    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, during the course of his recent visit to the United Nations Organisation, he had any talks with a view to strengthening Ireland's participation in moves to favour nuclear disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the official engagements which he fulfilled during the course of his recent visit to the United States, apart from his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach <Col N="2" /> whether, during the course of his recent visit to the United States, he had any contacts with the US administration or with legislators with a view to encouraging the passage of legislation in favour of non-documented Irish immigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he availed of the opportunity presented by his visit to the United States to impress on the members of Congress our concern to see the new immigration laws enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, during his visit to the United States, he <Col N="3" /> underlined to the various groups with whom he met the abhorrence of virtually all the people of Ireland for violence and our wish that nobody in the United States would give financial or any other form of support to organisations who use violence for political ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my visit to New York was to address the United Nations Third Special Session on Disarmament.  The text of my address is available in the Library.  In that address, I set out fully Ireland's position on disarmament and in particular on nuclear disarmament.</P>
      <P>Apart from addressing the United Nations General Assembly, I had discussions during the visit, which lasted a little over a day, with the Secretary General of the United Nations on a range of world issues.  The Secretary General expressed his gratitude for Ireland's continued support for UN peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon, Afghanistan and elsewhere. I also had bilateral meetings in New York with the Chairman of the Special Session, the Prime Minister of Finland and the Foreign Minister of China, the Foreign Minister of New Zealand and the Foreign Minister of Iran, during which we discussed matters of common interest to our countries.  In the case of the Iranian Minister, I emphasised the Government's concern about Mr. Brian Keenan and he undertook to look into the matter and see if there was anything his Government could do.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with the US executives of the principal semi-State bodies and discussed with them their plans and their concerns.</P>
      <P>I raised the situation of Irish emigrants in the United States during my visit in April and the Government's concern is well known there.  The whole issue continues to be pursued energetically by the Government at political and diplomatic level with the Congress and Administration in Washington and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Government are clear and <Col N="4" /> unequivocal in condemning political violence and terrorism which I regard as the common enemy of all civilised Governments. This condemnation is articulated whenever the occasion requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am a little surprised at the Taoiseach taking Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together on the pretext that they related to the one visit. I think that you will allow me a little latitude, Sir, to congratulate the Taoiseach on what seems to have been a much more constructive visit than his previous one to New York.</P>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 1, does the Taoiseach believe that, following on the various statements which he made during the course of his address to the United Nations Organisation, there is any place for a new initiative by the non-nuclear states to push forward the process of nuclear disarmament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I canvassed that idea, but I would think that the general view is that the whole question of disarmament now falls into two separate categories, on the one hand, these very welcome negotiations and discussions between the super-powers which are achieving results and then, in parallel with that, are the efforts of the United Nations.  I think that the general view at the present time would be that the matters should be left to those two separate sets of procedures.</P>
      <P>I might add, for the information of the Deputy, that since the questions were put down I have had an opportunity to have a briefing from the Special Russian Envoy who participated in all the discussions and negotiations leading up to Moscow and in Moscow and, without attempting to be too optimistic about it, I would say that he is looking forward to a considerable improvement in developments in the whole disarmament situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that a great deal of the thrust of his remarks at the United Nations was to point out the deficiencies and disappointments in relation to UN action on nuclear disarmament over a substantial <Col N="5" /> period?  Indeed, he mentioned himself a series of initiatives over the past 30 years which have produced very disappointing results.  Would the Taoiseach also not agree that he himself referred to the fact that it was not sufficient to leave the question of nuclear disarmament to the two super-powers and that, therefore, there must be a place in the complex of relationships within the United Nations for other countries outside of that direct negotiation to play a new role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think, though, that the non-nuclear states can be most effective through the machinery of the United Nations.  I would also have to say that in the margins of the Conference the view was that this particular special Conference would have to lay aim for rather limited objectives because of the general situation prevailing in the nuclear states and throughout the United Nations generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that I am not ruling myself out for supplementary questions on the other matters that I have raised. On this issue, would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be useful for the non-nuclear states now to consider what kinds of diplomatic pressure they could bring to bear on the nuclear states outside of the context of the United Nations, in order to heighten the effect of what might happen within the United Nations structure itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that could always be considered but, if the Deputy reflects on it, he might agree that because these very important and detailed negotiations are going on between the two powers and because a general debate is taking place at the special conference, it might be better to let things develop a little in both those areas before proceeding with any other initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's initial response to Questions Nos. 1 to 5, he mentioned that he had a meeting with the heads of the Irish semi-State bodies <Col N="6" /> in New York.  According to my information, an instruction issued from the Taoiseach's office ordering the heads of those bodies to be at the airport for his arrival in the United States.  Did that meeting take place and, if so, what was its purpose given that he would be meeting them the following day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of anything of the kind referred to by the Deputy.  My only objective was to have a meeting with the executives to discuss their general activities, objectives and problems.  I wanted to give any help I could and I am not aware of any other directive which may have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they at the airport on the Taoiseach's arrival?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as far as I can remember.  Some of them may have been there as a matter of courtesy but I did not attribute any particular importance to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 3, has the Taoiseach formed any opinion as to the likelihood of the new emigration initiatives being taken in the United States producing results during the course of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Immigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is &mdash; to use a cliché &mdash; ongoing.  As the Deputy knows, the Kennedy legislation has gone through the Senate and the action has now moved to the House of Representatives. It is difficult to make an assessment but there is a certain amount of optimism among our diplomatic service and our friends.  It may be possible to get the legislation through before the presidential election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of members of the public service, in the broadest acceptance of that phrase, <Col N="7" /> who accompanied him on his recent visit to New York or travelled to New York in connection with it; the estimated cost of their attendance there, including both travel and subsistence expenses; and the notional value of their time expressed as the appropriate proportion of their annual salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Six officials accompanied me as the official party on my recent visit to New York.  The estimated cost of their attendance there is £19,342.  I would not be prepared to give any estimate of the notional value of their time as I believe this to be far too vague a concept to be meaningful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the progress which is being made on the legislation suggested by the Supreme Court in the Derrynaflan judgment to extent the application of treasure trove to archaeological objects that do not fall under the definition of treasure trove; and when it is intended to bring the Bill before Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Draft Heads of a Bill have now been drawn up by my Department and circulated to other Departments for observations.  The comments received are being considered and it is hoped to submit the matter to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, the Supreme Court suggested that there might be a system of rewards in the legislation and also a method of assessing such rewards.  Has this been incorporated in the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of rewards for the finders will be incorporated in the legislation.  I would be quite happy to receive any suggestions or submissions from the Deputy which he <Col N="8" /> might wish to put forward in the light of his experience in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has satisfied himself with the present publicity campaign in relation to the dangers of teenage drinking with particular relevance to the seriousness of alcohol as a drug; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the extent of the problem of the abuse of alcohol in the community. Currently the Health Promotion Advisory Council are considering the abuse of alcohol as a major element of their workload and I expect to receive from them clear recommendations regarding an intersectoral approach to alcohol control in Ireland soon.</P>
      <P>Recently also, my Department, through the Health Promotion Unit, launched a new nationwide training course entitled &ldquo;Drug Questions &mdash; Local Answers?&rdquo;.  This course is intended to give those working in the health, education and social fields information and training to help them tackle the alcohol and drug related problems in their communities. This programme allows for a specific emphasis on the problem of teenage drinking.  The Health Promotion Unit are currently training convenors to run these courses at local level and by the end of the year up to 200 convenors will be operating in all health board regions.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department continue to make available resource materials to schools and the general public on alcohol and related problems.</P>
      <P>Also available from my Department are three booklets on alcohol.  These are intended for use by young people, parents and youth leaders.</P>
      <P>Many health boards are operating ongoing programmes for schools in the area of health education and all these programmes have an emphasis on alcohol as a drug of potential abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps is the Minister <Col N="9" /> taking, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, to eliminate the problem of under-age drinking?  It is obvious to everybody driving through our cities that there are drunken young people and children on the streets.  I am satisfied that there is a lack of implementation of the law by the Garda.  Is the Minister having any discussions with the Minister for Justice in regard to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As the Deputy is aware, in the legislation dealing with intoxicating liquor at present before the House, there are a number of elements dealing with the problem.  More powers are given to the Garda and it makes those selling alcohol more responsible in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement regarding the undistributed prize fund of the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited; and if he will make this fund, or part of it, available for distribution among the redundant employees of the Hospitals Trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that legislation will be necessary to release the sweepstakes trustees of their obligations in respect of these unclaimed prizes and to enable the funds be disposed of.  I am advised that this money could not be made available legitimately, even in part, for distribution among former employees of the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited. Responsibility for the making of any payments to these former employees rests solely with their former employer.</P>
      <P>While all my sympathies are with these redundant workers, I am afraid that it is not open to me as Minister for Health to take any useful action on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, to a certain extent, the Minister is constrained. However, will he agree that if the sale of the property had been completed the former employer would have been in a <Col N="10" /> position to receive additional moneys and to increase the compensation to those workers who lost their jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly points out, the sole responsibility for the former employees lies with the former employer.  In the event of the sale of the Hospitals Trust property I do not know what action the employer might take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the property which is still unsold, is the Minister aware that Dublin Corporation have proposed to zone it for exclusive residential use which will cut its value by approximately 50 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before me relates to the distribution of undistributed prize moneys of the Hospitals Trust and I do not have the answer to the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make public any and all reports available to his Department into the physical conditions in our psychiatric hospitals; and in particular if he will provide increased funding for essential improvements in emergency cases, including the case of Our Lady's Hospital in Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the public concern at the seriously substandard conditions at Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital, Cork disclosed in the report of the Inspector of Psychiatric Hospitals; the measures, if any, he intends to take as a result of this report and to ensure that conditions are brought <Col N="11" /> up to an acceptable level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <P>54.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will outline his proposals following the report of the Inspector of Psychiatric Hospitals on Our Lady's Hospital in Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 25, 28, 30 and priority Question No. 54 together.  A major part of the statutory duties of the inspector of mental hospitals is the formal annual inspection of each district mental hospital following which he is required to submit a report to me.  The present inspector, who was appointed last autumn, has submitted a number of reports.  I will arrange for a report in respect of 1988, his first full year in office, to be published as soon as possible after the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the inspector formally inspected Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork and submitted a report on his findings to me.  I had detailed discussions on that report with senior officers of my Department, including the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of psychiatric services, including Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital, Cork, is a statutory function of the Southern Health Board.  A copy of the inspector's report was sent to the board.  Subsequently copies were circulated to the members of the psychiatric services committee of the board.  Copies <Col N="12" /> of the relevent extracts were sent to the clinical directors.</P>
    <P>I received a response from the chief executive officer of the board.  Subsequently, on 2 June, I met the chairman and the chief executive officer of the board.  In the course of this discussion the CEO outlined the actions he proposed to take to deal with the problems raised in the inspector's report.  These included the closure of the main block of Our Lady's Hospital, known as the Grey Building, and the transfer of patients at present accommodated there to better and more suitable accommodation.  In addition, he proposed to improve standards of hygiene and to promote patient activation throughout the hospital.  I was satisfied that the action proposed by the chief executive officer would result in greatly improved patient care at Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital and help towards the development of a better psychiatric service in the Cork area generally.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer put his proposals to the board at their meeting on 7 June.  I am glad to record that they were supported by the board.  I look forward now to the speedy implementation of these proposals.  My Department will maintain regular contact with the chief executive officer during the implementation process.  I have already assured him of my support in the task he has now undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the appalling conditions obtaining at Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork in relation to which steps are now being taken by the Southern Health Board to improve matters.  Will any additional funds be provided by the Department of Health &mdash; it is unfortunate that the Southern Health Board are selling property in order to provide funds &mdash; to lead to the implementation of the <i>Planning for the Future</i> policy in relation to the psychiatric services which is very necessary?  Would the Minister agree that the recently published detailed discussions and contacts with the Southern Health board would appear to have been <Col N="13" /> inadequate?  I would contend that additional funds are necessary at this stage.  Will the Minister say whether such additional funds will be provided in the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that additional funds are necessary at this stage.  The budget for the psychiatric hospital in Cork is £10 million.  Within that budget of £10 million it is possible to effect a number of improvements recommended by the inspector of mental hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, while it is fine for him to say he will support the proposals recommended by the chief executive officer, in not allocating one penny to the alleviation of conditions there that are Dickensian and described as a hell hole in Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork, such support amounts to lip service only?  As a result of the agreement reached between the chief executive officer, the Southern Health Board and the Minister, will the Minister say whether the implementation of the policy contained in <i>Planning for the Future</i> in relation to the psychiatric services in the Southern Health Board region is being shelved since the new plan agreed appears to be the blueprint for the future?  Furthermore, would the Minister say what, if anything, he has been doing by way of committing moneys for this purpose.  For example, there was a commitment given of £5 million over a nine-year period in the document entitled <i>Planning for the Future</i>.  Has that gone by the board now?  Has the Minister washed his hands of that plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; in fact I fully support the plan.  I might say that the chairman and chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board intimated to me that they had a plan in course of preparation to improve the conditions of the psychiatric services in Cork.  Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital is one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the country catering for up to 900 patients.  In the short term it is necessary to place these patients <Col N="14" /> in suitable accommodation.  In the longer term, and in keeping with <i>Planning for the Future,</i> the idea is to reactivate as many patients as possible and have them placed in the community.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to learn that the Minister has taken this situation in hand because there is a long-standing history of neglect at this hospital.  I might ask the Minister two brief supplementaries in relation to standards of hygiene and patient activation.  What mechanism has been put in place to ensure that progress will be made, and monitored regularly, in relation to the urgent need to improve the standard of hygiene and of patient activation?  Would the Minister accept that, in relation to making transfers and changes, perhaps the objectives he has in mind would best be served if such transfers and changes were effected not alone in terms of patients but also in tems of management at that hospital?</P>

      <P>The immediate step proposed is the working out of a detailed plan with clearly-defined objectives with a specified time schedule for its implementation.  To facilitate these arrangements and in order to proceed with the immediate implementation, a designated officer of the board will be assigned full time responsibility for this project.  In the meantime, a number of the issues referred to by Deputy Quill &mdash; such as hygiene, nursing arrangements and patient activation &mdash; will be pursued immediately by the responsible programme manager.  There will be a detailed inspection carried out of every ward by the programme manager, the clinical director and the relevant chief nursing officer and a detailed report prepared on each ward.</P>

Furthermore, how does he expect the Southern Health Board to provide residential units, especially in view of the fact that the psychiatric services in the Southern Health Board region at present are already operating above their budget allocation for this year?  Also in relation to the lack of hygiene and the dirt prevailing in certain parts of Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital, will the Minister take any disciplinary action against the management who are responsible and accountable for the maintenance of standards in our hospitals because obviously they have not been doing their job in this case?</P>

      <P>The food products to which the reports refer were imported and home-produced stocks voluntarily surrendered by various firms to the Eastern Health Board for safe disposal as they had become unfit for human consumption. These foods were not on sale at the time.</P>
      <P>There is a well established arrangement under which firms who want to dispose of food products which, for one reason or another, have become unfit may contact the Eastern Health Board and the board in conjunction with Dublin County Council arranges for their deep burial under supervision at a council dumping site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the country of origin of the report referred to but the report itself was misleading in so far as it suggested that these foods were found to be unfit for human consumption by the Eastern Health Board, whereas they were brought to the attention of the Eastern Health Board as is the normal practice.  The foods involved were 10.5 tonnes of tinned fruit and fruit juices, 27.29 tonnes of chocolates, 16.77 tonnes of margarine, 2.6 tonnes of gluten-free bread and 7 tonnes of fish and fish products. Food will deteriorate if left on the shelf and it is the normal procedure in the Dublin area to arrange for the disposal of such foods by deep burial in a council dump under the supervision of the environmental health officer, to prevent them from getting into the hands of people who might try to sell them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that these food products were voluntarily surrendered, is there any possibility that there could be similar food products in the food chain which are close to their expiry date?  Perhaps there is a need for further inspection by the health board and will the Minister indicate if there have been instances of that nature before?</P>

      <P>The environmental health officers are always vigilant.  Foods will deteriorate on the shelf.  However, with the advent of the date stamp and expiry date after which people should not use foods, there is a protection for the customer so as to ensure that as far as possible food sold will be fit for human consumption.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that it was announced at the annual conference of the Environmental Health officers in Kilkenny that a five year survey produced evidence of more than 60 per cent of ice cream samples taken were contaminated by bacteria of an excremental origin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report on the survey of soft ice cream which was carried out in one county by health officers over a period of five years from 1983 to 1987 and revealed that 64 per cent of samples taken were contaminated by bacteria of excremental origin.  I take a serious view of this finding.</P>
      <P>Where contamination of this nature arise it is a result of poor standards of personal hygiene.  The need for regular hand-washing by all those involved in the preparation and sale of the product cannot be over-emphasised.  Since the survey was completed there has been increased co-operation between Environmental Health Officers and soft ice cream retailers in the county referred to with a view to improving hygiene standards through regular hand-washing and daily cleaning of ice cream machines.</P>
      <P>This improvement has been given added impetus by the national Clean-watch campaign which I launched recently.  The main aim of this campaign is to increase the level of awareness of the importance of good food hygiene among the workers in the food industry and the general public.  As a major part of the effort local training courses are being offered to food workers in the various health board areas in association with environment health officers.</P>

The fee per item system has operated successfully to the advantage of the patient. It must be recognised that there must be an incentive built into the system.  If the Minister reverts to a capitation system surely he is removing that incentive which will operate to the detriment of the patient.  Would the Minister clarify his views on this matter?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that the cost of private accommodation in public hospitals has been rapidly escalating.  The average increase for this accommodation was 6 per cent in 1987 and 3 per cent this year.  These increases were allowed for in premium increases sanctioned for the VHI and are not causing a serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to a report by the EC Commission on the Economies of 1992 which quotes the prices of certain drugs as being disproportionately expensive in Ireland, for example, the drug zyloric costing 47 ECU in Ireland as against 5 ECU in Spain, and the drug dogmetil costing 35 ECU in Ireland as against 4 ECU in Portugal; the action he proposes to take in respect of these particular discrepancies; and the way in which, in general terms, he proposes to curb the cost of drugs used in the General Medical Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The report consists of a study by the Directorate General of the Commission for Economic and Financial Affairs.  The study, assesses the potential economic effects of the completion of the internal market.  In discussion of the pharmaceuticals industry, reference is made to the 1987 BEUC Report on comparative retail drug prices of drugs within the Community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1983, arising from specific recommendations of the Trident Report, the then Minister entered into a voluntary pricing agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, controlling the trade prices of drugs and medicines on the Irish market by reference to directly comparable trade prices obtaining in the United Kingdom.  Some 85 per cent of finished human pharmaceuticals on the Irish market are imported from the UK. That agreement was renewed by the same Minister in August 1986.  At my request, officials of my Department undertook an intense renegotiation of the 1986 agreement in the early summer of 1987.  The renegotiated terms were formulated in a new agreement which took effect from 1 August 1987.</P>
      <P>I share the view of my predecessors in office, that the general level of manufacturers' prices and wholesalers' trade prices obtaining in the UK, and therefore in Northern Ireland also, offers a reasonable and sound basis for the establishment of unit costs here.</P>
      <P>Direct price comparisons with selected continental countries, where drug prices are lower than they are in the UK, may not necessarily be meaningful when the generality of social, economic and market circumstances are taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>I should point out that I have no function as regards the retail prices of drugs and medicines paid by private patients in high street retail pharmacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of unit costs of drugs to the Exchequer has always been kept under constant review and that review will continue with particular regard to the situation arising from the movement towards completion of the internal <Col N="27" /> market.  The more general issue of control of drug costs in the GMS scheme was addressed in a previous reply to a parliamentary question on 10 May 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What conceivable social, economic and market factors could justify the divergence in the prices of the drugs mentioned in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tremendous variation in the price of drugs.  The Deputy gave a price of 47 ECU in Ireland as against 5 ECU in Spain but there are also variations within the other European communities.  For example, the unit prices range from 2 ECU in Italy to 18 ECU in The Netherlands for dogmetil and 4 ECU in Portugal to 35 ECU in Ireland for stugerom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the question.  How, why and on what basis can these divergences be justified given that Ireland in both cases was singled out in this report in respect of the drugs mentioned?  They are not my figures.  They come from an EC report. Ireland is the country with the most expensive price for these drugs.  Why? Why does the Minister continue to link our price to UK prices?  Would it not make more sense to say that Irish prices shall be linked to Portuguese prices if the Portuguese authorities are able to get a better deal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I and my Department are concerned about the high cost of drugs.  Primarily the variation between the countries is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In our Department we have negotiated with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries to ensure we get the very best price available and we have taken the British prices <Col N="28" /> as the unit cost prices on which to base our negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  What is the justification for the difference of these drugs dogmetil and zyloric as between Ireland and the countries mentioned?  It is a simple question of which the Minister has had four days' notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact reason why one drug should be a different price here as distinct from other European countries.  Reading the reports it is obvious there are variations between each of the EC countries in regard to the price of drugs and a vast variation between other European countries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the precise proposals made to (a) St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin 4; (b) St. Michael's Hospital, County Dublin; (c) St. Columcille's Hospital, County Dublin and (d) the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin 2 concerning the number of acute beds in 1989 in each hospital; the specialities allocated to each hospital; the complement of beds in each of these hospitals in (i) 1982, (ii) 1984, (iii) 1986, (iv) 1987 and (v) 1988; and the budget and number of staff of each of these hospitals at these dates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the review of hospital services announced last year, discussions are ongoing between officials of my Department and the hospitals concerned on the provision of hospital services in the south-east Dublin-east Wicklow areas.  These discussions have concentrated on planning for the provision of an integrated hospital service for the catchment area.  The details of <Col N="29" /> such a plan have not yet been finalised but the broad thrust of the proposal would see the fullest co-ordination of the respective roles of St. Vincent's Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire and St. Columcille's Hospital.  All three hospital authorities are supportive of this proposal.  The precise future role of each of the three hospitals and the service links between them have yet to be agreed.  I would hope to have the full agreement of all the hospitals concerned within a relatively short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> The transfer of services from the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital is part of my Department's policy of locating specialised services such as ophthalmology on a general hospital campus and discussions are ongoing with the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital on a transfer of its services to appropriate general hospitals in Dublin and to the Midland Health Board.</P>
    <P>The further information requested by the Deputy is set down in the tabular statement which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health his views on whether the legislation governing the operation of private nursing homes is adequate to ensure that substandard homes are detected in time; the provision which exists for the speedy rehousing of patients where homes are found to be grossly substandard; if he will consider the monitoring of prices charged by private homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The operation of nursing homes is governed by the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, and the 1985 regulations made thereunder.  I should point out that it is a matter for each individual health authority to ensure that the standards laid down in the Act and regulations are enforced and met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current legislation does not provide for the registration of nursing homes but merely for the notification of the establishment of nursing homes to the relevant health authority.  I consider that there is a need for registration for such homes and the introduction of the necessary legislation will be pursued in conjunction with the report of the Working Party <Col N="31" /> on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly which is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which I understand the working party are addressing is the relationship of private nursing homes and health boards in their complementary task of caring for the elderly.  I can assure the House that the Government will quickly examine the recommendations in this report and will implement those which they accept in so far as resources allow as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I have no function in relation to charges in private institutions.  The right of elderly people to make private arrangements for nursing care in their latter years is a matter for each individual.</P>
    <P>As legal proceedings are pending in relation to the particular nursing home mentioned I do not wish to comment at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's statement that he considers there is a need for the registration of these homes, will he not take the opportunity in the few weeks left in this session to introduce an amendment to the current legislation requiring registration? Will he not agree that part of the problem at the moment is a proliferation of these homes which apparently are under no control, can charge what they like and can provide effectively what services they choose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that there should be registration of nursing homes and my intention is to prepare legislation to provide for such registration. My predecessor in office recognised the need to update the regulations and it is now mandatory on nursing homes to notify the health board of their existence and to comply with the terms of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the future registration of nursing homes and the regulations governing their operation, does the Minister intend to consider changing the system whereby some of the homes are paid a subsidy by health boards <Col N="32" /> and others since a certain year are not allowed to qualify for the subsidy?  This, as the Minister would agree, results in hardship for patients who cannot get into those that are subsidised and have to go into those that are not subsidised, therefore putting themselves and their families under large financial strain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 56 together.  Discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance have only recently commenced in relation to the <Col N="35" /> 1989 Estimate.  It will be some time before these discussions and similar discussions with other Departments are concluded. At that point the Government will consider the allocation of resources for 1989.</P>
      <P>Meetings to discuss the review of the common contract for consultant medical staff have been held this year on 15 January, 19 February, 25 March and 3 June 1988.  As I have explained on previous occasions, because of the importance being attached to the talks it has been agreed that details of the proceedings would remain confidential.</P>
      <P>Deputies will, however, be aware of the joint statement issued following my meeting with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation on Friday, 3 June last.  The statement read as follows:</P>
      <P>At a meeting today between Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, T.D., Minister for Health and representatives of management and the Irish Medical Organisation, the progress of discussions on the common contract was considered. It was agreed that it is essential for the efficient operation of hospital services that agreement should be reached between individual consultants and hospital management as to the way in which consultants discharge their contractual commitment including activities such as out-patient clinics and theatre lists.  It was decided that individual hospital managements and individual consultants would immediately proceed to agree this scheduling, including the scheduling of specific activities involving other hospital resources where this is not already in place.  It was agreed that the review of the terms of the common contract would continue at future meetings, the first of which will be held shortly.</P>
      <P>This agreement represents a considerable advance and is an indication of the serious commitment with which both management and the Irish Medical Organisation approached these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda for the negotiations on the <Col N="36" /> review of the common contract is a wide ranging one and includes provision for discussing the appropriate mix of patients as between those being treated publicly and those receiving private treatment. The report on private practice in the Southern Health Board will be considered in that context.  Given the confidential nature of the discussions I do not propose to comment further at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The report by the Southern Health Board on private practice in hospitals in that region is a public document. I should like to know if, since its publication, the Minister has taken any steps to control the level of private practice which has risen to 63 per cent by one consultant in St. Finbar's Hospital, Cork, to 52 per cent in the Orthopaedic Hospital while in the case of other consultants it has risen to 20 per cent and 30 per cent?  At a time of scarce resources and cutbacks, surely the Minister has a responsibility to control such abuse in that region?  In relation to the activities of some consultants, I should like to ask the Minister if there will be any element of indepth monitoring of the level of private practice in the new contract.</P>

I referred to the report of the Southern Health Board and I was given an assurance by the Minister that the matter would be investigated.  What investigation has taken place of this unprecedented high level of private practice in hospitals that are facing cutbacks in regard to equipment and staff?

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a statement to the House about the extradition proceedings concerning Patrick McVeigh which took <Col N="122" /> place in Portlaoise District Court yesterday. The finding of the court was that it had not been established to its satisfaction that the person before the court was the person named in the warrants.</P>
      <P>I want to make it perfectly clear, lest there be any confusion about this, that this issue concerning identification did not arise from any provision of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  These particular proceedings were in fact taken under the provisions of the Extradition Act, 1965, and the identity of the person before the court is an issue which could have been raised at any time since the enactment of the 1965 Act.</P>
      <P>The British warrants before the court identified the person whose extradition was sought as being Patrick McVeigh of Portlaoise Prison, County Laois, formerly of 18 Forest Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The British authorities had informed the Irish authorities that no police officer was in a position to make a personal identification of Patrick McVeigh as the person concerned in the alleged offence.</P>
      <P>Evidence tendered before the court included evidence that the person before the court was the only Patrick McVeigh in Portlaoise Prison at the relevant time and that that person had previously given his name and address as Patrick McVeigh of 18 Forest Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland.  These facts were not challenged.</P>
      <P>The evidence tendered to the court to identify Patrick McVeigh as the person named in the warrant was in accordance with established norms.  It was for this reason that the British prosecuting authorities were informed that further evidence of identification was not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since yesterday's decision the Attorney General has been in touch with the British Attorney General.  The British Attorney General expressed his deepest concern at the result of the application.  He agreed that the decision not to call evidence of British police officers was in the circumstances of this case entirely as he would have expected, in the light of experience in previous extradition cases.  Both the Attorney <Col N="123" /> General and the British Attorney General have agreed to consult on the implications of the decision.</P>
    <P>The District Court decision of yesterday, if upheld, would set a precedent as to the kind of evidence which would be required in future in such cases.</P>
    <P>Extradition is a part of the normal machinery of legal co-operation between civilised States.  As we have stated on numerous occasions, the Government are committed to having proper and effective extradition arrangements with other countries.  We are determined to make every effort to ensure that the legislation and procedures in place are clearly workable.</P>
    <P>The Government are very deeply concerned that the issue which has arisen as a result of yesterday's court proceedings should be resolved.  I wish to inform the House that the most effective action open to the State is being taken immediately. An appeal by way of case stated will be taken to the High Court against the decision of the district justice.</P>
    <P>I am sure that it is not necessary for me to remind the Dáil that our courts under the Constitution are totally independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and, subject only to the right of appeal, their decisions must be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday's events in Portlaoise District Court are another unfortunate chapter in the ongoing saga involving extradition arrangements between the UK and Ireland.  The only winners from this unfortunate episode are the IRA and those in Britain who use every opportunity open to them to imply to the British public that the Dáil and our Judiciary adopt a milk-and-water approach to extraditing persons from this jurisdiction to any part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vitally important for all of us who respect democracy and condemn violence as a means of achieving political aims to continually point out that the vast majority of Irish people have no time for terrorism or for those who carry out terrorist acts.  If we believe in what we <Col N="124" /> say, we must, therefore, have extradition arrangements with those countries who share our democratic beliefs and particularly with our nearest neighbour, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Of course we are entitled to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place in any such arrangements.  That has been the case all along.  Adequate safeguards should not, however, lead to a situation where persons who should be extradited walk from our courts on a technicality. When the Extradition (Amendment) Bill was introduced in December 1987 we in Fine Gael warned against the possibility of long delays in extraditing people and unnecessary difficulties arising as a result of putting into legislative form what was previously there by way of administrative arrangement and which was capable of working efficiently if given a chance by this Government.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that our amendment which allows for review of this Act after a 12-month period was accepted.  Ever since the passing of that Act we have had long delays and endless hours of discussion between our Attorney General and his counterpart in Britain in trying to reach agreement on the working of this Act.  The net result has been no extradition for six months.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair of me to imply that yesterday's events are a result of the 1987 Act.  Having received full details of yesterday's case, it is quite clear that the extraordinary decision of the district justice could have arisen whether the 1987 Act was in force or not.  Yesterday's decision, however, requires answers from the Government on a few points: (1) Is it agreed that a member of the British police force should have been in court to identify Mr. Patrick McVeigh? (2) Is it agreed that in previous cases such a procedure was adopted?  (3) How is it alleged that the procedure in this case differed from others in not requiring identification evidence?  (4) What advices or requirements were given to the British authorities regarding the proofs to be adopted in this case?  (5) By whom were these advices given?  (6) Were these matters either discussed or transmitted to <Col N="125" /> the British authorities by our Attorney General's office?  (7) Is it proposed to appeal this decision?  If so, how?</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's statement that it is proposed to appeal.  What is most important now is to put in place agreed procedures so as to prevent, as far as possible, a recurrence of yesterday's events.  I would like to make a couple of suggestions in that regard.  One is that the two Attorneys General meet as quickly as possible to iron out any remaining differences which might prevent extradition resuming on a smooth basis.  In saying that, I must ask why the last six months of inactivity were not used more productively to produce a watertight checklist for extradition applications. It is quite clear that extradition cases can have serious consequences for our relations with other countries and there is a question therefore as to whether these cases should continue to be heard by the District Court, bearing in mind that this is the lowest court on the judicial ladder.  I would ask the Government therefore to consider amending the law so that future extradition cases can be heard in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that the statement of the Minister for Justice has been as brief as it is.  He has confined himself very much to simply the case itself without dealing with the broader issues. I thought for that reason, since he is not the prosecuting authority and has no responsibility for the prosecution and is not responsible for the broader Anglo-Irish context and the Anglo-Irish Agreement context of this, that perhaps another member of the Government might have dealt with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested to see what the Minister says about the two British warrants which were before the court and which identify the person whose extradition was being sought as being Patrick McVeigh of Portlaoise Prison, County Laois, formerly of 18 Forest Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland.  There was evidence given in that court yesterday by the governor of the <Col N="126" /> prison that the defendant in the proceedings was Patrick McVeigh of Portlaoise Prison, County Laois.  There was evidence given that he was the only Patrick McVeigh that had been detained in that prison and the only person who could have been described by that name. There was evidence given by three gardaí that he was of Portlaoise Prison and was formerly of 18 Forest Street, Belfast, Northern Ireland.  There is no conceivable way therefore in which the identity of that defendant could have been mistaken or could have been open to any doubt.  For that reason the decision that was come to was, in my view, inexplicable. Some people might go so far as to say that it was perverse.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, its consequences in a broader context are enormous.  They are not just consequences for the individual concerned but will inevitably have serious repercussions in the broader Anglo-Irish relationship.  It does nothing to assist the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Anglo-Irish process or a fruitful review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which might be expected to start now.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Barrett now that it is time to question whether or not the District Court should be involved at all in these proceedings because under the 1965 Act, as amended, every defendant against whom an extradition order is made by the District Court has an absolute statutory right to go to the High Court and, if he wants to, on appeal to the Supreme Court afterwards.  I have no doubt whatsoever that if the decision yesterday at Portlaoise had been otherwise Mr. McVeigh would have exercised that right, and at great length, as I forecast here in the debate last December on the Bill that was then going through the Dáil when I said that the first person against whom an order was made under the legislation would avail of every opportunity to challenge it at great length.  We should remind ourselves therefore that even if the decision had been otherwise yesterday the likelihood is that Mr. McVeigh would not have been extradited for as long as six or nine months or perhaps even longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> It is very unsatisfactory that in the relations between Britain and Ireland we should have this difficulty.  It behoves the Government primarily, and all of us to some extent, to look at the possibilities of trying to avoid these problems and at the same time not create injustice.  It is not easy to do that, particularly given the perception of some aspects of British justice as exhibited in the past year or two.  What the Minister for Justice said should be carefully noted, that the British authorities informed the Irish authorities that no police officer was in a position to make a personal identification of Patrick McVeigh as the person concerned in the alleged offence.  I would have thought that that was self-evident and therefore I do not think that if a British police officer had been called he would have been able to add anything to it.  The evidence which was given was more than adequate and would have satisfied any court in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are some matters that arise. They are not matters which are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice but they arise in relation to the conduct of the case in the actual court, not in relation to the advice which was given beforehand which in my view was correct. First of all, if there was an indication of the case going wrong in this way, why was an application not made for an adjournment.  This is not a case where somebody is going to be convicted or not convicted and has therefore a right to have the matter disposed of one way or the other, or might argue that he has. This is a procedure whereby a preliminary order only is going to be made for his extradition and where he has the right to go to two further courts to challenge it.  Therefore no injustice would have been suffered by the particular defendant if the application had been made for an adjournment and it would have avoided a lot of the difficulties at a political level that have now arisen.</P>
    <P>Second, when the justice indicated that he was deciding the case against the State's application, why did counsel for the State not then ask him to state a case <Col N="128" /> to the High Court for a direction on the matter of law and retain the defendant in custody while that was being done?  That would again have avoided the hiatus that we have now and the impression that unfortunately goes abroad that the Irish Government and the Irish authorities are not serious in their anxiety to extradite people who are wanted in other jurisdictions for terrorist offences.  Great damage has been done to our reputation and the Government have suffered criticism and suspicion that is unfair because I do not believe that the Government are soft on these matters.  I believe they are as anxious as any of us to see these things done and done properly.  It is a great pity that these possibilities were not availed of in the court in Portlaoise yesterday and all the very serious consequences we have been hearing about overnight in terms of our international relations could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>I see that a case is now being stated. Unfortunately the defendant is not in custody and the prospects of getting him back into custody in the foreseeable future are not very good.  Unfortunately once again the unfortunate Garda have been held up to a certain amount of ridicule in this matter through no fault of their own.  I understand that two gardaí actually re-arrested this man at one stage yesterday after his release but subsequently were ordered to let him go.  It must be very difficult for them to know what to do.  If they do not try to arrest him they are open to criticism; if they do they are equally open to criticism.  I feel that in future in cases of this kind specific instructions should be given to the Garda as to what precisely they are to do, assuming a case ends in a particular way. In the normal way the stating of a case to the High Court can take up to nine months to resolve.  Much of the delay is often caused by the delay in the justice actually stating the case.  Special arrangements should be made in this case to ensure that the justice states the case fully within a matter of 48 or 72 hours from now and that arrangements are made in the High Court to have it heard and decided within the next few weeks at the <Col N="129" /> outside.  There is too much at stake to leave this matter outstanding for any length of time whatever.</P>
    <P>It is curious that in the longer term another case which is being heard in the High Court today may have greater influence on these matters than the case that we are discussing here at the moment.  That is the McGimpsey case.  It may well have very long-term repercussions. The case we are at present discussing has extremely severe short-term repercussions, but the other case may in the long run be more important.</P>
    <P>I rejoice that the famous <i>sub judice</i> rule seems to have been sufficiently set aside today to enable us to discuss these matters.  That demonstrates the foolishness of the way in which that rule has been applied in many other cases in contrast to what has happened today.  I am not clear whether the Minister will reply to this debate.  If he does, he should seek to address the problems that have been created in terms of Anglo-Irish relations and to assure those who are very concerned about that aspect of the matter that the Government are determined and anxious to see these matters resolved once and for all.</P>

      <P>On 10 May last a case took place in the High Court that has profound implications for the discussion which we are having here today.  The case was that of The State-Anne Cawley against District Justice Clifford.  Anne Cawley had been arrested on an extradition warrant from the British authorities with the intention that she would face a charge of murder in London.  District Justice Clifford granted the extradition order and the order was quashed by Mr. Justice Gannon in the High Court.  He ruled that there had been a failure to identify Anne Cawley in the District Court as the person <Col N="130" /> named on the warrant and that that failure had deprived the district justice of jurisdiction to make the extradition order.  In summary, the High Court quashed the extradition order because there had been no adequate evidence identifying Miss Cawley.  This happened just over one month ago.</P>
      <P>I must begin by contrasting this story with the following sentence taken from <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date: &ldquo;Government sources said his `&mdash; the district justice &mdash;' insistence that the British police officer, who sought the extradition order should be present in court, represented a new ruling in extradition cases.&rdquo;  That is a grossly misleading statement. It appears that in the wake of this total fiasco Government sources are busy trying to find someone else to blame.  This is apparent also from the reports that the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions had consultations immediately after the result.  Unless some major change in the allocation of functions has taken place &mdash; some change that this House has never been told about &mdash; this has nothing whatever to do with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Why the Attorney General and the DPP should be consulting is a mystery, unless we are supposed to believe that the DPP in some way carries responsibility in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many instances in the recent past where we stood up in this House and condemned the British authorities for their obvious shortcomings. This, on the face of it, is not such a case.  In fact, unless some very cogent explanation is forthcoming as to the lapses in this case, I believe the Taoiseach has no choice but to ensure that whoever is responsible is called to account.  There is no need to go into the history of extradition and all the recent controversy, but it must be placed on record that with the passage of the Extradition (Amendment) Bill certain responsibilities devolved fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Irish Attorney General.  These basically boil down to the fact that no warrant for extradition would be endorsed for execution unless the Attorney General <Col N="131" /> was satisfied that &ldquo;There is a clear intention to prosecute or, as the case may be, to continue the prosecution of the person named or described in the warrant concerned for the offence specified therein&rdquo; and also that &ldquo;such intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.&rdquo; So, the Minister is not correct when he says that the more recent Act does not affect the present position.  It does have a bearing on it because of the obligation put on the Irish Attorney General to ensure that the intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>Since the passage of this law, there has been some controversy over the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;sufficient evidence&rdquo;.  Time and again the Taoiseach has told us that the Act is simple and straightforward. Notwithstanding that, there has been a series of meetings between, as we understand it, officials on both sides of the Irish Sea and between the two Attorneys General to iron out difficulties.  Those difficulties and that controversy we are told, have been satisfactorily resolved. However, there was never any controversy about a number of points.  First, decisions about the execution of extradition warrants are now a matter for the Attorney General unless he is absent or ill.  These are the only circumstances under which he can delegate this function. Secondly, it has always been understood that there must be a clear intention to prosecute the person named or described in the warrant.  For this reason, if this case has been badly handled, one person and one person only must bear responsibility and that person is the Attorney General and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that it has been badly handled.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the British prosecuting authorities were informed that further evidence of identification was not required.  Even under the 1965 position, it was always the case that the district justice had to be satisfied that the person who was arrested was, in fact, the person named or described in the warrant.  That was made quite clear by Mr. Justice Walsh in the case of The State <Col N="132" /> (Holmes) against Furlong, in <i>1967 Irish Reports</i>, when he nominated two things on which the district justice had to be satisfied.  The second one to be satisfied was that the person who had been arrested was, the person named or described in the warrant.  The Minister is putting the matter entirely wrongly when he says in his statement that the British authorities had informed the Irish authorities that no police officer was in a position to make a personal identification of Patrick McVeigh as the person concerned in the alleged offence.  It is not a matter of the person concerned in the alleged offence; it is a matter of confirming that this is the person who is named in the warrant.  That is a very different matter.</P>
    <P>We are told that the British prosecuting authorities were informed that further evidence of identification was not required.  A second year law student would not have answered the question as glibly as that and if that second year law student had been made aware of the judgment by Mr. Justice Gannon, to which I earlier referred, there is no doubt whatever that he would have recommended that that prosecuting officer should be in court to identify the defendant, not as the person who committed the offence but as the person named in the warrant.  District Justice Ruane, whether he was aware of the Gannon judgment or not, had no choice but to act as he did. If he had not recognised the flaw in the State's case, there is no doubt that the extradition order would have been quashed by the High Court on precisely the same grounds as in the Cawley case. Therefore, no one can seriously argue that the decision of District Justice Ruane was a bolt from the blue.  The State were &mdash; or should have been &mdash; fully aware of the precedent and if they were not someone was guilty of gross dereliction of duty.</P>
    <P>The only common factor in every single case of extradition to Britain is the office of the Attorney General.  Different judges may be involved, different lawyers may be briefed for the prosecution or the defence but the Attorney General is the <Col N="133" /> only common factor.  The failure of the State in this case is bad enough but it has been compounded by the apparent attempt to pass the buck.  It may be convenient to let it be known that the judge's ruling was inexplicable, that some other official might be responsible or that the question of blame is irrelevant, but that is a totally irresponsible approach.</P>
    <P>In this House we reserve the right to criticise the actions of the British authorities. Later today we will be debating what many believe to be a series of miscarriages of justice when we deal with the Labour Party motion on the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four but we will lose the right to be listened to if we do not put our own house in order.  When it comes to the question of extradition, our house is seriously out of order.  During the debate on the Extradition Bill, I made the point that, under the arrangements being put in place, it was possible to foresee a situation where nobody could be extradited to Britain in connection with terrorist offences.  Since the passage of the Bill nobody has been extradited.  The House will be aware that there is a great deal of dark suspicion &mdash; even among some in Britain who are friendly to the cause of Ireland &mdash; that we are not serious when it comes to extraditing terrorists to face trial.  Situations like that which occurred yesterday only give ammunition to our enemies and place our friends on the defensive.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago that the Minister for Justice accused the British Attorney General of being unfit to hold public office.  However, yesterday's fiasco was the result of incompetence and conspiracy, and it cannot be denied that our Attorney General has a case to answer in the circumstances of the McVeigh matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any debate on the unfortunate saga of the implementation and use of the extradition laws between this country and our nearest neighbour, it is important on occasions to take an opportunity like this to reaffirm some basic principles that should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extradition is a device and a means <Col N="134" /> used by civil society to attempt to confront trans-national terrorism.  Terrorism, in whatever form, is unacceptable in our society and every opportunity must be made to defeat the ends and means of the terrorist.  Terrorists are the enemy of democracy and wreak havoc on the lives of ordinary people, mostly working people, and the security forces.  Extradition is a standard and usual method of dealing with terrorism across national boundaries.  It is a long-standing process and must be allowed to operate effectively and speedily.  There can be no support for the very isolated position that is often canvassed in the context of this debate, that there should be no extradition on any grounds or terms from this country, whether that argument is made on the grounds of the nationality of the person being sought or the nature of the crime alleged to have been committed.</P>
    <P>No extradition from this country means that we become a partner to and a haven for some of the most determined and sinister killers that Europe &mdash; if not the world &mdash; have produced this century. Can anyone suggest, if the alleged perpetrators of the Enniskillen bombings are located on the Southern side of the Border, that for some jingoistic or warped reasons there should be no trial to deal with them?  Extradition &mdash; it must be emphasised &mdash; has always been a feature of our criminal process, as long as it has been known to the law internationally. We have always engaged in it as a process of dealing with criminals and persons suspected of crimes elsewhere. It is not something that has been newly introduced as a phenomenon to deal with increasing terrorism at home.</P>
    <P>The law is not new; it has been developed and must continue to be developed as circumstances require it. For this reason, no democrat or socialist could or should object to the provisions in the first of the two amendment Bills of 1987 which sought to introduce the provision of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism into our domestic law.  This development in the law was designed specifically to deal with the ever-increasing internationalism of <Col N="135" /> terrorism, a phenomenon and a feature that is, sadly, now attributable to the most active terrorist organisation in the country, the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>Extradition between the United Kingdom and Ireland plays a significant role in the efforts of both countries to deal with the cancer of terrorism.  For that reason, it plays a particularly sensitive role in Anglo-Irish affairs.  A special effort must always be made, therefore, by the Administrations of both countries to ensure that when an application for extradition by one country or the other is made it is dealt with in the most efficient, professional and highly regarded way possible.  It must be remembered that Mr. McVeigh's case was the first major test of recent additions to our extradition law as represented by the two amendments in 1987.  For that reason, it is particularly regrettable that the application was not successful.</P>
    <P>It must be underlined by anyone making a contribution that it is clearly seen that the reasons for it not being successful are not that the evidence was not there but that it was poorly presented in court during the hearing.  The failure of the application requires serious questions to be asked of the level of professionalism or commitment being devoted to applications of this kind on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Little will be achieved by accusations backwards and forwards between the two countries as to who is at fault. The history of extradition between our two countries has been marked by failures and mistakes on both sides.  What is particularly worrying in the Minister's address to the House today is that nothing he said to the British Attorney General &mdash; in any exchanges that have taken place at Government or ambassadorial level since the decision &mdash; indicate that there is an appreciation of what went on during the proceedings, or a recognition that what was available was presented as well as possible and that what was said between those parties would be reflected in a response from the Prime Minister of the UK or any other leading politician who might seem to <Col N="136" /> make remarks on the case and its implications for Anglo-Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>Very strong comments have been made, North and South and in Britain, about the outcome and implications of the case for Anglo-Irish affairs.  Our Government must take all necessary steps to ensure that those matters are put right without delay and that the record of the House is reflected, in some reciprocal way, in statements from the Prime Minister, if she so desires, on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a deficiency at two levels in applications of this kind, a seriousness of intent in the preparation of the applications and ensuring that no mistakes are made.  We all lose when these applications fail and the only person who wins is the terrorist and the organisation to which he or she belongs.  In the aftermath of these decisions it is quite clear that there are people on both sides in the two countries who are prepared to build on and exploit failures or difficulties when they arise.  There is a clear failure of understanding of the processes and a failure of understanding of the efforts being made to ensure that the terrorist finds no haven within our jurisdiction. There is a common belief abroad that there are hundreds of these people running around this country.  That is not so and if they are being sought abroad it is for questioning only.  We must emphasise that this jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction will not support the notion of extraditing people for questioning only.</P>
    <P>The other major issue that arises is particular to the case and has to be commented on, that is, the quality of the presentation of evidence with regard to the identification of the person sought.  I join Deputy Taylor in making what point I can on this, that it is and should be of no surprise to any official or law officer involved in the process of extradition to suggest that a requirement would be made in court of proper identification of the person involved.  The question fundamental to a court &mdash; and it is one of the basic questions asked &mdash; is, is the person named and sought in the warrant the person standing in the dock of the court?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> It has been clearly indicated that there was no member of the British police force available who could in any way suggest that that was the person sought and named in the warrant.  It is not good enough simply to say that and leave it at that.  In the first instance how was McVeigh suggested?  Was a conclusion drawn in the British investigation to suggest that he was wanted and could be made answerable for the crimes involved?  Somewhere in the <i>corpus</i> of evidence assembled by the British in the investigation of the crime there must have been something that would have suggested that Mr. McVeigh could be connected with that crime, by fingerprint, by civilian or other witness or by some other means.  That must have formed part of the provisions of the Amendment Bill of 1987 and included in the memorandum furnished to the Attorney General. Consequently, there must have been available to the authorities, both in Britain and here, a means of introducing evidence in court here to establish clearly that McVeigh was the person needed and wanted on the warrant, who could be linked to the crime and identified as the person named.</P>
    <P>For what it is worth it is my view that the district justice reached a correct decision, took a decision that could not in any way have taken anyone involved in the process of extradition by surprise. In my experience it is a central feature of all extradition applications.  Similar cases in which I have been involved as a practitioner have involved police officers or other witnesses, including civilian witnesses, or experts on fingerprint identification, attending hearings in District Courts on a regular basis in Dublin or elsewhere to satisfy the justice sitting that the person in the dock was the person named in the warrant, the person connected with the whole process and investigation. That is what is central.</P>
    <P>The Worker's Party have never been happy with the amendment introduced in the second Bill of 1987.  We have always argued that there should be a full investigation by the District Court here in all extradition proceedings through the <Col N="138" /> process known as the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  This House has not seen fit to support that idea but nonetheless has given support overwhelmingly to the extradition laws as they now stand.  It is the duty of all of us to ensure that those laws are implemented in full, without hitch, error or mistake.  In any review of the law consequent on the McVeigh case it is necessary that comprehensive machinery be put in place in both jurisdictions to ensure that nothing similar will recur.</P>
    <P>The final point that must be made is this, that the mess surrounding the McVeigh case &mdash; and it can only be described as that &mdash; simply did not begin or end in court yesterday.  The method by which the man was released from prison, the ham-fisted attempts to try and detain him outside the prison, involving a collision of efforts on the part of the Army on the one hand and prison officers on the other leaves much to be desired. At this point a prison officer has been suspended because of his failure to obey an order to run across the fire of armed security on the roof of the prison firing after McVeigh.  There was the fiasco on the streets of the town yesterday when Garda took it upon themselves to seek to apprehend McVeigh, again without any authority.  That is something that cannot be allowed to go without examination or investigation.</P>
    <P>This has been a sad saga in the whole of the operations of the extradition laws. On the part of a party and people concerned to ensure that extradition works and is effective, we urge the Minister to ensure that all steps are taken so that what has happened in the course of this sad affair will never be repeated in our courts or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update and strengthen the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children <Col N="139" /> who are being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk.  It replaces the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, which was at Committee Stage here when the 24th Dáil was dissolved.  That Bill ran into difficulties when a Supreme Court judgment in a case known as <i>KC</i> and <i>AC v. An Bord Uchtála</i>, cast serious doubts over the constitutionality of two of its key elements; first, proposals to make it easier for children to be placed in health board care and, secondly, provisions which would have enabled the courts to grant custody rights to foster parents.</P>
    <P>Apart from these constitutional problems, a large number of changes in the details of the Bill were sought by Deputies, health boards and other interested parties.  All of these factors taken together would have involved extensive revision of the Bill requiring as many as 150 amendments.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office we carefully considered the position with regard to the 1985 Bill.  We reached the conclusion that it would be more expeditious to allow it to lapse and to bring forward an entirely new Bill, drafted in the light of the latest judicial interpretations of the Constitution and the many representations made by child care interests.  The Bill now before the House has been prepared on this basis.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of this Bill are as follows: (i) the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection; (ii) strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services; (iii) improved procedure to facilitate immediate intervention by health boards and the Garda where children are in serious danger; (iv) revised provisions to enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk, in the care of or under the supervision of health boards; (v) introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services and (vi) revised provisions <Col N="140" /> in relation to the inspection and approval of residential centres for children.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation in relation to the care of children is based largely on the Children Act of 1908.  That Act was the culmination of a series of legislative measures taken during the 19th and early 20th centuries aimed at protecting children from cruelty and exploitation.  It has served us well and many of its provisions are still in use today.</P>
    <P>While the legislation may not have changed significantly, there have been sweeping changes in society in the intervening period.  The political and administrative structures have changed; new values and attitudes have evolved; there is a more sensitive understanding of the psychology and needs of children.  In particular, there is a greater awareness now of the rights of the child himself or herself as an individual member of society.</P>
    <P>We live in a more enlightened society which has brought great benefits to most of our children but, regrettably, there is a darker side to the picture.  There continue to be unhappy and deprived children in our community.  At any time about 2,500 children are in the care of health boards.  Many are in care because their parents are unable to look after them, whether due to physical or mental illness, alcoholism, marital breakdown or other family crises.  Most are reunited with their families after a few weeks or months; unfortunately others remain in care for years.</P>
    <P>There is another group of children who come into care in much more dramatic and traumatic circumstances.  They are the victims of child abuse, whether it be physical, emotional or sexual.  In 1986, the total number of confirmed cases of all sorts of child abuse known to the health boards was 494.  This represented an increase of 62 per cent on the 1985 figure of 304.  In the case of child sexual abuse, the number of confirmed cases rose from 133 in 1985 to 274 in 1986, an increase of over 100 per cent in one year alone.  My Department have not yet completed the collection from health boards of statistics in respect of 1987 but, on the basis on the returns that have been made to date, all <Col N="141" /> the indications are that the total number of reported and of confirmed cases in 1987, particularly of child sexual abuse, will show a substantial increase on 1986. I do not wish to be alarmist but this trend clearly illustrates the need for up-to-date and effective legislation to protect children who are at risk in the community. That is the primary objective of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office, I have become increasingly concerned at the rise in the number of cases of alleged child abuse being reported to health boards.  In July last, my Department published a new set of child abuse guidelines.  They set out, in considerable detail, recommended procedures for the reporting, recording, investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse, including sexual abuse.  These new guidelines have been welcomed by the various interest groups.  They are designed to ensure a systematic and sensitive approach to caring for the victims of abuse.  The problem of child abuse requires an effective and coherent multi-disciplinary response from our health and social services and this is emphasised and underlined through the guidelines.</P>
    <P>The assessment of alleged child sexual abuse involves an investigation by a multi-disciplinary term in each health board area, with support from specialist services, including child psychiatric, paediatric and gynaecology services as appropriate.  There is a real need to increase the range of services available for sexually abused children and I have already allocated special funds to enable services at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals to be significantly expanded.  There is, of course, a need also to improve services outside the Dublin area and I have therefore, allocated special funds of £450,000 from my Department's share of the national lottery surplus to the health boards outside of Dublin to enable them to improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child abuse including child sexual abuse.  These improved services throughout the country will strengthen the ability of the health <Col N="142" /> boards to discharge their duties under this Bill.</P>
    <P>While the State and its agencies must have the power and resources to protect those children whose health or well-being is in jeopardy, it is equally important to protect children and families from unwarranted or excessive interference.  I would see children being taken into care against the wishes of their parents only in exceptional cases where, for example, they have been ill-treated or sexually abused or where there are compelling reasons why their welfare demands that they be removed from their family.  The Bill has been drafted on this basis and I wish to emphasise that it poses no threat to family life generally or to the vast majority of parents who are doing an excellent job, sometimes under difficult circumstances, to rear and care for their children.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides that the Bill is to be known as the Child Care Act and empowers me to bring the various provisions into effect by order.  While it is my intention that the Bill, when enacted, should be brought into operation as quickly as possible, it may be necessary to phase in certain provisions so as to allow time, for example, for social workers and other staff to be briefed on the new legal procedures and for the setting up of inspection mechanisms for pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Section 2 defines various terms used in the Bill of which the most important is the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  At present, the Children Act, 1908, as amended, defines a child as a person under 15 years and defines a young person as a person between 15 and 17 years.  In general, children but not young persons may be the subject of proceedings for Fit Persons Orders.  This means, in effect, that a person over 15 years may not be placed in health board care regardless of how desirable this might be in his interests. During the debate on the 1985 Bill a number of Deputies and other interested parties drew attention to this and sought <Col N="143" /> an increase in the age up to which children may be taken into care.  They pointed to a small but growing number of older children who would benefit from being in care but cannot be admitted under the present law.  I accept that there may be older children who may need to be placed in care and propose to achieve it by defining &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill as a person under 18 years.  The main effect of this will be to raise to 18 years the age up to which health boards will be responsible for children and the age up to which children may be admitted to care.</P>
    <P>Part II, that is sections 3 to 9, contain a number of provisions aimed at promoting the welfare of children, preventing family breakdown and avoiding the need to have to take children into care on a compulsory basis.</P>
    <P>Section 3 places a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and also gives them new and expanded powers to provide child care and family support services. This is one of the most important provisions of the Bill.  It imposes a clear obligation on health boards to promote the welfare of children.  It will enable them to provide child care and family support services so as to assist parents in caring for their children and to prevent children having to be placed in care.  I am confident that the imaginative use of this power by health boards and their professional staffs will result in the development and expansion of community based services and facilities for children and families.  These may include more intensive social work support for families at risk, new counselling and advice services, pre-school services, home help and home maker services, child guidance, day fostering, family resource centres and special projects for the young homeless and other &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups.</P>
    <P>In implementing this provision, health boards will be required to have regard to the principle that is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.  Thus the emphasis is on <Col N="144" /> providing support and assistance so that children can remain at home; only in exceptional cases are children to be taken into care.</P>
    <P>Section 4 extends the powers which health boards have under the Health Act, 1953, to receive children into care on a voluntary basis.  At present, about 80 per cent of the children in care are there on this basis rather than under court orders. While there has been a slight increase in recent years in the proportion of children entering care through the courts, I expect that the bulk of admissions will continue to be on a voluntary basis.  The new section will enable health boards to receive into care, without reference to the courts, orphans and abandoned children and, with the consent of the parents, children whose parents are unable to care for them due, for example, to serious illness, sudden bereavement, marital breakdown or other family crisis.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies and religious communities have played an important part in the development of our child care services particularly in the provision of residential facilities.  I wish to acknowledge the excellent work which they have done over the years and continue to do today for the most disadvantaged children in the nation.  There are a number of sections in the Bill which recognise their expertise and commitment and seek to ensure that it continues in the future.  It is proposed in section 5 to establish one or more child care advisory committees in each health board area to advise the board in the performance of its functions under the Bill.  The committees will be composed of persons with a special interest or expertise in child care and will include representatives of voluntary bodies providing child care services.  I see this as a very useful provision which will ensure that the voluntary sector has a say in the planning and development of our child care services.  I hope that it will also lead to greater co-operation and co-ordination in the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables health boards to make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide child care and family support services on their behalf.  Section <Col N="145" /> 8 empowers health boards to grant-aid voluntary bodies providing child care and family support services.  Section 9 enables the Minister and health board to sponsor or carry out research in the area of child care.</P>
    <P>Part III (sections 10-13) deals with the protection of children in emergencies.  It replaces the &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; provisions of the Children Act, 1908.  Since the Garda are often the first to come across cases of child abuse and neglect, section 10 provides that in an emergency a Garda would be empowered, without warrant, to remove to a hospital, a children's home or other safe place a child who had been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, where there is an immediate and serious risk to his health and well being.  The child could be kept there for a maximum of 24 hours pending the making of an application for an emergency care order.  Section 11 empowers a district justice to make an order to be known as an emergency care order which would authorise the removal of a child from his home and his placement in the care of a health board for up to eight days where there was an immediate and serious risk to his safety.  An important new element is the time limit of eight days; under the present place of safety order no specific period is defined.  This new element has been inserted to help to ensure that parents are not unnecessarily or unfairly deprived of custody of their children for indefinite periods and to give them an early opportunity to state their side of the case to the court.  The relatively short time span may create some initial difficulties for health boards who will have to be ready to proceed with an application for a care order or a supervision order within eight days.  However, I believe that with experience any such difficulties can be quickly overcome.</P>
    <P>Part IV, sections 14 to 24, deals with care proceedings and is one of the most important parts of the Bill.  It sets out the circumstances in which the courts may place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk, in the <Col N="146" /> care of or under the supervision of health boards.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that it was the corresponding part of the 1985 Bill that ran into serious constitutional difficulties. In preparing this Bill, I have paid careful attention to the relevant provisions of the Constitution and to recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court.  I have also obtained the advice of the Attorney General to ensure in so far as it is possible to do so that the provisions in relation to taking children into care are constitutionally sound.  What is now proposed is firmly based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution which I would like to quote in full.  It states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the Constitution not only permits the State to intervene where children are not being cared for properly but indeed obliges the State to do so.  I am confident, therefore, that the following provisions, which are central to the Bill would, if challenged, be found to be in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Section 14 imposes a statutory duty on a health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order, as appropriate, whenever it appears that a child requires care or protection that he is unlikely to receive unless such an order is made.  At present, health boards are not under any obligation to initiate court proceedings to take children into care and some doubts have been expressed about their legal authority to do so.  This section will eliminate any such doubts by imposing a firm statutory duty on health boards to initiate care proceedings where this is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the making of a care order.  It replaces the Fit Person Order provided for in the 1908 Act.  A care order would, in effect, suspend the parents' right to custody of the child and <Col N="147" /> place him in the custody of the health board.  A care order would remain in force until the child attained the age of 18 years unless it was discharged by the court because of changed circumstances.</P>
    <P>In order to obtain a care order, it would be necessary for a health board to satisfy the court that the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused, or the child's health, development or well-being has been or is being avoidably impaired or seriously neglected, or there are reasonable grounds for believing that his health, development or well-being is likely to be avoidably impaired or seriously neglected.  In addition, the court would have to be satisfied that the child required care or protection which he was unlikely to receive unless he was placed in the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>These grounds differ fundamentally from what is contained in the present legislation in so far as the focus here is on the needs of the child rather than the wrongdoing or shortcomings of his parents.  I believe that this is the more appropriate approach and it will ensure that the needs of the child are given full and careful consideration.  However, in order that the rights of all concerned are taken into account, the court in reaching its decision will also be required to have regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the court to make a supervision order.  This would authorise a health board to visit a child in his home to ensure that he was being cared for properly.  The concept of supervising a child at home under a court order is new to our law.</P>
    <P>At present, where the welfare of a child is giving cause for concern, a health board faces the stark choice of either seeking a Fit Person Order to take him into care or leaving him at home and depending on the goodwill of the parents regarding access to him.  One possible result is that health boards may be tempted to take children into care in cases where the separation of the child from his family is out <Col N="148" /> of proportion to the risk of which he is exposed.</P>
    <P>A supervision order would require the health board to have the child visited regularly to ensure that he was being properly cared for and to give his parents any necessary advice and assistance.  This regular monitoring of the child would assist the board in identifying any serious deterioration in his welfare.  It would then be open to the board to ask the court to give directions to the parents as to the care of a child, or, if necessary, to apply for a care order.  The court could direct the parents to bring the child to a day care centre, child guidance clinic, hospital etc. A supervision order would apply for 12 months and would be renewable.</P>
    <P>Some parents whose children are taken into care wish to continue to have access to them, either on a regular or an occasional basis.  In most cases, arrangements for visits and access can be made through the relevant health board social worker but disputes can arise as to the frequency of access and the arrangements for visits.  Section 17 is designed to eliminate such disputes by enabling parents, grandparents and other persons with an interest in the child to apply to the court for its directions as to access.</P>
    <P>Sections 21, 22 and 23 contain a number of provisions aimed at reducing, as far as possible, the stress and anxiety associated with court proceedings. Section 21 provides that care proceedings will be heard in private and will be as informal as possible.  Section 22 provides that the child involved need not be brought before the court for all or any part of the hearing unless the court so directs.  Section 23 prohibits the publication or broadcast of any matter that would serve to identify a child who is the subject of care proceedings.</P>
    <P>Part V, sections 25 to 34, sets out the arrangements which may be made by health boards in looking after children in their care.  A health board may place a child in foster care, in a children's residential centre, in a special school recognised by the Minister for Education or to make such other arrangements as may be approved by the Minister.  Section 27 will <Col N="149" /> enable me to make regulations governing the placement of children in foster care and section 28 confers a similar power in relation to residential care.  Section 31 enables a health board to provide &ldquo;after-care&rdquo; e.g. support and assistance for persons who were formerly in care.</P>
    <P>At present, there is no statutory supervision of pre-schools, playgroups, crèches, nurseries and other pre-school services for children.  There have been various calls in recent years for the introduction of legislative controls on these services, notably from the Task Force on Child Care Services and the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents, to ensure that children attending them receive proper care and are protected from possible abuse.</P>
    <P>Part VI provides for the introduction of a system of inspection of services for pre-school children, e.g., day nurseries, crèches, playgroups and pre-schools.  The provisions here are intended to cover a wide variety of different types of pre-school services.  Some operate on strict commercial lines while others are run on a community or self-help basis.  Some simply mind the children while their parents are away; others provide educational programmes designed to stimulate the child's physical and intellectual development.  Some services provide full day care while others operate for only part of the day.  My Department estimate that there are some 1,400-1,500 different services catering for up to 20,000 pre-school children.</P>
    <P>Section 36 will enable me, in consultation with the Minister for Education, to make regulations for securing the safety and promoting the development of children attending pre-school services. Persons carrying on pre-school services will be required to notify the local health board and there will be statutory duty on them to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the children concerned.  Health boards will be required to arrange for the inspection of pre-school services.  As many of the services have an educational dimension this aspect will, where appropriate, be taken into account in the inspection process in consultation with <Col N="150" /> the Department of Education.  Section 42 empowers health boards to provide pre-school services and to make available information on pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill (sections 44-50) updates the arrangements for the supervision of residential centres for children.  These include cover for 24 residential homes (former industrial schools) for which I have responsibility and 17 homes approved under the Health Act, 1953. The 41 homes together provide accommodation for about 1,000 children.  At present, the residential homes are subject to certain limited controls under the Children Act, 1908, while the 17 approved homes are not subject to specific statutory regulations.  The Bill will enable me to prescribe requirements as to the standard of accommodation and facilities, staff numbers and qualifications etc., in all the centres.  In addition, the centres will be subject to inspection by officers of health boards and by officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw special attention to section 49.  This provides for the introduction of a superannuation scheme for the staff of most of our children's residential centres.  This is something that has long been sought by the managements and staffs of the centres and their representative associations.  It is proposed that the staff of the centres concerned will be deemed to be employed by their local health board for the purposes of the local government superannuation scheme.  This is an administrative device to avoid each of the 40 or so children's residential centres having to establish and maintain superannuation records.  Instead the records will be maintained by the local health boards who are more familiar with all aspects of the superannuation code.  I would like to emphasise that this provision will have no effect on the employer-employee relationship between the staffs and managements of the centres concerned.</P>
    <P>Part VIII (sections 51-56) contains various technical provisions in relation to the administration of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Section 52 will enable me to supervise health boards in the performance of their functions under the Bill.  Section 55 reserves to chief executive officers of health boards certain functions under the Bill, chiefly those which affect individual children.  I would expect that most of these functions would be delegated by chief executive officers to other officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>Part IX (sections 57 to 62) contains miscellaneous and supplementary provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 57 provides for the abolition of the death sentence in respect of crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age.  This is to give effect to Article 6.5 of the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which provides that sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age.  This is one of two measures required to enable the State to ratify the UN Covenant; the other is the prohibition of incitement to national, religious or racial hatred.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public concern about solvent abuse, or &ldquo;glue-sniffing&rdquo; as it is popularly known.  Already this year, there have been reports of six deaths of young people arising from various forms of solvent abuse.  One of the most disturbing aspects of this phenomenon is reports that some traders, a very small minority of them, have been selling solvents to youngsters with reckless disregard for the dangers involved.  Section 58 proposes to make it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they will be abused.  Provision is made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  I accept that this may not be a complete answer to this problem.  However, I do not think that it would be realistic to attempt to enforce more stringent legal controls.  The variety of household products which may be abused, for example hair lacquer, cigarette lighter fuel, aerosols, nail varnish remover and petrol, renders legal control difficult.  These products are readily available in most <Col N="152" /> homes, so prohibiting their sale to children would not reduce their availability for sniffing.  Furthermore, there are quite legitimate uses for these products by children; a ban on sale of glues, for example would hinder children involved in such innocent pastimes as model building.  I would like to assure the House that the provisions of this section will be complemented by greater efforts to educate children and the wider public as to the dangers involved in solvent abuse.  I have asked the Health Promotion Unit of my Department to take urgent action towards this end.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the primary purpose of this Bill is to protect children who are being or who are at risk of being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  It poses no threat to the generality of families and is firmly based on the principle that the best place for a child to grow up is with his own family or, where this is not possible, with a suitable substitute family.  There is an urgent need to update the law in this area and I believe that this Bill represents a significant improvement on the present situation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While we in Fine Gael welcome the publication of the Child Care Bill, we are firmly of the view that it is seriously defective in a number of ways.  As I said on an earlier occasion, what has been awaited and expected was a major charter of children's rights which would steer the laws and services in relation to children into the next century and guide them on the right path.  What we have got falls far short of this.  Indeed, the Minister himself said it is essentially a document aimed at tackling the area of child abuse and important steps forward to be made in this.  While it contains some important and welcome reforms, the Bill is more remarkable for what is not in it than for what is included in it.  It is unfortunate that the Minister &mdash; I made similar comments when his predecessor presented his Bill &mdash; reacted to the constitutional problems by reducing and minimalising the legislation and leaves us in a situation that no sooner will the ink <Col N="153" /> be dry on this Bill than we will have to draft another Children Bill to move on with what is next required.</P>
      <P>The major failing in this legislation is the ducking of the constitutional issues. It has long been recognised that, while the rights of families are, quite rightly, strongly protected in our laws and Constitution, the rights and needs of our children are far less defined.  It was anticipated that the Children Bill would seek to address this imbalance.  The Bill is almost totally silent in relation to children's fundamental rights.  There is no statement of principle.  There is by contrast in Part II of the Bill again a clear definition of the rights of families, which nobody argues with but which are already identified and protected in many of our laws and clearly in our Constitution.  As a result of the failure to face up to the constitutional challenge we have had a watering down even of proposals in the previous Bill.</P>
      <P>What was the reaction to problems in relation to foster care?  It was to drop them completely.  An objective seen as desirable by the Department and the Health officials at the time of protecting and establishing foster care on a more sound constitutional and legal footing has simply been dropped as a result rather than face the substantive constitutional issue.</P>
      <P>In the Preamble to this Bill the Minister should include a statement of children's rights.  I hope he will give some thought to this, and certainly we will be moving it by way of amendment.  The Minister referred to Articles of the Constitution which referred to the imprescriptible rights of children.  I refer to Article 40 which recognises the fundamental rights of citizens.  It provides:</P>
      <P>1. All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that children are different from any other citizens.  Children, by <Col N="154" /> virtue of their youth, dependence and vulnerability are unique among citizens and are in need of special protection. They form a very large part of the population of this and most other countries. Our Constitution specifically allows us to have due regard to their position.  The Minister identified other parts of the Constitution which stated that we must have due regard to the imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>We have not taken many steps on the way towards introducing substantial legislation in regard to children.  We should have a substantial statement of principle to form the core, philosophy and spirit of the Bill.  Such a statement was missing in the original draft of the Status of Children Bill but we succeeded in having it inserted at a later stage.  The final word in relation to children's legislation for our generation will never be uttered until we face this constitutional issue, not duck it.  We will have to stand up for children.</P>
    <P>Can any person, bureaucrat or lawyer, seriously argue against a statement of the fundamental right of children to live a life free of abuse and in an environment which fosters their growth?  If there was a need to have a referendum I am sure the Irish people would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on every occasion an issue relating to children was put before them.  In the past they responded positively when such issues were put to them.  I am confident that if these issues were put to them, rather than approaching legislation in a minimalist and conservative way, they would adopt them.</P>
    <P>I wonder how long we can avoid this issue.  Even in recent weeks a member of the Judiciary questioned the constitutional basis of existing actions by health boards in taking children into care. I do not think we can avoid these issues much longer.  It is not desirable that we should do so because it has led to us having the most conservative child care legislation that could have emerged from the 80 years of expectation and the last ten to 15 years of serious and deep consideration. We have had a multitude of reports but most of the proposals in them <Col N="155" /> were ignored in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I may not have made such liberal comments when I was on the Government side but I did express my views to the previous Minister.  The Bill makes welcome improvements in the law in relation to children at risk of abuse and clearly defines sexual abuse as an offence against children.  However, even in that section the approach is fundamentally flawed in that it emphasises as the standard response the removal of the child, rather than the offender from the home.  Many countries have adopted the Toronto Protocal which is based on the premise that it is the offender who has to be removed rather than the child as a matter of principle but any reference to this type of approach is absent in the Minister's speech.  In discussions in the Department the principle was not introduced or identified. It is important that it should be brought to the fore and that children who have been offended against should not be further victimised by being seen as the target to be removed, as being seen as the offender rather than the victim.  The legislation should be based on the Toronto Protocol and accompanied by a set of procedures which would ensure that in our laws and in the practice observed by our sexual assault units and our social services it becomes the fundamental principle when dealing with cases of child abuse.</P>
    <P>We have been so busy trying to ensure that we do not run foul of the constitutional position of the family that we have not taken the necessary leap forward in regard to the treatment of children who are abused, sexually or otherwise.  Part II which gives health boards responsibility for the promotion of the welfare of children has tremendous potential, greater than I realised when I first read the Bill.  That potential will only be recognised if health boards are given resources and a structure under which they can develop their services, neither of which are in evidence in the Bill.  The structures proposed in the Bill are totally inadequate and will not allow health <Col N="156" /> boards to take on the extra responsibilities envisaged in it.</P>
    <P>The question of information on prevention and education regarding abuse should be central to all our activities in the future.  The European Parliament draft report on child abuse, issued in July 1985, emphasised the importance of prevention and early detection for the health of the child and for the long-term prognosis for the child.  In the USA that takes place as early as in maternity hospitals where certain factors, even at that early stage, predict the likelihood of a child being open to abuse.  Various child care bodies say that the number coming forward to the volunteer information on child abuse in a family can be increased by greater publicity by the mass media. There has been evidence of this in the past year here and in Britain with the mass media giving greater attention to this issue.  Television, in particular, can be used to break down the fears and reluctance of the people concerned and encourage them to seek help.</P>
    <P>It is important to look at an area where we do not have any services, apart from individual counselling.  I am referring to the need for services for abusers.  In 50 per cent of cases the abuser is an intimate relative or acquaintance of a child &mdash; in most cases the abuser is a relative.  While for the purposes of this legislation we have to define the action of abusing a child as a criminal act and one which must be prosecuted, we must also be concerned about their predicament. Many of them act involuntarily and may be following experiences of their own as a child.  They are in need of help.  I hope the Minister will be able to outline proposals for the development of services for abusers.  I should like to ask him to say if he has requested any of the bodies involved in the provision of services for children to look at that matter.  It has been established that a small number of abusers interfere with many children.  I have heard it said that one individual may be responsible for abusing 70 to 90 children.  It is important that we should deal with this matter urgently.</P>
    <P>If we take the issue of child abuse more <Col N="157" /> seriously we will have more prosecutions but within a short time the offenders will be back on the streets again in the grip of whatever personal experiences or inclinations that drove them to commit the first offence.  They are likely to commit a similar offence.  Many of the adults who abuse children have been the victim of abuse and are in need of help.  Ultimately, for the person who has been abused, that realisation must help them to come to terms with what has happened to them and to seek an explanation for the violation of their rights as individuals.  That is a very important side of the development of our services.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to any of these areas.  We must make use of the mass media.  There should be public education programmes in our schools from the earliest stages.  We should educate young children to recognise a violation of their rights.  This is the most important element in the programme dealing with the abuse of children.</P>
    <P>Through the use of the mass media to reach people who are anxious and willing to come forward, the experience in other countries has been that 70 per cent would voluntarily report cases of abuse following a public information programme because they saw themselves involved in a cycle over which they had no control and they felt great remorse.</P>
    <P>The ISPCC and other Irish bodies have identified the need for a mandatory reporting of cases of child abuse among health professionals.  I regret that this has not been included in the Bill.  I share their view that it is imperative that doctors, nurses and social workers would be obliged by the law to report all evidence of child abuse.  In some cases, this involves a conflict of existing ethical practices in relation to confidence and disclosure. However, it is vital that in the provision of this legislation we give due weight to the view that the use of a child by an adult for sexual purposes is an abusive and criminal act and the person involved should be prosecuted.  Such reporting should be done in the context of an agreed protocol to which all personnel involved with children would adhere. <Col N="158" /> The abuse of children is an area where many taboos exist.  People are often wary of reporting their suspicions.  We should require the professionals in the field to follow certain procedures.  Mandatory reporting should be included in the Bill and I hope the Minister will give this suggestion due consideration when he is putting down amendments on Committee Stage or, perhaps in his reply to Second Stage, he might explain why, given that this matter has been identified by the ISPCC, this is not a feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The extension of the provision of services, the increased powers being given to health boards to act in cases of abuse, to take children into care, to provide care services, to inspect the pre-school facilities and to inspect and provide centres, will depend on a number of things. The first is resources but while that is very important, I do not believe it would be in order for us to cover it today.  What we must do is ensure that, as far as possible, this legislation will address the current problems with child care and how the services are structured within the health services.  I will repeat a phrase that has been used &mdash; I used it earlier and I know the House has heard it many times &mdash; that the community services are the Cinderella of the health services and the child care services are the poor relation.  This is the view held by those working in the field and an objective look at the total figures for this area will bear this out.  In this legislation we are adding the responsibility for providing a greatly increased level of service and Part II has immense potential if resources, financial and personnel, are provided.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on child care recommended the establishment of a seperate programme in the health board areas for child care.  This has been ignored completely by the Minister and is tagging extra responsibility on to an already groaning and creaking system which is finding it impossible to deliver many services.  Most of the time of the chief executive and the management is tied up dealing with the major hospitals. There is nothing in this Bill which would <Col N="159" /> improve the structure of the administration to ensure that the existing or potential services are developed or would ensure that the new powers in the Bill can be fully realised and implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not have had time to read in detail the proposals published by our party spokesman yesterday.  In those proposals there is a structure which we in Fine Gael believe would give due consideration, weight and attention to the child care area and other very important areas of community care.  The radical restructuring by Fine Gael would envisage trimming down the bureaucracy involved in the administration of the health services and the improved management of those services.  Within the improved management structure is recognised the fact that local regional responsibility would be limited to providing community care and supervising the special hospitals in their area.  It is envisaged that there would be five project managers, one of them dealing with child care and within that context, there would be an adequate structure to ensure that child care moves from its current position. The need for such a move is evident from the Minister's speech in which he gave us the chilling statistics of the increasing incidence of abuse over the last number of years and these figures continue to rise.</P>
    <P>The importance of child care and the structures for delivering child care services will be high on any health agenda in the foreseeable future.  The Minister has not done anything in this Bill to improve the administration and to establish an improved delivery mechanism, or to lead us to believe that the potential of the Bill in the area of the promotion of the welfare of children could be realised. I ask the Minister to look again at this area.</P>
    <P>One of the other structural units recommended by the task force was a national children's council.  I cannot understand this Minister's, the Department's or the previous Minister's reluctance to have such a council.  I cannot see how anybody can argue against its <Col N="160" /> existence.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's arguments.  The fact is we have waited 80 years for a major update of a Bill, a Bill which has stood the test of time reasonably well.  Even with the passing of this Bill, the Adoption Bill and similar legislation, many sections of the 1908 Act still remain in law and the section dealing with juvenile justice still remains to be examined by this House, not to mention the huge gaps in the area of child care.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe it is vital that we should have an independent monitoring body representative of the voluntary bodies which more and more are filling the gap in the services provided in these specialised areas.  I believe we should have such a body and if the Minister is firmly fixed against it, I will be putting down amendments to this effect on Committee Stage.  I do not believe it would be a matter of great expenditure.  It could be handled in the same way as the National Social Service Board handle the National Council for the Aged.  It could be supervised and staffed by them.  It would help to ensure the children's legislation is not allowed to slip into a backwater and that constant changes in approach are given due attention and implemented in our procedures and services.  It would be a great help to the Department, the Minister and everybody with the interests of children at heart.  I do not understand the reluctance to have it and I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with pre-school services.  We welcome the first steps towards supervising this area, which have developed to date without controls.  My colleague, Deputy Barnes, has a particular interest in this matter and will comment upon it in detail.  The Bill falls far short of implementing the minimum legal standards recommended for pre-school services.  For example, it is envisaged that schools may register before they are inspected, which is surely an extraordinary notion.</P>
    <P>I regret that family day care has been ignored completely in the Bill.  By this I mean the provision of care for children <Col N="161" /> in the home of another mother with children. We are light years behind our European partners in the support of women at work.  In the Federal Republic of Germany the role of family day care is fully recognised and supported.  A monthly fee is paid by the Department, but we should not hold our breath in expectation of the same thing happening here.  It is important to include that category of child care personnel.  This system of having children cared for is one of the most popular among working parents.  It is not excluded by the Bill and I should like some reference to it as one of the preferred ways to have children looked after in an environment closest to the child's own family home.  Child care is essential, not just for women working but as a major support to a mother who may be under pressure and may be likely to abuse her child.</P>
    <P>Another major disappointment is the failure to take on board the task force recommendation that the school attendance service should be transferred to the Department of Health.  Those of us who serve on local authorities and have seen the non-activity of school attendance committees realise that the nature of the service has changed completely.  Originally it was a regulatory service backed up by the Garda Síochána.  The personnel of these committees are being under-utilised but they could form a valuable resource within the Department of Health, especially in view of the fact that non-attendance at school is no longer seen as something for which a person should be penalised or sent to an institution. Very often it is the first warning sign that a child is in difficulty of some sort, a matter which should be the concern of the Department of Health.  It is a signal of stress and of the emergence of problems to which it would be more appropriate for the Department of Health to respond.  The Minister might refer to this point and explain why this provision has not been included.  I hope he will take a fresh look at this matter.</P>
    <P>We warmly welcome the improved provisions for the handling of cases of <Col N="162" /> abuse and the power given to the Garda Síochána to take a child to a place of safety without a warrant.  We also welcome the improvement of the other procedures in relation to emergency care orders.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended on broadening the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  He must have taken a great interest in this point in order to have brought about its inclusion.  It closes off a major gap which was identified in the debate on the previous Bill but also by the activity of voluntary bodies who have taken an interest in the plight of the teenage homeless. The recent Focus Point and Streetwise reports identified the fact that children were falling into a statutory abyss in that they were no longer the responsibility of the Department of Health because they were no longer defined as children, but were not eligible for help by the Department of Social Welfare or for housing by the Department of the Environment.  If they became detached from their family they were likely to stay that way, depending on the assistance of voluntary bodies. I warmly commend the Minister on accepting responsibility for this group and ensuring that the Department of Health have responsibility for their welfare, care and shelter.</P>
    <P>While there are welcome reforms in this Bill, which we will be anxious to see implemented, a major opportunity has been missed in the light of the expectations and hopes for a definitive modernisation of the law in relation to child care on which to base our social services and our total approach to children into the next century.  That is missing fron this legislation.  We have a few piecemeal reforms and we will have to start working, not just on the huge area of juvenile justice which has been totally left aside but upon many of the areas related to this Bill as soon as the ink is dry.  I regret that this is so.</P>
    <P>I hope we can make some progress on this Bill, although its approach is basically so conservative that it is hard to see how one could incorporate a more total approach to the problems of children without completely redrafting.  I hope the <Col N="163" /> Minister will use the summer to reflect on the Bill and to consider the points made on Second Stage, as well as meeting with bodies who deal with children. The Minister may then initiate substantial amendments on Committee Stage.  He should consider whether it is timely and appropriate to face up to the constitutional issues by including a major statement of principle in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If necessary, let us face that constitutional issue.  The European elections will be held next June and we could, if necessary, have a referendum at that time.  Let us move ahead in this area, with the support of the Irish people, by framing legislation that will not give pre-eminent rights to children or in any way threaten family rights but that will get the balance a little more even where it is totally unbalanced at the moment in favour of the family.  I hope the Minister will bear these points in mind when he is reflecting during the summer following the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue in a number of respects.  First, it is now 80 years since any Parliament responsible for supervising this particular matter in Ireland has addressed this point in a comprehensive and categorical way with a view to providing a system of legislation for the proper protection of children. The Children Act of 1908, with which I have some passing acquaintance in my law practice and which many other Deputies in this House have also seen from other aspects was for its time, undoubtedly a progressive measure, but in retrospect and certainly in the light of present circumstances, it is a measure which by no means does justice to children or holds fairly and impartially the scales between children and society and children and their parents and the families to which they belong in terms of doing them justice and vindicating their constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure put forward by the Minister is a reasonably fair compromise between a number of conflicting interests.  On that, I do not have any <Col N="164" /> major misgivings as to the balance being struck by the Minister within the confines of the Constitution.  Like Deputy Flaherty, I agree that there is the over-riding constraint on all legislators in this country at the moment in that the Constitution gives to the family very wide-sweeping fundamental and antecedent powers and rights with which any legislator can only interfere with at his peril.  That is unfortunate. It reflects outdated social thinking, it reflects an unnecessary pre-occupation with family rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> a child's rights in cases where they come into conflict and it is something which is part of the luggage of history rather than something which really reflects social values and social thinking at this stage of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we also have to take into account that in vindicating children's rights there must be a bias in favour of vindication of those rights within the family.  I do not think anybody in this House, no matter how they may view the present Constitution, would take a view that there should be anything but a presumption in favour of parental discharge of the function of looking after children's welfare.  It is wrong to think that the present Constitution is a conscious enemy of children's rights.  It is right to think that it was over-zealous and had an imbalance in its approach to the issue.  It is wrong to think that we should be indifferent to parents' input into the upbringing of their children or treated as just one more factor in a judge's determination of what is or is not the best interest of a child at any given stage.  In the Guardianship of Infant's Act code the interests of a child are given the most important weight in determining how a decision should go whereas the Constitution, on the other hand, gives the family much more weight in determining how a child's future could be affected by any particular court decision.</P>
    <P>My feeling is that we should as a society strike the balance with a bias towards parents as being the proper people to look after their children and to make decisions in the absence of any particular <Col N="165" /> reason as to why there should be a substantial interference with their rights but that we should not erect parental rights into a cathedral of principle erected over the child's interests.  The child is fundamentally someone who is a citizen of this State and, by virtue of its minor status, is entitled to more and not less willingness and capacity on the part of the State to vindicate its rights.</P>
    <P>It is a huge mistake, and it is something which sometimes cries out for rectification, to think that in some sense because a child is a minor and does not have full legal capacity its interests fall to be subordinate to those of others.  I believe on the contrary that a child, as a minor, as someone who is not of full legal capacity, has the right to have its interests specially protected, that children should be given special protection by the Constitution and not simply by the laws of this State, that children are entitled, because they are incapable of defending and asserting their own rights, except through friends or parents or agencies established for that purpose, to special protection rather than the reverse and their minor status, their inchoate status as citizens should not be seen as a weakness or an affliction or as something which exposes them to legal consequences against which they have no remedy.  I believe that in that respect this Bill goes a long way towards re-striking the balance, and in a proper direction.</P>
    <P>
      <i>En passant</i> I do say that the text of the Constitution circulated by the Progressive Democrats is correct in one respect; it sought to establish and to recognise the special rights of children as rights to be vindicated rather than seeking to erect family rights into a huge structure which can sometimes grind down and obliterate the superior rights of a child.  We have seen cases here where children's rights have come in conflict with parental rights, adoption cases where courts have decided, for instance, that children placed in the care of others with a view to their adoption, not-withstanding their interest in that adoption proceeding should, because of the subsequent marriage of their natural <Col N="166" /> parents, be returned to those natural parents irrespective of the interests of those children.  Those decisions are ones which raise an eyebrow legally as to what balance we are trying to strike between parental rights and social rights and children's rights.  I believe we should aim in the long run as a Legislature, as Deputy Flaherty suggested, towards redressing the balance constitutionally, because the Constitution is the fundamental law of the land, towards the vindication of children's rights and towards giving children a better deal in our laws.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, we now deal with a piece of statutory legislation which is designed to deal with very pressing problems. It is dealing with the problem of the abused, neglected or abandoned child and it is putting on the Statute Book, for the first time in 80 years, a comprehensive code giving somebody some obligations and some duties in respect of such children, as opposed to leaving it effectively to the fruits of chance as to whether such children would have some benevolent interloper who would come to court or seek to vindicate their rights.  Now at last there is somebody whose duty it is to look after those children's rights and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>This Bill has a degree of urgency about it because I know from my other capacity that some judges of the High Court have already ruled that it is more probable than not that health boards at the moment have no right, good, bad or indifferent, to invoke the powers of the District Court to have a Fit Persons Order made in respect of a child or to have children detained against the wishes of their parents.  Judges of the High Court have ruled, quietly and privately &mdash; there has been no publicity because these cases are held <i>in camera</i>&mdash; that those powers are not now available to the health boards, that there is nothing in their statutes which gives them those rights and that they have as much function in relation to the welfare of children as have Bord na Móna and CIE; they are just statutory bodies which have no function whatever in relation to the welfare of children where those children's interests <Col N="167" /> come into conflict with their parents' constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware &mdash; and the Minister of State should tell him &mdash; that one judge of the High Court has said, <i>in camera</i>, that this kind of Bill is an urgent necessity, that there are demands now for the introduction of such a Bill, so as to prevent what could be successfully challenged as interference by a statutory agency, that is the health board, in family rights.  I repeat that there is nothing now, in either the Children Act of 1908, or any of the Acts constituting the health boards or amplifying or extending their powers, which gives them either a right or a duty to interfere against the wishes of parents in relation to the custody, well-being or welfare of their children.  That is a very big lacuna in our law and something which requires immediate attention from this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty has said, and I agree with her, that this is important legislation which is unlikely to come before this House in its final Stages before the summer recess.  However, there must be a sense of urgency about it because there will be some parents, if they are anyway properly legally advised, who will go to the High Court and have some district justice's order quashed under the 1908 Act, saying that there are no rights whatsoever in respect of them and their child and defying the court to show them the statute, Act or regulation which gives such a right.  This House is not simply doing something worthwhile, but something which is urgently necessary.  It should apply itself to this Bill, keeping that in mind.</P>
    <P>We must think reflectively on legislation of this kind.  We have to decide whether we are, by this Bill, setting in place the proper mechanism for vindicating children's rights.  If High Court judges are telling us that something must be done, it must be done.  If every agency report on the issue suggests that something must be done, we must go further than just saying that something must be done.  We must decide whether we are doing the proper thing by children and <Col N="168" /> not doing something for the sake of being seen to do so, after so many decades of neglect.  It is in that respect that I query a number of features of this Bill.  It is easy to say that you will give functions and duties to health boards, but if you do not fund them in respect of those functions you make a mockery of the vindication of children's rights.</P>
    <P>I know from experience &mdash; I shall not amplify that &mdash; and I ask the Members of this House to take it as true, that there are many cases where health boards find themselves trying to vindicate the rights of children by having no resources whatever to deal with the issues.  They find themselves with no child psychiatic service and no family welfare people available to them.  They find themselves with people who are working against a huge and overwhelming tide and being swept backwards by it.  There are very many cases where health boards have found themselves going to judges of the courts of this land and saying that, whatever the rights or wrongs at issue, they simply do not have the time or the staff to investigate them or come to a conclusion one way or other, or to provide adequate services to support a family which is in crisis and whose children are suffering as a result.  That is not fiction, but fact.</P>
    <P>I have seen with my own eyes responsible people, executive and chief executive officers of the largest health board in the country, telling the judge in the High Court that they could not supply the services adequate to the needs of the family involved.  Those chief executive officers are labouring under the difficulty that they have not even a clear statutory basis to do what they are doing already.  They say that they cannot provide the social worker to supervise a child while it remains in its parents' care, they cannot guarantee this child who is at risk and may or may not be abused, any adequate level of supervision to safeguard its interests.  If that is the case now, where health boards have this incohate statutory role &mdash; no role at all &mdash; if you place on them an obligation to vindicate the rights of little children, a yea or nay over who makes an application to a court, but do <Col N="169" /> not provide them with any, or any adequate staffing or funding to decide what the child's interests are, or to vindicate those interests once they are identified, then you make a mockery of the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for unlimited funding for health boards.  I know that in this day and age funds are limited.  However, when you are proposing to extend the powers of health boards, to amplify them, to give them clear duties as to what they must and must not do &mdash; as this Bill actually does &mdash; you cannot do that without giving them a budget with which to do it.  You cannot give somebody a duty without first giving him the where-withal with which to carry out the powers given with that duty.  It is simply hypocrisy to give a health board a new duty to look after children and leave it to the health board as to where they get the necessary resources.  That is a very grave error for us to make.  That is a major problem with this Bill which is not in any way overcome by the Bill itself or any of its provisions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Flaherty has said, Part II of the Bill gives health boards dramatic new functions, wide-ranging powers, including all sorts of advisory committees and statutory duties to look after the welfare of children who are deprived and are at risk in the functional areas of the health boards.  That is all very well, but how are they to do it?  What officers are to carry out these functions.  I know that in some health board areas there are already in existence, without any statutory framework, groups designed for this purpose.  I know as an equal fact that they have not adequate resources to do what they are doing now and that it is just an idle pretence to think that by extending or amplifying their powers, or enshrining them in statutory form, we will vindicate the rights of those children unless we give to the health boards resources along with the powers.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I wish to make.  It is considered, for some reason that I am not quite clear about, but I have my own grave and dark suspicions, that the functions of vindicating children's <Col N="170" /> rights should be given to the District Court and made the stuff of district justice's jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have thought long and hard about this and have viewed on many occasions what has and has not gone on in the District Court, and what are or are not the training and experience qualifications of district justices.  They are in criminal cases confined to exercising summary jurisdiction in limited matter. The District Court is one of summary jurisdiction fundamentally, which means that decisions are made quickly, promptly and in a hurry and made with a view to getting on with the next business. That is summary justice and anybody who disagrees with that is deluding himself or herself.  To give to a court dealing with offences such as no lights on bicycles or the exact remit of the permits of street traders or the smallest matters such as parking fines &mdash; those are some of their more elevated functions &mdash; the power of deciding yes or no over matters of huge consequence to a child is indefensible.</P>
      <P>The District Courts in this country are simply not equipped to deal with the case-load that they have at the moment.  It is again a self-deceiving pretence to suggest that they are in any position to give adequate attention or the hours that are necessary to deciding whether there is or is not substance to a claim that a child is being sexually abused.  That is a fact.  I have been involved in cases which have gone on for weeks on end as to whether those things happened and the District Court cannot give an hour or two of its time to the same issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Which Deputy will say that he or she knows of a District Court which has time to spend two days deciding the fate of a child?  What District Court is organised to allocate two or three days to the decision as to what the future of a child demands?  What District Court is organised to receive child psychiatric evidence? What District Court is organised to lay aside the TV licences and to allocate its <Col N="171" /> judicial brains to deciding what a child needs most of all?  We all know well in our hearts that no District Court is organised to do that.  It is in many respects, despite the best efforts of its members, the district justices, an intellectual and legal slum into which we push more and more work, irrespective of the fact that we know we are not giving it the facilities to deal with it.  For instance, if it cannot deal with a complex case of larceny, where someone will go to jail for two years &mdash; and it cannot deal with that case because larceny is not a minor offence on the criminal side &mdash; why should it decide where a child is to spend from two to 16 years of age?  If it can only deal with minor cases in criminal law, how can it decide major matters in relation to a child's upbringing and welfare?</P>
    <P>Much more importantly, I wish to remind the Minister and the Minister of State that the only function of the District Court is that it is a court of local and limited jurisdiction under the Constitution. It has no right to make far-reaching decisions about the welfare of a child.  Upper class children, and those who have the services of lawyers who will act for nothing, get a High Court judge to exercise wardship jurisdiction over them. When a High Court judge does that he takes the child into the care of the court and makes up his or her mind as to what the best interests of that child may require.  He does so from a totally impassive point of view, that the child is the court's responsibility and that if a health board is looking for custody as opposed to the parents, the court will decide in the best interest of the child where that child should be sent or what will become of it.  That happens in the High Court on one front but we are making a jurisdiction for the District Court &mdash; the poorest of courts in terms of resources, the most overstretched in terms of its time, availability and commitment, the most undertrained and underqualified of our courts, with the greatest of respect to its members &mdash; to make the most dramatic and far-reaching decisions, especially for <Col N="172" /> the poorest of children.  That is an indictment of us because we think we can give to a minor court of summary jurisdiction far-reaching decisions about children whose interests require to be protected. The District Court is utterly inadequate to deal with the gravity and complexity of the cases it will be dealing with under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under the 1908 Act, the decisions of the District Court are suspect, unfortunately by virtue of the circumstances in which it has to hear cases, by virtue of the fact that parents are not given full legal aid and lawyers to fight their side of the case in court and to vindicate the rights of their clients' children.  I have seen this with my own eyes and I know it is wrong to attempt to give the District Court a huge new jurisdiction over the welfare of children because it simply will not exercise that jurisdiction.  It will fail in its duty to the children because it does not have the resources, expertise, time or inclination to do what is necessary in the interests of those children.  Above all &mdash; unlike the High Court &mdash; it is a court of limited jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State to tell me how a court of limited jurisdiction can decide, effectively, on a child's whole future on the basis of a half an hour in some unheated, half ruined building, erected in the 19th century and which is totally unsuited to its purpose.  Indeed, people would be lucky to have their case heard in such a building, it could be heard in the back room of a lounge bar or a rugby club in Sutton.  We must face up to that because we are giving the court jurisdiction but nothing to carry out it jurisdictional functions.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the Bill is scandalous and I do not say that lightly.  However, we must have reasonably workable law. It cannot be over-formal and you cannot increase lawyers' costs which would make it a field day for family lawyers.  As a group they are just like other lawyers; they will complicate many simple issues and fight others which perhaps should not be fought.  The simple fact is that the District Court is the worst court to decide these issues.  If we do not learn from that <Col N="173" /> in relation to family law, perhaps we will learn from it in relation to other bits of law.  Today is a prime example of a case where we allow a court to make a decision in relation to international relations, which is of far-reaching and fundamental importance, but we do not allow that court to decide whether a person charged with murder should be admitted to bail. We do not have a clear view of the seriousness and gravity of the powers we are giving to people in relation to children.</P>
    <P>We have never arrived at a view as to what the District Court should do yet, we are giving it more powers in this Bill and we will regret it in the long run.  Where a care order is made under this Bill in relation to a child, it is open to the court &mdash; unfortunately the District Court &mdash; to rescind that order but while the child is in care the health board are given very far-reaching powers to define the nature of that care.  It is up to the health boards to decide whether a child in respect of whom a care order has been made should be brought from, say, foster care into institutional care.  That is a decision the health board make under the direction of the Minister.  Is that a fair balance to hold for a child, that a bureaucrat, even one with the best of intentions towards such people, should decide whether a child goes from foster care to institutional care?</P>
    <P>Once a child goes into the care of the court system, it should require at least an independent person who is not looking at the pounds, shillings and pence of every decision, to decide where that child should be looked after and what should happen in relation to it.  Are we creating a cast of latter day Mr. Bumbles of Oliver Twist fame &mdash; the chief executive officers of the health boards &mdash; to make decisions in relation to children and, when a care order is made in respect of them, moving them from one kind of case to another in the light of financial pressures on them? I very much doubt that we are making the right decision in that regard.</P>
    <P>If you are creating a court system and a system of law to vindicate those children's rights, we should go the whole hog <Col N="174" /> and establish a family court of competent, well trained people and require that any decision as to whether a child moves from foster care to institutional care &mdash; when a care order has been made &mdash; is made by a group of people whose interests are not financial but dictated by the rights and interests of the child in question.</P>
    <P>Wherever we establish power in relation to a child we should also establish responsibility.  Where in this Bill is responsibility placed in respect of decisions made affecting the rights of little children?  If you intend setting up a statutory power to take a child into care and giving certain people the right to make an application to a court to secure an order that the child is taken into care and to put the child here or there as they see fit, you must also create some responsibility to the public on the part of the people who make those decisions. Who are the people responsible?  The chief executive officers of the health boards.  What function do they have in this kind of matter?  What training do they have in deciding whether a child should be put into the care of voluntary institution, in foster care or in an institution which the health board have established? What right is there to review their decisions?  What accountability do they owe to the child to make the correct decision?  Absolutely none.</P>
    <P>You can have all the advisory committees you like but, in the last analysis, they are statutorily not responsible because they do not make the decisions. You give the decision to a chief executive officer of a health board to make final decision of a huge kind in terms of a child's long term interest.  There is no accountability, no one to whom the chief executive officer must go and say: &ldquo;I believe this is the correct decision; I am taking that decision in the interests of the child and I am asking that my decision be validated&rdquo;.  I revert to the proposition that if one is creating a jurisdiction to make the care order, one owes it to the child to create a jurisdiction to supervise that care order, to ensure that in the long run that child's interests continue to be <Col N="175" /> vindicated.  Whatever status the judge may have when he takes his decision, under the provisions of this Bill, he effectively washes his hands of it.  He gives to that health board the right to make all decisions once a care order is made in relation to the child.  He does not exercise an ongoing jurisdiction.  Who does?  &mdash; a chief executive officer.  It is like saying the Secretary of a Department of State will decide what happens to a child.  He will have as much direct connection with a child in his care as has the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food to any individual farmer.  He will have no duty or responsibility to the child.  As long as he does not commit some legal error nothing he does will be capable of being reviewed or challenged.  In my view that is simply not adequate as a statutory mechanism to defend children's rights.</P>
    <P>For instance, it does not happen in relation to criminal lunatics when they go to Dundrum.  The High Court took back from the Minister for Justice the right of deciding when and if they should be allowed out of Dundrum and what should happen to them while they are there. But, in relation to a child, once a care order is made, the child is gone out of the supervision of the people who took the decision about its welfare into the responsibility of a chief executive officer. That is fundamentally wrong.  It is something which warrants review.  It is something which does not do the kind of justice that is within our power to do to vindicate the child's rights.</P>
    <P>Having said all of those things about this Bill, there are many of its provisions which are good, many provisions crying out for enactment, for example, the power to supervise pre-school services, the powers in relation to children's residential services, the powers in relation to taking some kind of proceeding to protect children.  I agree with many of the provisions of this Bill but I still believe that, in the last analysis, it is wanting as drafted.  It is half-baked in some respects. It requires to be debated section by section, with no guillotines of any kind, to get the correct law enacted for children. <Col N="176" /> Although it is urgent we have to do the right thing by those children.  There is no need to tell us that this must be done by some date in October, by midnight some night, that we must have all of the correct answers thought out during a 12-hour session, that the Minister's amendments only will go through unless we can be brief and contain ourselves.  That is not the right way to bring about a comprehensive legislative change after 80 years of inactivity.</P>
    <P>I hope the comments I am making will not be interpreted by the Minister or his advisers as being too sharply negative.  I believe they are based on at least one person's experience, that is my own, of some of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>In particular I would ask the Minister to take into account the wardship jurisdiction of High Court judges.  As of now they are entitled to make an order taking a child into their care.  How does that mesh in with the statutory provision here?  Does it supersede it?  If a parent applies to the High Court saying; &ldquo;My child is at risk from her father.  I want you to take over the control of this child and to take decisions in relation to its interests&rdquo;, how does the health board's statutory power to intervene in the District Court come into the balance there? Does it supersede it?  Is it inferior to it because the District Court is an inferior court?  Is it a right that goes into abeyance once the High Court exercises its wardship functions?  I have seen cases in which parents have gone to the High Court to save their children from the decisions of bureaucrats in a health board.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is this: in England recently there were cases in which children suspected of being sexually abused by adults were taken into local authority care.  In Ireland &mdash; under existing practice without legal foundation and under legal practice if this Bill becomes law &mdash; it will be for a health board to take decisions of that kind.  They will have to apply to a District Court in order to get any authority for their actions; they have not the right, as their counterparts had in England.  Under the provisions of this Bill only a garda is given <Col N="177" /> a right to take a child who, in emergency circumstances needs some kind of intervention without the intervention of the courts.  That is good.  I would ask the Minister this: in those English cases the most worrisome feature from a lot of people's point of view was that well-intentioned people were given very extensive powers &mdash; I believe they were well intentioned; I do not believe there were evil people on any side in that dispute &mdash; in relation to children with no safeguards to correct those powers where they went wrong.  I implore the Minister to take into account that, when he establishes machinery for resolving the differences between those rights, deciding how those rights should be mediated &mdash; the conflicting rights of the child and parents, the conflicting suspicions, be they of local authorities in England or health boards here as to whether a child's welfare is being properly looked after, there must be adequate safeguards built-in. When one establishes machinery to adjudicate on those issues &mdash; and they are issues which have to be adjudicated on no matter how informal the provisions of the Bill may render the adjudicatory process &mdash; one must build into them adequate safeguards for the child whose interests are paramount.  One must build into them adequate safeguards for parents against whom it has always been said that it is easy to make an accusation but much more difficult to disprove a negative.  In all those circumstances one must put in place legislation that ensures fairly and squarely not merely that the first order made in respect of the child is the proper one but that the child's interests thereafter are properly looked after.</P>
    <P>The major defect of this Bill is that while it does take the first serious step &mdash; it does say that a care order cannot be made at the instance of a bureaucrat, an interested social worker, a prejudiced parent or whoever &mdash; once that order is made it is like the legislative guillotine, it comes down and that is it.  Thereafter that child has gone into a different world, <Col N="178" /> one in which fundamental decisions concerning its welfare are taken by a bureaucratic, non-adjudicatory mechanism, one in which the chief executive officer of a health board, his advisory committee and the child welfare officers employed by the health board effectively have the upper hand in deciding that child's interests. That is wrong.  We should strike a balance which gives the child the right to be separately represented in these proceedings. Sometimes there are cases in which the health board think they are representing the child's interests against those of the parent but they are not; they are trampling down the child's interests.  The Minister should do something far more radical in this respect.  Whatever court &mdash; I hope it will not be the District Court &mdash; is given jurisdiction to make an order it should be given a duty to ensure that that order not only was made but continues to be operated in the interests of the child.  That is the fundamental weakness of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Having said all of that I am hoping that child welfare agencies, bodies, people in the community at large, will study the provisions of this Bill and think long and hard about their implications.  They are far from perfect now and require considerable reformation and legislative attention to render the Bill overall a proper piece of child legislation.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on having done something after 80 years when so much is required to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this legislation for debate in the House and I take on board the remarks of the previous two speakers. It has become clear in the one and a half hours during which we have been debating this issue that 80 years of neglect cannot be easily resolved in one fell swoop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the House approach things from different perspectives.  We all welcome the fact that the debate is taking place. The first message that has come across is that the debate must be long and meticulous and all the aspects of the child care must be taken into account, not only legal <Col N="179" /> aspects but aspects relating to the caring agencies and the families of children who also have an opinion to express.  This legislation is the culmination of 20 years of debate about reforming legislation relating to services for children.  The debate was initiated by the Tuairim Committee report of 1966 and developed by the Kennedy report of 1970, established by the Minister for Education, the Task Force on Child Care Services Report of 1981 established by the Minister for Health and the contribution of a myriad of voluntary organisations in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>There have been two previous dry runs at this legislation, the first published by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Barry Desmond, the Child Care and Protection Bill, 1987, which progressed to Committee Stage, and a modified Bill published by the Labour Party last year, the Children Care and Protection Bill, 1987. There have been many comments on all these pieces of legislation.  Although we need to take a measured response and a very slow and analytical approach to enacting legislation in this very sensitive and important area, we must hear some alarm bells ringing when listening to the comments of a practising lawyer who has indicated that at least some members of the High Court are currently dissatisfied that there is any legal basis now for health boards to intervene in cases of need.  That should spur us on to look with great care at this legislation.  While we need to be careful, we need to be expeditious in moving forward.</P>
    <P>In looking at the main purposes of the Bill we see in the explanatory memorandum that the main provisions of the Bill are:</P>
    <P>(i)  the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection;</P>
    <P>(ii)  strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services;</P>
    <P>(iii)  improved procedures to faciliate <Col N="180" /> immediate intervention by health boards and the Gardaí where children are in serious danger;</P>
    <P>(iv)  revised provisions to enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, ill treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk in the care of or under the supervision of health boards;</P>
    <P>(v)  introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services;</P>
    <P>(vi)  revised provisions in relation to the inspection and approval of residential centres for children.</P>
    <P>While all these things are welcome and are valuable, the first striking problem that arises relates to resources.  Where are the financial resources and the personnel resources to be provided?  They are not provided now.  I listened with some muted cynicism to a previous contribution which underlined the same difficulties as I have now, in terms of the lack of resources to health boards at a time when we are savaging moneys available to health boards, and when only yesterday senior consultants in one of our national hospitals had to resort to the media to underline the crisis that exists in our health services.  This is reflected in every aspect of health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to the community care services as the Cinderella of the health services because they traditionally got less resources than the acute general hospitals.  We are now going to devolve onto the health boards a myriad of new responsibilities without giving them any extra resources.  In fact, as promised by the present Administration, we will further deprive the health boards of resources.  Deputies in contact with the health boards know only too well that it is impossible for health boards to meet their present statutory duties.  We all know of cases where children are at risk.  In one case I contacted the chief medical officer in my own county to find out what could be done for one vulnerable child who was walking the streets of a town in the south east and I <Col N="181" /> was told there was no place for that child to be placed, that there was no suitable accommodation to be found.  Where is the accommodation?  Where are the resources and personnel to be found after the enactment of this important legislation? The already inadequate resources are to be further reduced.</P>
    <P>With cynicism I listened to the representative of the Progressive Democrats who take credit for creating the climate, in the mould breaking tradition they have set for themselves, for financial rectitude. They take credit from the fact that this new so-called realism means that we have to cut health expenditure and expenditure on the caring services.  They cannot have it both ways.  They cannot come into this House and argue in favour of expenditure when it suits them and go outside and hold themselves up as the doyen of financial rectitude and cutbacks and say that is the correct approach.  So much of the cant that passes for politics in this country now is emanating from that source.  People who support the principle of cutting public expenditure are in favour of expenditure when it suits.  That sort of hypocrisy must be nailed instantly. I hope the Minister, when replying to the Second Stage debate will give us some hope that resources required to meet the requirements of the new duties imposed on the health boards by this legislation will be provided by him and his Department. What passes for an adequate community care service is a very thin sticking plaster on a very sore wound.</P>
    <P>In the Bill one of the first things the Minister does, and it is something I heartly welcome, is that he clarifies and raises the age of a child.  Deputy Flaherty commented on the recent Focus Point and Streetwise survey done on homelessness. One of the shocking aspects of that report was that whereas many of us felt that homelessness was a problem merely for the very large contributions and that it did not reach into the provincial towns, that view was scotched by this report which highlighted in a stark and real way the fact that homelessness exists all over the country, and that there are children between the ages of 15 and <Col N="182" /> 18 caught in a limbo where there is no legal responsibility for them.  I heartily welcome the age increase incorporated into the legislation before us tonight.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives responsibility to health boards to promote the welfare of children. This is a very positive duty imposed on them.  It will force health boards to clarify their own thinking on what services they should provide for children and the real needs of children at a very difficult time.  It is amazing to think that the prime legislation that we use today to reflect our views on the needs and rights of children is 80 years old at a time when almost all the modern inventions that we regard as normal would have been unimaginable. The pressures and the society that exists now are so vastly different from that bygone age that it is not surprising that we have so many anomalies that need to be corrected by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on providing support and assistance so that children can remain in the home is a very important and significant issue.  Some pilot schemes have been undertaken in various parts of the country and I have more than a passing familiarity with one such scheme, which is the Wexford family centre.  The aim of the Wexford family centre &mdash; and the town of Wexford was very lucky to have such a centre &mdash; was to look in a holistic way at the needs of vulnerable families, to reach out to those families, to provide the support needed to allow children to remain and to thrive in the family set-up, to involve from the toddler to the parents themselves in support and encouragement. These are expensive types of out-reach projects.  Family support services exist throughout the United Kingdom but they are rather exceptional here.  I hope the UK models and the examples that have been piloted in this country could be built upon.  As a former primary schoolteacher I know the value of this support but we are getting back once again to the essential and the kernel problem of funding.  It was my view that this type of service which was quite exceptional was almost &mdash; and I do not want to sound disparaging of health <Col N="183" /> boards &mdash; an embarrassment to a health board which simply could not match it anywhere else.  They were afraid that it simply highlighted the inadequacies in other regions, in other districts and in other towns.  They were afraid that if this particular project was successful that the demands would overwhelm them.  If children can be maintained in the home, if support can be provided to enable them to develop in safety, to enable them to mature and to be educated and if you can socialise the parents &mdash; which is often a basic but an essential prerequisite to establishing a proper home background &mdash; and educate them on hygiene, food management and so on, that is not only a very desirable achievement not only from the social perspective but also economically. I do not know how a cost analysis of the benefits can be done but I believe that money spent on prevention, support and care at the foundation level saves money in remedial education, in justice expenditure and in policing at a later stage in life.  I am totally committed and supportive of the notion of family support services.  I hope that the Minister would not only have a nodding acquaintance with them and say: &ldquo;Yes, they are a good entity, it is a good idea&rdquo;, but say that this is a policy decision of his Government and of his administration and that he will put money into supporting out-reach projects that give comfort and succour to a family that is vulnerable and in need.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 health boards have a right to receive into care, without reference to the courts, certain categories of children.  In subsection (2) of that section I note that the issue of the constitutionality of all our dealings with children comes into focus in the first instance. Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall authorise a health board to take a child into its care against the wishes of its parents or of any person acting in <i>loco parentis</i> or to maintain him in its care under this section if its parents or any such <Col N="184" /> person wish or wishes to resume care of him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty made a cogent case that throughout the Bill the view taken has been the minimalist one, that we pull back our horns if there is a threat of a High Court decision in relation to the constitutionality of any of our actions.  I believe it is time we made the definitions first, that we decided what was the desirable objective, in the first instance, and then set about whatever mechanism is required to enact that desirable objective. If a constitutional challenge has to be backed away from and if we are backing away from something which we feel is right, that is a fundamental mistake.  If we need to have a referendum on an issue let us face that too.  Our first duty must be to get the rights of the child vindicated and to make sure that in any case that what is best for the development of the child is enacted into legislation by us.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of child care advisory committees. I have no difficulty in supporting the notion of a child care advisory committee at local level, but it is a point of regret that the national children's council which was requested by all the caring agencies and all those involved with children has not materialised in this legislation. I do not see any justification for not having it, even if it had a fixed term of reference for a short period to focus on the whole area of the needs of children in modern society and the sort of provision that is needed for children both legislatively and probably more important, practically on the ground in each health board region.  I would ask the Minister to think again on that issue and perhaps he would see fit to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to establish a national children's council, even if that were to be on a fixed term basis.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV contain the core issues, enabling a garda in the first instance, to remove without warrant to a place of safety a child who had been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused and who is in immediate danger.  That is a <Col N="185" /> very important new power.  I listened with interest to the lawyers' perspective, and the general view that wherever possible recourse should be made to the courts to allow them to make a balanced decision is a crucial mechanism to have enacted.  Where a child is imminently and immediately in danger it is important that somebody would have the legal right and the legal wherewithal to remove that child from danger.  The limit of eight days will put pressure on health boards and I am interested in talking this out because no bureaucratic institution moves with alarming speed.  I am fearful that eight days is a very short time for a health board to prepare a case for the District Court.  Perhaps we can think about this again.  Obviously, we are striking a balance between the rights of parents to regain possession of a child and the risk that, simply because of the slowness of bureaucracy, a child might be handed back into a place of danger because the health board would not be able to get their act together with enough speed.</P>
    <P>In relation to care proceedings, section 14 of the Bill imposes a statutory duty on a health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order whenever it appears to the board that the conditions required for the making of an order exist in respect of a child.  Section 15 provides for the gounds where a care order can be applied.  The differences between these grounds and those in the previous two Bills I have mentioned, the Children (Care and Protection) Bills, 1985 and 1987, are worth looking at.  In the Minister's Bill the grounds are: (a) the child has been or is being assaulted, ill treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused (b) the child's health, development or well-being has been or is being avoidable impaired or seriously neglected (c) there are reasonable grounds for believing his health, development or well-being is likely to be avoidably impaired or seriously neglected.</P>
    <P>Let me by way of contrast read into the record the grounds in the Bill published by the Labour Party last year which were far broader in scope.  Under section <Col N="186" /> 45 (2) of the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1987 a child may be the subject of care proceedings if any of the following conditions is satisfied with respect to him: (a) he has been or is being ill-treated, neglected or assaulted (b) he is or has been under the care of a parent or guardian who does not exercise proper guardianship or who has otherwise received or is receiving inadequate care such as to cause or be likely to cause him physical or mental suffering or injury to his health or to impair substantially his proper development (c) his parent or guardian is not capable of exercising proper guardianship (d) he has been or is being sexually abused (e) any of the offences mentioned in the Second Schedule has been committed in respect of him. A set of offences which I will not read out are set down in the Second Schedule to that Bill.  I continue: (f) he is a member of the same household as a person who has been convicted of an offence mentioned in the Second Schedule (g) the court or another court has found that any of the above conditions is or was satisfied in the case of another child who is or was a member of the household to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>The valid point made about more progressive thinking in relation to where a child is vulnerable, abused or in danger of being abused is that you do not remove the child but you remove the offender, the abuser.  We might think again about that, although I have no difficulty at all in accepting that perhaps the definitions as boiled down or synthesised in the Bill before us may well cover all the eventualities. I hope the Minister will in his Second Stage wind-up assure us that all the eventualities envisaged in the earlier Bills will be covered by his more succinct provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill goes on to the provision of supervision orders, a very important innovative arrangement where a child can be allowed to stay in his own home setting.  I think we have a consensus view from everybody that the ideal is for a family supportive background, a family unit to be maintained where that is possible and practicable.  Under the terms <Col N="187" /> of the supervision order obviously you maintain the child in his home environment and you allow for the regular monitoring of that child.  Again, we cannot escape the difficulties.  We have seen horrific cases in the UK in the past year where children were technically being supervised by the local area health authority and horrendous damage was done to them and in some cases the child was murdered.</P>
    <P>If you are going to devolve this sort of authority on to a local health board you must provide the wherewithal to carry out adequate supervision.  You must provide the money and the trained personnel. If you allow a child who is vulnerable to stay in the home background and you do not provide the resources for the adequate monitoring of that child, you are doing a tremendous disservice to the interests of that child who is vulnerable and dependent on us to vindicate his rights and maintain his integrity.  We need an assurance if any of these provisions are to work that adequate resources, funding and trained personnel will be provided in order for these provisions to be carried out properly.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill deals with the jurisdiction of the District Court.  We have had a rather disparaging analysis of the role, function and competence of the District Court by a previous speaker and I do not intend to add to that.  I do not have that Deputy's disparaging view of either the District Court or the bureaucratic nature of health boards.  Although the central authority of health boards is vested in the CEOs, the boards are staffed generally by a great number of caring, competent professional people whose advice and experience I would place far more faith in than the legal experience and competence of some lawyers to determine the correct decisions in relation to children.  I would prefer decisions in relation to the rights and future of children to be made by competent child care specialists rather than by lawyers or judges whose knowledge of <Col N="188" /> the needs of children and whose competence and professional training in that area would be lacking.</P>
    <P>However, I want to focus on the need for family courts, for children's courts, a request made by many of the reviews I have cited.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate to us that they will be the subject of separate legislation.  He did not mention it in his speech.  Perhaps he intends to introduce another Bill to allow for family courts or perhaps his colleague, the Minister for Justice, will promote that legislation.  I, and I think anybody who has been involved at any level with the rights and needs of children, accept that the informality, the professional competence and the expertise of specialist family courts are required if we are to do justice to the rights and needs of children. I do not know why we have not addressed that but I presume the only justification for not doing so is lack of money.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to give us some indication that family courts will be established.  A recommendation to establish such courts was contained in the Kennedy report published in 1970 and in the report of the Task Force in 1981.  It is 18 years since the Kennedy report was published but we have not acted on its recommendations.  Too often we allow reports to build up and gather dust on shelves.  I could give a long list of such reports but if we are serious about how we treat the issue of the rights of children, if we are serious about providing for the best intentions of children we must establish a framework in which correct and just decisions are made.  I do not share the disparaging view of the District Court expressed by another Member, although it is not the ideal place for important decisions on the future of children to be made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the informality that is to be introduced under the Bill but it is not nearly enough.  It is not enough to have informality, it is not enough not to compel the child to be present and it is not enough to hold care proceedings in private.  What is important is that the judge making the decision should have a specialist knowledge of and training in <Col N="189" /> the complex area of the rights and needs of children and the demands of children in the times we live.  I hope, and pray, that the Minister will give consideration to that matter and will be able to tell us that he will use another piece of legislation if not this Bill to establish those much vaunted and often talked about but yet to materialise courts.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with the arrangements which may be made by health boards in looking after children in their care. However, we will have to wait for the Minister to introduce his regulations under the Bill.  Always in such cases one is inclined to say that it would be nice to have the regulations published in tandem with the Bill so that the House can debate them directly rather than having enabling legislation allowing the Minister to make provision subsequent to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains a very important new development.  For the first time some regulations will be brought into the area of pre-school services.  I have always believed that the State should provide a proper pre-school service.  In the last ten to 15 years there has been a mushroom growth of playschools and pre-schools of variable character.  Some are excellent, some are operated and managed by competent and conscientious individuals who have a background in education or child care and provide excellent facilities. Others are run in garages or in accommodation that factory workers would not be allowed work in because it would be illegal under the factories Acts.  For the first time we are putting down a framework for legislative action in relation to maintaining standards for little children who attend pre-school classes, who are expected to spend hours each day often in conditions which are not acceptable. We have to tackle the huge variety of standards.  The quality of some of the personnel who operate pre-schools should be given some legislative attention. This may be the prerogative of the Minister for Education rather than the Minister for Health but there is no doubt that some minimum standards should be applied to those who offer pre-school <Col N="190" /> educational facilities to those who are under the compulsory school attendance age.</P>
    <P>In many progressive societies the State has a comprehensive view of the educational needs of children.  It is clear that the formative years of a child, from two-and-a-half to three, can be crucial in the future development of that child.  I have had experience of some children attending school for the first time at between six and seven years who have not had pre-school experience being far behind those who start school at five after one year or two years in pre-school.  They are well in advance of the late starter.  We are compounding an inequality because invariably it is the children of the parents who can afford to pay who have the best standard of pre-school education available to them.  There is a compelling and urgent logic in this State making provision for the total education needs of all our children.  If we give a leg-up to a section of the community who can afford it we are further compounding inequalities. Children starting school at six or six-and-a-half years are often socially retarded and linguistically backward because they have not had the experience of developed speech.  We need to address the whole area of pre-school.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in Part VI as a first step in providing the very minimum, adequate structures, ventilation and so on, but we have a long way to go before we can clap ourselves on the back and say that all the needs of our children are adequately catered for.  Part VII updates the arrangements for the inspection and supervision of residential centres for children. The crucial question is, who is going to do this work?  Will the Minister provide the staff or will he give the health boards the money to enable them carry out this work?  If he does not do so, that provision will not be implemented and we will be making a mockery of the Bill.  We are devolving roles to health boards right, left and centre thinking that we are doing a marvellous job but we are not providing the money or personnel to carry out the duties placed upon those boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> I am sure most Members looked askance at section 57 which provides for the abolition of the death penalty in respect of crimes committed by persons under 18 years.  I do not think the House will have any difficulty in removing the death penalty for such cases from the Statute Book. Indeed, we should have gone further and abolished the death penalty altogether in this State.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses a serious subject, one that has caused most of us a lot of concern in recent years.  I am referring to the increasing abuse of solvents by children. I recognise that the Minister has a difficulty in regard to this because while we have to allow children to build model aeroplanes and the like we must face up to the fact that the substances used to glue the parts of such models together can be abused.  We have the other level of the pendulum.  In the streets of our capital city, and indeed in the streets of other towns, there is blatant abuse of solvents by young children who appear on the streets with bags of glue and are in a totally intoxicated state.  There must be some responsibility on premises and individuals who sell substances like that to children.  Obviously retailers have some discretion.  They know in many instances that somebody coming in for four cans of a certain glue is not going to make model aeroplanes.  There is a need and an urgent necessity to have penalties imposed upon those whose only concern is commercial gain and who want to simply ignore the fact that they are causing untold hardship and damage to the lives of young children.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for the release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, and for a pardon in respect of the Maguire Seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of moving this motion here tonight.  Many people may, and I am sure will, ask in the coming weeks why, at this time, we in the Labour Party choose to use our Private Members' time to move this motion.  Many people may feel that this issue has been decided upon, judged upon, tried and retried.  With the economic difficulties this country is facing at present, the savage cutbacks in health and education, the unemployment which is rising on a constant basis and indeed emigration, many people may ask why this motion is being taken at this time. I believe very strongly, and I am fully supported by my party in that belief, that there is a genuine and a grave need to highlight the plight of the individuals involved in the case contained in the motion.  They are Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power and Johnny Walker, known as the Birmingham Six; the Guildford Four, Gerard Conlon, Paul <Col N="193" /> Hill, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong, and also Annie Maguire and her family.</P>
    <P>Those people must not be forgotten and that is why we are moving this motion here this evening.  They must not be forgotten by this House, by the public at large or by any person who has at least a minimum interest in seeing justice being done.  Sadly, if they are forgotten by this House or outside of this House in the Republic or in Northern Ireland, indeed if they are forgotten by the many people in England who have been fighting their cause, if we fail to keep them in the forefront of our deliberations, then their future is indeed a very bleak one.  In fact, to put it in those terms may be an understatement.  If they are forgotten by this House they have no future and that is the reality.  They will remain condemned by an intransigent system which is not prepared to allow for or to accept that mistakes have been made, that it is quite usual for mistakes to be made, that it is indeed human for mistakes to be made.  In these cases, despite enormous evidence to the contrary, evidence which will stand up in normal courts of justice, the British system of justice which, as I have said, has been totally intransigent in its treatment of Irish cases in the past number of years, will not make any allowances or admit that mistakes can and have been made.</P>
    <P>I recall some months ago discussing the case of the Birmingham Six with one of the Queen's Counsel, one of the senior lawyers involved in their appeal which was heard prior to Christmas, during that hearing.  He stated to me in no uncertain terms, indeed he stated very bluntly, that all through the hearing of that appeal an unreal atmosphere pervaded that trial. The three judges never at any time appeared willing to allow any benefit of the doubt to the appellants' lawyers and they acted throughout the hearing in a totally hostile and prejudicial manner to the basic rights of the Birmingham Six.</P>
    <P>The judges in question, who seemed to have been hand-picked with a particular purpose in mind, never seemed to have an open mind on the matters on which <Col N="194" /> they were deciding.  In the attribution of weight to the evidence which was put before them, serious weight was given freely and lavishly to the Crown witnesses' evidence despite huge inconsistencies in the presentation of the prosecution case and many obvious inferences of collusion which were exposed on the part of Crown witnesses.  On the other hand, at all times the judges seemed to over-step the mark in their efforts to undermine the defence lawyers' presentation of the case for the appellants and in putting forward evidence on behalf of the appellants.  The Queen's Counsel further concluded that he could never, for one second during that long hearing which went on for many weeks, feel that those people were going to get a break or even get a whiff of fair play from the Judiciary.  It was, he said, beyond his comprehension and it rocked any belief which he had as a lawyer of many years' experience in trial cases and as an experienced Queen's Counsel in the system of justice in Britain.</P>
    <P>I am sure, in speaking in this House tonight, that there are many people in the Establishment in Britain who would wish that the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and Annie Maguire and her family would just go away and be conveniently forgotten about, with all the public disquiet in relation to them which exists on this island and generally throughout Britain, perhaps more so in the Irish community but also among civil libertarians and those concerned to see that justice is done.  Given the unanswered questions, the uncertainties, the wholesale disrespect for justice and values, if not the downright sham in relation to these cases, I can safely say that these cases as they stand will not go away, in fact they will not be allowed to go away.  As I said at the outset, if we were to allow those cases to go away, then we, the Members of the Government and Opposition Parties, could be accused of reneging on the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>In presenting this motion this evening there is a great opportunity for us as the elected representatives of the people in <Col N="195" /> the Republic to represent a unanimous view on the subject before us.  It is interesting to see that, on the Order Paper, there is a very similar motion in the names of a number of Government Deputies.  In the past there was an opportunity for this House to take a unanimous view on an urgent matter concerning our relations with the British Government.  That was in 1986 when, as Minister for Energy, I agreed to accept a Fianna Fáil resolution calling for the closure of Sellafield.  There was unanimity in the House on that occasion and there was a rare sense that the House should combine for a worthwhile purpose.  Of course, there are those who ask, what did we achieve by that unanimity because despite that unanimity, Sellafield is still open and is still a threat to the health and welfare of our people.  I would say those cynics missed the point.</P>
    <P>The moral value of any unanimous decision we make is obviously impossible to estimate.  The very fact that by our decision we can bring hope and courage to people who must often, if not always, be on the brink of despair, ought to be enough motivation for us this evening and tomorrow evening when the matter will be decided to seek to bring about that unanimity I am talking about.  Of course, it can do much more than that. If we, the combined Opposition parties and the Government, speak with one voice on this issue, then our people will be seen to be speaking with one voice and the moral pressure that can be brought to bear by our Government with the united voice of this Parliament behind them is very considerable.  We have friends all over the world, and we have called on those friends on many occasions in the recent past and I believe those people will be singularly impressed by the unanimity of any decision which we might make in this House.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it is very important that the Progressive Democrats, the only party which put down an amendment to our motion, consider the contents of the motion and their amendment and, if in the collective wisdom of their party they <Col N="196" /> can find the resolution to withdraw that amendment, I believe they would serve the purpose we are seeking to serve rather than the possibility, indeed the high probability, that this House will divide.  In the normal course of events it is not the sort of amendment I would object to, but I believe the Progressive Democrats can look at that in another perspective.  I make a public appeal to them through their spokesperson, to indicate that the matter will be considered further by their party if the opportunity arises before the vote is cast, if it has to be cast at 8.30 p.m. tomorrow because we would be far more effective and the signal we send out from this House in relation to these matters would be far clearer to the people of this country, to the people in Britain and to the many friends we have throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The details of these cases are well known and well documented in the western world and I believe there is very little disagreement in this house about them. Discussions have been going on for some weeks, letters have been circulated and correspondence has emanated from all the parties to highlight this matter before the summer recess.  The sad fact is that with the House due to rise in a matter of weeks, this is probably the last opportunity we, as a House of Parliament, will have to give vent to our feelings on the many issues involved.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we express our sentiments as simply as possible.  We want to send a very clear and specific signal to those in authority.  I accept that there are differences in background, evidence and circumstances in the cases covered by this motion, but primarily and fundamentally, these are technicalities. At bottom, as I hope to show, all these cases have one thing in common &mdash; they are all involved in individuals who, in the opinion of the great majority of people, are suffering deep injustice.  It is important that in seeking to give expression to our sense of justice, to the sense of justice ingrained in us, that we should avoid clouding the issue with further technicalities.</P>
    <P>We have debated the topics which are <Col N="197" /> the subject of this motion in general in this House and in many fora outside and we have debated them in specific terms on a number of occasions in the recent past.  Often our discussions have generated a great deal of heat not only in this Chamber but in party rooms.  At the end of all the heat and all the argument, ten people remain in jail and a cloud hangs over the lives of Annie Maguire and her family.  In a very real sense everyone covered by the motion before the House is carrying a life sentence; some will spend the rest of their lives in jail unless something is done, and some will live with the finger of suspicion always pointing at them.</P>
    <P>Looking at the weaknesses in the cases presented against them, ironically, none of them has been found guilty beyond a reasonable shadow of doubt.  That, at least, is the view of a great many people in this country and outside this country. I will quote a remark made by Roy Jenkins, Home Secretary at the time of the bombing and the convictions.  He said:</P>
    <P>The new evidence I have seen would be sufficient to create in my mind what's sometimes called a lurking doubt that the convictions in these cases were safe.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Error of Judgement</i> a book published by Chris Mullin.  Great weight has to be attributed to that remark by Roy Jenkins and it is one of which I hope the establishment will take heed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have to accept that people were appalled, not only in Britain, by the horrible crimes which led to the incarceration of these people.  I recall being in England in 1974 at the time of the Birmingham bombs and one was embarrassed by the implication that these bombs were set by Irish people and that the mayhem was caused by people who said it was in the cause of Irish unity and nationalism. There was an understandably hostile and bitter attitude in Britain at that time towards Irish people and all things Irish. <Col N="198" /> We must not, however, allow that to cloud the issue.  We must not allow the understandable reaction of a community to horrific crimes to lead in conviction at all cost.  That must never be the position in civilised society.  People who hold no truck with violence or with the Provisional IRA believe that an injustice has been done.  All of us in this House know that these cases hang like a black cloud over the further development of the best possible relations between our two countries. We all believe that the misery of these people should be brought to an end for its own sake.  Others have suffered too, the countless victims of the crimes for which the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four are in jail.  For many of them the suffering caused by the loss of a loved one will never end but that suffering will not be eased by the continued incarceration of innocent people.</P>
    <P>The question is often posed: are they innocent?  I have posed that question myself on many occasions when reading about these cases and trying to get to the bottom of them.  The answer to that question is, I suppose, that we will never know for sure, but I believe, as do many, if not most, other Deputies, that they are not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  On that basis they remain entitled to our presumption of their innocence.</P>
    <P>Some people would go much further than I have gone.  Some believe absolutely and unequivocably in the innocence of all these people.  A very persuasive case has been made for the Birmingham Six by Chris Mullin, MP.  He claims that not only are the Birmingham Six totally innocent but that he knows the identity of those who committed the crimes in 1974.  In some ways this gives rise to the saddest irony of all.  The Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four have been used as a recruiting weapon by the Provisional IRA ever since they were put in jail.  The people who must carry ultimate responsibility for the crimes involved, and a great many more crimes besides, parade the innocence of the ten people involved as one more weapon in their propaganda armoury.  It is even possible that some young people have joined the Provisional <Col N="199" /> IRA and have participated in some of their most horrible and heinous crimes because of the poison which has been spread about British justice arising from these cases.  If there is a more powerful argument for ending the misery of the Birmingham Six, I do not know what it is.</P>
    <P>It is sufficient for us to argue that these cases have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  That ought to be sufficient too for the Establishment in Britain and the British authorities.  The very phrase &ldquo;beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; is one of the cornerstones of the British system of justice.  It is a concept we too have enshrined in our law as one of the most valuable and long standing parts of the legal standards which we inherited from the British system.</P>
    <P>An editorial from <i>The Times</i> is quoted by Chris Mullin in his book, <i>Error of Judgement</i>.  This editorial was written immediately after the trial of the Birmingham Six under the heading <i>Justice for the Birmingham Bombers</i> and states:</P>
    <P>One of the disturbing features of this case... has been the evidence that at some stage (the bombers) were beaten up.  While men convicted of such outrages deserve no sympathy, they had the right to fair and proper treatment. One of the most critical tests of any judicial system is that standards are upheld to the full for those least deserving sympathy.  The final judgement on this whole affair ought to be that justice was done to and for these men.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to put it in better terms than the strong language used by <i>The Times</i> editorial.  The whole system was put on trial in relation to the convictions which were obtained.  The whole system stands indicted in relation to what has been done.</P>
    <P>How then did it happen, given the weight of those types of statement, that these ten men are now in jail and may remain there for the rest of their lives? In the case of the Birmingham Six it was a combination of circumstances: a police officer who appears to have convinced <Col N="200" /> himself almost on sight that he had the men he wanted; a disreputable scientist carrying out discredited tests; collusion between the two of them for many years; and confessions extracted under circumstances of brutality.  I would refer to a very graphic description of a beating at page 59 of <i>Error of Judgement</i>.  The man concerned was Billy Walker and his statement reads as follows:</P>
    <P>As I entered the room somebody else behind kicked me on the base of the spine.  I yelled out.  There were three officers in the room and they all started hitting me with their fists and kicking me.  I was pushed and kicked from one officer to the other.  One of them said, &ldquo;I've a good mind to throw your... body into the Irish Sea.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one of many graphic descriptions of the treatment which these people received while in custody.  What sort of a climate was being created in relation to the detaining of these people in custody? It was understandable that there was a hostile atmosphere in Britain, perhaps nowhere more than in the police force. The rage which was spread across the nation was such that the public called out for convictions.  I would believe that the vast majority of that public which was outraged at what happened in Birmingham in November 1974 would not want to have convictions at any cost.  The average British citizen would want to see fair play in relation to the protection of innocent people and would want to see that a miscarriage of justice did not take place.</P>
    <P>Very unconvincing circumstances combined to lead to a conviction during the original trial.  This climate was developed by a public which had been traumatised and was crying out for revenge.  Deep hostility existing to all things Irish, and I know that hostility existed because I experienced it.  At the same time I did not consider it understandable but given the outrageous act which had been perpetrated on the British people perhaps that hostility can be understood better in retrospect.  There was also a sense of enormous pressure on the West Midlands <Col N="201" /> police force to capture somebody, to bring somebody to trial and to have somebody convicted for the crime that had taken place.  I can understand, with the passage of time, the hostility that these acts engendered in the British public at that time.  There should be a two-way process.  Perhaps the British public and, more to the point, the British Establishment could also, with the passage of time, look at these events more dispassionately. It ought to be possible for the British judiciary, for the Establishment in Britain, to admit that mistakes were made.</P>
    <P>None of us can claim infallibility.  In matters of law, the system of justice as we have known it, as it has developed over the years &mdash; though for many centuries it could hardly have been described as justice in this country &mdash; has always been that it is better for 99 guilty people to go free than that one innocent person be convicted of a crime he or she did not commit.  In the case of the Birmingham Six I believe strongly that more than a mistake was made.  In order to make the evidence fit the conclusion that was sought it was necessary to develop a story.  That story grew into a conspiracy as more and more people became involved in hiding the truth about the beatings and the mistreatment and soon, inevitably, it became impossible for the Establishment to admit that there had been a miscarriage of justice.  To do so would have exposed the whole system, and this was recognised and accepted by Lord Denning who was quoted at page 216 of <i>Error of Judgement</i> by Chris Mullin.  I agree wholeheartedly with Mullin's assessment of Lord Denning's judgement when he said that Lord Denning appeared to be more concerned with the consequences for the Government and the police than with due process of law.  Lord Denning said:</P>
    <P>Just consider the course of events if this action is allowed to proceed to trial.  If the six men fail, it will mean that much time and money will have been expended by many people for no good purpose.  If the six men win, it <Col N="202" /> will mean that the police were guilty of perjury, that they were guilty of violence and threats, that the confessions were involuntary and were improperly admitted in evidence and that the convictions were erroneous. That would mean the Home Secretary would either have to recommend they be pardoned or he would have to remit the case to the Court of Appeal.  This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would say: It cannot be right that these actions should go any further.</P>
    <P>Sadly, for a man who made an enormous contribution to the development of law in England in the past half century, I would say that in his case experience and wisdom were not descending upon him with age.  He showed in fact that his judgement, in his later years, was severely impaired.</P>
    <P>In some respects the case of the Guilford Four is even worse than that which I have outlined in the case of the Birmingham Six.  In that case there was not even a shred of forensic evidence.  Convictions were secured exclusively on the basis of confessions, confessions which had and have all the appearance of being forced out of them.  In the past number of years there have been many instances of wrong-doing in our relations with the British Government.  As yesterday's events in Portlaoise show, not all the blame can be attributed to the British. We have been guilty of our own lapses, our own misjudgments and, perhaps, of insensitive handling of certain situations, but the conclusion in relation to these matters, the bottom line, is that two wrongs never make a right.</P>
    <P>Now with the possibility of dialogue with the British Government being perhaps stronger than it has been for the past number of years perhaps there is an opportunity for an improvement in relations between the two Governments and between the two peoples on both islands.  That also presents an opportunity to the British Government.  If they would, for once, get down off their high horse and make a gesture of compassion, <Col N="203" /> of generosity, it would have the effect of being a healing step of enormous proportions. I do not believe there will be a better opportunity for the British Government to show that it can be a generous Government, that in relation to dealing with matters such as I have outlined in this House they can show clemency.  Sadly, there have been no indications that they are about to do this.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his meeting of recent days with the Home Secretary in Britain.  I particularly commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his return to duty after his illness for taking these matters up again as a matter of urgency.  I know from experience that his task of convincing the British Government of something that he and his party believe strongly in &mdash; and that belief is echoed in the motion on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies Kitt, Andrews and others &mdash; that there has been a miscarriage of justice, is difficult. However, there is a golden opportunity and I believe it is not stretching the imagination or the challenge to the British Government to look in a dispassionate manner, given the passage of time, at the cases we have been discussing in this House.  I appeal to our Government to keep up the pressure on the British Government in a very reasonable and well thought out manner as they have been doing, so that all shades of opinion in this House can support the motion and that justice can be done for the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and Annie Maguire and her family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, for his efforts on behalf of these people.  In my short term here I have been most impressed that, despite his illness, he has always been most helpful and supportive. I, too, welcome his return to Iveagh House.  I am aware that as recently as yesterday our Ambassador raised these cases with the British Home Office.  Due to the restraints of time, I shall deal primarily with the case of the Birmingham <Col N="204" /> Six.  I am aware that my colleague with whom I am sharing time will be dealing with the cases against the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven.</P>
      <P>It used to be said of British justice that it was based on, among other things, the principle that it is better that 100 guilty men go free than that one man be wrongly punished.  Nowadays, there are many who would say that it is based on a different principle, the principle that it is better that six innocent men remain in prison than that one guilty policeman, or one wrongful conviction be quashed, or one politician be embarrassed.</P>
      <P>What happened in 1974 is understandable, as Deputy Spring pointed out. The fact that we can understand it does not make it excusable and certainly can never excuse the extraordinary contortions of the English Establishment to pretend that justice was done in the aftermath of the bombings.  I say that it is understandable because, knowing the revulsion that the bombings caused in this country, how much greater the revulsion must have been in Britain.  With the carnage still fresh in their minds, it is hardly surprising that the police would use any means available in their efforts to track down those guilty of the crime.  It is hardly surprising that an inefficient forensic scientist, possibly feeling that his job was under threat, would seek a renewed lease of life by jumping on the conclusions which the police, the public, the politicians &mdash; and indeed the press &mdash; all wished to be arrived at.  It would have been a jury of extraordinary strength of character to bring in a not guilty verdict at the subsequent trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now a matter of record that Dr. Skuse was incompetent.  The British Home Office, after all, ordered his compulsory retirement at the age of 51 years. His evidence at the original trial has since been discredited.  Mr. Chris Mullin, MP, has, I believe, rightly claimed that Dr. Skuse conspired with police officers to pervert the course of justice at the time of the pub bombings.  As one of the political observers at the Court of Appeal in the Old Bailey, I was not surprised to hear that there is now strong evidence that Dr. <Col N="205" /> Skuse telephoned Superintendent Reade from his hotel room while he was in London giving evidence at the appeal hearing, despite the fact that he was warned by the appeal judge not to speak to anybody connected with the hearing. This matter, as the House knows, has been investigated by the British police and predictably no prosecutions have been initiated.</P>
    <P>It took time for any widespread view to grow that the Birmingham convictions may not have been as justified as most people originally believed.  Even in this country, the case of the Birmingham Six took a long time to catch the public imagination.  Great credit is due to the small handful of people who possessed the foresight to see from the beginning that something was seriously wrong and who possessed the courage to say so.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that no jury could ever have fully digested or totally comprehended the scientific theories and issues at stake in the original trial, or indeed, that in the time in which they returned their verdict they could have fully considered every detail of the evidence which was adduced.  There is no legal requirement that they should have done so, but their rapidly returned verdict can have only one meaning, that is, that the jury reached their verdict on the broad sweep of the case rather than on careful evaluation of all the pieces of evidence.</P>
    <P>We will never know, and the Court of Appeal cannot have known, whether the jury were impressed more by the forensic aspect of the Crown case than by the confessions, or the circumstantial evidence regarding the six men's backgrounds. Perhaps they were equally convinced by all three aspects of the Crown case.  Perhaps they were more influenced by the inherent danger in trial by jury in such circumstances that once a person is in the dock he will be presumably guilty notwithstanding the common law presumption to the contrary. Once any aspect of the Crown case can be shown to be seriously at issue &mdash; and that certainly can be said of the forensic case against the Birmingham Six <Col N="206" />&mdash; it must follow that the original verdict is unsatisfactory.  Since it is as likely as not that it was the forensic case which clinched the jury, or some members of it, it inevitably follows that had the weaknesses of the Crown's forensic case been known to the jury, they might not have convicted.  What the Court of Appeal had to decide was, not whether the six were guilty or innocent but whether or not there might have been a reasonable doubt, as Deputy Spring has pointed out, in the minds of the jury had they heard the new evidence.  The decision of the Court of Appeal that no such doubt could have existed defies all logic.</P>
    <P>The Crown case stood up better at the appeal as regards the issue of whether or not the confessions were voluntary.  It stood up better in the sense that there were as many inconsistencies in the six men's allegations as in the police version of what happened.  Yet, to accept absolutely the passage of time and the dimming of recollection as the reason for police inconsistencies, while unequivocally ascribing those of the six men to a conspiracy to commit perjury, was monstrously unfair and illogical.  Yet that is the basis on which the Court of Appeal upheld the confessions.  Nor does it say much for judicial common sense that the idea that policemen interrogating men whom they suspected of mass murder in Birmingham might have resorted more to the rubber hose than the kid glove was apparently beyond their lordships' comprehension.</P>
    <P>The appeal to the House of Lords has been turned down.  I must admit that at this stage I have little stomach left for English courts or confidence in English judges.  It appears certain that only massive public pressure, both at home and abroad, on the British Government can now lead to the six men being freed.  I certainly hope that, just as the motion on Sellafield has, I believe, advanced the case against the British nuclear industry, this motion will help to this end.  Such pressure can be mobilised.  Most importantly, it can and must be mobilised in Britain.</P>
    <P>Other issues have shown that the <Col N="207" /> present British Government are remarkably unsusceptible to foreign views or sensibilities.  Indeed, there are many who would say that they are not very susceptible to the views of the British people, either.  Nevertheless, no Government can ignore for ever the responsible views and genuine concerns of its own people and members of parliament.  Even iron ladies have their breaking point and that is something which will never be said of the Birmingham Six.  Already, the judgement has attracted critical comment in Britain from legal journals, the press and MPs.  An Early Day Motion has been signed by over 150 MPs, calling upon the Home Secretary to establish an independent review tribunal.</P>
    <P>There are possibilities open to the British Home Secretary of which he should avail.  These include the recommending of a pardon, the granting of an early release, the granting of a release on compassionate grounds, or a positive response to the Early Day Motion calling upon him to establish an independent review tribunal.  Quite frankly, I believe that the cumbersome British legal process has been exhausted in the three cases which we are discussing and that the preferred option must be that the Home Secretary would respond to the representations of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and this supportive all-party debate calling for an early release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and a pardon for the Maguire Seven.</P>
    <P>If the Home Secretary does not respond, the campaign must continue. This campaign should not be confined merely to Britain, but every country which has subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights represents a potential ally in this struggle.  This British Government are hardly popular in Europe.  The case of the Birmingham Six must be hammered home in the European Parliament to every single member of the EC to every possible sympathetic audience.  This all-party motion will strengthen our hand in these efforts.</P>
    <P>Above all, it is clear that US public opinion is concerned about what is now <Col N="208" /> happening in Northern Ireland and to Anglo-Irish relations.  The United States did not support the Anglo-Irish Agreement, both financially and otherwise, in order to become a party to injustice.  In this, an election year in the United States, there is a unique opportunity to place the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven on the highest American political agenda.  This must and will be done.</P>
    <P>I am aware that our Ambassador also raised the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire family with the British Home Office as recently as yesterday. On the Guildford Four case, many have argued that it is a more clearcut case of miscarriage of justice.  The Home Office in a recent reply in the House of Commons stated that the report of the police and other relevant information will be taken into account when deciding whether to refer the case to the court of appeal.  This is a positive response and I accept that there has been some progress. However, this and the other cases have taken many years to come to this stage and I ask the British Government that there be no further delays.</P>
    <P>The case of the Maguire Seven is obviously interwoven with the Guildford Four and the progress in the case of the Guildford Four will mean a positive step forward in clearing the names of the Maguire Seven.  I am confining my remarks to the case of the Birmingham Six, although it does not indicate any lack of interest in the other issues because they are three of the most important matters that should be raised time and time again in this Parliament.  On humanitarian grounds I hope that this debate will get a response.  Above all, the implications of these cases represent a threat to the security and safety of all Irish people who live in or have occasion to travel to Britain.  This is our concern; we cannot ignore it.  Their cause is our cause and their vindication will be our security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank my colleague for sharing his time with me. Coincidentally, in my post last Friday the following letter came from Her Majesty's <Col N="209" /> Prison in Full Sutton, York.  It was from Ger Conlon, Prisoner No. 462779.  Like other letters which I received from some of the Birmingham Six and from one of the Guildford Four, it is a poignant reminder of our continuous need to remind ourselves of the plight of those prisoners.  It starts:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Roche,</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear from you.  I found your letter very heartening.  It is not often that I hear from Irish politicians, which I find unfortunate considering my terrible situation, so to hear from you is a pleasure.</P>
      <P>He goes on to deal with his move from Long Lartin to Full Sutton.  The move meant that, effectively, the few prison visits from his parents are now denied to him.  He moved from Long Lartin on 29 March last, a few days before the Home Secretary received the police report on the investigation of the additional evidence of Yvonne Fox and others.  Since 29 March and between then and 6 June Mr. Conlon, who has been in prison for 14 years, served a further 59 days out of 69 in solitary confinement.  By any civilised standards that is cruel and unnatural treatment.  I will deal with other aspects of that letter later.</P>
      <P>Every nation harbours its own myths and our nearest neighbour, like ourselves, is no exception.  One of the myths it harbours is an unshakeable belief in its system of justice.  It is good that a nation should believe in its system but it is wrong to believe that a nation should seek to vindicate a system which is human, fragile and fallible like any other system to the point where it inverts the <i>raison d'être</i> of the system of justice.  The intention of any system of justice is to do justice to each and every man and woman.  In the case of the 17 people, with whose difficulties we are dealing in this motion, the Birmingham Six, the Maguire Seven and the Guildford Four, it is clear to anybody who chooses to view the matter with an impartial eye that grave injustice has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely believe, and have believed for some considerable time, that the cases <Col N="210" /> referred to in this motion have been historic miscarriages of justice.  They have been aberrations in a generally good system of justice.  They scream to the heavens for redress at this stage.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the recent decision in the Birmingham Six case.  It is true that the judicial authorities in the United Kingdom narrowed their consideration but I was, nonetheless, amazed. However, as Deputy Kitt and Deputy Spring dealt with the Birmingham Six case at length, I will focus on the other cases.  I am confounded as to how any court could take the decision taken in the case of Annie Maguire, her family and friends.  As has been shown in some excellent works, particularly in Robert Kee's book, the seven persons involved in the Maguire case were together for only a short period of time.  The conspiracy of which they were accused could only have taken place in a very narrow time span.</P>
    <P>One of the more remarkable aspects of the facts of that case is that within that very narrow time span the home of Annie and Pat Maguire was under observation and subjected to close scrutiny by two police officers who could, if they wished, have looked in the window of her house and seen that there was nothing more conspiratorial going on than sending the children for chips and talking to Ger Conlon about the state of his health and the plight of his son.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Maguire, Mr. Maguire, their two sons, a lodger and a neighbour who had dropped in, who had brought his young children to be minded by Annie Maguire while his wife was in hospital, and Giuseppe Conlon were charged with the possession of explosives following the Guildford and Woolwich bombings in October and November 1984.  They were charged together with conspiracy and during the course of their trial they were accused of making bombs on the table in their very humble home which, as I said, was during the critical period under police review.</P>
    <P>All seven people were found guilty. Annie Maguire and her husband were sentenced to 14 years each and Annie <Col N="211" /> Maguire had the extraordinary distinction of being the woman who spent more time in solitary confinement than any other woman in the British penal system.  Their sons, at that time aged 16 and 13 years of age, were also found guilty and condemned to five and three years respectively.  The others received 12 years each.  All served their sentences, with the exception of Giuseppe Conlon, who died in Her Majesty's Prison in 1980.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most poignant aspect of the Maguire case &mdash; other Deputies and I had the experience of meeting Annie Maguire some time ago in the Irish Embassy &mdash; is that there is no bitterness in this woman, only a desire that justice is done.  Annie Maguire's husband, Pat, was at the time a member of the Conservative Club, hardly what one would call a ranting fanatical republican.  He certainly would not fall into anybody's description or imagination of a mad bomber.  His young son of 13 years of age knew nothing of the IRA, Republicanism, Unionism, politics or bombing. The real tragedy of that family, as was pointed out by Annie Maguire, was that when her young son had served his three years in prison no member of the family was notified, he was simply released on to the streets.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Birmingham Six, the case against the seven, including Pat Maguire, rested on evidence of the most dubious type.  In the case of Mrs. Maguire, the Crown got no confession or no acceptance of guilt.  There was no direct forensic evidence linking Annie Maguire to bombing, bomb making or any of the things of which she was accused.  She was condemned because a glove in her house, which when tested after a crucial time lapse during which it could have been contaminated, was found to show some traces of an explosive substance.  No evidence was ever brought forward to prove that that glove had been used exclusively by Annie Maguire or, indeed that it had been used at all by Annie Maguire, because, as a cleaning lady, she suffered from dermatitis and, <Col N="212" /> as she said herself, she had at any stage, up to 20 pairs of gloves in use.</P>
    <P>At this stage no justice can be done to Giuseppe Conlon who died in one of Her Majesty's prisons.  But at this stage his name can be cleared and those of the Maguire, the O'Neills and the Smyth families.  They can all be compensated for the trauma they have suffered.  They can have their good names vindicated.  It is within the power of the British Home Secretary to have that suffering ended, to make a strike for real justice by seekng a complete re-trial in their cases.  He could do so if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>As was the case of the Maguire family, the case of the Guilford Four is bizarre. I would submit that the case of the Guildford Four is the most bizarre of all.  In October and November 1984 there were explosions in Guildford and Woolwich. They formed part of a series of horrific events.  As Deputy Spring has said, it is easy &mdash; if one puts oneself into the time &mdash; to understand the anger and frustration of the British authorities, to understand the urge to obtain convictions.  I think Deputy Spring dealt with the point.  After all, the Birmingham bombings represented the biggest mass murder in British history.  There was a very real pressure to bring convictions; so, too, in the case of the Guildford and Woolwich bombings.  In those bombing outrages seven people died.  Subsequently, three people from Northern Ireland, Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon and Patrick Armstrong were arrested.  In addition, an English girl, Carole Richardson, the girlfriend of Paddy Armstrong, was arrested.  They were tried and convicted of the bombings. All were sentenced to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Anyone who looks carefully at the details of this case cannot but be convinced of the evidence of the people. Some time ago I met Paddy Armstrong's mother.  She said: &ldquo;My pat is no angel &mdash; I would not claim that &mdash; but he could not have harmed a fly and he did not murder those people.&rdquo;  The extraordinary thing when one meets these people is their lack of bitterness.  It is even more <Col N="213" /> extraordinary that, after all these years, they continue to underscore the fact that they are innocent.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Guilford Four, there was a twist of events in December 1975 when the Balcombe Street siege took place.  In the course of that siege four men &mdash; Hugh Doherty, Eddie Butler, Martin O'Connell and Harry Duggan &mdash; were arrested.  They were charged and subsequently found guilty of a whole series of crimes.  In the course of their trial they confessed responsibility for the Guildford and Woolwich bombings.  The important point here is that not only did they confess, but they showed an absolute grasp of detail which could have existed only among people who had been involved in the Guildford and Woolwich bombings.  When they came to trial they were charged with 25 bombing and shooting incidents.  They were not charged with either the outrage at Woolwich or at Guildford.  In October 1977, the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom heard an appeal by the Guildford Four on the grounds of the Balcombe Street four confessions.</P>
    <P>The prosecution accepted that the Balcombe Street four could have been involved in the Guildford and Woolwich bombings but insisted that, if they were involved in those bombings, they must have been involved in them in addition to the four people we now call the Guildford Four.  At no time were the British authorities willing to contemplate that there could have been an error.  At no time were they willing to contemplate circumstances in which the four &mdash; that is Doherty, Butler, O'Connell and Duggan &mdash; had in fact been guilty of the bombings at Woolwich and at Guildford and that the four who were in jail at that stage &mdash; Hill, Conlon, Armstrong and Carole Richardson &mdash; were innocent; that that at least was a possibility.  That it was a possibility was not even accepted by the British authorities at that time.</P>
    <P>As we know, on 3 March 1987 an ITV programme was presented which cast new light on the case of the Guildford Four.  Mrs. Yvonne Fox came forward and indicated that, while she was not <Col N="214" /> called as a witness in the original trial &mdash; and one can only be condemnatory of the manner in which the defence of the four was handled in the course of that trial &mdash; she gave evidence that she had been in the same house as Paul Hill on the night of the Woolwich bombings.  On that same television programme eminent people such as Cardinal Hume, Lord Devlin and others came forward and gave testimony as to their conviction of the innocence of the four.</P>
    <P>In August of last year the Home Secretary agreed, following pressure, to establish an independent police inquiry into the new evidence which had been provided in this case.  That police inquiry, by the Somerset and Avon police, has now been completed and a report handed over to the Home Secretary on 13 April last.  The Home Secretary must now decide what action, if any, he is to take on foot of the findings of that report.  It strikes me, after so many months, that one cannot be optimistic as to that decision, but I am hopeful.  Having met the Home Secretary, having discussed this and other cases with him, I believe he is sincere in his search for the truth in these matters.  I would hope he would view this report with generosity.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has followed the case of the Guildford Four will be of the opinion that its handling has been disconcerting, to say the least.  Even those British parliamentarians who show little sympathy, for example, in the case of the Birmingham Six &mdash; there were a number of them here recently when we discussed this and many other matters with them &mdash; are convinced that the Guildford trial did not come up to the highest standard normally expected of a court of justice in a civilised country.  As one goes into the details of the case &mdash; even without the evidence of Yvonne Fox &mdash; one can only reach the conclusion that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I had had the privilege of meeting and discussing the matter for a long time with Paddy Armstrong, one of the Guildford Four.  I went into that prison to meet him convinced of his innocence.  I came out without any <Col N="215" /> shadow of doubt as to his innocence.  At the time that man had lived in a squat, on the border of the drug culture in London. The last thing on his mind was militant action of any kind.  He has provided the police authorities with grave difficulty because it has taken him years to painstakingly recreate the nights in question. He has provided the police authorities with reasonable evidence to prove that he could not have been where he should have been had he been involved in that bombing.  Carole Richardson has done likewise.  In many ways her's is the most tragic case of all.  She has been able to find evidence: the road manager of a pop group and some other people in a pub who can all prove that she was in concert at the North London Polytechnic at the crucial period during one of these bombings.</P>
    <P>I know there is no doubt in the minds of people on all sides in this House who have studied these cases closely that there has been the gravest miscarriage of justice. It is proper that we should from time to time debate this issue in this House, hopefully sending out a clear message of our concern to the British authorities about these and other cases.</P>
    <P>It pains me to read a letter from Gerry Conlon saying that he had to watch, for over five years, the slow death of his father, that they saw their mother broken-hearted and humiliated by the British penal system; that they had spent over 700 days in the punishment blocks.  They had had it over all the years.  Now, after all this, the Home Office have moved him to a prison where it is really impossible for his family and relations to visit him.</P>

      <P>If nothing else, could we not appeal this evening to the British authorities: if they must keep these people in prison could they not at least do so in a humane way?  Why is it that Paddy Armstrong cannot be visited except once a year by his unfortunate mother who must work as a charwoman <Col N="216" /> in Belfast in order to do so?  Why is it that we now see Gerry Conlon, having lost his father, having lost all of his young life, imprisoned in these circumstances at this time?  I support this motion, everybody in the House supports this motion. We are convinced there has been a grave miscarriage of justice here and we hope the British Authorities will rise to the occasion and right that wrong.</P>

However the Deputy is perfectly in order in referring to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the situation and I am grateful the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle have agreed to circulate it.  The amendment which Fine Gael submitted for consideration is:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in the light of the fact that there remains considerable anxiety about the continuing imprisonment of the Birmingham Six, notwithstanding the recent review by the Court of Appeal and in the light of the doubts that have been widely expressed about the safety of the convictions in the Guildford Four and Maguire cases, Dáil Éireann calls on the British Home Secretary to exercise the powers vested in him to order the release of The Birmingham Six, and to exercise his powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968 to refer the Guildford Four case and the Maguire case without delay to the Court of Appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> All of these cases have given rise to considerable anxiety and there is a widespread belief in Ireland and elsewhere that there may have been a miscarriage of justice.  There is a nagging doubt that the guilt of each of these persons has not been proved conclusively.</P>
    <P>Later tonight we debate the role of the jury in our legal system when we debate the Courts Bill.  Throughout the passage of that Bill I have been a strong supporter of the jury system but it is nonetheless an irony that of the very many cases that have arisen from the campaign of terrorism throughout these islands, the decisions that have given rise to most disquiet have been verdicts of juries. They have not been decisions of the Diplock courts or of our non-jury Special Criminal Court.  The cases that refuse to go away, the cases that gnaw at us, those cases that continue to trouble us are, without exception, cases that were decided by juries.  That is of some interest because if there is a common thread running through all of these cases, it is that in these cases the courts, and more specifically the juries, lost hold of the golden thread that should run through our criminal law and the criminal law in Britain, and that is that there is at all times a presumption of innocence. Simply put, the anxiety is that such was the fury of the British nation at the time, the understandable and proper fury given the atrocities that had been committed, that Irish people appearing in the dock in the mid-seventies did not enjoy the same presumption of innocence as was enjoyed by other defendants of different backgrounds appearing for different kinds of offences, or that the same exacting obligation to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt was not exacted of the prosecution when a series of Irish people found themselves in the dock.</P>
    <P>I will consider each case in some detail. I will not say much about the Maguire case, not because I do not regard it as important but because Deputy Barry who will speak tomorrow night is in a position to speak with much greater authority on that, having had the privilege of meeting Mrs. Maguire on a couple of occasions. <Col N="218" /> In considering each of the cases, it behoves us to exercise some circumspection, because if there is reason for anxiety that British juries show some tendency to assume the guilt of Irish defendants in terrorists trials, it is equally desirable that we should not adopt the position of assuming the innocence of everybody convicted of a terrorist offence by the British courts.</P>
    <P>One of the least happy aspects of Anglo-Irish relations is the mutual disrespect that each country has shown for the other's judicial procedures and courts.  In our country that takes a form of snide references to British justice which is always put in quotation marks.  In Britain's case it more usually takes the form of incredulity that our courts should set exacting standards of proof and compliance with appropriate procedures before a person can be deprived of his liberty, and that has resulted in the lackadaisical, slipshod and inept approach that has characterised so many British requests for extradition from this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is a further point which we should keep in mind.  Today we have had a hullabaloo about an extradition application which is perceived as having gone wrong.  Some of us have been angered by the refusal in Britain in sections of the British media to differentiate between what is the sphere of the executive and what is properly in the judicial sphere.  There appears to be a belief in some British media circles and elsewhere in Britain that it is acceptable for the executive to intervene in the judicial sphere.  Last Sunday's British papers, for example, reported the overturning of a murder verdict against a British citizen in Burma and stated explicitly that that verdict would not have been overturned without a political intervention. I know nothing about the system of justice that applies in Rangoon and that charge may or may not have been properly put but it is an attitude that is quite out of place when dealing with the legal system of countries in which the separation of powers is fundamental.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> The Birmingham Six case has been the subject of exhaustive judicial consideration. To date the case has been extensively considered at different levels &mdash; in civil courts, in the criminal courts and in all of the appellant courts.  All these considerations notwithstanding, the convictions stand, and all those considerations notwithstanding, the doubts remain.  Let us recall what was at issue in the current review.  Essentially what was at issue were what has become called the two pillars of the prosecution case, the forensic evidence and the confessions. Given that it is common case that the men were seriously assaulted while in custody to the extent that a number of them required medical treatment, stitches and so on for the injuries afflicted on them, one would have thought there might have been some doubt as to when that assault took place.  The only issue is whether those assaults were inflicted while in the police station and before the confessions were made or after they were removed to Winston Green Prison and into the custody of the prison service. One would have thought that a jury might have taken the view, against a background of undisputed assaults, that there was a doubt as to whether or not confessions were voluntary.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the last review very real doubts were raised about the operations, the effectiveness and the reliability of the grease test which was the basis of the forensic evidence and the basis of the evidence tendered on behalf of the Crown by Dr. Skuse.  While it is true that in the course of the court of appeal hearings Dr. Skuse attempted to retrieve lost ground and proferred a number of explanations and in effect, his evidence had been less than complete in the original proceedings, one has to say that he cut a less than impressive figure as a witness.  A jury aware that his original testimony could not stand &mdash; certainly it could not stand without glossing and elaboration &mdash; might well have come to the view that they were left in doubt about the quality of the forensic evidence. Again, the court of appeal had <Col N="220" /> before it independent evidence from a number of people who came forward, principally Joyce Lynas, the young police recruit, and Thomas Clarke.</P>
    <P>The court of appeal considered their testimony carefully and in each case decided to reject it.  No one is to say they are wrong, but can it really be said, if that evidence was before a jury, that they might not have accepted it or might simply have said: &ldquo;I do not know whether this man, Clarke, was motivated by a desire to cause trouble for his former colleagues who had dismissed him, or, whether he really did see something untoward&rdquo;.  On that basis they might have felt that the proper and honourable thing to do was to give the benefit of the doubt to the accused.  That is what is at issue now, whether a doubt exists in relation to these convictions.  There has been a tendency on the part of some commentators, and some of those who have campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six, to deny the existence of any case against the six defendants.  That is to overstate their position and it is far from helpful.  It is interesting that the mens' own lawyers in the court of appeal specifically accepted that it was not a black and white case which would have entitled them to have their convictions quashed.  What they said was that their arguments fell short of that but that it was sufficient to have the matter looked at again by a jury.</P>
    <P>The case has been considered in the first instance.  It has gone to appeal.  There was an attempt to open up another route in the civil courts.  It is being investigated in the media, the Home Secretary has referred it to the court of appeal, who have advised that there is nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the convictions. It is worth saying that we would not have had the opportunity for a further view of the evidence were it not for the fact that a very vigorous campaign has been conducted by responsible opinion in Britain and in Ireland.  Credit is due to those in Britain, in the media, in parliament and in the legal world who have pressed their case.  I think, too, a degree of credit is due to the British authorities who have, <Col N="221" /> at least, responded to the extent of referring the case for reconsideration by the court of appeal.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was passing a Sinn Féin office here in town and I saw on the window posters questioning British justice. I was struck by the stark contrast in regard to fates of the victims of Provo justice, because for them there is no question of a reasonable doubt, there is no question of the exercise of clemency; for them it is summary execution, sometimes execution delayed until after barbaric torture or, if they are very lucky, it is a question of escaping with a knee-capping.</P>
    <P>The fact that these men remain in prison, notwithstanding the court cases, continues to make people uneasy and it contributes to a distrust of the legal system in our neighbour's land.  That fact is capable of being used for mischievous purposes.</P>
    <P>Recently, the British Attorney General announced his conclusions on the Stalker-Sampson report and, indeed, they were far from welcome in this jurisdiction. He concluded that there was evidence on which people could have been put on trial for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, but having considered the public interest he said he was of the view that there should be no prosecutions. It seems to me now that it is appropriate that the authorities in Britain take into account the public interest now that the judicial road has been travelled in relation to the Birmingham Six.  It is not in the public interest that there should be a continuing shadow over Anglo-Irish relations.  It is not in the public interest that a sizeable section of responsible opinion, notwithstanding that all the judicial channels have been explored, remain anxious about the validity of the convictions.</P>
    <P>In the Guildford case doubts have existed for a long time about the voluntariness of the statements.  For my own part I have always felt that they were most implausible Provo bombers.  It defies belief that the Provos, embarking on a very important phase of their operations, extending their campaign to mainland Britain, were going to entrust that <Col N="222" /> to a teenage girl on the fringe of a drugs squat and that they would entrust the leadership of that to someone whom they had fallen out with and on whose head they had put a price.  We know that new evidence from Miss Kelly has come forward following the &ldquo;First Tuesday&rdquo; programme. We know that, following lobbying by a series of people, most significantly Lord Devlin, the authority on the jury system, the Home Secretary has asked the Avon and Somerset police to investigate.  It appears that their investigations are now with him.  I would urge the Home Secretary to refer those cases to the court of appeal.</P>
    <P>I will not deal with the Maguire case because my colleague will have an opportunity to do that except to say this: given that the sentences have been served how is face lost by allowing the court of appeal to reconsider those convictions?  The Home Secretary has consistently taken the view that he should not exercise his powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, unless there is new evidence available. There is no basis for that in the Act.  The Act appears to give the Home Secretary a complete discretion.  First, let me say that at least in the case of the Guildford Four there is, very clearly, new evidence available which should be considered by the court of appeal.  Second, the anxieties that exist are so widespread that that in itself is a ground on which the Home Secretary should ask the court of appeal to reconsider the reliability and the safeness of these convictions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of remarks that have gone down in history.  Perhaps one of the most unhappy moments of this whole saga were the remarks of the then Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, when the Birmingham Six sought to reopen or, at least to re-examine what had happened to them in custody through civil proceedings. His remarks on that occasion when he spoke about the appalling vista that would be opened by the quashing of their convictions has already been put on the record here this evening.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest another appalling vista.  It would be an appalling vista were these cases to go unresolved, were these <Col N="223" /> cases to remain as an irritant in the body politic, were these cases to continue to niggle, were these cases to continue to be available to those who wish to use them to sap our common commitment to fighting terrorism.  Let us be clear about this.  These cases will not go away.</P>
    <P>Responsible people remain in doubt. They remain anxious that a miscarriage of justice may have been committed. While those doubts may be held by responsible people, many are prepared to turn those doubts to their own use.  It is not in the interest of any democrat, or any of us, that there should be any shadow of doubt which would pull us away from a wholehearted, unified fight against terrorism in which the British authorities and ourselves would stand together against the common enemy represented by the Provisional IRA.  These cases made that common stance more difficult.  On at least two occasions in the last 18 months or so this House has had lengthy debates on the extradition issue. On at least two occasions we had been considering the question of extradition for offences that some people would call political, an essential weapon if we are to fight terrorism effectively.  These cases are being used to cast a doubt over the effectiveness of that weapon and it is vital that that doubt be removed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 7 to 9, to delete &ldquo;FOR THE REGULATION OF THE NUMBER OF COUNSEL APPEARING IN CERTAIN ACTIONS&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;FOR THE REGULATION OF THE NUMBER OF COUNSEL IN RESPECT OF WHOM COSTS IN CERTAIN ACTIONS MAY BE RECOVERED&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1, which relates to my amendment No. 14, deals with the issue of the number of counsel appearing for whom costs may be awarded in actions covered in this Bill.  Amendment No. 1 relates particularly to the title, and this amendment appeared on Committee Stage.  I put it again because I believe that, perhaps due to time constraints on Committee Stage, it was not possible to deal with it properly.  I would like to put it to the Minister that the amendment we are suggesting is correct in terms of the effect wished for in this Bill.  The title has already been amended to allow for sections dealing with the numbers of counsel for whom costs may be taxed, but the title still says that the number of counsel appearing in certain actions are what is being regulated.  I submit it is the number of counsel in respect of whom costs may be recovered.  I ask the Minister to have a further look at this and perhaps he will be in agreement and will see his way to accepting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14, however, is the substantive amendment and is a substitute for section 5 in the Bill as amended in Committee.  It deals with the possibility of the Minister introducing regulations to specify a different number of counsel and the type of counsel involved in an action for whom costs may be recovered.  Substantially, our amendment does not differ greatly from the Minister's except in two main areas.  The major one is where I make provision in my amendment at subsection (3) for the evening up of the odds as between the plaintiff and the defendant. I suggest to the House that the Bill, as amended in Committee, would allow <Col N="225" /> the Minister to make regulations which could be used by a defendant &mdash; an insurance company which was a defendant in an action &mdash; to allow an uneven distribution of force as between the number of counsel involved on each side. It could be that it would be left to the plaintiff to pay out of his own pocket for any number of counsel above one in normal circumstances and two in exceptional circumstances.  That could lead to unfairness and injustice.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider if, in the unlikely event of regulations having to be introduced, he would consider it would be fairer to ensure that the party who is ordered to pay costs knows that he or she will be liable to pay costs for the same number of counsel on either side.  I think that is only fair and just.  No ordinary individual is in a position really at any stage to retain counsel or solicitors out of his or her own pocket.  Most people cannot countenance doing that without some kind of financial backing.  The Bill does not cater for the difficulties which might occur on the introduction of regulations and those who are in that extraordinary position of having to go to court will find it far more difficult than they would have otherwise to keep up with the kind of representation the insurance companies could afford to bring in.  We have heard here in the House talk of &ldquo;big guns&rdquo; and the difficulties for the small person in the court facing large companies like insurance companies and the headstart they would have.  I submit that the amendment here, particularly subsection (3) would go a long way to resolving that problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (1) of our amendment, we have stipulated that where the Minister is of the opinion that by reason of any practice an excessive number of counsel are retained he may then make regulations.  It is wise that the Minister should have to inform himself of these practices whereby an excessive number of counsel are retained rather than going ahead and mking regulations without having to have regard for issues such as that.  As it stands there is no demand that the Minister must have <Col N="226" /> regard to such circumstances existing and it would be fairer for the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council were treated rather badly in the last number of months in connection with the introduction of Committee Stage of this Bill.  I believe there was a real willingness on the part of the Bar Council to change their practices quite substantially and to go even further than was being asked of them at the time by the Minister of State responsible for trade and marketing.  Nevertheless, they showed good faith.  They had held an extraordinary general meeting which unanimously authorised the Bar Council to change these practices.  Having done that, the Bar Council then found they were, nevertheless, going to have regulations foisted upon them.  That seemed to be the impression that was left with them and with the public in general.  I appeal to the Minister to clarify whether he intends to bring in regulations, and what circumstances he would see leading him to have to do so, and to clarify it in general so that the possibility of coming to some future agreements with the Bar Council is not jeopardised because of what has happened in the last number of months.</P>
    <P>If regulations are introduced under the section we could find that the tradition of barristers giving their services on the basis that if the case was successful they would be paid and if it was lost they would not, could be threatened.  The regulations could radically change the listing system which operates in the courts.  Barristers who up to now would have made themselves available may not be in a position to block out their time over a long period without knowing if they would be getting paid for the case.</P>
    <P>Regulations should even up the balance as between plaintiff and defendant, particularly where insurance companies are involved, and subsection (3) of amendment No. 14 goes a long way towards doing that.  It does not, and could not, address the problem of equality of representation for the plaintiff; but, as far as possible, it evens up the number of <Col N="227" /> counsel who would be involved.  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 would be alternatives if amendment No. 14 is not accepted.  If regulations are being made under the section it is only right that they should be brought before the House for debate so that the House will be clear on the implications of them.</P>
    <P>The provision under discussion is new and was not included in the Bill published two years ago.  We have not had a Second Stage debate on this radical measure which alters greatly the impact of the Bill. If passed it will have an enormous impact on practice at the Bar and on our judicial system.  Once more we have an example of the dangerous practice of rushing through legislation.  The least we can expect if regulations are introduced under this section is that they will be brought before the House and fully debated.  I stress the latter point because there is a danger that we would be permitted one hour or so to debate them. That would not give us an opportunity to put forward our arguments on such regulations.  We must remember that the House must consider all the implications of any legislation introduced.  I hope the Minister will not find it necessary to introduce regulations but in the event of them being brought in they should be debated here and, if necessary, voted on.</P>

      <P>I got an assurance from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Reynolds, who dealt with the Bill on Committee Stage, that regulations would not be introduced to control the number of counsel in respect of which costs may be recovered unless negotiations between the Minister for Justice and the Bar Council broke down.  I am <Col N="228" /> confident that will not happen.  I have sufficient faith in the integrity of the Bar Council, and faith in the word of the Minister &mdash; I hope he repeats this evening the assurance I was given on Committee Stage &mdash; to know that the regulations will not be introduced if a suitable agreement can be reached between him and the Bar Council under which at least one senior and one junior counsel will be present for a case, except in exceptional circumstances when two or more senior counsel may be needed.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Colley's remarks about members of the Law Library representing individuals who do not have the money to pay the costs. Deputy Colley felt the arrangement that exists might be affected if regulations are introduced by the Minister.  That tradition was brought home to me by a constituent who is in receipt of disability benefit and lives in a caravan.  Following an accident she took a court action but her solicitor, and the senior counsel engaged, will not receive any fee for that case because she lost, although I thought it was a good action.  That individual would not have had an opportunity of having her case heard in a court unless members of the legal profession were prepared to give their services on the basis of a fee if the case was successful.  I would not like to see anything happen, perhaps through a misunderstanding, to that arrangement.  Long may that arrangement continue.  We must take that into account when making any changes.  We should not be afraid to protect the rights of individuals to earn a decent living provided they, in turn, play their part in helping the community. There is a need for a good working relationship between the Bar Council, the Minister and his Department on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 15.  He should announce that it is not his intention to introduce regulations unless he fails to reach agreement with the Bar Council. That commitment was given by his colleague, the Minister for Industry and <Col N="229" /> Commerce, last week.  If that announcement is made, the Minister will be meeting the views of all sides.  I will not delay the House any further if the Minister gives that assurance and accepts my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Standing Order No. 92 (1) of Dáil Éireann requires that the title of a Bill shall contain &ldquo;a short description of its purpose&rdquo;.  The purpose of section 5 of the Bill is to deal with the problem of over-representation by counsel in personal and fatal injury cases, and to reduce the number of counsel appearing in these actions.  The way that this is being done is by placing a limit on the number of counsel in respect of whom costs may be allowed on taxation.  That is the approach being adopted for legal reasons.  There would be difficulties in a provision that would attempt to directly limit the number of counsel appearing in a case.  I may add that the draftsman, with whom the matter has been discussed fully, is quite happy with the Long Title as it stands.  I consider that the present text of the Long Title, as amended on Committee Stage, is adequate and conforms with the requirements of Standing Order No. 92 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 differs from the provisions of section 5 of the Bill, which was inserted on Committee Stage, in two main respects: (a) subsection (3) would require the regulations to provide that the maximum number of counsel in respect of whom costs are recoverable would not be fewer than the number retained by the party ordered to pay costs and (b) subsection (4) would require an approving resolution of the Dáil before the regulations could take effect.  While I have reservations about the way subsection (3) is phrased, I appreciate what it is trying to deal with &mdash; the fear expressed by a number of Deputies that wealthy insurance companies will not be deterred from employing a greater number of counsel than would be allowed for on taxation and that the ordinary plaintiff, who must pay out of his own pocket if he loses, would be placed at a disadvantage.  In view of the assurances <Col N="230" /> which I have received from the insurance companies, I would not think that there is much basis for that fear.  However, if it transpires that I am wrong in that, I can assure the House that it is a matter that I would provide for in any regulations that I would make.  The regulations could provide, for example, that the Taxing Master, in awarding costs, would have regard to the number of counsel retained by the party ordered to pay costs.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously to the House, it is my intention to postpone the making of regulations until I have had an opportunity of seeing how matters develop once jury trials go.  If there is a need to deal with the sort of problem envisaged by subsection (3) of this amendment, I will not hesitate to provide for it in regulations.  As I have already indicated on Committee Stage, I accept that any regulations proposed would be subject to an approving resolution of each House &mdash; not only of the Dáil as this amendment proposes, but of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The House will, accordingly, have its full say as to what safeguards should be inserted in the regulations.  I suggest that is the best way to deal with this matter and that it should be left for the regulations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the amendment differs from section 5 of the Bill in that it would require me, before making regulations, to be of opinion &ldquo;that by reason of any practice whereby an excessive number of counsel are retained... the amount of costs recoverable on taxation are unreasonable&rdquo;.  I do not think that this is necessary or that it adds anything. I would not propose regulations unless I felt there was a need for them in the light of experience and, in any event, any regulations I would propose will have to be debated and approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendment No. 15, it was stated on my behalf on Committee Stage that I am prepared to accept Deputy Barrett's amendment.  This will have the effect of substituting a provision for a positive resolution by both Houses of the Oirechtas for the present provision <Col N="231" /> in subsection (3) of section 5 of the Bill. It means that the Oireachtas will have full control over any regulations I may introduce to limit counsel's costs.  With regard to amendment No. 16, tabled by Deputy Barrett, the same applies and I am prepared to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Two things occurred to me from what the Minister has said. Firstly, whereas I appreciate that he shares the concern of Deputy Colley in her amendment, that the equality of fire power is something which should be kept in mind, I wonder is section 5 (1) of the Bill wide enough to allow him to put an equality of fire power provision into a regulation.  It was because of doubts on that issue that Deputy Colley put that in. If she thought that it was possible to do so in regulations I presume she would not have bothered proposing that we put it in statutory form.  Section 5 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding any provision made by or under statute, or any rule of law or practice, the Minister may specify by regulations the maximum number of consel in respect of whom costs may be allowed, on taxation by a Taxing Master, for payment by another party or other parties...</P>
      <P>It does not seem to allow the Minister to make regulations by saying that the Minister can, by regulation, vary the number of counsel employed by the other side.  If the Minister understands it to have that effect, to allow him to make such a regulation, so be it, and obviously it is unnecessary to put it into statutory form but Deputy Colley's amendment at least had the advantage that it forced him to take on board the equality of fire power provision.  I am concerned because the Minister is claiming that section 5 (1) is sufficiently wide to allow him to do that. He says he is so advised and I will not query it.  An insurance company may in time decide that section 5 (1) is not that wide but that is, perhaps, a matter for court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equality of fire power principle is only a matter of choice.  Admittedly, in <Col N="232" /> view of the fact that Deputy Barrett's amendment is being accepted, if the Minister's view is correct this House will be in a position to put that into the regulations or to ensure that it is inserted in the regulations before the House approves them.  It is important that it be on the record now that the House is passing this measure in the light of a determination that if and when regulations are made under this Act they will contain an equality of fire power clause.  Therefore, no Minister can stand up later and say that this is outside the ambit of regulation and that he cannot accept the proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to equality of fire power, the person will have a letter from the Insurance Industry Federation and that is fine until it comes to little &ldquo;Joe Soap&rdquo; who comes up against an uninsured employer or an employer who says: &ldquo;I want to beat him down; I am retaining more counsel to deal with this case&rdquo;.  The person may come up against somebody who does not have an insurer behind him and who is not privy to the undertaking made to the Minister and in those circumstances he will be caught by the inequality of fire power.  No matter what assurances you get, there will be occasions when the rich specialist who has no insurance of any kind is sued for medical negligence and he will witness the hefty team.  In other words, there will not be equality of fire power where the insurance company's agreement is not binding.  It is a mistake to make one law for cases where insurers are involved and another law for cases where they are not involved.  I want to underline what I perceive to be Deputy Colley's correct view &mdash; that is that the equality of fire power provision must be built into any regulation in regard to the number of counsel. You cannot ask a plaintiff to undertake an uphill struggle in terms of numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister's discussions with the Bar Council &mdash; I am wearing my lawyer's hat now &mdash; are fruitful and that no regulations under this Bill when it <Col N="233" /> becomes an Act will be necessary.  It is my understanding, from what I have been told by the Bar Council, that they are willing to negotiate in good faith with the Minister and always were willing to do so.  They went as far as they thought they were being asked to go and then discovered that more demands were being made of them which they were not even aware of when they had their extraordinary general meeting to which Deputy Colley referred.</P>
    <P>I hope that in dealing with this issue, the Minister will bear in mind that there are cases where, due to their length or complexity, more than one barrister is needed.  If you prescribe a maximum of one barrister per plaintiff, you are saying to the plaintiff that some of his damages are going to be applied inevitably towards paying for the correct number of counsel in the case.  Some of what is his correct entitlement in damages is applied to his lawyers and that means he will get less than his correct entitlement in those circumstances. It is wrong for us as a House to seek to limit, unless there is a very good case to be made that there is something going against the public interest, the number of counsel which a plaintiff who is trying to recover damages can employ in order to do justice.  I know that is to open the floodgates, but the other point is there can be overmanning of counsel if the plaintiff is allowed to choose how many counsel he wants without any regard to the questions in issue.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point that where money has to come out of damages it is an injustice done.  There are many solicitors who are taking 10 per cent off the top &mdash; I hope I will not be held to be disloyal by some of the solicitors in this House when I say that &mdash; but to me that is 10 per cent out of what the court has determined to be the entitlement of their clients.  If we limit the number of counsel too rigidly, we will be further invading the compensation function of the court by requiring more and more burden to be borne by the individual plaintiff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzpatrick Mr. T. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The title of this Bill <Col N="234" /> is the Courts of Justice Bill, 1988.  That presupposes that the Bill is about the administration of justice and the protection of rights, particularly the rights of the small man against the big person or a corporation.  However, that is not what this Bill is about at all.  This is about insurance premiums and the reduction of insurance premiums.  It is being introduced and passed as a <i>quid pro quo</i> with the insurance companies &mdash; if this Bill is introduced, premiums will come down.  I do not believe for one moment that the premiums will come down.  I also do not think that counsels' fees in any running down action will be reduced dramatically as a result of this legislation.  If there is only one counsel on each side, that counsel will commit himself to devoting his full time and attention to the hearing of the case for the duration, certainly the insurance companies counsel will do that, and he will charge a fee accordingly. When it comes to taxing the costs of the successful plaintiff I would be very surprised if the Taxing Master did not ascertain what was paid to the counsel for the defendant and tax the plaintiff's counsels' fees accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this legislation will be to make it much more difficult for the man of no means, or even the man of moderate means, to gain access to the courts. He will start off under a very big handicap. The amendments we are dealing with now seek to provide that there will be only one counsel or two counsel at most &mdash; one senior and one junior &mdash; for the plaintiff and the defendant.  I put it to the House that while one counsel might, and could be said to be quite adequate for the defendant in such an action particularly when the defendant is a wealthy insurance company which can guarantee a handsome fee to the counsel no matter how long the case goes on, that one counsel could be quite inadequate for the plaintiff because the counsel who would take on the case for the plaintiff would be committing himself to perhaps a two weeks trial, and frequently a week's trial, with no guarantee that he would get one brass farthing at the end of it.  If he loses the case the brief goes into the <Col N="235" /> wastepaper basket and that is the end of story.  If that happens to a counsel several times a year, he will end up a not very wealthy man.  He will be very choosy about getting committed to such cases because if he takes on a brief and walks out on it, it will be very like the present position in a criminal case.  He will be adversely commented on by the trial judge.  That is the important point.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill is also all about insurance premiums and the reduction of insurance premiums. If I ever wanted to satisfy myself that I was thinking correctly, it was when I heard across the floor today assurances given that &ldquo;we have exchanged letters with the insurance companies and they have undertaken to do this, that and the other&rdquo;.  I take all that with a grain of salt. They will find ways and means out of that.</P>
    <P>We have heard in this House on several occasions in recent years about an Irish solution for an Irish problem.  Since the foundation of the State, a poor man, or a man of moderate means, was never deprived of the right to go into court particularly in a personal injuries act.  He could always get a solicitor and a barrister to bring his case into court and to fight his case for him.  That was because there was an Irish solution for an Irish problem. The problem was there was no free legal aid system in this country, nor has there been and there is not now so far as running down actions are concerned and indeed as far as most actions are concerned, with the possible exception of family law.  That was and is the problem. The solution was two senior counsel between them decided that they would run the case for the plaintiff and he would not be left without a senior counsel to look after his case at any particular time.</P>
    <P>This legislation is setting up, under pressure from the insurance companies which has been going on for years &mdash; it was going on when I was a member of the Incorporated Law Society and if I had not become a Minister in 1973, I would have been President of the Law Society in 1974 &mdash; to get rid of juries and two <Col N="236" /> senior counsel.  This pressure has been going on ever since and has been championed in the council chamber of the Incorporated Law Society by a clique of fashionable lawyers in this city who enjoy the patronage of the insurance companies. They have been fighting the case for the insurance companies and that is the reason this proposal to abolish two seniors is before the House.  The Minister in all his innocence tells us that he has a letter from insurance companies saying they will be good boys and will not take advantage of the poor fellow.  Why do they want this change?  I do not think it will reduce counsels' fees.  If there is a case which is to go on for a fortnight or three weeks with only one senior, the insurance company will not mind giving that senior an introductory fee of £3,000, plus £2,000 a day thereafter.  Counsel will certainly be paid.  However, if the man who ends up in a wheelchair for the rest of his life wants to take a case it will be at the real expense of the counsel, who will have to take the case on the basis that if he wins he will be paid but if he loses he will not be paid.</P>
    <P>I was against this proposal when I was a practising solicitor and spoke against it when I was a member of the council of the Incorporated Law Society.  I am still against it.  I have not much faith in these regulations.  My experience of nearly 30 years in this House leads me to believe that I am right.  How many people read the reports of the debates on the Justice Bills in 1924, 1936 and so on?  Of course people do not read them.  The report of this debate will not be read either.</P>

It took nearly 20 years to get the proposal into the House but it took almost as long to get the rod licence legislation into the Dáil.  Look at the mess that has created.

      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on the amendments and the proposals that now surround them.  I hope the Chair will allow a little latitude because the Minister indicated in his remarks that while he intends the section to stand he does not intend to introduce it.</P>
      <P>In the earlier debate on the central issue of this Bill, the abolition of juries, the Minister was heavily criticised by representatives of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats on the basis that he had accepted letters of assurance and written undertakings from the insurance industry that they would reciprocate the Minister's move towards the abolition of juries by ensuring reductions in insurance premiums subsequently.  We were told that legislation should not be hawked about in this way, that it was not the way legislation should be contemplated or addressed.  Yet, when we come to deal with this proposal, we are prepared to put it into cold storage on the basis of a similar undertaking.  I do not believe the Bar Council have committed themselves in writing to the Minister but they have indicated through their emissaries on the floor that they are prepared to meet the desires of the Government and of this House and to be good boys.</P>

      <P>I want to borrow the arguments used by Deputy McDowell, Deputy Barrett and others when they criticised the Minister in the matter of premium reductions and to use those arguments to good effect in relation to this section.  I am not satisfied that the Minister is merely putting in place an enabling section.  He has said &ldquo;nothing will be done until we see how matters go&rdquo;.  It is ridiculous that we are asked to discuss and deliberate while in the middle of that discussion we are told that nothing will happen on foot of enactment until we see how matters go.  What an elegant phrase in the context of legislative reform and what light it throws on us as a working Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party are not satisfied with this approach.  We are not impressed by the goodwill and good intentions of the Bar Council in this matter.  Their response to long-standing criticism of their work practices in the Four Courts is very slow.  They are indicating late in the day that they are full of good intentions.  The contributions made by a number of Deputies, especially Deputy Fitzpatrick who has many years experience, have indicated the resources and ingenuity in the Bar and elsewhere to get around the regulations, if they are put in place.  I gather, however, from what has been said tonight that the regulations will never be introduced.  In the interim they will do as they have done in past decades by making it seem to the legislators and to the public that what they are doing is in the best interests of the man of no or moderate means as he has been called here tonight.  So successfully have they pulled the wool over the Minister's eyes in this House in the last number of weeks that they will have no difficulty in pulling the wool over the eyes of the Minister and his successors and the eyes of the public generally in the next number of months or years or however long it goes on, in convincing people that what they have been doing <Col N="239" /> down there is motivated by the best interests of the public at large, and all the problems that have manifested themselves in this section will continue on and not be addressed at all.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I urged the Minister to put this section in place and not withdraw it in its entirety in concession to the Law Library lobbyists in the House.  My plea to the Minister tonight is to proceed with the regulations without delay and let them be back in this House to be debated.  It is in the light of the real intentions of this section that we will get any clear idea of whether the practices in regard to the conduct of cases in the Four Courts in future will go or not.</P>
    <P>I have to disagree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that the two counsel rule developed out of some altruistic motives of concern for the poor man of no or moderate means.  The two counsel rule developed as a skilful device of Bar Council mandarins who wanted to maintain control of as many of the lucrative cases as possible to enable them to control as much work as possible on any given day down in the Law Library; it was the means of bi- tri- or quadro location or whatever it is called where they could step into one courtroom and out of it and into another and move around switching and swopping, and at the kernel of the whole thing was surely control of the most lucrative work.  The real impetus for changing these regulations has not come from without, from public concern or clear understanding of what is going on down there, but from the demand for democracy within the Law Library itself, from the many hundreds of young, educated lawyers who are in there watching the fat cats cream it every morning as they waddle off to the round hall with their briefs stuck solidly underneath their oxters.</P>

      <P>Could I dissuade the Deputy and the House from drifting into a general debate on these amendment? I would much prefer that you related your remarks much more closely <Col N="240" /> to the amendments directly under discussion, Nos. 1, 14, 15 and 16.  There is a tendency for a general debate which is not appropriate on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling on that.  I take the Minister's point, but I wonder why we are debating these amendments at all, apart from that it is another opportunity to make a plea on behalf of the Law Library and its interests, because the amendments make absolutely no addition, good, bad or indifferent to what is already in the Bill? There is the expression &ldquo;if the Minister happens to be of the opinion that by reason of any practices&rdquo; etc., but that is the basis upon which a decision would be taken under the regulations in any event. I fail totally to see the reason behind the amendments in the name of the Progressive Democrats when it is quite clear that the Minister indicated to the House the last day that so long as his Government were in power he was not going to make the slightest effort to introduce these regulations.  It is sad that he indicated such and it must be commented on here tonight.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Barrett is welcome.  It is included in the Progressive Democrats' amendment.  It was clearly indicated that the Minister would accept that in principle but what of it?  The regulations are not going to be implemented.  An arrangement that is acceptable to the Opposition in terms of dealings with the Bar Council is utterly unacceptable when one comes to deal with the insurance industry.  Arrangements outside of the operations of this House in writing or verbally and totally setting at nought any purpose of intention in the section would seem to indicate that we are being made fools of in this House here tonight by the devices of the Bar Council to pull the wool over the eyes of the Minister, ably aided and abetted by their emissaries here on the floor of the House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to proceed with the making of the regulations.  Let us put this debate into context.  I would like to deal with what I believe is the <Col N="241" /> context of this whole debate.  Unless regulations include regulations to control the level of fees the number of counsel will not in any way affect the fees levied. If the number of counsel is reduced they will simply do what they are doing currently and have been doing for many years, that is, increase their fees to cover the fact that they cannot slip in and out from one place to another to maintain control or interest in a number of cases running contemporaneously.  The argument that it is inappropriate for this House to seek to regulate the work of barristers in this area cannot stand up to scrutiny.  The solicitors' profession is regulated by statute from top to bottom, perhaps not enough.</P>
    <P>There is an area that Deputy McDowell has indicated and I would join with him on this.  That is this percentage cream off by lawyers, solicitors in particular, of clients' fees.  It is an immoral and unjust practice that the Law Library is incapable of stopping because, again, the clique element that Deputy Fitzpatrick talks about controls it, and this is currently engaged in through the agency of solicitors by barristers themselves and will more so be engaged in and relied upon as a device to ensure the addition of counsel to the ticket so that bi- and tri-location schemes can continue as operate today. Therefore, to say that it is improper for us to regulate in this area does not stand up to scrutiny.  When the regulations come in they should be far more wide-ranging even than is intended in the two provisions that are being presented to us here tonight.</P>
    <P>In summation I am disappointed with the way in which we have stood back from this whole issue.  The good faith of the Bar is not as worthy as people make it out to be.  Regulations should be put in place.  We should not be afraid to ensure that this House has a voice in how justice is administered in practice as it currently does with one side of the profession.  It is time we looked to the other side.  I hope the Minister will accede to the proposition I am making that the regulations would be introduced and debated at length in this House so that we can see <Col N="242" /> how best to address the better administration of justice in the interests of litigants before the courts.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, Sir, in relation to the amendments, that I welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to accept subsection (3) of Deputy Colley's amendment No. 14 in any regulations that he might make.  For that reason I think that the main point which she and Deputy McDowell were trying to make in that regard has probably been made.  It would need to be carefully recorded in the Official Report of this House that that undertaking has been given, that this proposal, whereby one side will not be allowed a larger number of counsel than the other side, has been accepted.  Like most Members of the House I hope that the Minister or his successor will not have to resort to the making of regulations.  I believe that if something can regulate itself in the public interest it is better that this is done rather than having it done by formal legal regulations. I have no doubt, in view of the manner in which the Bar Council have tried to meet this matter, at least in very recent times, that they will continue to bear the public interest in mind.  I found that it was not as easy in more distant times to get them to do this.  The prospect of this legislation has had a marvellous effect on thinking over the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Colley is well-founded because the Long Title misstates the position, as does the side note to section 5 as it now <Col N="243" /> is.  In both cases there is a reference to a regulation of the number of counsel appearing in certain actions.  Section 5 does not purport to regulate the number of counsel appearing; it purports to regulate the number in respect of whom costs can be recovered on taxation.  That is a very different matter.  If the Bill set out to regulate the number of counsel who could appear for somebody, very probably it would be held to be unconstitutional. If I can afford to pay for half a dozen counsel, I have a right to have half a dozen.  On the other hand, if I have no money but have a just cause and a half a dozen counsel at my request are prepared to appear for me, neither the Minister nor anybody else has any power to tell them by regulation that they cannot appear for me.  I would ask the Minister to look at this matter again, perhaps in the Seanad.  It is not, perhaps, a major issue and does not affect the substance of the matter but what Deputy Colley has said is correct.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section 15, which is essentially the same as section 16, is being accepted and will be substituted for subsection (3).  It gives the House the opportunity to look again at this.  The negative resolutions which often appear in sections of Bills are useless.  It is only the Government that can move them, anyway, and since the Government have made the regulations, obviously they are not prone to annulling their own regulations.  The only method that is of any value is the positive regulation which must be passed. For that reason this section is welcome.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it still is a cause of some concern whether or not it will be possible to have these cases now heard without a jury outside of Dublin.  I raised this point on Committee Stage, moving an amendment to that effect.  The amendment was not proceeded with on an assurance given by the Minister that the Superior Rules Committee would prefer to make rules, and have power to do so, to allow cases to be heard as heretofore in, I think, six or seven centres outside of Dublin.  I have since checked that out with some members of that committee on whose <Col N="244" /> behalf this undertaking purported to be given.  They have not been consulted and know nothing about it.  They cannot give me any guarantee that the committee will make any such regulation.  The Minister cannot bind them to make any such regulation, although they are entirely free to do so if they wish.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister and the House to realise that one of the consequences of passing this Bill tonight in this form will be to confine a hearing of all these personal injury actions to Dublin.  Since thousands of these are heard in seven centres outside of Dublin every year, it will be a cause of great hardship and great expense if those thousands of hearings now have to be transferred to Dublin and all the litigants and witnesses transported to Dublin.  I would like the Minister's assurance in this regard and to know how he proposes to meet the case.  What he is doing now is preventing all these cases from being heard in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo and Dundalk, if I remember rightly.  I do not think that that is the intention of the House and I hope that it is not the intention of the Government, but it will be the effect of the passage of this legislation as it is unless, as it is hoped, the Superior Rules Committee make rules allowing these cases to be heard elsewhere.  They are under no obligation to do that, being independent.</P>

      <P>It is in everybody's interest that any regulations coming from the Department of Justice would be debated and discussed fully in this House and that, if necessary, there would be a resolution of the House in the form of a division before these regulations become law.  A very positive decision was taken by all members of the Bar Council and all practising barristers.  I understand that a very open, democratic vote took place resulting in a resolution calling for one senior and one junior barrister to appear in these matters.  That decision was taken before these amendments were brought forward and discussed in this House.  It is better to have any organisation, whether it be the Bar Council, the Law Society, a <Col N="245" /> trade union group, a farmers' organisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;acting on a consensus. This is to the advantage of all individuals appearing before the courts in these cases, whether plaintiff or defendant.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made a number of points about the Bar Council, one being that a number of leading barristers appear to monopolise a very considerable part of the market.  The Deputy would be honest enough to admit that, no matter what walk of life, or profession, or business you consider, a certain section of people will succeed better than others and obtain a greater share of the market. The Bar Council are no different from most other areas in this.  A number of senior counsel are most sought after by particular insurance companies on the one hand and by plaintiffs' solicitors on the other.  The democratic decision taken by the Bar Council will help to open up the areas.  Many of the barristers who, financially, are not so successful, who may be as good as, if not better than, many of the leading people, but whose abilities and talents have not been recognised, will get recognition because there will be a greater spread of business around the Bar Council.  That will be to the betterment of everybody.</P>
      <P>As a person from rural Ireland, who has been in practice going back quite a long number of years, I have come across individuals of very limited means and have taken cases on their behalf.  Most solicitors will also have come across people of no means.  Many barristers and solicitors are quite agreeable to take on running down or civil actions in which there are quite large profits.  However, in fairness to the young solicitors' society, the free legal aid group and others, I should point out that many barristers and solicitors are also prepared to take on the non-remunerative work.  I will not dwell on that point because it is not within the scope of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the passage of this Bill it will <Col N="246" /> still allow access to the courts for people of very limited means.  That is important because if I go to a junior counsel and later have to go to a senior counsel I can get information for a very small fee.  I am sure I speak for the vast majority of solicitors in rural Ireland when I say that, if I want to consult an expert on taxation or to clarify an abstruse point in regard to a matter of equity or title I can do so, and I hope that will continue.  There is plenty of expertise in the Bar Library, and indeed a number of our barristers and solicitors have gone to the courts in Brussels and The Hague and have made their case in a most competent manner. It also proves that our legal system is excellent.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that there has been a consensus in regard to this matter because the vast majority of Members were anxious to obtain it.  There is a certain amount of concern in regard to the last point made by Deputy O'Malley in regard to setting down a case.  Up to now you could specify whether you wanted a case heard in Dublin or in a different location.  There appears to be a difficulty as to whether you can have you case heard outside Dublin.  This matter came up on Committee Stage.  I do not want to put the Minister on the spot, but perhaps tonight or when the Bill comes before the Seanad we will have an opportunity of investigating it in detail and, if necessary, of introducing an amendment.  For instance, in Cork many of the surgeons attached to the hospitals like to give evidence in the courts there.  It saves considerable time and expense.  The lists in Dublin are much more lengthy and people cannot be sure when their case will be heard.  Perhaps the Minister will examine this matter closely and let me know if a person's action can be heard outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's amendment is very sensible and I urge the Minister to accept it.  It is important to get a consensus of opinion.  Over the years in matters of this nature there has been a considerable <Col N="247" /> amount of goodwill.  Indeed, it is fundamental to our whole democratic institutions to get consensus on matters of this nature and that is why I support it.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the replies from the Minister instead of the other contributors, although I appreciate the points made by them.  The Minister said that he is willing to take on board amendment No. 15 in the name of Deputy Barrett.  It is similar to amendment No. 16 in my name and therefore I will withdraw my amendment.  The Minister also said that any regulations coming before the House will include reference to the subject matter of subsection (3) of our amendment No. 14 evening up the balance between the two sides.  I accept the Minister's assurance that any regulations coming before the House will include that and I will withdraw amendment No. 14 on that basis.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that we cannot legislate for every situation.  I take strong issue with Deputy McCartan's remarks about having to bring in the regulations immediately, that we need regulations and that we should use them if they are there.  In any civilised society we should always strive to leave as much freedom with the individual as possible, and if it is possible for self-regulation to have effect in any institutions it should be allowed if it is in the public interest.  If it is possible for people to reach agreement there is no place for the State to step in.  I hope the Minister will not find it necessary to bring in these regulations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 13, after &ldquo;law,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to subsection (8) of this section,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, the trial of actions with juries to which section 1 of the Bill relates.  Obviously there are differences between the proposed phraseology in Deputy Colley's amendment and that contained in the amendment tabled by Deputies Taylor and Spring but the principle of them all is similar, that is, to provide in certain circumstances for the trial of actions in relation to negligence and personal injury actions by a judge sitting with a jury.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion the Minister took the view that there was something to be said for at least looking at the proposition that, in exceptional circumstances, there should be some way of permitting a trial of some of these classes of actions with a jury.  On that occasion I indicated I accepted the Minister's thinking, that is, that if one sets out some exception containing so much of a potential floodgate, if opened, it would effectively nullify the legislation, there would be no point in having the Bill at all.  It appears to me that the purpose of Deputy Colley's amendment is to be extremely restrictive of the right of people to seek a trial, in exceptional circumstances, with a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is there a reason for having a jury trial in exceptional circumstances?  It is simply this; there are occasions on which <Col N="250" /> for justice to be seen to be done, even in actions in respect of personal injuries, it is desirable that it should be seen to be done by a tribunal which is not a judicial tribunal alone.  The reason it is desirable that it should be done other than by judges can vary.  It is very difficult in advance to set out with precision the circumstances which could give rise to a case for an exceptional right to trial by jury. One that has occurred to me is that of a judge who is a defendant in a running down action, who has a good defence but his colleague on the bench feels massive pressure that the great phrase used in another context &mdash;&ldquo;He would wouldn't he&rdquo;&mdash; would be used in evaluating whether his defence was true especially if it turned on a question of credibility. Suppose a judge is driving home some day &mdash; it may seem a strange example &mdash; and knocks somebody down, according to the plaintiff, but does not according to himself.  This has been known to happen. Supposing, in those circumstances, it comes down to a question of credibility and a High Court judge tells his own insurance company: I did not cause the accident, or the facts are that I am innocent and it was all the fault of the other person.  If it comes to a swearing match; in those circumstances is it desirable that another High Court judge should be forced to disbelieve his colleague on the bench and accept the word of another witness against him?  Or, worse still, suppose he is disposed to accept his colleague's account, that he is disposed to believe him.  He may feel: what does the ordinary man in the street believe?  Three people are saying the judge is wrong but I do believe conscientiously, in my heart of hearts, he is telling the truth.  But nobody will believe that that is a bona fide judgment made by me of the facts; nobody is going to accept that this is me trying to be impartial because three people have sworn X, the judge has sworn the opposite; here I am in the middle trying to ensure not merely that justice is done &mdash; with which no judge has any problem &mdash; but that justice be <Col N="251" /> seen to be done.  He is sitting there, knowing that this is going to be very embarrassing; I am going to have to believe my colleague against two witnesses who say he is telling a lie and, in those circumstances, justice is not going to be seen to be done.  I suppose those circumstances are somewhat extreme.</P>
    <P>There will be cases in which, for various reasons, it is desirable that questions of fact be decided by a tribunal other than a judge because of the nature of the controversy or because of the nature of the people involved in the controversy.  I can think of other examples but I do not want to waste the time of the House. They are all wholly exceptional circumstances but if we do not legislate to enable some method to deal with them we will put in place a law which drives the law somewhat into disrepute, that prevents the law, in a sense, from avoiding circumstances in which these unsatisfactory side-effects will arise out of litigation.</P>
    <P>There are other circumstances in which I believe it would be desirable to have matters dealt with by a jury rather than a judge.  In those circumstances I believe it is correct to permit a fall-back position for the judicial system so that the Judiciary can do their best, not simply by themselves but by the administration of justice, by giving the greatest possible weight to the desirability of justice being seen to be done.</P>
    <P>In England in 1933 the right to trial by jury was scrapped in personal injuries actions.  It was not scrapped in the absolutely categorical, clinical way that the provisions of this Bill provide.  An exceptional circumstance was provided &mdash; I hear the simultaneous translation service going on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In exceptional circumstances in England there is a right to trial by jury.  That was left there in 1933 when the general right was abolished. Not only was it left there in 1933 but recently when the law was updated in <Col N="252" /> England that exceptional proviso was retained.  I do not know, and I have not been able to research it, but I can say this, that although many attempts have been made to invoke that exception, never once, to my knowledge, has somebody actually succeeded in persuading a judge of the English Queen's Bench, or whatever it is, that they should avail of that right, but it is there.  It may be that there have been many cases in which people have sought to invoke the right but I do not know of any cases in which it has been invoked and in respect of which the judge has actually ordered a trial by jury.  However, it does not take away from the general principle of what I am saying, that it is an extreme rarity in England.  In fact, it goes the other way; it proves that it is possible, in legislation, to allow for exceptional circumstances and to do so without opening the floodgates.</P>
      <P>Doubtless the Minister will be advised, and will receive a strong lobby from the insurance companies, against putting in any exception, contending that the lawyers and the Judiciary will get together and totally undo the purpose of the provisions of this Bill.  Undoubtedly he will be advised that that is the case because that will be the attitude of people who do not want any exception, who want to copperfasten this principle, ensuring that nothing ever moves before a jury again which has the character of a personal injuries action.  But the fact is that, in England, where this was done &mdash; and it is a similar jurisdiction &mdash; if there have been a handful of cases in the last 55 years since the right of trial by jury was abolished, I would be very surprised indeed.  There must be a tiny number. There have been many occasions on which people have made the case to a judge that they ought to have it and they have been refused, but there have been a handful of cases involving the kind of circumstances to which I have referred. The fact that in England the Judiciary have diligently and conscientiously confined it to a handful of cases seems to argue all the more strongly and coherently for allowing an exception here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> Deputy Colley has put her proposal for an exceptional right to trial by jury in very restrictive terms by stating that it should apply only where a judge of the High Court is satisfied that by reason of the existence of special and exceptional circumstances which he shall specify in his order, the interest of justice or of the public interest would be better served by such a trial with a jury.  When one goes before a judge in England with an application for a jury trial one is effectively saying to a judge that it is preferable that one of the judge's colleagues should not take this case and that there are good reasons why a colleague of the judge should not try the case but that it should be tried by jury.  One is in a sense affronting the dignity of the judge by saying that neither the judge nor his colleagues should try the case and that the case is so exceptional that it would be better tried by a jury of 12 ordinary people.  After this Bill has passed we will keep defamation and assault jury actions in the High Court, so the jurisprudence of juries and the machinery will all be retained whether or not this Act is passed.  I have no doubt that there are cases where it will be desirable to retain the special exceptional right to trial by jury.  The proof of the pudding in England was that retaining the exceptional right did not open the floodgates.  If the Minister cannot accept Deputy Colley's wording he should indicate whether, if someone can come up with a formula which preserves a special right by way of exception, he will entertain such a formula in the Seanad.  Will the Minister accept in principle that if a cast iron wording is devised he would consider it in the Seanad?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider a new wording in the Seanad, if the Seanad considers this before the end of the Dáil term?  There will be a time, for instance, when a judge is disbelieved by another judge and that would create a scandal in the system.  Is a judge to continue on the bench if one of his own colleagues has said that he is a liar, that his word is not being accepted?  That is something which will happen some day. Judges have been plaintiffs on occasions. I know of several who have been plaintiffs and I know the poor counsel who have had to be savage with them in crossexamination. It is a sad state of affairs if one of their own colleagues has to disbelieve them on their oath and what about the poor insurance company who has to fight a judge who is demanding damages for whiplash and another judge has to decide whether or not the judge is codding everyone and whether or not he is really in pain?  There are other circumstances. I know of one circumstance where a prominent person who is a Member of this House came before the courts and the question was whether he should or should not be accorded a trial by jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These issues arise.  We should think through the implications of this, because some day a judge will complain that his back is injured and he will be either believed or disbelieved by another judge. If he is disbelieved the scandal will be massive.  If he is honestly believed by the trial judge but there is evidence to suggest that he might be telling lies, there will be an equally large scandal.  There are certain circumstances where we must retain the right to decide questions of fact even in these kinds of accidents by a jury. It is not beyond the wit of the Minister to devise a cast iron formula to do this. If the Minister does not accept Deputy Colley's wording he should introduce another amendment.  However, what <Col N="255" /> Deputy Colley suggested is so restrictive compared to the English law that nobody could suggest that it would open a flood gate and would undo the purpose of this Bill.  Deputy Colley's wording is much more restrictive than Deputy Taylor's and I fully understand why Deputy Taylor has phrased his amendment in the way he has phrased it.  There are circumstances in which we will regret a cold clinical exclusion of juries.  On the last occasion I said that medical negligence cases could be such cases where the Judiciary may on some occasions not want to make the decision.  There are hundreds of other cases which it is hard to catalogue now but which I am quite sure should be the potential subject matter of a trial by jury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking to amendment No. 4 I endorse the comments on this subject made by Deputy McDowell.  The Deputy touched on one category of case in which it was appropriate to preserve the possibility of a jury trial.  The Deputy mentioned a case of negligence actions against a doctor.  That parameter should be broadened somewhat to include any case of a claim for damages for negligence against any professional person.  People might take the view that they might not get a fair trial in such an action before a judge alone because professionals by and large come from the same category of people as the Judiciary and there might tend to be a bias in the way a judge alone would hear a case.  That may or may not be well based, but for appearances it is very important that when a case of professional error is to be determined a jury should be provided.  This aspect, interestingly enough, was touched on in Blackstone's <i>Commentaries</i>, written 200 or 300 years ago, when Blackstone dealt with this class that a judiciary are drawn from and the important value that a jury system has in preserving the position of ordinary people.  It is worth giving a number of extracts from what was written all those centuries ago and to look at the situation as it is now, because his comments have the same force today.  In <Col N="256" /> relation to a jury trial he states at page 378 as follows that:</P>
      <P>...it is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals ...The impartial administration of justice, which secures both our persons and our properties, is the great end of civil society.  But if that be entirely intrusted to the magistracy, a select body of men, and those generally selected by the prince or such as enjoy the highest offices in the State, their decisions, in spite of their own natural integrity, will have frequently an involuntary bias towards those of their own rank and dignity: it is not to be expected from human nature, that the few should be always attentive to the interests and good of the many... But in settling and adjusting a question of fact, when intrusted to any single magistrate, partiality and injustice have an ample field to range in; either by boldly asserting that to be proved which is not so, or by more artfully suppressing some circumstances, stretching and warping others, and distinguishing away the remainder... This therefore preserves in the hands of the people that share, which they ought to have in the administration of public justice, and prevents the encroachments of the more powerful and wealthy citizens.  Every new tribunal, erected for the decision of facts, without the intervention of a jury, (whether composed of justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, judges of a court of conscience, or any other standing magistrates,) is a step towards establishing aristocracy, the most oppressive of absolute governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the point I am trying to make here &mdash; and a similar point was made by Deputy McDowell &mdash; is that where a person is alleging in a court a professional error on the part of a professional person that person will want, and reasonably is entitled to, a jury as <Col N="257" /> the arbiters of whether negligence has occurred in that professional conduct or not.  That is their right.  That is what the people want.  They want that in all cases in my opinion and that is something to which scant attention is being paid.  As evidence of the fact that they want juries it is open to any person bringing a case for trial to opt for hearing by judge alone if he or she wished.  If a person wanted to have any negligence action tried by a judge alone it was open to them to opt to do so in their notice of trial.  I suppose in 99.9 per cent of cases they showed what they wanted by opting for trial by jury.  The Dáil has reached the position where the Bill has passed both Second Stage and Committee Stage but I think we should have a care and recognise the fact that there are a very small number, relatively speaking, of special situations that require special attention and which require to be distinguished from the general rule.  If we bring in a broad sweep and throw all out in one effort and categorise all these actions as being of a basically similar essential point, the Dáil would be making a very grave mistake.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the case of professional negligence actions.  Most of the decisions in England that have been given by judges alone &mdash; or certainly some of those that I have read &mdash; have tended to take a rather harsh view against the plaintiff and have tended somewhat to lean towards favouring the professional person who was on trial in a civil suit for having made some professional error that could well have had devastating consequences on the plaintiff.  There has been that tendency to lean towards the profession. The only way to cope with that situation is to preserve the possibility of a person bringing a claim, under that heading, to have a jury trial, not necessarily in every case, not necessarily as of right but to leave it open for an application to be made to the judge to highlight a particular circumstance of any particular case and to leave it open to the discretion of that judge to order a trial by jury if he considers it appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>There is one other category that should <Col N="258" /> have a like possibility reserved and that is those few cases where the injuries are of a very severe and grave nature.  I am talking about people who find themselves as a result of an accident ending up as paraplegics or quadraplegics, and condemned to spend the rest of their lives in wheelchairs and all the horrific prospects that ensue for them.  Very often that happens to people in humble walks of life. The consequences for people who have suffered horrific injuries of that nature and whose whole lives and existences for the remainder of their days will depend on the response they get from a court, be it from a judge or from a jury.  Those people would feel that their interests would more reasonably be served in having the damages assessed for them by a jury.  The type of damages that have to be taken into account in such a case are damages that involve those every day needs, for example, care, nursing by day and by night, feeding the person, attending to their toilet needs, their linen needs, and so on, for the rest of their lives.  A person in that position would feel that a jury of their equals, of ordinary people who make up juries, would have a better down to earth understanding of what their needs would be for the rest of their lives.  In cases of very serious injury &mdash; there are not very many of them but they occur from time to time &mdash; in common with the other professional negligence cases referred to, and the comparatively rare cases referred to by Deputy McDowell, of a judge himself being involved, the possibility only should be there of a judge to exercise his discretion to allow that case and that plaintiff to have his case determined and his damages assessed by jury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to these amendments, I think it was Montesquieu who said that one should never give reasons for laws in laws and others have said that exceptions make for inequality and, ultimately, injustice. Deputy McDowell mentioned the case of High Court judges and the possibility of each of those having to try one another, exceptional as it might be.  There are <Col N="259" /> more Circuit Court judges in the country than High Court judges.  The jurisdiction in the Circuit Court is not to exceed £15,000 and the possibility exists, under present legislation, of a Circuit Court judge trying another Circuit Court judge. There are more district justices in the country than there are Circuit Court judges.  Indeed, there are more District Court justices in the country than there are Circuit Court judges, High Court judges and Supreme Court judges put together.  The possibility exists under present legislation with the jurisdiction limit in the District Court being far more of a district justice having to try another district justice in relation to a road traffic accident and having to make a judgment, and there is no provision for a jury.  If you are going to travel down the road of making exceptions you must be specific. Deputy McDowell has been relatively specific.  He stated quite clearly that he was using an example of High Court judges.  What I am trying to get across is that you cannot stop at that.  If you are going to make the argument that one judge should not try another, then you must go all the way down the road.  One must go on from saying that a High Court judge cannot try a High Court judge to saying that a Circuit Court judge cannot try a Circuit Court judge and a district justice may not try another district justice. Then we have to go a step further and say possibly that a district justice may not try a commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner.  Before we know where we are the whole thing is up in the air and people do not know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How far down the road can you go? For example should a district justice who listens every day to the local superintendent prosecuting given individuals have the right to try the superintendent in relation to a road traffic accident?  To go a step further, if it is the local sergeant who calls out the list for the superintendent, should the district justice have the power to try the sergeant?  Should a garda who is in a quiet squad, so to speak, on traffic patrol and who is before the <Col N="260" /> same district justice every day be tried by the district justice at all?  We are beginning to go round the mulberry bush and there seems to be no end to it.  For example, if a High Court judge is tried by a jury and an individual is not tried by a jury will people say the jury awarded the High Court judge more than the High Court judge awarded the ordinary citizen? Will they say then there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor?  I am afraid I make logical sense.  Making exceptions at any given stage in any walk of life is to create inequality.  Inequality creates injustice and, to use Deputy McDowell's phrase, by God justice is not seen to be done.</P>

We are now into the realms of justice for one not being justice for all, and in this terminology justice for all means no justice at all for some.  It does not make sense. If you are going to introduce a law for the professions and the judges and another law for the ordinary people you are creating a bad law.  A bad law is a law which the majority of the people deem to be unjust.  It is to encourage a class distinction.

      <P>The Deputy does not understand.  He should talk to Deputy O'Malley who knows about Marxist-Leninists and will explain exactly the basis upon which class politics are advanced and why they are tackled and objected to by some socialists.  We say they exist to be tackled.  The people on the right say they do not exist at all, so they will never be tackled.</P>
      <P>In addressing this amendment I want to put it in the context of the movers of the amendment, Deputy Taylor in particular, and myself on behalf of The Workers' Party, people who are extremely concerned about the very fact of the abolition of juries at all in the first instance.  In the context of amendment No. 2 being ruled out of order, the opportunity now has passed for debate on that major issue as has been debated here on Committee Stage and one comes to address what can be done with the given position that juries are effectively for civil actions in the main.</P>
      <P>I say to Deputy O'Donoghue and anyone else who has doubts about how one regulates the administration of justice that our Constitution establishes four square that justice will be administered by courts and judges appointed under the Constitution.  It is totally consistent with our concept of constitutional justice as administered by judges and courts that we allow courts to regulate under what circumstances and in what manner courts and court hearings are conducted.  It is not in the slightest inconsistent for us to leave the residual authority or power to a judge of the High Court to decide in what exceptional circumstances or cases one can rely upon the device of trial by jury as a means of achieving justice in a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to the Deputy's question about how far down the road do we go, I say to him that one goes as far as the amendments in either Deputy Taylor's or Deputy Colley's names allow, and that is not very far at all.  It is being addressed in these amendments.  I have no preference one way or the other.  The wording is more verbose in one amendment, but they achieve virtually the same thing at <Col N="262" /> the end of the day.  It is to recognise that there are always and often exceptional occasions when the courts should have the authority to decide in the interest of justice that in that case it is better that the hearing and issues be decided by jury as opposed to judge alone.</P>
    <P>I must admit I am not altogether impressed by the singular incident case Deputy McDowell used.  Previously he spoke in the cause of barristers; now it is in the cause of judges.  The point is well made nonetheless that the residual authority should be vested and rest in the judges of the High Court to decide the circumstances, exceptional one recognises, under which justice would be better achieved in that way.  This is an important safeguard for the litigant coming before the courts and is there in the interest of justice and justice being seen to be done.</P>
    <P>In the litany of instances proffered as Deputy O'Donoghue weaved the road, he wondered were we all going to slip down in this whole affair, I suggest to him, and as a practising lawyer he will have to concede, that a district justice does not hear cases against the person whom he or she knows well personally or has everyday business or dealing with. The judge rises and moves on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the best the judges of the District Court can do under their constitutional duties to achieve justice in their tribunal, in their courts.  In the High Court you are dealing with a far more rarefied surround and a much more exceptional circumstance that do not necessarily apply in the instance given in the terms of the District Court and the Circuit Court.  The point has been made <Col N="263" /> that you have the mechanisms ready to hand because they will be there for defamation, false imprisonment and assault instances.  The mechanism is available to call in the jury to decide in the very exceptional instance.  On the point of simply giving it as a safeguard device in a corresponding jurisdiction and jurisprudence in Britain, that type of exceptional clause has been there available for upwards of 50 and odd years.  This is a very modest proposal.  It highlights a very useful safeguard.  Despite the ingenious reasons the Deputy has woven to throw some doubt on the proposition, I commend the principle of the amendment to the Minister.  I hope the Minister will accept either of the amendments advanced in the names of Deputies Colley and Taylor.</P>

      <P>By a large majority the House decided to abolish juries in respect of personal injury actions but an attempt is now being made to bring them back through the back door.  In fairness to Deputies Colley and McDowell, this matter was raised on Committee Stage when they both referred to &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.  Since then I have been trying to visualise the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; they were referring to but I could not, with the exception of those outlined this evening.  Frankly, I do not accept those views.  I cannot see how a judge can decide in one case to grant a trial by jury while in a similar case another judge may decide to refuse it.  In such circumstances where does justice come in?  We will have to clearly define such a provision.  We must set out the circumstances in which a trial by a jury will be allowed.  To leave the matter for decision by a High Court is a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Colley refers to &ldquo;any party to any proceeding to which the section applies&rdquo; and so on.  That could cause enormous difficulties. Advice could be given to people to chance making an application for a trial by a jury.  There could be a great deal of inconsistency.  I am not convinced <Col N="264" /> of the arguments put forward by other Members that the ordinary punter will suffer to a great degree as a result of the abolition of juries.  There are no juries in the Circuit Court or in the Supreme Court but we have one rung of the judicial ladder that has had juries up to a short time ago.  Asking a High Court judge to decide on a certain amount of damages will not deprive a citizen of a particular right.  How many times, can it be argued, did a jury bring in a wrong decision?  We are all aware of decisions by juries that are open to question.  Awards granted by juries, not always on the high side, could be questioned.</P>
    <P>We either decide to abolish juries or not.  If I was to agree with Deputy McDowell in principle I would have to call for such a procedure in specific cases. I would not like to see a High Court judge having to go before another High Court judge.  For argument sake, in a negligence action against a doctor, I do not see how a jury are better qualified to decide that the doctor was negligent rather than a person who deals with similar actions almost every day of the week. I do not see how 12 people can decide to any better degree that a doctor was or was not negligent over and above what a High Court judge may decide.</P>

      <P>If that is the case, the Deputy will have to forgive my ignorance. I bow to the Deputy's superior knowledge of everything but, nevertheless, I will give my humble opinion on the subjects that come before me.  It is the Deputy's business to decide to accept that opinion or not.  Those Members who are not members of the legal profession at times can see things in a better light than those who are in the profession and it is important that all should remember that.  Deputy McDowell should give the House an example of the case he has in mind rather than saying one High Court judge migh be afraid to hear the case of another High Court judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> The Minister may accept the amendment before us or he may tell us that he will consider it between now and the debate in the Seanad.  I am prepared to accept such a move but I have not been convinced that there is any great need for such a provision now that we have abolished juries.  I can see why Deputy Taylor has tabled his amendment, because he was opposed to abolition of juries.  The best of luck to him if he can succeed in having an amendment accepted that would bring juries partly back.  I do not believe that the ordinary man in the street will not get justice as a result of the abolition of juries.  Unless the Minister can throw some light on this issue I am not inclined to accept the amendment before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is a consequential amendment, arising from the substantive amendment proposed in Opposition amendment No. 11, which I am opposing.  With regard to No. 4, the amendment proposed by Deputy Taylor is in conflict with the policy intention of the Bill that judges should replace juries to decide all the issues in personal injury and fatal injury cases.  The Deputy's amendment would leave a very wide discretion to the court to allow juries to continue for any special reason that found favour with a particular judge.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would reintroduce uncertainty, and possible litigation in the Supreme Court as to what cases or circumstances should still qualify for jury trial and depending on how the courts would interpret such a general discretion it could lead to the very wide availability of jury trials and this would certainly defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Also, the process of realising the benefits that are expected for the insuring public from the legislation could be made more difficult.  Plaintiffs who thought that they had a special case for claiming a jury trial, for whatever reason, would be even less reluctant to settle than they are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment refers to cases of serious injuries and the implication seems to be that such cases would not be <Col N="266" /> adequately compensated without a jury. I cannot accept any such implication. Damages awarded will consist of loss of earnings, past and future, and cost of future care, and the amounts of the awards for these items will be fixed by reference to expert actuarial and other evidence.  Damages will also include an amount of general damages for pain and suffering, which will be fixed taking account of the limit proposed a few years ago by the Supreme Court as a general rule for serious injury cases.  In the circumstances there is no basis for any contention that serious cases need a jury to do justice to them.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the proper course is to go all the way with the removal of juries in these cases, as was done in the case of the Circuit Court in 1972.  I cannot accept the amendment.  I am opposing Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage and again this evening Deputy McDowell suggested that jury trials should continue to be available at the discretion of the High Court in a personal or fatal injury case. He suggested that juries should be available for exceptional cases such as cases of medical negligence or motor accidents involving the Garda and cases in which the State is interested.  A similar point was put forward by Deputy McCartan and Deputy Taylor.  I have considered the matter very carefully since Committee Stage but I have to reject the suggestions that the Bill should be amended to introduce this discretionary element.  It certainly would be against the principle of the Bill and it would introduce uncertainty and could provoke appeals to the Supreme Court.  Depending on how the courts would interpret any discretion being given to them, it could result in juries being fairly widely available.  That would defeat the purpose of the Bill and I think the House would agree that I must ensure that that cannot happen.</P>

      <P>I could think of some interesting examples but that is beside the point.  That would be a very long list.  The Deputies gave their reasons in favour of the amendment.  Deputy Barrett was opposed to the amendment.  He did not agree with it in regard to the decision as to whether cases should be heard by a judge or jury because he would not rely on the wisdom of the judge to make a wise decision.  I thought that the judges who would be hearing cases would be omnipotent, that they could not make a mistake, that a single judge would always arrive at the right decision.  The whole issue was capped when the Minister came in.  He said it would be unwise to leave it to the judge to decide whether a case should be heard by a judge or by a jury because the judge would decide on something that found favour with him, with a particular judge.  This is the man who is going to decide the whole issue of the action.  What bee might he have in his bonnet about the class of people he <Col N="268" /> was hearing or the way the accident happened? What particular issue will find favour with a judge?</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that not alone is the issue of whether the case should be heard by a judge or jury to be left to the judge but the trial of the entire issue can be left safely with him.  I never heard a more absurd argument from a Minister in my life and I am surprised that he used it.  In my opinion he has made a unanswerable argument for the trial by jury system, by 12 wise and sensible men who will not have bees in their bonnets about anything; if they have, it will be a sensible mixture and not one large bee that will decide the whole issue.  These four people, for different reasons, do not want the judge to hear a case if it is a very serious case, or if the professional classes are involved and do not want issues to be heard solely by a judge because there might be something in it that would find favour with him and him alone or he would, for some other idiotic reason, come to the wrong decision.  All I can say is, God help the plaintiffs when these actions come before the judge.  I want to go on record again as saying that every case is an important and serious case when it involves the limb of a person, his expectation of life or pain and suffering.</P>

    <P>Libel and slander are to be left to juries.  Why?  Invariably there is no insurance company involved and the influence of the insurance company does not come through.  Assault by one person on another is not involved in this Bill. Why?  Because there are no insurance companies involved and the influence of the insurance company does not come through.  I venture to suggest that before this Bill is five years an Act there will be another lobby here&mdash;the lobby who will complain that his constituent cannot get his case brought to court and that he is being bullied about by adjournments and so on.  He may have had a counsel who was to appear for him and he disappeared because the case went on too long.  There will be all sorts of hardships and, as other people will call them, abuses.  The gentleman who, a few years ago, rose up as the <Col N="269" /> protector of the client of lawyers will now rise up in another form, to protect the lawyers from the failure to be able to get a case brought to court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to say that the thing that is furthest from my mind in this amendment is to bring back juries.  That needs to be said after listening to the contributions from a number of Members in the House, including Deputy Taylor on my right, who no doubt wishes to see jury trials in existence throughout the system.  I have consistently spoken in this House for the abolition of juries where personal in juries are involved.  The purpose of my amendment is a very narrow one.  It bears saying again, despite the eloquence of Deputy McDowell earlier, that justice being seen to be done is as much part and parcel of the judicial system as justice being done.</P>
      <P>I have grave concerns that if this Bill is passed as drafted, justice will not be seen to be done in a very small minority of cases, but those are the cases that will be visible, they will have a high profile, they will be written up in the newspapers and they will be on the lips of the people. There will be no getting away from the fact that the judicial system will be brought into disrepute by these few cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in my name is extremely restrictive.  One of the reasons I believe it stands above Deputy Taylor's amendment is that the judge when making an order would have to specify the reasons for making that order and there must be special and exceptional circumstances and it must be in the interest of justice or in the public interest. I cannot think of anything that is clearer than that, that the public interest or the interest of justice would require, in <Col N="270" /> special and exceptional circumstances that a trial with a jury would be required.</P>
    <P>The essence of my amendment is that it is restrictive.  I do not believe, as in Deputy Taylor's amendment, that the seriousness of the injuries or the actuarial evidence that might be brought forward should be part of the basis of an application for trial by jury.  They do not come within my reasoning for this amendment, which is that justice must be seen to be done.  I believe justice could be seen to be done despite the enormity of injuries or the seriousness of those injuries if a judge sat alone.  The difficulty is where one or other of the parties has a certain status &mdash; it could be a judge, a high-ranking politician, a garda or somebody who was seen by the rest of the community as part and parcel of the judicial system &mdash; and there is no doubt many people will assume a partisan approach will be taken by a judge sitting on his own in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Deputy O'Donoghue when he said we were implying there should be one law for the rich and one for the poor, one for the professions and one for the ordinary man.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I would dissociate myself from the remarks by Deputy Taylor in that regard because I do not believe the professions should be one of these special and exceptional circumstances. It should be a far more restricted than that.  Any negligence actions taken against the legal profession are unlikely to have caused personal injuries and, therefore, they would not be involved in the circumstances envisaged in my amendment.  It has to be far more restrictive than professional people up on negligence cases needing trial by jury.  I do not believe trial by jury is necessary in those cases.</P>
    <P>We are not looking for juries by the back door.  We want justice to be seen to be done.  The Minister has said he is not in favour of this amendment but I ask him to think again before this Bill goes to the Seanad.  I understand what he and Deputy Barrett said &mdash; as this Bill calls for the abolition of juries, let us do it, and then everyone will know where they <Col N="271" /> are.  I do not believe that is responsible. We are going to bring the legal system into disrepute.  It is not just for Johnny on the street who has a particular case and feels he will not get justice done; the difficulty is the whole judicial system will suffer because of one case.  It is essential that as a House we have regard to the wider implications of any legislation we pass and not just look at individual cases and exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that a judge would not wish to try a case involving another judge.  I am not concerned with the niceties or the feelings of the judge involved. What I and the Progressive Democrats are concerned about is how that appears to the public.  If it appears to the public that justice has not been done, then it is not the right way to try it.  That is the rationale behind this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor or the Minister said juries were abolished in the Circuit Court and there had been no untoward repercussions. I wish to remind them that at that stage there was, and still is, trial by jury in the High Court.  Therefore, juries were not abolished completely because there was the chance of going to the High Court if one did not have the opportunity in the Circuit Court.  There are circumstances where justice to be seen to be done would require a trial by jury, and those circumstances will still exist after the passing of this Bill.  They will be extremely rare but they will be there. Even if they were only to be used once in every ten or 15 years, it is essential that they are seen to be there as part of the judicial system.  As part of the wheels of democracy we should see that justice will be done.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of what Deputy McDowell said earlier about a case in England.  Many years ago jury trials were abolished but they allowed for such exceptions in a wider context than my amendment.  They trusted their judges.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made a number of very interesting points about what a judge should and should not be trusted to do.  Are we saying that a judge should be trusted with a judicial <Col N="272" /> decision but should not be trusted with the decision whether he should try that case?  In my view that is ludicrous.  It is only normal and natural that such a decision should be left to a judge with the proviso that he gives his reasons for making that decision, and the reasons must be in the interest of justice or the public interest in special and exceptional circumstances.  No floodgates opened in England and they have a wider interpretation than we do.  They trust their judges.</P>
    <P>I trust our judges and I do not see why my amendment, or a similar amendment which the Minister or his Department would be happy with, could not be introduced. I urge him once more to consider this and perhaps bring an amendment forward in the Seanad to make sure justice is seen to be done and that we are not throwing out the baby with the bath water.  It is essential that we have regard to the wider aspects and not just to the smaller individual circumstances which we have referred in this debate.</P>

    <P>I am introducing this amendment in response to the point made by some Deputies, in particular by Deputy McDowell, on the Committee Stage that the present text of subsection (3) of section 1 of the Bill could result in an injustice in genuine cases that involved both a claim for damages in respect of false imprisonment or intentional trespass to the person, and also a claim for damages in respect of some other cause of action, arising from the same event.  I accept the present wording of the subsection could be read as excluding a jury in such a case if, say, a claim for negligence were included in a plaintiff's claim as an alternative remedy.  This is a technical point which does not affect the principle of the particular provision of the Bill and I am prepared to amend the Bill to ensure that no injustice will arise for plaintiffs in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>My amendment has been carefully drafted to ensure that the High Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for claiming damages for false imprisonment and/or intentional trespass to the person before an action <Col N="279" /> that included, but was not confined to, such a claim could qualify for jury trial.</P>

      <P>I oppose the Minister's amendment.  I had hoped he might have given some attention in the opposite direction, in the direction reflected in some respects by the amendment in the name of The Workers' Party Deputies which is a repeat of what was included on Committee Stage and was not reached by reason of the Order of Business at that point and no vote was taken on the issue. I speak of the amendment in the name of the Labour Party Deputies seeking to try, in some way, to achieve a balance in this legislation.  The Minister, in fact, is weighting the balances even more in his own favour and that of Government by ensuring that every possible loophole is closed and that juries are excluded as watertightly as possible from ever being involved in actions of the kind contemplated by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Observations and points were made on Committee Stage about the ingenuity with which lawyers address their minds to drafting pleadings in such a way as to bring as many of the potential actions as they felt would benefit from jury trial under the provisions of the exceptional clauses within the Bill as it stands.  To avoid that charade and untidy practice The Workers' Party have proposed that the problem be squarely addressed.  The way to do that is to consider that actions that comprise, wholly or partly, a claim for damages for false imprisonment or intentional trespass should not then be denied the right to trial by jury and recognise the complexity of actions, the mulitplicity of causes that can arise from any one incident and the desirability of not simply confining the exception only to the very narrow base of false imprisonment and intentional trespass proposed by the Minister.  Now the Minister, in this cleverly drafted legislation, has brought in a further restriction that enables a party to move a motion within seven days of the notice of trial, or at such time thereafter as the court allows, to have drawn out of <Col N="280" /> the arena of jury trials such action as the court might be asked to decide.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister's direction in this. I regret profoundly that he has not made any effort at all to address the concerns of those Deputies who approached this whole problem by asking him to, in some way, liberalise the regime to allow for the fact that there can be a multiplicity of causes of action arising from any one incident and that they should not be excluded simply because they include a claim for damages for negligence on grounds other than trespass or false imprisonment.  There is a profound change being introduced in the Minister's Bill in abolishing juries absolutely in this area, but there is in place in any event a whole jury mechanism, so addressing this problem would not have been a terrible inconvenience, recognising the very minute proportion of all actions, 0.2 per cent, that at the end of the day seek to have a hearing by a jury of their cause even though the facility is there.  Recognising all of that, we had hoped the Minister might, in some way, have eased up on his hellbent intention of wiping out trial by jury.  I greatly regret it.  I made my remarks as brief as I have because we have chased this matter at length on Committee Stage to no avail, which is, again, regrettable.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 can be put aside quickly.  It is merely consequential on amendment No. 8 being acceptable.  The issue centres on what is included in amendment No. 8 and that is what I would like to address briefly.  Again it is mirrored by the amendment in the name of Labour Party Deputies.  We are again seeking in some way to soften the blow of this legislation.  It is founded on a firm belief that it is not a progressive step but one that will have profound adverse effects upon the administration of justice, the quality of justice and the attempts and duties to see that justice is done in our courts.  We are fundamentally divided on that point.  It was a point on which the Fianna Fáil Party agreed with the Labour Party and the Workers' Party when in Opposition, when this matter was first moved before the Dáil.  The have turned about in the matter and we have a very firm division now in the House and a very clear majority on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is sought on behalf of The Workers' Party in these amendments is to respect in some sense, at least, the position of those litigants who have already started their cases, have set them <Col N="282" /> down for hearing, or issued writs to pursue.  I made the point on Committee Stage that the decision to issue a writ is very important and fundamental, not taken lightly by a litigant.  It is taken in the pursuit of justice, of compensation for injury done.  One of the factors that would be considered by lawyers advising a litigant, particularly where the writ is issued in the High Court, is the very real possibility of the availability of a jury to hear the issues and decide the facts of the case.  This amendment seeks simply to respect the grounds upon which the decision was arrived at and to allow, in all those actions that were commenced before the passing of the Act, the right to select trial by jury if so desired, on the advice of lawyers, or otherwise.  I believe that it is likely that in few or no such actions would there be election for jury trial, given the statistical base upon which they have proceeded in the past.  It is, nonetheless, incumbent upon us as legislators to seek in some regard to have respect for the views and decisions of litigants in the initiating of their proceedings. If ever there was legislation in which the knee was being genuflected to all sorts of interests, this is one.  We have genuflected to the interests of the insurance companies on the basis of a letter from them telling us that they will behave like good boys and that nothing should be brought to bear too heavily on them.</P>

      <P>We have prostrated ourselves before the Bar Council on the basis that they have told us that they, too, will be good boys if the legislation is not brought to bear too heavily upon them.  We are asking the Government to make a very small gesture to those litigants, whose decision was partly based on the availability of a jury to hear their action if they so desired.  It will not have a great bearing on the consequences of this legislation.  It is not a back door.  It is simply the closing of the door more gently on the fingers of those litigants <Col N="283" /> clutching on desperately in the hope of an opportunity of a hearing before a jury. It will not do down the legislation or cause any huge rush of litigation and, at the end of the day, the Government may not be troubled by this amendment at all. This small gesture would represent much in terms of the immediacy of the implementation of the legislation.  I am at a loss to see why the Minister cannot respond a little more favourably than he has in the past.</P>

      <P>The effects of the amendment would be to allow jury trial to continue for all personal and fatal injury cases where proceedings had been issued, that is, had commenced, before the commencement of the Act.  The provision in subsection (3) of section 6 of the Bill is also relevant to this matter.  It contains a commencement provision to bring the provisions of the Bill into effect on 1 August 1988.

      <P>Who does he think will benefit?  Does he think that the people of Ireland who have to have recourse to the courts will benefit from this measure that he is introducing here?  I am sorry to have to disillusion him.  It will be of no benefit to them.  There may be benefits to the insurers, the big insurance companies, those large corporations and so on.  The ordinary people of Ireland certainly will have no benefit.  It ill behoves the Minister to say that he is in a great hurry to get this Bill through because of benefits. The logic of that escapes me entirely.  The object of this exercise &mdash; let us call a spade a spade &mdash; is to reduce the damages that ordinary people have been getting and are entitled to get for what they have suffered and lost.  To do them down is the purpose of this measure.  It is to damage them and to help the insurance companies, to boost their profits.  They are the people that pressed for it, that want it.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inconsistencies of many of the comments made in this debate I find rather disturbing.  The contradictions in some of the comments made by Deputies Barrett and Colley, in particular, quite frankly have me flabbergasted.  On these similar amendments in the names of The Workers' Party and the Labour Party, is it all that unreasonable to propose, when a course of action has been initiated based on a certain premise that juries are available and those proceedings are under way, that we maintain the set of circumstances that existed when the writ issued, when they got their proceedings under way?  Is that asking too much or does this sledgehammer action have to be brought in?  There is such a thing as retrospective legislation.  To deal with a situation otherwise than to provide that the Bill will apply only to cases where plenary summonses have issued after the date of its passing is, for all practical purposes, retrospective legislation.  That must be utterly deplored.  There is a rule that one should avoid retrospective legislation. When a person had already issued a writ a month or a year ago, that was done in the expectation and knowledge that a certain set of circumstances existed <Col N="285" /> and would follow.  It has always been the law that they are entitled to a jury and they issued their writs on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Deputy who interrupted, not I.  When a writ is issued and the proceedings are under way, based on a certain set of legal rules, that claim ought to be allowed to continue under those rules.  The interests of justice require that.  Deputy Colley is anxious to achieve justice, but justice requires, when that was the legal position when the writ was issued, that it be allowed to follow through on that basis.  I see no need for the Minister to suggest that that is going to interfere with the passing of his Bill, or its coming into operation. If either amendment No. 8 or No. 9 is accepted, the saver is there.  The Bill will be in operation and will apply to actions starting from now, which is right and proper.  There will be a saver for those cases which are already under way.  It is strange, to say the least, that in this Bill as originally introduced there is a provision that it would not apply to cases where notice of trial had been served and that when a notice of trial had been served the person would still be entitled to a jury if he or she wanted one.  I thought then that that was going too far and that a reasonable test for a time cut-off would be when the plenary summons was issued.  The Minister is now bringing in a sledgehammer by providing that, even where no notice of trial has been served, actions which commenced perhaps two, <Col N="286" /> three or more years ago, when nobody was thinking of abolishing juries, would be affected.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes it even worse by saying that unless the trial has started the jury has to go.  Was it necessary to go to that extreme on this issue?  What kind of pressures were brought to bear, or why was it thought necessary to alter even the notice of trial provision which was in the Bill as introduced?  That was quite outrageous, but the Minister has now made it even worse by saying that the action has to be under way before you can get a jury.</P>
      <P>I do not understand it.  These amendments are reasonable and fair and they negative the retrospection being introduced in the Bill.  I urge the Minister to rethink this issue.  The House should not lend itself to the pressures of bringing in retrospective legislation.  Many of these plenary summonses could have been issued a year ago or more and they should be allowed to see them through under the existing system.  The number of cases affected is not great and the system will be phased out in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea by Deputy Taylor to the Minister to reconsider this matter because there is something essentially unjust in changing the goal posts when the game has started.  In effect, this is what is happening.  When people commence the expensive, worrying and difficult process of litigation on the basis of a certain litigious regime being available to them and then, at some stage after the action has commenced, they find that something as fundamental as the presence of a jury to hear their case will be removed, the goal posts have been moved with a vengeance.  The predicament of that person could be extremely serious and an injustice could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that if he or she had known when the action commenced that he or she would be involved in a lottery as to which judge would hear the case, that person might have had second thoughts about bringing the action.  If the <Col N="287" /> whole law is changed people will then have to face a new situation before the action is commenced, but if a person commences an action in the expectation of a jury and after the commencement finds that he or she will be involved in a lottery as to which judge, with all the inbuilt &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo;, although I referred on the last occasion to the inarticulate major premise of a particular judge &mdash; which may affect his view of that action, it is potentially a very unjust situation.</P>
    <P>It points up the contradiction or dilemma of what we are doing: we are removing juries for personal injury actions but we are leaving them for actions for defamation.  Where is the logic in that?  If we feel that juries are necessary to do justice to a citizen who has been defamed, why is there not an equal logic to say that a jury is necessary to do justice to a citizen who has been personally injured?  I do not know the answer, but there seems to be an inherent contradiction. By reserving juries for defamation actions there is an admission that juries are essentially the arbiters of absolute or pure justice in so far as the system can deliver it.  I mention that as a general point against the whole concept of abolishing juries.</P>

      <P>I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the prediciment of a person who has embarked on an expensive and worrying course of litigation and who now finds that the goal posts have been changed. That is essentially unjust and there is no gainsaying that fact.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that when a person decides to bring an action for hearing before one tribunal, namely a judge and jury, has incurred considerable costs and has got as far as serving notice of trial, one of the last steps before he arrives in the Four Courts or wherever the action is being held, is that he should suddenly be told that he will not be tried by a judge and jury because the tribunal has been changed and he will now be heard before a judge only.  As Deputy Cooney said, perhaps the fact that the trial would be before a judge and jury had a very big influence in deciding whether the action would be launched.  As Deputy Taylor said, to have retrospective legislation which will change the tribunal to hear the action is fundamentally wrong.</P>
      <P>The longer this debate goes on, the clearer it becomes that it is not about the administration of justice or seeing that a person is adequately compensated for injuries received at the hands of a motorist or employer.  It has nothing to do with that because the Minister said that he could not agree to it as it would delay the benefit that the Bill will bring.  Who will it benefit?  The injured person?  The person who seeks the aid of the court in his action against stronger forces?  Not at all. These benefits will come to a third party at the expense of the injured person who has been mutilated or deprived of his earning capacity for the rest of his life. That is the enormity of what we are doing here.  If we were doing it in exchange for a proper, free legal aid system that would be something, saying to people: you can only bring an action if you have reasonable grounds for doing so; if you have those reasonable grounds, the State will come to your aid, ensure that a proper legal team presents your case to the court and has expert witnesses there.  But that is not so.  The old Irish solution to an Irish problem is being abolished and replaced by absolutely nothing.  I honestly believe we will rue the day we will do this.  We will be forced into introducing a free legal aid system to cover running down actions, personal injuries actions and so on.</P>

      <P>It will, but it will take a long time because that lobby will not be as powerful as is that of the insurance companies, but as soon as the provisions of this Bill are implemented we will have to introduce free legal aid. There has been a free legal aid system operated by the Law Society under the United Kingdom Government for almost the past 50 years.  There, if a person has a stateable action which he may win or lose, his legal team are paid for at the expense of the State or some fund operated by the State.  We are not proposing that.  Oh, no, we are big fellows: we are mighty generous; we are mighty generous with other people's bones and bodies, with the insurance companies.  We are generous in endeavouring to get young people to believe that premiums will tumble but I venture to say they will not.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to most of the discussions on this Bill.  I am beginning to believe that those of us who consider, rightly or wrongly, that the abolition of juries will not introduce a great deal of injustice into our system means that, for once, we will face up to reality.  I have listened to much talk about the right of the individual to get this and that but would somebody please tell me who will pay for it?  I contend that what will be done will be the abolition of compulsory third party cover.  Perhaps that is what should be done so that I and others will not have to carry the can for those who do not arrange insurance cover on their vehicles.  Then we will ascertain who will pay for the awards handed out every day in our courts, whether by a judge or jury.  Whether we like to believe it or not, the reality of life is that there are large numbers of people who do not insure <Col N="290" /> their motor vehicles, resulting in others having to carry the can for them.  It should be remembered that the insurance companies have a facility known as Motor Insurers' Bureau fund out of which awards are consistently paid which they are not entitled to do.  It should be remembered that those awards are being paid by mine and other people's money. That practice cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>I am not here to defend insurance companies, or any other vested interest group.  Hopefully, I am here to face reality just like the reality we have had to face in the amount of money to be spent on health, education and farming relative to the amount of taxes collected. The principle of insurance is exactly the same; if one wants to pay out more then one must collect more but the question must be asked: who will pay?  The answer is that it will be I and every other citizen who will pay.  I want to ensure that those who are severely injured will get a fair deal.</P>
      <P>I do not accept for one moment that because it will be a judge alone deciding whether it should be £100,000 or £120,000 that should be awarded, that a plaintiff will not get a fair deal.  After all, there is the recourse to the Supreme Court, which has always been the redress of somebody who feels they are not getting a fair deal and remember, juries do not sit in the Supreme Court.  The reality is that, when we talk about benefits, we are talking about people who must pay large premiums every day of the week.  If one wants to get at insurance companies, then I suggest that one introduces a new system of taxation but do not let it be me and others who must carry the can for those who refuse consistently to pay insurance cover on their vehicles.  Yet, when they are in court they are handed down a mediocre fine that does not encourage them in any way to pay what they should.  I am all in favour of the retention of juries once that is not done at the expense of the ordinary individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> Let us decide whether we should introduce legislation to abolish compulsory third party insurance cover in respect of motor vehicles because, if that is done, then it will be a free market, then those who want to insure can do so but there will be no onus on anybody to carry the can.  For far too long in this country we have spoken about rights we cannot afford.  We cannot afford to pay out vast sums of money in that manner.  If we had had annuities or some other methods of payment they would have been more realistic.  It is wrong to imply that those who have taken the difficult decision to abolish juries in personal injuries actions are doing so without compassion.  It is wrong to suggest that.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that I and others who have taken that decision are doing so in order to increase the profits of insurance companies.  That is not true.  I am here to defend every individual who is at present obliged by the law of this land to insure against third party liability if they own a motor vehicle.  Perhaps we should decide to abolish that obligation, retain juries and have a free-for-all but as long as everybody is obliged to have third party cover then the premiums chargeable should be realistic.  Perhaps we should even consider nationalising motor insurance if that would satisfy some people.  Then we would ascertain whether our taxpayers would carry the losses incurred on motor insurance in recent years.  We would then ascertain whether people were prepared to pay increased taxes for that luxury.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that there should go into the record of this House the implication that those of us who support the abolition of juries, for practical reasons, are doing so in an inhumane and uncompassionate way.  That is totally wrong.  It is also wrong to suggest that we are concerned only with increasing insurance companies' profits because that is far from the truth.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Minister for Industry and <Col N="292" /> Commerce to ensure, before he allows an increase in premiums, that the profits made by insurance companies are taken into account, that is, the profits made by them on the investment of motor premiums collected.  Of course he should take investment profits into account.  It is up to him to decide he will not agree to an increase in premiums if that is the way he wishes to go about it.  Because of the vast increases that have taken place over the last five or ten years more and more young people are not bothering to get third party liability cover.  What happens then when they injure an individual? Who will pay the bill if a person becomes a paraplegic after an accident, whether the award is by a jury or a judge?  What will happen if there is no Motor Insurance Bureau and if I and others say we are not going to contribute part of our premium income towards this Motor Insurance Bureau?  Who will pay that unfortunate person?  Will he have to claim personal damages against an individual who may not have a shilling?  That is the reality of what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about the injustice of abolishing juries, but the experience to date is that the premia collected are not sufficient to meet the claims made.  In other European countries that situation does not arise because one does not even have to have passenger cover.  If one is a passenger in a vehicle in Greece and one has a serious accident there is no insurance company to pay out damages because passenger cover is not compulsory, whereas in this country it is compulsory to have passenger cover. There was a girl in my constituency who was involved in a car accident while on a holiday in Greece and she suffered multiple injuries including severe brain damage.  Her parents even had to collect money to bring her back from Greece because there was no insurance company to pay up.  That does not happen here, and I am proud of it.  But at the end of the day we have to decide whether or not we can afford to pay out vast sums of <Col N="293" /> money when the kitty is getting dry.</P>
    <P>I hope that between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Justice insurance companies will be brought to heel and that they will not be granted increases in premia without taking into account their investment profits.  If the situation we hope will not arise as a result of this legislation does arise and there are abuses, I hope somebody will have sufficient courage to come back in here and call for the reintroduction of juries because the man in the street is not getting a fair deal.</P>

      <P>I had intended to have little or nothing to say in reply to the debate on this amendment because everything that could be advanced in the cause of this amendment was advanced on Committee Stage and was mirrored again here.  The Workers' Party introduced this believing that it was a small measure that would in some way cushion the shock of the introduction of this proposal in the Bill.  I would be happy to leave matters as they were, having listened to the wise counsel and words of two of the most senior lawyers and practitioners in the courts, both Members of the Fine Gael Party, who have contributed to this debate.  It is a pity that their spokesperson for Justice could not have listened more attentively to some of the things they had to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party, in opposing this Bill and seeking to promote this amendment, did so on the clear statement that no benefit would emanate from this legislation <Col N="294" /> for anyone.  It is foolhardy in the extreme to suggest that benefits will accrue.  If one is to take up Deputy Barrett's arguments, the insurance companies are in such a pickle that they are running at a loss &mdash; that is a new poor mouth story for me &mdash; and if that is the case this legislation will be of no assistance to them.  It will certainly not benefit the administration of justice.  It will not benefit the people who want to go to court to seek justice, it will not benefit the administration of justice generally and it will not benefit the people who pay insurance premia, because the insurance companies will not pass on the benefit to the insured persons if they can avoid it. Nothing illustrates that better than the point Deputy Barrett made.  At the commencement of this debate about six weeks ago the Deputy talked in the context of insurance companies bringing down premia as a result of this legislation. In the last dying moments of this debate, with the kick that Deputy Barrett can give to the debate, the Deputy tells us that what we are really talking about is not allowing the insurance companies an increase in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole notion of a decrease has gone out the window.  The notion that the insurance companies will reciprocate this legislation by a decrease in their premia is gone.  What they are now talking about is asking the Minister to look at their books and see what profits they are making when they come in looking for the next increase.  That is the context in which we are now debating this fundamental legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make the point very clearly that there are rights which we can and must afford and they should not be up for sale at any price.  One of those rights is the right to trial by jury on issues of concern before the courts.  We are selling that <Col N="295" /> right cheaply here tonight with no benefit in return.  Deputy Barrett appears to support this Bill, so why can he not sit on the other side of the House and sit beside the Minister.  This Bill is his work.  It is his proposal.  It is a great pity that there is not unanimity in the Fine Gael Party on the issue.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of compassion here. This is a cold piece of legislation.  The right involved here is a right which we have always described in this House as a safeguard mechanism available to those at the end of a very long process who might on an occasion have recourse to trial by their peers.  That is the essence of jury hearings &mdash; a recognition that there is a higher authority than judge alone, that there is a higher authority of the law-maker. We, the community, can appoint delegates on our behalf to be a higher authority and adjudicator based on no other reason than that we are the peer group of the person coming before the court and we bring with us the experience of the life, the circumstnces and the surroundings to which that litigant comes and seeks justice.  That is what it is all about.  When one gets down to looking at the balance sheets of insurance companies and the profit and losses of the shareholders and directors of insurance companies, that implies a notion and those principles mean very little and that <Col N="296" /> they can in fact be sold.  Deputy Barrett has not listened to a word of this debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We pay nothing towards the cost of running the jury system by way of administration.  The jury system adds nothing to the cost of administration because juries are so rarely if ever employed and their impact on awards is in line with what judges are doing at the moment anyway.  At the end of the day even if you vary premium awards you will not get a change in premium levels because the insurance companies simply will not pass them on, and Deputy Barrett has told us that tonight. We are now at the close of this debate talking about holding insurance companies back when they come to look for the next increase.  We have sold the right to jury trial very cheaply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At this late stage of the evening I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter, the subject of a Private Notice Question I tabled today.  I tabled it because I felt an unprecedented warning had been sounded by senior medical staff in one of the most important hospitals in the country and I was a little dismayed when that Private Notice Question was ruled out of order on the grounds of lack of urgency.</P>
      <P>Last night the hospital manager of the Meath Hospital, Mr. Eddie Thornhill, admitted that 23 people were being cared for on steel trollies in that hospital yesterday as a result of the health cuts imposed by this Government.  Last week 43 beds were closed in that hospital and a further seven beds, according to the hospital administrator, are due to close in the near future.  I think the comments of the senior medical staff in the Meath Hospital are worth reading into the record of this House.  They are not the comments of a partisan politician or somebody trying to make political capital of an issue.  They are a cry from the heart from over-burdened and stressed medical staff who have come to the end of their tether and can cope no more in a hospital system deprived of urgently needed resources.  I want to quote from today's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senior Registrar Dr. John Manson complained bitterly that so many beds had been closed down because of health spending cuts.  He said that lives were being put at risk because of the measure: &ldquo;We have patients who had <Col N="299" /> emergency operations during the night being put back on trollies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another senior registrar, Dr. John Black said that elderly patients could be in danger of a fall from a trolley, or developing bed sores on the hard surface.</P>
    <P>Dr. Manson confirmed: &ldquo;It is an unfortunate position that people could die.  We have already had a number of near misses with patients, being recognised to be very seriously ill having to lie on a trolley with major bleedings problems and no beds available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Manson said that the problems had increased in the past few months.  &ldquo;We kept on working under these conditions because we were under the mistaken impression that somebody or the Government would see what was happening and do something about it.  But nothing is being done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Manson added: &ldquo;There is a lack of realisation as to what the health cuts actually mean in the hospitals.  We are not being allowed to treat our patients properly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are the comments of the senior medical staff charged with the responsibility of providing health care in an important national hospital.  Unfortunately, the problem is not confined to one hospital.  The entire health service is on the verge of collapse and the Government, and the Minister in particular, have nothing on offer but the prospect of more cuts and further closures.</P>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil came to office, between full hospital closures and bed closures in those hospitals that Fianna Fáil have not closed something approaching a staggering 4,000 beds have now been taken out of service.  There has been a consequent job loss for people engaged in the health services numbering at least 2,000 at the latest count.</P>
    <P>One must ask: what does it take, what evidence needs to be provided, who needs to make the appeal before the Minister realises the extent of the crisis in <Col N="300" /> the health services?  When will he change course?  My words of exhortation are ignored, but can the Minister continue to ignore the senior medical staff?  As a society we have had some difficult decisions to make.  We are faced with a financial crisis, but the question we must now address is: who is to pay for the financial crisis we have?  Surely the answer cannot be that we resolve our financial difficulties on the backs of the weakest, the most vulnerable and the sick.</P>
    <P>All the cutters in this House, be they on the Government benches or on the Opposition benches in Fine Gael or the Progressive Democrats, have now got to answer this dilemma.  They have put forward as a virtue the notion of cost-cutting, the notion of savaging our health budgets and have exhorted the Minister to sterner and further cuts in the future. They now must examine their consciences, as the Minister must because he is the person with ultimate responsibility for the health and well-being of the people of the nation.</P>
    <P>I should like to put one simple and direct question to the Minister: what is he going to do to save our health services? Like Nero of old, is he going to stand idly by and, in the words of the medical people at risk and allow some people to people at rick and allow some people to die and be forgotten?  The crisis now must be recognised by the Minister and I exhort him to look at the problem in the Meath Hospital because that is a reflection of the real crisis that exists in every major hospital here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that the accident and emergency service for south Dublin is at present being provided by St. Vincent's Hospital, St. James's Hospital and the Meath Hospital.  The Meath Hospital have a transfer arrangement with the Adelaide Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MANCH &mdash; Meath, Adelaide, National Childrens Hospital &mdash; agreed in <Col N="301" /> mid-1987 to accept additional responsibility for accident and emergency services previously provided at Dr. Steevens Hospital and also to accommodate orthopaedic services from Dr. Steevens Hospital.  To accommodate these additional services provision was made for urgent upgrading of the accident and emergency department at the Meath Hospital and the building of additional theatre facilities and recovery areas in both the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals. This work was completed on schedule and has greatly improved the facilities available to the medical and nursing staff in both hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would however accept that the facilities are not ideal, but it must be appreciated that it is an interim arrangement. The fact is that in a few years the Meath Hospital with the MANCH hospitals will transfer to Tallaght.  In this regard I am pushing on with the completion of the design of Tallaght Hospital with all possible speed &mdash; I recently approved stage 4 planning which is the penultimate stage of design.  There will be no delay as far as I am concerned in the building of Tallaght Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the allegations made by the doctors involved.  The Meath Hospital's revenue allocation, for example, was increased from £8 million in 1987 to £9.45 million in 1988, an amount of money which should clearly enable them with proper management of their resources to provide an adequate service to meet essential needs.  The Adelaide Hospital budget was increased from £5 million in 1987 to £6.25 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>The amount of taxpayers' moneys provided in both hospitals certainly does not warrant a hospital surgeon going on radio to advocate that patients that can go private should do so because they could not be catered for.</P>
    <P>In this respect I have instructed the chief medical officer of my Department and an Assistant Secretary of my Department in charge of acute hospitals to make <Col N="302" /> contact with the management of the Meath Hospital to undertake an immediate examination of the use of resources and the manner in which co-ordination of activity between the Meath and the Adelaide hospitals is working particularly at the consultant level.  It has been suggested to me that when there were patients on trolleys in the Meath Hospital there were the same number of vacant beds available in the Adelaide Hospital. I am also having this aspect of the matter inquired into and also the level of consultant staffing available in the accident and emergency services unit of the hospital.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am also having the allegation that patients developed bed sores at the casualty department investigated and also how this could have arisen.  I have also asked the officers concerned to find out could there be any basis for the statement by one of the doctors involved that patients should seek private treatment in circumstances in which the combined allocation of the Meath and Adelaide hospitals is £15.7 million in 1988 an increase of £2.73 million in that year over the year 1987.  When I receive a report on the examination I will consider what action it is necessary for me to take.</P>
    <P>I should say also that no attempt was made to use the normal channels of communication which exist within the hospital and with my Department to discuss the problems which were arising. There are and have been regular formal and informal contacts with me and with officers of my Department on a variety of issues which have arisen from time to time, particularly since the transfer of services from Dr. Steevens Hospital.</P>
    <P>I am confident if the normal procedures had been used in this instance they would have, as in the past, resulted in the resolution of the problem and avoided the unnecessary distress caused to patients and their relatives.  Such distress caused to patients and their relatives is out of character with the fine tradition over the years of these two excellent hospitals.</P>

      <P>A number of reports in recent years have advocated basic changes to our diet. These include: a reduction of total fat and especially saturated fat, a reduction in salt intake and an increase in fibre. Total fat should not exceed 35 per cent of calories, while saturated fat should account for no more than 15 per cent calories; simple sugars such as glucose and sucrose should not exceed 18 per cent of calories.  Fibre needs to be increased to between 25-30 grammes per day.  These recommendations have implications for the kinds of foods currently consumed. On the basis of data from the Department of Health's nutritional surveillance system, nutrient intake from various foods is as follows:</P>

    <P>Approximate intakes of nutrients as calculated by the surveillance system are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Fat gives 40.5 per cent of calories;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Protein gives 11.2 per cent of calories;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Carbohydrate (including simple sugars) gives 48.2 per cent of calories.</P>
    <P>Fibre intake has been calculated at 20.3 grams.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these data, significant <Col N="41" /> changes in the national diet will be necessary to meet dietary guidelines.  In general, what is required is more fibre-rich foods, more vegetables and more fruit, and a reduction in high fat foods, and foods high in added sugars.  This will pose a considerable challenge for the food and agricultural industries in Ireland, particularly as Irish agriculture is heavily committed to the EC Common Agricultural Policy, which offers incentives to farmers to produce heavier and fatter meat animals and more sugar beet.  The dairy industry continues to receive more support than any other sector within the industry from CAP.  The result, Community-wide, is that we continue to produce more of these products than we should eat, or indeed, than we can eat and this has implications for our national diet.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to state absolutely that Irish eating habits contribute to poor health.  Some conditions of ill-health have a dietary component however, e.g. heart disease, certain cancers, diabetis mellitus and cirrhosis of the liver.</P>
    <P>There is preliminary evidence that overall levels of heart disease may now be stabilising, or even decreasing in certain age groups; however, it remains the single largest cause of death in both males and females.  Atherosclerosis and hypertensive disease appear to be on the down-turn, as it diabetes mellitus, at least for females.  The position for colon-rectal cancer is unchanged in recent years, and for males in the 55-64 age group, there is evidence that the rates are on the increase.  Cirrhosis of the liver may be rising for females, and dropping for males.</P>
    <P>Diet is one component, albeit an important one, of the general lifestyle of the individual.  Other lifestyle factors which have an impact on our health are living and working environments, smoking, employment status, cultural and traditional values, exercise and weight control.  I have asked the Health Promotion Unit of my Department to report to me on nutrition and health as a basis for a broadly based health promotion strategy to improve the health and lifestyle <Col N="42" /> of the individual.  I will also be raising with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, through the Subcommittee of Government Ministers on health promotion, the role and relationship of the food supply and a national diet conductive to good health.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 49 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Department of Health; <Col N="43" /> 18 of these are homosexuals, 14 are intravenous drug abusers, four are homosexual-IV drug abusers, three are babies born to intravenous drug abusers, nine are haemophiliacs and one heterosexual. Twenty-two persons have died as a result of AIDS in Ireland &mdash; four were drug abusers, 11 homo/bisexuals, five haemophiliacs, one was heterosexual and one a baby.</P>
    <P>Under the Department's voluntary testing programme which monitors the level of HIV infection in the community, a total of 742 persons were found to be HIV positive, up to the end of May 1988.</P>
    <P>A wide-ranging series of measures have been taken by the Department of Health to combat AIDS since it was identified.  Measures have been taken to monitor the number of AIDS cases and the level of infection in the community. The blood supply is screened for the virus and blood products for haemophiliacs are heat treated.  Seminars have been held around the country for health care staff and literature on AIDS disseminated to them.  The public have been educated about AIDS through a national campaign which also provided those particularly at risk with more detailed information through a booklet and telephone service. A voluntary and confidential HIV testing service is available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I recognise that special measures are required in relation to IV drug abusers and towards this end I have allocated £450,000 as a special measure from the national lottery sources to fund an AIDS prevention and intervention programme aimed primarily at this group.  The major project to be funded is an Eastern Health Board Pilot Outreach Programme which involves statutory and non-statutory agencies working with drug abusers and is aiming to educate and inform IV drug abusers and their families about AIDS and to encourage them to present for treatment.  My colleague, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, and I have agreed that we should concentrate upon the educational system this year.</P>
    <P>A group of officials from both our <Col N="44" /> Departments is currently preparing a long-term AIDS programme for secondary schools.  While that programme is being prepared and to ensure that children leaving school this year have the facts about AIDS I asked the directors of community care and medical officers of health to co-operate with local school managements in providing AIDS education to ensure that no child should leave school without being aware of the facts of AIDS and I am happy to report developments in this area.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department of Health are continuing to provide information of a general nature to the public to maintain an awareness about the spread of AIDS. This is being done through a poster campaign advertising the confidential phone service and an information booklet on the basic facts about how AIDS is spread.</P>
    <P>In relation to research, Ireland is participating, through the Department's Virus Reference Laboratory, in an EC study of paediatric AIDS and will continue to co-operate with international bodies, in particular the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe. In addition, in view of the evolving problem of HIV infection among intravenous drug abusers, the Department of Health proposes to co-operate in an EC based multi-city research project in relation to the spread of infection among this group and to the population at large.  The proposed project is being developed by Strathclyde Regional Council in Scotland and will involve other European cities where the HIV problem is concentrated on IV drug abusers.</P>
    <P>I have had some discussion also with the AIDS fund on appropriate research projects and will be meeting them again to bring the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Charges levied by health boards and other institutions under Hospital (In-Patient Charges) Regulations or the Hospital (Out-Patient Charges) Regulations are statutorily based and have been approved by this House.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the charges apply in specified circumstances, have an upper limit in relation to the level of charge and are not levied where persons genuinely are unable to afford the charges.  Outside of these situations a health board or hospital is obliged to levy the charge on persons who receive in-patient or out-patient services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that where persons who receive services in such circumstances and refuse to pay, a health board or hospital is required in the public interest to make reasonable efforts to ensure that those in default of payment are pursued.  It is a matter for each health board and voluntary hospital to adopt and implement a policy of appropriate action where they consider it necessary and having regard to the circumstances of individual cases of default of payment. A situation where defaulters are not followed up is unfair on those persons who have paid, will serve to encourage others to default and bring into disrepute the statutory authority of the regulations.  I should also remind the Deputy that income generated from hospital in-patient and out-patient charges is used to maintain and develop existing services and to ensure an adequate standard of care.  Outstanding income from these sources will have an adverse effect on the provision of local services which is in all our interest to maintain and develop.</P>

      <P>My Department, along with the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, and Hospital Drug and Therapeutics Committees, continue to promote the use of generic drugs where suitable products are available.

      <P>The incidence of solvent-related deaths is not identifiable from the International Classification of Deaths, which is used by the Central Statistics Office.  I am aware, however, of newspaper reports of six deaths so far this year.</P>
      <P>I believe that the long-term answer to this problem lies in promoting a greater public awareness of the dangers of misusing solvents.  Information on solvent misuse has, for some time, been included in an educational programme on drug abuse and this is now under urgent review in the health promotion unit of my Department.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Bill, 1988, at present before the House contains a provision to deal with traders who supply solvents to children where they know that the solvents are going to be misused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of general principles govern the manner in which people have access to hospital services.  A universal principle is that access to the services is determined by the medical needs of the patient.  In <Col N="52" /> the Irish hospital system there is a long-standing tradition of incorporating the public and private practices of hospital consultants within the public hospital system.  I believe that this tradition has served the people of this country well in making the services of the most eminent and highly-skilled medical personnel available to all categories of patient.  I am at all times concerned to ensure that there is equality of access for patients and I cannot accept that public patients who are in urgent need of treatment do not have access to hospital facilities.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the common contract, consultants have the right to private practice within and without the hospital in which they are employed.  However, in public hospitals the common contract stipulates that medical need should be the overall criterion for access to hospital and that admissions should be arranged accordingly.  Admission policies and practices in private hospitals are a matter for those institutions.</P>

      <P>However, he also comments on a number of samples submitted by members of the public where contaminants of various kinds had gained access to the food during harvesting, processing, preparation or storage and suggested that the solution lay in a system of batch inspection of foodstuffs prior to their being offered for sale.</P>
      <P>As the public analyst acknowledges in his report, the European Commission has made proposals for a Council directive on the official inspection of foodstuffs. Under these proposals foodstuffs at all stages of production, manufacture, import, processing, storage, transport, distribution and trade would be subject to a system of inspection agreed between member states.  I will be reviewing existing food legislation in the light of these developments at European level.</P>

      <P>From inquiries I have made it would appear that the media report to which the Deputy refers is without foundation.</P>
      <P>The basis for the article lies in the recent agreement between the US and British Governments under which British passport holders who are going to the US on a short (less than 90 days) stay, hold a non-transferable, non-refundable onward or return ticket and satisfy the general requirements of US immigration control (e.g. they are not coming to engage in unauthorised employment) can travel without getting a US visa.  The scheme does not apply to, nor does it confer any advantages on, aliens already in the United States.</P>

      <P>The Government, however, is conscious of need for ongoing assessment and co-ordination of regulatory regimes in the financial area, and has already announced, for example, that the supervision of building societies and the trustee savings banks will become the responsibility of the Central Bank.  My Department also is examining the general position on the regulation of the financial sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to these initiatives, a number of meetings involving representatives of the various regulatory bodies have taken place under the aegis of my Department.  The aim of this forum is to examine matters which affect financial supervision generally and to facilitate future exchanges of information and the co-ordination of positions on issues where more than one supervisor is involved.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to attribute, with certainty, a change in the level of criminal activity to any particular measure such as neighbourhood watch.  However, the Garda authorities consider that neighbourhood watch is playing a significant role in reducing crime, particularly residential burglaries which dropped by about 30 per cent between 1983 and 1987.</P>
      <P>I want however to make the point, that the benefits of neighbourhood watch should not be gauged by statistics alone. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the scheme has been particularly successful in involving the community in crime prevention, in enhancing Garda/community relations and in promoting a greater sense of security especially among the more vulnerable members of the community.</P>

      <P>Work on Dublin Airport runway project is proceeding satisfactorily and is on schedule.  It is expected that the runway project will be completed by early summer 1989.  The orientation of the present main runway at Dublin Airport is in a North-East/South-West direction.  The orientation of the new runway will be approximately in an East-West direction.  The flight paths associated with the new runway will traverse lowly populated areas to the east and west of the airport thereby ensuring that aircraft operations cause the minimum of disturbance to local communities.</P>

      <P>According to the latest information available to me there are about 50 producers engaged in deer farming in Ireland with the total number of farmed deer amounting to some 2,500 head.  In addition data relating to wild deer indicate some 15,000 animals mainly in the Wicklow, Donegal and Kerry areas.  There are no grants available to individuals for the establishment of deer herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports of venison in 1987 amounted to some 14 tonnes.  Slaughtering usually takes place on the farm or in the wild with processing usually carried out in butchering premises.  The Commission of the European Community is currently discussing proposals relating to public health <Col N="71" /> arrangements for production and distribution of game meat including venison. The proposals aim to establish common standards in the member states in respect of public health, hygiene and processing of all game meat.</P>

These payments are made as early as possible. Payments under the western drainage scheme are made with little or no delay. There is, however, a delay of approximately four to five months in the case of the programme for western development, six to seven months in the case of the farm improvement programme and seven to eight months in the case of the farm modernisation scheme.  All claims are dealt with strictly in order of receipt. This is the most equitable way of administering the schemes within the resources made available in the Book of Estimates in accordance with Government policy on public expenditure.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the part time job incentive scheme is to provide long term unemployed persons with the opportunity to take up a part time job and thereby get a foothold in the labour market again.  While participating in the scheme, participants receive a flat-rate allowance of £27 for a single person or £45 for a married person with a dependent spouse instead of their usual unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The part time job incentive scheme applies only to persons working part-time, providing as it does a supplement to their part time earnings.  It is not considered a suitable mechanism for assisting unemployed persons who wish to return to full time education.  The educational opportunities scheme, which gives unemployed persons, over 25 years of age, the opportunity to attend a leaving certificate course run by their local VEC while at the same time being paid a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments is designed to do this.  The scheme is operating in the pilot locations of Limerick city and Tallaght, County Dublin, at present and it is my intention to extend it to other locations to cover different types of courses, and perhaps languages, in consultation with the Minister for Education, as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was examined on 12 May 1988 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in two months.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.</P>
      <P>This parliamentary question has been taken as an appeal against this decision on behalf of the person concerned. Arrangements are being made to have him examined by a different medical referee on 7 July 1988.

      <P>Where a claimant fails to give notice of incapacity for work within seven days, he is disqualified from receiving payment of disability benefit in respect of any period more than seven days before the date on which notice was given.</P>
      <P>The medical evidence of incapacity for both periods was only submitted to the Department on 14 January 1988.  Accordingly, he was disqualified from payment of disability benefit in respect of both these claims.</P>
      <P>A form requesting an explanation for his late notice was issued to him on 25 January 1988.  The person concerned did not submit an explanation.  Therefore the decision to apply late notice to both disability benefit claims remained unaltered.  Due to an administrative error a cheque for £22.50 was issued to the person concerned in respect of his September 1987 disability benefit claim.  It is not proposed to pursue this overpayment.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit issued to the person concerned from 26 June 1982 to 5 May 1984 at the maximum rate appropriate to a single man.</P>
      <P>From 7 May 1984 payment of disability benefit was due as follows: 7 May 1984 &mdash; 4 July 1984 @ £34.80 per week = £295.80; 5 July 1984 &mdash; 6 July 1985 @ £37.25 per week = £1,955.63; 8 July 1985 &mdash; 14 June 1986 @ £39.50 per week = £1,935.50; Total amount due = £4,186.93.</P>
      <P>In the period 7 May 1984 to 14 June 1986 a total of £3,356.36 was actually issued to the person concerned.  £824 was refunded to the Mid-Western Health Board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance paid during this period and a balance of £6.55 was due to the claimant which issued to him on 29 August 1986.

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of invalidity pension from 11 June 1981.  He is presently paid at the weekly rate of £50.90 (£48.50 personal rate and £5.40 half-rate in respect of one qualified child dependant, less deductions of £3 per week to recover an overpayment of £315).</P>
      <P>This overpayment occurred in the period 25 February 1988 to 4 May 1988 when he was paid full adult dependant allowance in respect of his wife who was receiving disability benefit in her own right during the same period.  It is not considered that the £3 a week deduction is excessive in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the wife of the person concerned was liable to a deduction of £5.60 per week.  This deduction was made to facilitate recovery of an overpayment incurred while she was in receipt of disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance concurrently. The wife of the person concerned has ceased to claim disability benefit.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is of the opinion that he is now entitled to an adult dependant increase in respect of his wife, he should apply to the Department for this increase.  He should forward documentary evidence of his wife's circumstances, in support of his claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 19 September 1985 and payment was issued to 6 June 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment was disallowed from 8 June 1987 following examination by a medical <Col N="79" /> referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.</P>
    <P>She appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  Her case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 8 June 1987 to 2 November 1987, the date of the latest medical certificate before him.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
    <P>A further medical examination has been arranged to establish her entitlement to payment of disability benefit beyond 2 November 1987.</P>
    <P>The disablement benefit payment of £675 mentioned by the Deputy in the note submitted with the question was a once-off payment in respect of an assessment of 2 per cent disablement for life.</P>

      <P>An applicant for unemployment benefit who is a landholder but does not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions in a three year period is not entitled to unemployment benefit if the income from his holding exceeds £4 daily.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a landowner who did not satisfy the contribution condition of having 78 paid contributions in a three year period.  The net yearly income from his holding after having taken into consideration purchases amounting to £1,610 and operating expenses of £3,828 was assessed at £2,254 per annum or £6.17 per day.  As this exceeded the £4 daily limit his claim for unemployment was accordingly disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He recently appealed against this decision and arrangements have been <Col N="80" /> made to have an oral hearing of his appeal this week.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.

      <P>The Passive Foreign Investment Company provisions in the US Tax Reform Act, 1986, in so far as they affect US investment here could have major adverse implications for our industrial and economic development. The Government's serious concerns in the matter have been the subject of extensive representations at all levels since mid-1987 to the US administration and members of Congress.  These representations are continuing and every effort will be made to obtain an alleviation of the impact of these provisions on US investment in this country.</P>

    <P>*The figures for 1988 are estimates, as final figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Assistance from the European Social Fund is paid directly to the applicant bodies.  Prior to the establishment of FÁS, ESF assistance for SES, Teamwork and EAS was paid to the Department of Labour.  It is now paid directly to FÁS to which responsibility for the administration of the schemes was transferred with effect from 1 January 1988.</P>

      <P>The amount allocated to the social employment scheme for 1988 from the Exchequer remains unchanged at £39.130 million.  A further £4.280 million is expected in 1988 in assistance to the scheme from the European Social Fund. The planned activity rate on the scheme is also unchanged at 9,600 man years.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil on 9 June, I understand that FÁS have had to operate a quota system to enable them to remain within the budget for the scheme.  This may lead to deferment of certain applications. This system is designed to ensure an equitable geographic spread despite heavy demand for the scheme.  I am reviewing the position at the moment to see if any action can be taken to ameliorate the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first of all to assure the Deputy that on the basis of advice received from the National Drugs Advisory Board, measures have been taken to reduce the risk of dependence on tranquillisers. <Col N="109" /> Benzodiazepine tranquillisers, into which category the product Ativan falls, were reviewed by the National Drugs Advisory Board in 1977, and while it was noted that prolonged or excessive use of these drugs may result in the development of psychological dependence with withdrawal symptoms on discontinuing the drug, the information then available did not suggest that the degree of this dependence was as serious as is suggested today.  The Benzodiazepine products on the market have since that date in 1977 been required to include, in the information being supplied to the professions, a warning which would alert doctors to this possibility.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the adverse reaction reporting scheme operated by the National Drugs Advisory Board, the question of the Benzodiazepines was again reviewed in 1985 and the board recommended that their use be limited to short periods of four to six weeks or less.  In order to give greater effect to this advice, regulations were introduced which came into force on 1 July 1987, namely, the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 18 of 1987).</P>
      <P>These regulations provide that a prescription for a Benzodiazepine tranquilliser may be dispensed on one occasion only.  This new regime represents a significant tightening of the controls pertaining prior to July 1987 when a prescription could be dispensed on a number of occasions within a period of six months after the date of the prescription.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, steps have been taken to bring Benzodiazepines within the control regime operated under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 and 1984. This action will facilitate surveillance of the prescribing of the products in question and will enable me to set up the necessary investigative procedures where there is evidence of irresponsible prescribing by practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned for those members of the public who are having tranquilliser dependence problems.  They can however discuss the problem with their family practitioner.  If they need further help they <Col N="110" /> can contact the various agencies around the country who provide counselling and support for sufferers.  Details of such bodies are listed in a booklet entitled <i>Directory of Organisations concerned with Substance Abuse</i>, which is available from my Department.</P>

      <P>The Colleges of Education for primary teacher training are private institutions under the management of the local Hierarchy and reflect the denominational nature of the national school system which is explicitly recognised by the State in pursuance of the provisions of Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution. The concern of the college authorities for the religious or philosophical beliefs of applicants clearly derives from the denominational nature of the national schools and the fact that, as well as teaching secular subjects, the teachers are also teachers of religion which is a fundamental part of the school course.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all applicants for primary teacher training, regardless of country or origin, are assessed on an equal and just basis at interview and I am not planning to introduce legislation along the lines suggested by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>Budget provision for the elimination of sexism and sex stereotyping in education in 1988 amounts to £30,000.  It will cover the following activities: (1) An action-research project involving girls in the new technologies; (2) Pilot intervention projects in physics and in chemistry.  These projects will involve ten regions from September 1988.  There was no specific budget allocation in this area in 1985.  In 1986 an allocation of £100,000 was made. However, savings in the region of £70,000 were made following a direction from the then Minister.</P>
      <P>An allocation of £60,000 was made in 1987 which was fully expended on activities at both national and international levels.</P>
