      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has given any further consideration to the concept of an honours list, if he will give details of any further progress regarding the resolution of any obstacles preventing the introduction of such; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that occasion the Taoiseach indicated that he would enter into some discussion with the various parties during the recess.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach is indisposed at present but I wonder if the Tánaiste could give any information as to whether any discussions took place along those lines and whether any attention has been given to the resolution of the difficulties to which the Taoiseach referred on 29 June?</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Taoiseach is very interested in this matter and <Col N="514" /> I share his interest.  When the Taoiseach is back in the House I am sure that this matter will be expedited.  I agree that this is something to which we should give very deep consideration.  It is a suggestion that has been there for years and we should come to grips with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in view of his commitment to our heritage, if he will ensure adequate funds (details supplied) are made available from his Department to finalise the existing Viking dig at South Main Street, Wexford which has received national and international acclaim and is the first concrete evidence of Viking man in Wexford, to substantiate the claims of literature and folklore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the National Heritage Council have received many applications for assistance from the funds available to them, including one in respect of this project.</P>
      <P>The council are considering these applications at present in the context of their overall priorities for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I am aware that there is an application to the National Heritage Council.  In view of the fact that <Col N="515" /> funds will have dried up by 18 November and that this is our most important Viking dig, with the possible exception of Wood Quay, could the Minister bring his immediate attention to bear on the matter and expedite a decision on the application?  A sum of £28,000 is needed and that includes funding for the post-excavation work which is essential to make sense of the excellent work that has been done heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is at present under consideration by the National Heritage Council.  The Deputy will appreciate that the council met for the first time last month.  Already they have had a second meeting and have divided into subcommittees to examine applications under various headings.  It is up to the subcommittee to make a recommendation and then it is a matter for the Heritage Council.  I will bring the Deputy's remarks to the attention of the council and I assure the House that this matter, along with several others, is getting the immediate attention of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the private developer concerned, through his interest and support of the local community, has deferred his development for almost 12 months to date?  Unless we are in a position to help and unless this Government are prepared to contribute towards the funding of this most vital Viking dig, we cannot hold up this man any longer.  A very quick answer on it is essential.  Is the Minister aware that Wexford Corporation have contributed £30,000, that Wexford County Council have contributed £5,000 and the local business community have contributed £12,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Minister's personal interest in this matter.  Is he aware that the workforce have been instructed that they will be paid off on 3 November?  In that context, will the Minister say if the task force being set up <Col N="517" /> by Údarás has been given Government authority and every resource to seek out an alternative buyer for this plant?  Are the IDA involved in that area at the present time?</P>

Will the Government declare this blackest of black spots in terms of emigration and unemployment to be a priority area for industrial activity by Údarás na Gaeltachta in the times ahead, and will he see to it as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach that the Údarás are given every possible resource in order to secure and maintain the jobs of the 96 to 99 workers there at the present time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the plans his Department has (1)  to provide a proper and adequate marine search and rescue service for the west and north coasts (2) to introduce a new rescue co-ordinating structure and (3)  to introduce a procedure for annual safety equipment surveys for all registered fishing vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 8, 20 and Priority Question No. 29 together.</P>
      <P>The number of lives lost as a result of fishing vessel incidents over the last five years was as follows: 1984, 0; 1985, 4; 1986, 8; 1987, 6; 1988 (to date), 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre has sought the assistance of the Royal Air Force in marine search and rescue operations on the following <Col N="519" /> number of occasions since 1982: 1982, 57; 1983, 70; 1984, 20; 1985, 93, 1986, 61 and 1987, 48.  Co-operative effort of this kind is a feature of internal efforts of search and rescue.</P>
    <P>Provisions regarding the safety of fishing vessels are laid down in the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1983, and in rules and regulations made thereunder.  As was pointed out to the Deputy in reply to a parliamentary question on this matter on 24 November 1987, this legislation covers such matters as safety equipment to be carried in a fishing vessel, registration of fishing vessels, manning and certification of crews, provision of radio installations, masters and safety of navigation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officers and Engineer Officers) Regulations, will come into force on 1 September 1989.  These regulations, which have been agreed in consultation with the industry, will require those fishing vessels of 16.5 metres in length and over which operate in the limited area and all fishing vessels which operate in the unlimited area to carry a specified number of deck officers, certificated in accordance with the regulations. Existing certificates of competency issued under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1984, will be treated as equivalent to specified certificates of competency issued under these regulations. Also, all fishing vessels of 750 kilowatt or more engine power will be required to carry a specified number of engineer officers certificated in accordance with the regulations.  There is no provision under existing legislation which requires fishing vessels to carry engineer officers.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made under the regulations for the issue of certificates of service to uncertificated engineer officers and deck officers serving in capacities which do not at present require the carriage of certificated officers, but which will on enactment of the new regulations.</P>
    <P>At international level work is proceeding in redrafting the Torremolinos <Col N="520" /> Convention on the Safety of Fishing vessels, which lays down uniform principles and rules concerning the construction and equipment of fishing vessels directed towards the safety of such vessels and their crews.  The International Maritime Organisation's Maritime Safety Committee considered the matter at its 55th session in April of this year and approved, in general, proposals for the development of a protocol to the Convention. As a member of the IMO Ireland contributes to its work towards developing and harmonising maritime safety standards and regulations as between its members.  When the Torremolinos Convention enters into force, my Department will examine their provisions with a view to their incorporation into domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>As far as surveys are concerned, merchant shipping legislation requires fishing vessels to be measured for tonnage prior to registration.  An inspection of safety equipment, that is, life-saving and fire-fighting appliances, is also carried out at this time.  While existing legislation does not call for periodic inspections, fishing vessels are resurveyed when structural alterations are made.  The Torremolinos Convention contains provisions regarding periodic inspections of fishing vessels and my Department are awaiting the final deliberations of the International Maritime Organisation before proceeding to draft the appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>So far as search and rescue is concerned the report of the West Coast Search and Rescue and Action Committee was formally presented to me on 14 September of this year, at which time I immediately referred it to the interdepartmental committee on the deployment of search and rescue helicopters, which has addressed those recommendations of the West Coast Committee which come within its terms of reference.  The report of the interdepartmental committee is now under consideration by the Minister for Defence and myself and it will be presented to the Government very shortly.</P>
    <P>Marine search and rescue operations <Col N="521" /> within our area of responsibility are coordinated by the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre situated at Shannon Airport. The centre acts as a clearing house for all messages received during an operation and all new relevant information is evaluated and redirected to all appropriate units and agencies.  A working group on MRCC Shannon comprising officials from the Department of Tourism and Transport, reported in September of this year.  My Department are at present considering that report.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgency and importance I attach to the efficiency and effectiveness of marine search and rescue operations I have established a special group comprising the public service agencies involved in search and rescue (including the RNLI) earlier this summer to review at regular intervals marine incidents, and to agree where possible, improvements to approach and procedures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that safety has a very low priority among certain members of the fishing community, particularly among those on smaller fishing vessels which operate closer to land and that these vessels are subject only to infrequent random checks?  Have the Minister's Department any proposals to ensure that the EPIRBS is fitted on all fishing vessels and all commercial and pleasure craft?  The report of the Marine Rescue Service shows that there are great difficulties and that many problems arise due to the lack of proper radio equipment on these vessels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are fully aware that fishermen generally do not give safety a very high priority.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to impress on people involved in the fishing industry the necessity to have the highest possible standard of safety equipment and to make any other arrangements that they can organise.  We must stress at every possible opportunity the importance of fishermen undertaking these investments with regard to safe operation.  In the new fisheries development plan which I <Col N="522" /> launched yesterday we have indicated the desirability, in the training of skippers, of giving high priority to that whole area. This is something in which the fishing industry generally is becoming more interested.  We must encourage the fishermen themselves to play an important role and give higher priority to this than has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any specific proposals, or is there any intention of, grant-aiding small fishermen to instal these facilities?  Is the Minister aware that the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre has no radio communication equipment capable of exercising direct and efficient control over search and air rescue facilities? There is an ambiguity, in that the coastal radio stations believe they exercise a radio co-ordinating function and the MRCC people believe that they should not.  There is confusion in this regard and need for co-ordination.  What definite and specific plans have the Minister's Department to solve this present problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be some anxiety concerning overall co-operation of effort in this area, but this has not been of any major significance.  I initiated a committee, which I felt was important because there are so many agencies and people with responsibility in this area, to encourage the fullest co-operation at all times between them.  There is no major difficulty in that area.  In the context of the present overall review with the departmental committee and the recent report we received from the committee in the west of Ireland, there is a basis on which we can make some improvements. Some other developments are taking place which add a further dimension, for example, the automation of lighthouses means that in the future there may not be manned lighthouses and this gives further urgency to the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that many agencies and many people are involved here and that much effort is put into the industry.  What we have been endeavouring to do in the short time since our <Col N="523" /> Department were established is to coordinate, in the best possible way, the existing agencies and voluntary effort in this regard and to utilise our resources to the best possible advantage.  Also, we must look at the changes taking place, especially technological ones.  In that regard we provided this year £700,000 additional revenue to modernise the VHF radio service.  With one or two small exceptions, the whole area of jurisdiction is supplied with an extremely efficient and modern VHF radio network, which is essential in any search and rescue service. We have done this at a time of very strict financial controls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from Ceist a 5, would the Minister agree that it is now a matter of great urgency, in view of the reply given by him, to make a statement on the relocating of the Air Corps service at Shannon?  Further, would the Minister agree that, to say the least, it is a bad state of affairs that the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre has to rely on the RAF for rescue operations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I could let the Deputy away with that.  There is an international convention governing this whole area and sometimes the RAF may rely on our services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the best possible co-operation in that area.  We certainly have the best possible co-operation between the rescue services here and in the United Kingdom.  As I indicated in my reply, we are examining this area.  We should like to see some improvements &mdash; and fairly soon.  There will be no undue delay on our part in reaching a final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of Question No. 8, leaving aside the issue of co-ordination and given the current location, be it on the British mainland or on the east coast of Ireland, of the helicopter service, could I draw the Minister's attention to <Col N="524" /> the time it takes for helicopters from these locations to reach our west coast? The Minister must now be in a position to accept the primary recommendation of the west coast search and rescue action committee, namely, the location of the helicopter service at Shannon and Finner. Could he give some indication of the Government's position on that, irrespective of interdepartmental committees and special groups?  Would he agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 23 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the new licensing arrangements at the beginning of 1988, I made clear on more than one occasion my Department's willingness to examine ways in which the legislation could be improved.  I also indicated that I was willing to make adjustments within the framework of the legislation to make it more acceptable to anglers and tourists alike.</P>
      <P>The controversy that developed as a result of this measure was avoidable and unnecessary in view of the generally accepted view that expenditure by the taxpayers on inland fisheries should be supplemented by a statutory contribution from anglers towards the overall development of the resource.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the legislation and after its passage through the Oireachtas, discussions were held with various angling bodies, with the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and with many other interested parties on the <Col N="531" /> question of the development of inland fisheries.  There was widespread agreement on the need to strengthen the finances of inland fisheries to avoid any further rundown and neglect of this important sector.</P>
    <P>While there is acceptance of the necessity to fund development, no generally accepted formulae emerged as to how it could be achieved.  It was in these circumstances that the licence arrangement was made.</P>
    <P>Figures on the loss to tourism are not based on any factual assessment.  Estimates of £3 million to £6 million which have been mentioned are largely speculative. It remains to be seen at year's end what the outcome will be.  Major efforts have been made throughout the year to attempt to resolve the issue.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the discussions undertaken, the anti-rod licence lobby continued to raise unrelated issues and, in a small number of areas, inhibited citizens from exercising their lawful rights to fish.</P>
    <P>I would urge all the groups involved to call off the campaign and to get back to working through their representative bodies.</P>
    <P>I am more than willing to discuss the whole area, as inland fisheries are in a critical and declining state and must be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the valuable development work which had been done over the years, on an annual basis, by angling clubs on a voluntary basis has now come to a halt because of their objections to the imposition of a rod licence on the free fishing waters and that this will have a detrimental effect on the development of inland fisheries as well as the terrible effect which this is having on our tourist industry?  Was it not the Minister's intention originally to seek to get additional funds for investment in inland fisheries development?  Having considered the matter for the best part of nine months, would he not accept that there are other ways in which additional funds can be obtained through the organised angling <Col N="532" /> clubs for the purpose of developing inland fisheries without necessarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can I ask the Minister, in the interests of avoiding further social disharmony and in the interests of good tourism development and angling development, if an alternative is put up which is agreed and which would bring into the Exchequer an equivalent or greater amount of funding, if he would be prepared to review the licence concept of the legislation in that context?</P>

Would the Minister agree that it is because of his own intransigence in the issue that those who are involved are determined not to compromise.  It is their view which must be taken into consideration and it is about time the Minister made a decision to withdraw the order of licensing and to start afresh so that the damage that has been done to the tourist industry and to the angling clubs generally in the smaller areas where tourism is not the main issue can be rectified in the coming years.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in relation to aquaculture is, in the broadest sense, to maximise its contribution to the task of national recovery in terms of output, jobs and exports in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of a clean environment.  The principal measures which I am putting in place in order to achieve this objective include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the provision of a sound legal frame-work for the development of the industry through the designation of areas for aquaculture under the Fisheries Act, 1980, and the licensing of projects within those areas consistent with their ecological carrying capacity;</P>
      <P>&mdash;co-ordination under the aegis of my Department, of the activities of the two principal State agencies, Údarás na Gaeltachta and BIM, in order to get the best effect from State aid in the sector; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;liaison with the EC Commission in order to maximise assistance from that source for the development of <Col N="537" /> aquaculture and liaison with the industry to ensure that applications to Brussels are properly presented and supported.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture development strategy announced yesterday as part of BIM's plan for the years ahead is a key element in the developmental programmes of my Department and it may be of interest to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>We were extremely disappointed in 1987 with the funding for aquaculture from Europe and both myself and the Minister made our disappointment abundantly clear at the Council of Minister's meeting in Europe at that time.  As a result of our efforts, during April of this year we received £0.9 million.  I can say no more to the House other than that we will receive an amount substantially higher than that before the end of this year and I believe this is as a result of the steps which we took at that time, through the talks we had with the Commission and by impressing on them why they should inject more money into aquaculture in this country.</P>
    <P>Of course there are the social and economic implications involved in so far as aquaculture can be developed along the seaboard in an area where there are no alternative sources of employment. Within a short time of assuming office we determined exactly what the Commission would require in relation to information. We drew up detailed guidelines which we presented to the industry.  We brought officials from the Commission to Ireland. They visited many parts of the country during last year.  They inspected all sectors of the industry &mdash; such as salmon farms, oyster farms, mussel farms and small production units.  Without being bombastic about it, it is my belief that all of these efforts will bear fruit in the very near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the grave concern on the part of many people about the effect of smolt rearing in those lakes and rivers which are a source of public water supply, where there are also valuable inland fisheries <Col N="538" /> stocks?  The Minister spoke about the ecological-carrying capacity &mdash; which is a matter of concern to many people &mdash; and that judgment in this matter might not necessarily be based on accurate information because it is a developing science.  Is the Minister aware that there have been experiences abroad of serious pollution caused to lakes and rivers because of such fish farming activities? Would the Minister address himself to that problem, informing the House of his views and what steps he is taking to protect these waters?</P>

That application was rejected and has been resubmitted to An Bord Pleanála.  The decision in that regard was taken by the previous administration on 10 November 1986.  It is important that the House be aware of that decision in the cases of Loughnafooey. Were it not for the fact that we insisted that planning permission was required possibly it would have slipped through before we assumed office.  I have said frequently that we will ensure at all times that the rights of traditional sea harvesters are protected and that the environment is protected, too.  I have no doubt that when the relevant spokespersons are afforded an opportunity they will welcome the launch of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's programme announced yesterday.  The House will be aware that there will be thousands of jobs coming on stream as a result of our efforts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if he will introduce a by-catch allowance for sole and winter herring caught by east coast fishermen; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a permitted by-catch of 10 per cent for herring caught when fishing for other species in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>As regards sole the quota in the Irish Sea has been taken.  Therefore, it is not legally possible to permit a by-catch.  I am obviously concerned to ensure that this fishery should be managed to provide for a fair and equitable distribution of the quota and for a more sustained fishery.  I have asked officials of my Department to convene a meeting next month to discuss an agreed management régime for sole and plaice in the Irish Sea with representatives of the various fishing interests concerned.  Given this year's experience it is imperative that such a régime should operate for next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>At all times we will consult with the industry.  I have no doubt but that we will be able to find common <Col N="541" /> ground in that respect.  It will be essential to ensure that there is a by-catch remaining for sole at the end of next year, as there is in respect of herring.  We have embarked on this management plan &mdash; as we did in relation to mackerel and herring &mdash; to ensure continuity and greater job creation.  I should say that the quota for sole in 1988 was some 215 tonnes and that this has been exceeded. The Deputy will appreciate that, legally, a by-catch is not permitted.  We envisage the same type of regime applying to a by-catch in respect of sole in the Irish Sea as for herrings.  We would hope to be able to prolong the season even at the expense of boat quotas and possible weekend closures, thus ensuring a greater market price for fishermen.  In the event of our failing to secure agreement by way of negotiation in regard to such a regime I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister will not hesitate to introduce any measure to provide a balanced and sustained fisheries industry.</P>

I have strongly urged both Irish industrialists and Irish public authorities to give serious and urgent consideration to the development of alternative means of dealing with material currently incinerated at sea.

Our Department and the Department of the Environment work very closely and I will make some of the details of the relevant documents in this area available to the Deputy because, as she rightly pointed out, it is very complicated.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the herring quotas secured after very difficult negotiations at the Council of Ministers last December allow for the continuing development of the fishing industry here.  Officials from my Department have raised my concerns with the Commission and participated to the fullest extent possible in the deliberations of the international scientific organisations whose advice will form the basis of the Commission's proposals on total allowable catches and quotas for 1989. These proposals are, however, not yet available.  The position of the industry within the constraints of quota is being addressed by strengthened management arrangements worked out in consultation with industry.  The Deputy can be assured that I will be pressing at the negotiations in Brussels in December for the maximum quotas possible for our fishermen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Governments record in relation to securing quotas and the tonnage in total allowable catches, what future is there for the herring industry?  I should like a very clear indication of the position of those involved in herring fishing.  How will the plans proposed yesterday by BIM fit into this proposed development in view of the fact that there are very strict limitations on the amount of fish that can be caught? How can this great development take place when restrictions have been imposed by the EC because of the lack <Col N="546" /> of effectiveness by our Government in negotiations at EC level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the question of records first.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the record placed before us in March 1987 on coming into Government when there was a quota of 80,000 tonnes of mackerel, 73,000 tonnes had been caught because it was an election year and the Minister for Labour had resigned.  In a six-week period, 73,000 tonnes were caught, some of the fish were processed in this country but too many went aboard luggers to be processed in Comecon countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask for an historical analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to set the record straight.  We were left with a total allowable catch of 7,000 tonnes, we travelled to the various capitals of Europe and secured sufficient quotas up to December of last year.  We commenced this year with 80,000 tonnes and 97 per cent or 98 per cent were sold at premium prices and the rest provided job creation in the area.  We managed matters so well that the fishing closed naturally in May and we had 23,000 tonnes left for the rest of the year.  Unfortunately, we did not reach Deputy McGinley's question which suggested that the early opening of mackerel fishing was a sick joke.  However the people in the fishing industry did not think it was a sick joke when £500,000 of mackerel was landed last week and mackerel to the value of £500,000 this week.  That is far from a sick joke in deprived areas in the west.  I appreciate that Deputies are not familiar with the details of yesterday's launch but they will receive a copy of the details this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware that there is a wide range of fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We will talk about specifics.  We are talking about non-quota species, horse mackerel, scad, and blue whiting for which there was a tremendous market in Japan last year.  However, this <Col N="547" /> has been a difficult year in regard to quality and quantity in horse mackerel and we have no control over this.  Strenuous efforts are being made to find a market for blue whiting but, in the meantime, it is achieving very high prices on the Continent.  We are trying to assist young fishermen to purchase new white fish boats.  It is wrong to suggest that the constraints here would effect yesterday's plan.  The whole secret in relation to the fisheries is its management.  This is not just a theory.  We have seen it in practice last year and this year.  Nothing will deter us from taking an overall view of the situation.  We will have discussions with the industry, including the processors, the producers, the Department and representatives of the various POs and fishermen's organisations.  If it is necessary, we will not be deterred from taking steps to ensure that there is no indiscriminate fishing for fishmeal purposes and that the fish will be taken ashore and value added. We had a difficult time this year.  There will never be a repeat of what we had in the past, with herrings being landed indiscriminately for fishmeal purposes. All of these fish will be landed for productive purposes and for job creation.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that in the final analysis the livelihood of most fishermen depends on the amount of fish they catch, and the fishermen in the Celtic Sea have been very seriously restricted?

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be pleased to give the facts about the Celtic Sea.  At the Council meeting in December of last year the quota for the Celtic Sea was 11,240 tonnes.  We had bilateral discussions with the Commission.  We proposed closing the area around the Blaskets for two weeks for conservation <Col N="548" /> purposes this year, the area south of Cobh and Ballycotton for two weeks next year and the area off Dunmore East which is traditionally known as Baginbun for two weeks.  This indicates our commitment to that area and as a result, we secured an additional 4,220 tonnes which is no mean achievement particularly during these weeks when the fish in the Celtic Sea are going for £12 to £13 per box.</P>

How does the Minister propose to carry out the objectives of the Bill when there is no provision for funding within it?  Is it not a fact that <Col N="549" /> he himself is not satisfied with the present drafting of the Bill and intends to have it re-examined?  Is he also aware that certain developments which were taking place, particularly in Foynes, are now on ice because of anxiety on the part of the developers that the good value and autonomy that was in Foynes in the operation of it as a commercial port is now under serious threat in terms of this Bill?</P>

      <P>The Government's economic and budgetary strategy is aimed at creating the conditions for sustainable growth in output and employment.  To establish these conditions we must continue our efforts to restore order to the public finances and in particular to stabilise the debt/GNP ratio as envisaged in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> This framework for recovery is fully consistent with the strategy and principles outlined by the National Economic and Social Council in their report entitled, <i>A Strategy for Development 1986-1990</i>.  This report was quite explicit on the need for curtailing expenditure. This it saw as the most appropriate means of restoring order to the public finances and encouraging strong and sustainable growth in the medium term.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office last year, we were faced with the legacy of the failure to confront the problem of the public finances.  The reality of the first part of this decade was a very steep rise in national debt, little real progress in reducing Government borrowing and no real growth in national wealth.</P>
    <P>On taking office, we were determined to end this stagnation and to restore the conditions for lasting growth in the future.  This required decisive action to tackle the problem of the public finances and the ever rising debt and debt servicing costs associated with that problem. We took bold steps in 1987 and in 1988 to create a new environment for growth.</P>
    <P>Some disapproved.  Some said that the steps we took would give an adverse shock to the economy which would be too great.  They have been proved wrong. They did not realise that strong positive forces would be set in motion by the change in economic strategy which this Government have introduced.</P>
    <P>The most important of these are the fall in interest rates and the great improvement in confidence in the economy which we have brought about.  There has been a huge fall in interest rates since the 1987 budget.  They are now 6 percentage points below their level in the early spring of last year.  Gilt yields are also at their lowest point in over 20 years. Not only that, but interest rates here are well below the rates prevailing in the UK, also.  We are now in a position where it is generally recognised and accepted that Ireland can continue to enjoy the benefits of relatively low domestic interest rates provided we continue to pursue sensible economic and fiscal policies.  Nobody in <Col N="636" /> this House can seriously suggest that this would have been possible without the policies we have been pursuing.</P>
    <P>The cost of capital is one of the most crucial factors affecting business decisions.  If interest rates are too high, and they reached unprecedented heights before this Government took office, businesses will not invest.  Many of them found it hard to survive, and finance working capital, when interest rates were so high.  While this Government believe in the case for State policies and incentives to develop industry, we knew that their effectiveness would be greatly reduced while interest rates were too high.  To reduce interest rates, we had to cut Exchequer borrowing.</P>
    <P>People generally, of course, also benefit from the fall in interest rates.  Mortgage payments have fallen markedly since we took office.  The cost of personal borrowing has also fallen.</P>
    <P>The fall in interest rates, and the clear evidence that the Government were determined, and able, to put the public finances in order, brought about a resurgence in economic confidence.</P>
    <P>There is now confidence in the will and the ability of the Government to take charge of events and in the future of the economy.  People no longer fear that the economy could drift into chaos, that Ireland could have its future determined by our foreign creditors, and could join the list of those luckless countries with an intractable debt problem.</P>
    <P>This confidence is not confined to domestic investors alone.  There was a dramatic increase in the amount of foreign investment in the gilt market over the first nine months of this year, with a total of £741 million being invested.  People abroad can now see that this Government have the finances under control.  This is a direct result of the strong budgetary policy the Government have followed. The huge fall in interest rates and the restoration of confidence are bound to have growing economic and social benefits.</P>
    <P>The 1988 budget strategy focused directly on the closely-related objectives <Col N="637" /> of improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.  Only by tackling the public finance problem head-on could we turn the economy around.</P>
    <P>In the January budget, therefore, I aimed at a further significant reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement. The budget projected Exchequer borrowing at £1,457 million or some 8¼ per cent of GNP.  This represented a reduction of 2 percentage points of GNP on the outturn for 1987, which itself had shown a reduction of almost 3 percentage points of GNP on the outturn for 1986. Within the overall borrowing target the current budget deficit for this year was set at £1,125 million, or 6.2 per cent of GNP.  The reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit had to be achieved primarily through savings on expenditure, since an increase in taxation was not an option.  In our view, and I think in that of most of the Opposition, taxation is still too high.</P>
    <P>We should, however, keep a sense of proportion on our tax burden.  Recent figures show that the total tax burden in Ireland is not excessive by EC standards. There are six countries in the EC with a higher tax burden relative to GDP than Ireland, and we are below the EC average. But direct taxation in Ireland, excluding social security contributions, is as a percentage of GDP, the fourth highest in the Community.  A particular problem in the direct taxation area is the comparatively low levels of income at which single people in Ireland hit the higher rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Implementation of this year's budget has proceeded very satisfactorily.  We have been confident since early in the year that the budget outturn would be below target for the second year in succession. Our confidence has been confirmed by the end-September Exchequer returns which showed borrowing for the first nine months of the year at only 61 per cent of the budget projection.  This compares with 84 per cent for the previous year and 87 per cent for 1986.  This <Col N="638" /> very good position reflected the exceptionally good performance of tax receipts and emerging savings.</P>
    <P>There will be a saving this year on Central Fund Services of approximately £35 million arising on our contribution to the EC budget.  The saving mainly reflects the changes in the method of calculating member states contributions agreed earlier this year by the Heads of State and Government, and from the finalisation of the EC budget expenditure figures for 1988.</P>
    <P>Non-capital supply services are also likely to show some expenditure savings by the end of the year.  A major factor contributing to the lower expenditure is the projected saving of over £30 million on unemployment payments resulting from a reduction in the live register. Savings are likely to emerge on non-capital supply services, even after allowing for the payment of a Christmas bonus to welfare recipients again this year at a cost of some £21 million.</P>
    <P>The much reduced level of the Exchequer's borrowing requirement for 1988 has had a significant beneficial effect on the Exchequer's financial position. This, combined with large purchases of gilts by non-residents, enabled us to repay £230 million of foreign debt during the first nine months of the year.  We would hope to make further progress in this area during the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>1988 is a watershed in many respects. The substantial repayment of foreign debt is unprecedented; the performance of the gilt market has been exceptional this year, following on a very good performance in 1987 and we are entering 1989 in a much stronger position than ever before.  This will allow various funding options to be exploited according as opportunities arise in the markets.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue, especially VAT and excise receipts, has benefited from the stronger pick-up in economic activity compared with what had been expected at budget time.  This, incidentally, shows that our belief that our policies would increase economic activity was well founded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> The recent huge inflow of £500 million under the tax amnesty has, of course, boosted this year's revenue receipts even further, to an extent that could not have been envisaged when the budget was being drawn up.  I will come back to the implications of the amnesty later.</P>
    <P>All in all, it now appears that, barring some adverse developments over the remainder of the year, the Exchequer borrowing requirement for the year as a whole could fall below 5 per cent of GNP. Even if the exceptional proceeds of the amnesty were excluded, the Exchequer borrowing requirement would still fall this year to about 7 per cent of GNP, that is, 1¼ percentage points below the projection in the January budget and three percentage points below the 1987 outturn.  This is a tremendous achievement by any standards.</P>
    <P>While we cannot allow ourselves to be dazzled by the emerging outturn this year &mdash; especially in view of the exceptional factors at work &mdash; it provides further confirmation that our strategy for the public finances and the economy is soundly based.  It should encourage all sections of the community to continue to support the Government in their efforts to finally resolve the problems that have bedevilled our economy for far too long.</P>
    <P>Despite the constraints on us in framing this year's budget, the Government were able to undertake a number of important taxation reforms.  The income tax concessions implemented this year have increased to 62.7 per cent the proportion of taxpayers who are paying tax at the standard rate in the current year. This is an important step in the right direction.  There has also been a fundamental overhaul of corporation tax, which will reduce the previous bias in the tax system in favour of investment in plant and machinery at the expense of job creation.</P>
    <P>Radical initiatives were taken by the Government this year in the area of tax assessment and collection.  In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> new arrangements have been put in place for tax assessment <Col N="640" /> for the self-employed as a major intital step towards a system of full self-assessment for this group of taxpayers.  In broad terms, the objectives of the new arrangements are to place more responsibility on taxpayers to meet their tax obligations, to streamline and significantly reduce the number of appeals and to eliminate timeconsuming exchanges between taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners.  The new arrangements will be of considerable administrative benefit to compliant taxpayers while releasing resources in the Revenue Commissioners to counter tax evasion.  A significant level of payments is already being made under self-assessment.</P>
    <P>A second major initiative taken by the Government in the tax collection area was the introduction of the tax amnesty. We took the view that, with the introduction of self-assessment and the accompanying strong enforcement regime, tax defaulters should be given a once-off incentive to clear their arrears of tax.  The success of the scheme has exceeded all expectations.  The response to previous amnesties of this kind had been poor.  The unprecedented success on this occasion is due not just to the terms of the amnesty itself but to the cumulative effect of the measures to achieve greater enforcement of tax liabilities. These include the interest surcharge, the activities of the sheriffs and the new power given to the Revenue Commissioners in this year's Finance Act to attach the assets of defaulters.</P>
    <P>From the Government's viewpoint, the major once-off boost in tax revenue from the amnesty is gratifying.  From the point of view of many taxpayers it has provided a great opportunity to wipe the slate clean as regards their outstanding tax liability. This will help place those taxpayers and enterprises who have availed of the amnesty on a sounder financial footing. The tax administration system will also benefit from the elimination of a huge backlog of tax arrears and this will make for a more efficient system in the future.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the amnesty scheme offered this year was a once-off measure and the Government are committed to <Col N="641" /> rigorous enforcement of all tax liabilities in the future.  I would urge all those who have availed of the amnesty, and indeed all taxpayers, to keep their tax affairs up to date for the future.  Those who do so will benefit enormously by avoiding the punitive sanctions for default which are now in place.  It is in everyone's interests, in the light of the major effort made under the amnesty scheme to bring tax affairs up to date, that prompt payment of tax should be the norm for the future. This will ensure a more efficient and more equitable system and ensure that every taxpayer is making his/her just contribution to the running of the State.</P>
    <P>The European Commission remarked, in its recent Annual Economic Report that the Irish economy, which in the early eighties had one of the highest inflation rates in the Community, a huge external deficit, and spiralling public debt, has made great strides towards stability.  That progress will continue this year.</P>
    <P>The strong trend of exports and output experienced in 1987 is continuing in the current year.  The balance of trade continues to run strongly in our favour.  In the first nine months, the trade surplus was nearly £1,600 million, over £500 million better than the first nine months of 1987.  For the full year, I expect a trade surplus of about two billion pounds.  The surplus on the balance of payments should be at least 3 per cent of GNP compared with 1½ per cent last year.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments on current account may seem a bit remote to the man in the street.  But it shows how we stand financially with the rest of the world.  For a country like ours, so dependent on foreign trade, it is a crucial indicator of the health of the economy.  Many commentators reckon that the move into surplus was one of the most important improvements in the economy last year.</P>
    <P>Everyone is affected by inflation. Inflation fell to a new low last year and this downward movement has continued this year.  We expect inflation to be at about 2 per cent in 1988 compared with 3 per cent last year.  At mid-August, the annual rate of inflation was 2.1 per cent. This compares with 5.7 per cent in the <Col N="642" /> UK for August and 3.2 per cent for the European Community average in the same period.  In September the UK rate has in fact increased to 5.9 per cent.  The wage developments agreed within the framework of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> reflect these favourable price trends here and ensure that the cost competitiveness of our products at home and abroad is improving.</P>
    <P>Improved competitiveness is essential to increase our share of world and home markets which in turn is the only lasting basis for employment growth.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has also been doing well over the last year or so with a strong recovery in incomes after the two dismal years of 1985 and 1986.  This big improvement in farm income is very welcome and will have a real impact in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to unemployment, which is, with emigration the greatest economic and social problem we face.  I will not gloss over the problem.  I will not minimise the scale of it or its impact on so many families in this country.  Make no mistake, the Government regards unemployment as its number one priority.  There is no doubt that the &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; of the economy are improving very rapidly.  So why has employment not risen more rapidly and unemployment fallen faster?</P>
    <P>It takes time for a basic improvement in the economy to show up in employment. But there are already definite signs that the employment position is improving and that we have turned the corner. The results of the Labour Force Survey for April of this year were published recently.  They show a rise in total employment of 6,000 in the year up to April 1988, in contrast to the decline of 66,000 in the five years up to April 1987.</P>
    <P>They also show a stabilisation in industrial employment in the year to April and a strong pick-up in private sector services employment.  This confirms what we had said earlier &mdash; a turnaround has been achieved in non-agricultural employment. It is clear that the fall in unemployment since we took office is not just due to emigration, as some people have claimed.  We have, of course, still a long <Col N="643" /> way to go.  But under this Government job creation will accelerate and unemployment will continue to fall.</P>
    <P>We recently announced a series of measures under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  These measures are primarily designed to facilitate self-sustaining investment or output with the objective of accelerating employment growth.  They are consistent with our overall development strategy.  They will make a valuable contribution to job creation in such key areas as tourism, fishing, forestry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the excellent progress we have made over the last two years in reducing Government borrowing, a lot more remains to be done.  The fact is that, even with a borrowing requirement this year well below the budget target, we will still be borrowing on a very large scale in 1988; debt-servicing payments will still cost £2 billion this year; the national debt now stands at over £24 billion; and the underlying trend in the ratio of debt to GNP is still upward.  What this means is that too much of our resources are still going to service debt instead of being used for more productive, employment-generating purposes; and that the debt burden on the economy continues to grow.</P>
    <P>The debt problem built up over a long period and will require continued determined action to resolve it.  We cannot relax until we have halted the rise in the debt/GNP ratio.  Indeed our objective over the medium-term must be to bring down that ratio.  This is the only way to free the economy from the constraints of a high debt burden, and to protect us from exposure to factors outside our control &mdash; such as foreign interest rate and exchange rate changes &mdash; that large debt entails.  If we do not continue in our work on improving the public finances we could end up back where we started, and the favourable prospects now emerging for higher growth and more jobs would be reversed.</P>
    <P>Some people might be lulled into a false sense of security by the success of the tax amnesty.  I must stress that the <Col N="644" /> vast bulk of the amnesty receipts are of a once-of nature and will not be repeated next year.  They will not be available to finance additional expenditure next year. The reduction in 1988 borrowing arising from the tax amnesty will result in debt service costs in 1989 being about £30 million lower than they would otherwise have been.  While this saving is very welcome it puts the yield from the amnesty into its true perspective.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the carry forward to next year of part of this year's revenue buoyancy, as well as the full year expenditure savings flowing from earlier decisions, the 1989 budgetary prospect against which the Government had to prepare the Estimates was not easy.  It reflected the heavy costs that will arise next year from certain 1988 budget decisions.  The 1988 budget decisions on income tax will cost the Exchequer £150 million in 1989; the decisions on social welfare will cost about £100 million while the second general increase under the 1987 public service pay agreement will cost about £70 million next year.  Some commentators have not allowed sufficiently for these factors in forming their views on the opening position for next year.</P>
    <P>Taken overall, the opening borrowing requirement for next year in the absence of corrective action was well above the range needed to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio.  There was no alternative, therefore, but to make further expenditure savings.  Failure to face up to this would damage seriously the economic confidence which we have so carefully nurtured.</P>
    <P>For the second year in succession work on the determination of departmental spending allocations has been completed much earlier than was normally the case. The benefits of early publication are clearcut.  It demonstrates to the Dáil, the public and the financial markets the Government's continuing commitment to firm management of the public finances and allows for open discussion among elected representatives and interested observers on the direction of public expenditure policy.  It also gives spending <Col N="645" /> Departments and the public sector generally time to plan their 1989 expenditure and to put in place the measures needed to keep expenditure within the allocations determined by the Government.</P>
    <P>Following the very successful expenditure review process carried out in preparing the 1988 Estimates, the Government decided to adopt the same comprehensive searching approach to settling departmental allocations for 1989.</P>
    <P>During the early summer a team of officials from my Department, and an independent economist examined with the spending Departments all expenditure programmes.  The recommendations of this team were then carefully considered by the Government in June and July and a wideranging package of expenditure reduction measures was decided upon.  Departments were instructed to prepare proposed Estimates during August which reflected the many review decisions taken by the Government. In drawing up their Estimates, Departments were told that no proposal for additional spending on new or expanded programmes would be entertained by the Government.  In September the Government gave close detailed scrutiny to the departmental spending Estimates submitted.</P>
    <P>The overall results of the review and estimates processes was to reduce Exchequer-funded expenditure by some £224 million in 1989, as compared with the 1988 budget allocations.  Of this, £118 million falls on non-capital expenditure and £106 million on capital spending.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer expenditure allocations in the Estimates and PCP reflect reductions of some £311 million relative to what expenditure would have been in 1989 if we had not acted.  This saving of £311 million is additional to the carryover benefit we are gaining from previous expenditure decisions, and favourable expenditure trends.</P>
    <P>I have given the figures of £224 million, and £311 million because it is natural that the House, and the public, should want to know both figures.  There has been some comment to the effect that the <Col N="646" /> Government are highlighting the £311 million figure, and are thereby trying to give the impression that they have cut expenditure more severely than is in fact the case.  This is not so.  We have not given exceptional prominence to the figure.  The Government statement on the Estimates was identical in its approach on this matter last year and this; then as now figures on both basis were given.</P>
    <P>I feel that the figure of £311 million is a better guide to our approach to public expenditure in 1989 than that of £224 million.  Any Government, in settling the Estimates for the coming year, have to deal with upward pressures on public spending, such as the full year effects of the previous year's pay and social welfare increases, and the impact of the coming year's inflation.  If their aim was to hold the total level of spending unchanged from one year to the next, the allocations for some programmes in the coming year would have to be reduced just to offset these upward pressures.  When expenditure in the coming year is settled at a lower level than in the previous year, and that is the position for Exchequer spending in 1989, the reductions have to be greater again.</P>
    <P>The basic point is that the Government, in settling the 1989 Estimates and Public Capital Programme, decided on ways in which £311 million Exchequer expenditure will be saved in 1989.  It is not easy to make such large savings, and I have no doubt that we will face criticism from some of those affected by the steps we have decided.  We could perhaps have deflected some of this criticism by not publishing the figure, giving only the lower figure of £224 million but that lower figure would have given the House, and the public, a misleading impression of the approach to public spending underlying the 1989 Estimates.</P>
    <P>Our aim has been to maintain the downward pressure on the overall level of public expenditure without restricting the access to public services of those groups in our society who must turn to the State for support, and without reducing the effectiveness of our economic <Col N="647" /> development policies.  We intend to continue to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of public expenditure while ensuring that the quality of public services and particularly social services is preserved.</P>
    <P>Over the last two years we have made significant progress in reducing expenditure. Based on the latest expenditure and GNP figures, total Exchequer expenditure was 53.6 per cent of GNP in 1986. We reduced it to an estimated 50.3 per cent of GNP in 1987 and this year it is budgeted to fall to 49.1 per cent of GNP. Given expenditure savings the outturn for this year will be a bit lower.  The Government are confident that the expenditure levels reflected in the 1989 Abridged Estimates Volume and Summary PCP will ensure a further fall in the expenditure-GNP ratio for 1989.</P>
    <P>During this debate other Ministers will comment on what the 1989 Estimates mean for their expenditure areas, so I will confine my comments to the general picture and areas which are my direct responsibility.</P>
    <P>In examining the Estimates this year the Government again paid particular attention to departmental administration budgets.  Travel and subsistence allocations have been very tightly drawn and Departments and public service agencies will have to ensure that only necessary travel is undertaken, and on the most economical basis possible.</P>
    <P>The budgets for office machinery and computerisation were also closely scrutinised. While the Government sees computerisation in the Civil Service playing a key role in delivering Government services in a more cost-efficient way, it, like any other investment for which money has to be borrowed, must be looked at in terms of the benefits it brings.  Equally importantly, it must be geared to the capacity of the organisations involved to make the changes that effective computerisation demands.</P>
    <P>Savings are also being made next year by curtailing maintenance work on <Col N="648" /> Government property and by transferring responsibility for contract maintenance work from the Office of Public Works to individual Departments.</P>
    <P>We have also decided to introduce from January 1989, fees ranging from £25 to £75 for first appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation in respect of his determination of the rateable valuation of property and also to introduce a flat rate charge of £20 for all applications for revision of the valuation of a property. The introduction of these fees is fully justifiable.  The cost of the valuation process is some £3 million annually and it is time that those benefiting from it contributed something to the cost of the service provided.  The fee income will only recover a small proportion of the cost of the service.</P>
    <P>Turning to public service numbers, the Government have decided that public service numbers policy in 1989 will follow much the same lines as in 1988.  It will remain the case that no vacancy in the Civil Service will be filled without the consent of the Minister for Finance, and that no vacancy in any other area of the public service, excluding the commercial State bodies, may be filled without the approval of the Minister responsible with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The early retirement terms on general offer to all personnel aged 50 and over in the Civil Service, health boards and non-commercial State bodies will not apply in 1989.  People have been told that they must make up their minds on whether they wish to apply for early retirement and, if they do, that they must have left the public service by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The redundancy terms will be offered in 1989 in specific areas only in the public service where surplus staff have been identified.  The result is that the requirement for early retirement payments is projected to fall from £80 million in 1988 to £25 million in 1989.  The Estimates volume provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The strong budgetary position in 1988 has made it possible to meet part of the 1988 exceptional lump sum redundancy costs from normal Exchequer sources <Col N="649" /> while keeping well within the overall budgetary targets.  For this reason it was decided to defer to 1989, £25 million of the advance surplus income payment which the Central Bank was due to pay to the Exchequer in 1988.  The Central Bank have agreed to this arrangement. This deferral does not change the total amount which the bank has agreed to advance the Exchequer to finance early retirement payments.  Only the timing of receipts from the Bank will be changed.</P>
    <P>The repayment terms which will apply to the £25 million advance surplus income payments in 1989 will be the same as applied to earlier surplus income advances.  The advance will be repaid, after a one year moratorium, by way of 4 equal annual deductions from the normal surplus income payments due by the bank to the Exchequer.  These arrangements with the Central Bank will not affect the normal payment of surplus income which would be due to the Exchequer from the bank in 1989.</P>
    <P>As regards the Exchequer Pay and Pensions bill, the allocations for Departments for 1989&mdash;shown in the Estimates Volume and totalling £2,948 million &mdash; make allowance for the cost of the second general increase under the Public Service Pay Agreement which is due to be paid to most public servants from 1 January 1989 and averages about 2.5 per cent. Low inflation, coupled with the tax concessions granted in the 1988 budget ensure that this pay increase will result in a further real improvement in the living standards of public servants.  The total cost is £70 million.  The Estimates also make allowance for the cost of special increases under the 1986 PSPA which are already in the process of being paid.</P>
    <P>Clause 3.2 of the 1987 Public Service Pay Agreement sets out a framework for the implementation of new special pay increases.  That clause provides for the payment of 40 per cent of such increases from 1 July 1989, but includes a statement that if the Government consider that these payments would have such serious financial and budgetary consequences as <Col N="650" /> to put at risk the central objectives underlying the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> they shall consult with ICTU by 1 May next.  The Estimates volume does not include provision for any such further special pay increases.  While it is too early at this stage to speculate as to eventual cost of these claims, it is clear that significant costs will be involved.  My Department are continually monitoring the situation, and the Government will consider the whole question of the payment of special pay increases in settling the 1989 budget.</P>
    <P>The public expenditure plans for 1989 &mdash; set out in the Estimates and Public Capital Programme &mdash; represent a further positive step in this Government's strategy to revitalise our economy.  They will build on the progress we have made over the past two years.  They will continue to improve domestic and international confidence in the management and direction of the economy.  Indeed, we can view the commentary on Ireland in the European Commission's Annual Economic Report, to which I referred earlier, as further endorsement of the correctness of this strategy.  The report recognises that the prospects for growth are &ldquo;brighter than for some years&rdquo;. Nevertheless, it says we should continue to give precedence over other considerations to the process of budgetary adjustment.</P>
    <P>The reaction of commentators to the Estimates has been mixed.  Some have argued that the savings are too great; others that they are too small.  The argument that the savings are too small relates to the size of our public debt and the present level of taxation, both of which give legitimate grounds for concern.</P>
    <P>It is easy to draw up a notional budget table for 1989 and to form a view on the scale of savings that should be made from, say, the point of view of a high rate taxpayer hoping for a large cut in his tax burden, or from that of someone concerned solely with financial markets.  The Government are conscious of these considerations. But they must also be conscious of social and economic considerations.  Overall we have reduced <Col N="651" /> expenditure wherever we felt that the economic and social consequences would not be unacceptably harsh.  We have been highly conscious of the need to protect the less fortunate.</P>
    <P>We have struck a balance between financial considerations and the other factors I have mentioned.  I believe that we have got the balance right.  Indeed, to judge from the performance of the market in Government paper, the financial markets are satisfied with what we have done.</P>
    <P>Anyone who argues that we should have effected more savings should say where we should have done so.  Anyone who says we should have achieved less savings must either accept that taxation would have to be increased on a wide basis, affecting those on moderate incomes; or that the public finances should be allowed to deteriorate, with all that would imply for interest rates, confidence, and, quite soon, jobs.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate to take place over the next few days and hope it will be conducted in a constructive, realistic manner.  On the basis of the amendments tabled to the motion I believe it will be conducted in that manner.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;Programme&rdquo; to add to the Motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;published by the Government on 18th October, 1988.  In noting the publication of the 1989 Estimates Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that they present only one part of the budgetary and financial picture for 1989, and resolves to have a full debate on each estimate as amended, as soon as possible after the 1989 Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1989 Abridged Estimates are surprising. Despite a long sequence of leaks on the part of Government Ministers and off-record press briefings suggesting swingeing public expenditure cuts, when <Col N="652" /> the Abridged Estimates for 1989 were published on Tuesday last they arrived more with a whimper than a bang.  They are surprising for another reason.  Progress made by the Government in the last two budgets in reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement and moving toward stabilising the national debt/GNP ratio was achieved principally by cuts in public expenditure.  If similar progress is made in the 1989 budget it will be done not by cuts in public expenditure but by increasing the amount of revenue collected by the Exchequer from taxes, levies and miscellaneous charges.  If this does not happen the Exchequer borrowing requirement will remain too high in 1989 and the prospect of stabilisation of the debt/GNP ratio will recede.</P>
    <P>I agree that there are real reductions in the funding of some Government programmes in these Estimates but the ground gained is lost by real increases in expenditure on other Government programmes, principally those with a large pay bill content.</P>
    <P>First I should like to discuss the overall impact of these Estimates.  Then I should like to examine the allocation for some Government Departments and individual programmes together with the effect of the allocations made on the delivery of services.  Finally I should like to suggest what should be our general approach in the medium term.</P>
    <P>In the press statement which accompanied the publication of the Book of Estimates the Government claimed credit for expenditure cuts amounting to £311 million.  That figure is based on the extra expenditure required to fund all Government programmes had the Government taken no action in this Book of Estimates or in previous budgetary estimate campaigns.  Immediately we see that political credit is being claimed again for ground won previously and that the real benefit of the cuts amounts to £224 million rather than £311 million.  Eighty-seven million pounds of the claimed expenditure cuts disappears like last year's snow.  The £224 million of expenditure cuts claimed for these Estimates <Col N="653" /> consists of £118 million on current spending and £106 million on capital spending. They are significant savings if real but on examination these savings, too, begin to melt.</P>
    <P>Let us look first at two major items on the current side.  This year the Government introduced a voluntary retirement scheme for public servants.  This led to public service pay bill savings by reducing the overall number of public servants. However, it had two cost elements, one immediate, the provision of lump sum gratuities to those who availed of the scheme and one progressive, the cost of ongoing pensions.  The Central Bank provided the money to fund the lump sums. This was done, not by means of a loan or a grant, but by the Central Bank advancing £80 million of accrued profits to the Exchequer for this purpose.  The Minister, in his speech, has amended this figure somewhat.  The Government's early retirement scheme will continue next year but at a reduced level of activity.  The lump sum cost in these Estimates is £25 million so this is the amount that the Central Bank will advance in 1989.</P>
    <P>A cut in public expenditure of £55 million is being claimed as a consequence but there is no cut, nor is there any saving to the Exchequer because the Central Bank have provided the money for the purpose of the early retirement scheme only and will not advance this extra £55 million to the Exchequer for other purposes in 1989.  It is quite proper to present this in the Book of Estimates but it is sharp practice to claim that it represents either a cut in public expenditure or a saving to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>When we examine cuts in the Office of the Minister for Finance, the amount at the disposal of the Minister from expenditure arising from the national lottery is £40 million, a reduction of £20 million on this year's figures.  This year's figures, because of delays in gearing up for the expenditure of lottery funds, contained a carry-over from 1987, together with the expected disposable profit from 1988. The 1989 Estimate figure is a one year <Col N="654" /> figure and this explains the reduced Estimate. It is quite properly calculated and presented but to claim it as a reduction in public expenditure for the purpose of fiscal correction is nonsense.</P>
    <P>These two spurious cuts, one on the lump sum provision for retiring public servants and the other on the saving on the lottery, eliminates £75 million of the claimed savings of £118 million on current expenditure, leaving a net amount of £43 million.  The plot thickens, however, when this is further examined.  The 1989 Estimates, as published, represent reductions or increases on the 1988 Estimates as published.  It has been clear, however, from mid-year that the 1988 outturn will be lower than the 1988 Estimate by between £50 million and £100 million or, having listened to the Minister today, significantly more than £100 million. If we take the main figure for the purposes of examining it, of £75 million &mdash; although the Minister's speech suggests that the figure is far higher &mdash; we see that instead of a saving on current expenditure Estimates there will be an increase in current expenditure next year over the 1988 outturn.  That is not progress.</P>
    <P>I should now like to examine the savings claimed on the capital side.  The total, according to the Government press statement, is £106 million.  This represents the Government funding of the capital programme but it overstates, by £49 million, the cut in expenditure on the capital programme.  The Government have allowed certain State-sponsored bodies to increase their borrowings to fund their capital programmes by a total sum of £49 million.  This borrowing is underwritten by the Government.  What is really happening is that £49 million has been shifted from the Exchequer borrowing requirement to the public sector borrowing requirement and the real cut on capital spending, on the face of it, is £57 million rather than £106 million. Here again, however, and for the same reason which I pointed out when I was discussing the current Estimate, the national lottery plays a part.</P>
    <P>In 1988, so far, a sum of almost £34 <Col N="655" /> million has been included in the capital Estimate.  In the 1989 Estimate this has been reduced to £15 million.  This accounts for £19 million of the purported capital savings but, as in the revenue side of the Estimate, there is no corresponding increase of £19 million, the reduction claimed does not take place.  A cut is a cut is a cut and a saving is a saving is a saving but the whole economic debate has been about the size of the gap between expenditure and income.  If £20 million drops off the expenditure side and is matched by £20 million dropping off the income side then the gap is not closed by one iota.  That is what has happened in the case of the £55 million on the current side for lump sums for retiring civil servants.  That is also what happened in the case of the £20 million for the national lottery funds which are for one year rather than for two.  This is what happened on the capital side when the national lottery amount is reduced from £33 million down to £15 million.  When the Minister claims a saving of £19 million there is a corresponding reduction on the revenue side of £19 million also and the gap is not closing.  Consequently, on the capital side, the purported savings of £57 million on the public borrowing requirement is reduced to £38 million.</P>
    <P>Now, it is evident that Exchequer capital spending will fall short this year of the Estimate.  By the end of September, according to Department of Finance figures, £181 million out of an allocation of £332 million had been borrowed.  Three-quarters of the year is gone and half the money is left.  I believe that the 1988 capital outturn will be significantly less than the Estimate and I expect the 1989 public capital programme to involve an increase in expenditure over the 1988 outturn.  If there are any savings, they are in the area of the difference between nominal increases and increases which are indexed for inflation.  There are real increases in expenditure on the capital and on the current expenditure side over the expected 1988 outturn.  The Minister's speech today reinforces this opinion because he is now claiming a 1988 outturn <Col N="656" /> which is lower than I expected, based on the information which was made available by the Minister to the public previously. So much for the overall expenditure cuts and savings achieved in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The progress begun when Fianna Fáil adopted the Fine Gael 1987 budget and continued through the 1988 budget has not been maintained in these Estimates. For years now we have been bridging the gap between expenditure and revenue with a level of domestic and foreign borrowing which is unsustainable, leading to an accumulated national debt which is also unsustainable.  There are, of course, two alternatives to borrowing if we wish to close the gap, namely expenditure cuts or increased revenue.  We can cut or we can tax or we can borrow.  If we want to reduce borrowing we can either cut or tax.  If we fail to cut and we will not or cannot borrow we can only tax.  That is the foundation on which the Minister is building the 1989 budget.</P>
    <P>My primary concern with this Book of Estimates is that the Minister and the Government, having failed to cut, will tax instead.  There is evidence in the Book of Estimates which suggests that this will happen.</P>
    <P>There are real cutbacks in programmes in some Departments, even though the real increases in expenditure in other Departments cancel these out.  Where programmes are significantly cut, however the consequence of the policy decision is that the particular level of service will be maintained by imposing charges, which are in effect tax increases. This is true in the areas of apparent large cuts, for example, in the Departments of the Environment, Social Welfare and Education.</P>
    <P>The cut in the rates support grant is about 8 per cent.  Local authorities will not be able to absorb this and maintain the present level of services.  Now, as the present level of services provided by local authorities is inadequate, it is a pretence to suggest that such a cut can be absorbed by further retrenchment by local authorities.</P>
    <P>We understand that the Minister for <Col N="657" /> the Environment has informed local authorities of their allocations for 1989. These indicate a cutback in the rates support grant of between 5 per cent and 6 per cent outside of Dublin, but cuts in excess of 11 per cent in Dublin city and county.  It will be the responsibility of Fianna Fáil members of local authorities to make an appropriate response to these decisions.  They hold an overall majority on most councils.  The decision of the Minister for the Environment and of the Government will lead inevitably to increased local charges in local authorities which already impose them, and to their imposition for the first time by the Fianna Fáil majority on Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>This does not cut public expenditure, it increases taxation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare show cuts of £89 million.  Much of this can be explained by the prediction that the live register of unemployed will be 236,000 on average rather than the 253,000 estimated this year.  I have no doubt that this figure will be achieved, if the Minister for Social Welfare continues to chase persons off the live register, through job search programmes and if his colleagues in all Government Departments continue to urge our unemployed young to emigrate, by directly advocating it, by preaching a message of hopelessness and despair and by failing dismally to fulfil their job creation targets and by certain members of the Government, principally the Taoiseach, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, giving the impression that they are the official emigration agents of the United States and Australian Governments.</P>
    <P>This live register figure will not be achieved by the creation of jobs and this Book of Estimates will make matters worse rather than better, as those areas of expenditure where real cuts are proposed are those by in large with the greatest job creation linkage.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare estimate there is a similar trend to that already noted in the Department of the Environment.  Where real cuts take place, they are replaced by increased charges, which are, in effect, <Col N="658" /> taxation increases.  The ceiling for employee PRSI payments is raised by £500; and for employer PRSI, the ceiling is raised to £20,000.  The Minister has not given us a figure for these increases.  He may do so in his reply and I understand that this will lead to an extra £70 million flowing to the Exchequer.  These are, in effect, further tax increases of the worst kind which load a further burden on the shoulders of the PAYE worker and his employer with all the other attendant ills which follow on, extra increases in personal taxation which on numerous occasions in this House both I on behalf of Fine Gael and Deputy McDowell on behalf of his party, have pointed out to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare claims that this year's imposition of PRSI on the self employed will lead to an increased return in 1989.  I am sure he is correct as it will apply for a full year and at a higher rate.  It is another example of increased taxation rather than reductions in public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education Estimate shows increases in teachers' pay which are due to technical pay roll circumstances, rather than any increases in service.  There are two cuts however worth mentioning, one in higher education and one in school transport.  The cut will be replaced by increased school bus charges and by a 5 per cent increase in third level college fees, increases in charges equivalent to taxation increases.</P>
    <P>The Government may continue in 1989 to make progress towards stabilising the debt/GNP ratio.  The Minister has claimed that it will and any time the Minister has stated something categorically in the House, he does not mislead the House. If the Government do make this progress it will be done by tax increases rather than by expenditure cuts, and from the evidence in the Book of Estimates some of these tax increases will be highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister signalling to me that he is hitching a lift to another climate and will not be around when these predictions come true?</P>
    <P>The Minister may decide to further <Col N="659" /> increase taxes on budget day.  Last year he imposed increases of almost £100 million but gave back £91 million in income tax relief.</P>
    <P>In the absence of progress being made by either expenditure cuts or increased taxes on budget day, I presume the Minister for Finance is relying on bouyancy of revenue accruing from existing taxes to close the gap between expenditure and revenue.  There is evidence from the quarterly returns that there is bouyancy in income tax, VAT and excise receipts.</P>
    <P>The prospect is complicated by the success of the tax amnesty.  We do not know whether it will lead to increased revenue bouyancy in 1989 by bringing extra taxpayers into the revenue net, or whether it will reduce bouyancy because it has brought forward into 1988 payments of arrears, which would be made in any event in 1989.  I invite the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is confident that revenue bouyancy will do in 1989 what expenditure cuts did in 1987 and 1988, it still leads to difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is only of academic interest to the tax paying rabbit, whether he is caught in last year's snare or in one newly set on budget night.  The overall adverse economic effect is the same, regardless of how the increased tax revenue comes about, and while one tax may have a different economic effect than another, a Minister who relies on bouyancy alone does not control the effect of his impositions.</P>
    <P>This Book of Estimates does not change, except in a marginal way, the pattern of public expenditure.  Many programmes are underfunded, but they lie there in wait, some of them with voracious appetites, for the spending Departments to win back the ground lost to the Department of Finance over recent years.  If the state of the public finances improves next year it will be because of new tax impositions, together with extra yields from existing taxes.  While this approach may improve the economic statistics, it will act against the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>As well as the general pro-taxation and <Col N="660" /> anti-job trend that underlies this Book of Estimates, I would like to note one other area, where in my opinion the Government have not only let the country down, but have let themselves down.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in the past of the necessity of reducing factor costs in our economy. I note some progress has been made by the Government in bringing electricity costs, and telecommunication costs into line with our European neighbours. Transport costs however are totally out of line.  We are on the margins of Europe far from the market place and our road network is a national disgrace.</P>
    <P>This year the Government announced the establishment of a main roads authority and appointed a board and chief executive.  The 1988 Estimate proposed a figure of £120 million for roads; the 1989 Estimate proposes the same figure, a reduction in real terms.  Worse than this, however, is the fact that the Government have foregone at least £40 million of EC funds available for roads by not providing matching funds in the Estimates.  We need a road network superior to those of our European neighbours to keep us competitive.  In the years after 1992, when the channel tunnel is completed we will be the only European island nation. Not only will we need low cost access transport to Europe but an efficient cost effective road network especially to our ports.</P>
    <P>The treatment of investment in major roads in these Estimates is tantamount to criminal negligence.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what the Minister foc the Environment was doing at the Cabinet table unless he was trying to impress the Taoiseach that he was the best man around for cutting in case a job vacancy might occur in the near future, because he certainly was neither defending his Department nor improving the services and neither was he acting in the national interest in the job he is in at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Except East Limerick.  I would like, in conclusion, to contemplate our approach to controlling the public finances over the next five years or so.  The Minister has stated that the objective of the Government is to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio in the 1989 and 1990 budgets.  He has said that on EBR of between 7 per cent and 5 per cent of GNP will achieve this, and that his opening position for 1989 will be significantly above the higher margin.</P>
      <P>I am referring to a speech the Minister made some weeks ago and not today's. The Minister slightly amended the situation today but, as presented, it corresponds closely enough to what he said some weeks ago.  The ESRI believe that an Exchequer borrowing requirement of less than 5 per cent is required to stabilise the debt.  Let us suppose we reach the necessary target, whatever it is, in the 1990 budget.  What then?  We will have an accumulated debt of more than £27 billion which will no longer be rising as a percentage of GNP, but which will still be rising.  Will we continue with present policies, with a cut here and a tax imposition there, to reduce this to proportions safe from the exigencies of rising international interest rates and world slumps? Are we to continue with cuts, real or imaginary, of £300 million a year for the next 90 years until we have paid off the debt?  That is what it takes to pay off a debt of £27 billion in modules of £300 million.  It would take 90 years to do it. That is not a great financial prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest this is obviously a nonsensical approach but have the Government a view on this matter?  Is there life after debt stabilisation?  When do the Government expect that this House may look at Estimates objectively, decide the level of service we require in any area and provide the funds necessary to deliver that service?  I believe and I strongly advocate that the Minister accepts that it is time to get back to a more traditional approach to the public finances and to accept that there is a real distinction between current and capital expenditure.  I believe that if stabilisation of the debt-GNP ratio is around the corner we should accept the <Col N="662" /> elimination of the current budget deficit as our medium-term target.  I believe that this generation of politicians should impose upon themselves the discipline of a balanced current budget and agree to achieve this over a period of three to four years and maintain it subsequently.</P>
    <P>It is politically easier to cut capital expenditure than to cut current expenditure but the effect of continual capital cuts is very damaging to the economy. The capital budget has been devastated over the past seven years with very damaging consequences for the economy.  To cut capital investment to enable us to continue to fund current spending programmes, and to a large extent this is what happened in last year's budget and in the previous year's budget, is a recipe for low growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>I believe it is time for us to reconsider our position, to re-establish the real distinction that lies between day-to-day spending and spending for investment purposes.  While we should continue with a clear objective of balancing the current budget in the medium-term, we should at the same time begin to free the capital programme from its present enslavement to debt control so that decisions fundamental to the development and growth of the economy can be made.  I would advocate that the Minister consider what I have said and, if possible, include it as part of Government policy objectives.</P>
    <P>I have moved our amendment to make it clear that Fine Gael are noting the publication of these Estimates but that does not imply an acceptance of the Estimates. The board of directors of a company would not make a decision after seeing only one side of a balance sheet, that is, the spending side, without a clear view of the income side.  Fine Gael will not do so either.  We want the fullest possible opportunity to debate the individual Estimates at the first available opportunity after the 1989 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication by the Government of the Estimates for the Public Service, for 1989 and the Public Capital Programme for 1989, has occurred yet again in October of the year <Col N="663" /> preceding the budget to which they relate.  This is commendably early and I congratulate the Minister for Finance on that account.  By dividing the budgetary process into two distinct parts and by separating public consideration of those parts by a number of months there are a number of effects, one of which is that there is more room for closer scrutiny of each individual part in its own context.  I hope this will mean there will be more room for closer scrutiny of the terms of these Estimates in the next few days and weeks in this House.</P>
      <P>I would point out however that a motion to note the Estimates <i>en bloc</i> is not a very satisfactory method of considering their content and that is why I put down on the Order Paper an amendment to the Minister's motion in similar terms to the one moved by Deputy Noonan, to point out and emphasise that these Estimates only derive their meaning and significance from the other part of the budgetary process which is the statement of the Government's budgetary intent which will happen in the early portion of next year.  Many of the implications of these Estimates are entirely unclear as of now.  We depend not so much on the substance of what is printed in the booklet supplied to the Members of this House and members of the public but rather on what has been leaked about them by members of the Government in press briefings which are not the subject matter of a White Paper or close public scrutiny or debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, we learn informally now that it is proposed to increase the ceiling for PRSI from £16,200 to £16,700.  We also learn, perhaps correctly or incorrectly, that it is proposed to increase the level of PRSI for employers up to a figure of £20,000.  Those amount to increased tax measures and taxes on employment. I will come back later to their effect but let me say this: there is no point in discussing a Book of Estimates in terms which are merely arithmetical when subtending them and justifying them are steps already decided upon which have profound effects and will have profound <Col N="664" /> effects on the pattern of employment in this country.  Therefore, I believe that if we are to have this annual debate, noting the Estimates as published in the autumn of the preceding year, then the very least we must do is to have an accompanying White Paper to explain what decisions have already been made which back up those Estimates and to flesh them out in a way which makes sense.  It is ridiculous that we have column after column of figures thrown at us which require, effectively, to be decoded to understand their significance.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance, if they are asking us to note these Estimates, and I presume that intellectually means that we come to terms and grasp their meaning and importance in those circumstances owe this House and the Minister for Finance in particular owes this House the duty to come to this House with a White Paper accompanying the publication of the Estimates.  It was done in the past in some respects more or less as part and parcel of the budgetary process. Now that the process has been divided we find ourselves with Estimates standing by themselves unexplained and we are looking through a glass darkly at them for their significance.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, for instance, I believe that provision is nominally made for a 2 per cent increase in the amount of the ministerial Estimate but in real terms even on the Minister's account today that amounts to a reduction. Taking into account that public sector pay costs are increasing at a rate of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent per annum, the real value of the part of the health Vote which will be spent on non-pay items will decrease by between 2 per cent and 3 per cent next year.  That is only one instance of a feature that runs throughout the entirely of these Estimates, namely, that we are proposing to spend more money in 1989 in delivering less services by the same bodies than in 1988.</P>
    <P>The level of public sector pay which has increased at a faster rate than the rate of inflation is artificially reduced by the <Col N="665" /> £80 million spent by the Government on the public sector early retirement scheme which has reduced the numbers on the public sector payroll.  I also note that the cost of pensions has gone up by 8 per cent this year.  It is legitimate to take a look at what the Minister refers to in his speech as the real increase in the value of public sector pay.  Why is an insolvent employer offering real increases to its employees when it proposes to do less with them, to provide less services by them and to derive less benefit from them in the next year?  It is fine for the Minister to say he is glad to note a real increase in the value of public sector pay because the increases arranged in last year's budget and the increases provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> exceed the rate of inflation.  They are only part of the story because the special increases that are coming through match those increases.  As a result we will find ourselves in 1988 and 1989 paying more and more to the public service generally to deliver less and less.</P>
    <P>For instance, in the Department of Agriculture and Food salaries, wages and allowances for the coming year are up 5 per cent, or £3 million.  This increase accounts for all of the nominal increase in expenditure in that Department.  In crude terms it will cost 5 per cent more in salaries, wages and allowances to deliver about 2 per cent or 3 per cent less in terms of real services to agriculture next year.  The same applies in the Department of the Environment.  The total budget is down by 11 per cent, but the cost in terms of salaries, wages and allowances is only down by 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>In Vote 10, Office of Public Works, there is no change in salaries but that office is spending less and doing less than it did last year.  Expenditure is down 11 per cent but the same amount is being spent on salaries.  Another example, to go from the large to the small, is the Army Pensions Board where a 6 per cent increase in wages, salaries and allowances occurs in the context of a 3 per cent increase in the nominal value of the pensions administered.  Allowing for inflation, it will cost 3 per cent more <Col N="666" /> to deliver the same real value of Army Pensions next year.</P>
    <P>The Government have told us there is a 1 per cent decrease in gross non-capital supply services but, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, that is based on a false comparison. Table 5, page xiii of the Book of Estimates, compares an Estimate of £7,189 million for 1989 with an Estimate of £7,244 million for 1988.  That would be all very well if we did not know the real figure for 1988 is likely to be £7,150 million, and therefore that this gross non-capital expenditure will be up this year, not down.</P>
    <P>Throughout these Estimates and their presentation in public, there has been a sustained effort by the Government to portray the effect of these Estimates as entailing cuts in public spending.  I agree with every word spoken by Deputy Noonan, and I will not repeat what he said or attempt to parallel what he said by giving other examples, but the fact is that this set of Estimates does not of itself amount to an independent and selfstarting campaign in 1989 to reduce public expenditure or to make real savings which were not already budgeted for.  In reality, the real cuts are arguably much less than £100 million and the notional figure of £311 million trumpeted about by the Government is in the main designed to whet the appetite of the business community who were led by the Government to expect a major drive for economy in the public finances.  That drive for economy has not occurred this year.</P>
    <P>When you look at the public service in this Book of Estimates, the one thing you can say with confidence is that it has all survived more or less intact.  The question then arises: what do the Government have in mind as the strategic view of the service, its structures, and the impact the public sector is to have on Irish society as time goes by?  Is it, as Deputy Noonan suggested and I am loath to believe, that all these Departments hope to winter out this particular storm and re-emerge next year if circumstances are better, and make the same mistakes, again waste money and use the same resources to <Col N="667" /> recreate many of the problems that economies have overcome in the last few years?</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any strategic direction in these Estimates.  Their effect is that the Irish taxpayer will be charged more by the public sector for delivering less and there is no indication that the Government understand the opportunity they are missing to lay the foundations for a radical reform of our system of taxation.  I heard what the Minister said about the tax burden in Ireland and I agree that their is some naiveté shown by those who say that the burden of taxation in Ireland, in European average terms, is excessive.  It is true that our tax burden as a percentage of gross domestic product is not abnormal in European terms, but that simple truth tells a much darker and deeper lie.  The structure of our taxation system is one of the most anti-work, antienterprise, anti-investment and antiemployment ever contrived by any Government in any country.  The Minister's statement, which goes back to the old hoary Fianna Fáil chestnut that their aim in life is to put two-thirds of the taxpayers on the standard rate, must be exposed and thrown out of the water.  It is not an aim worth pursuing.  It is an aim that can be achieved by very marginal tinkering with the tax rates as they stand and will not, if achieved, amount to any kind of major reform in the taxation system.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that when this Government took office more than 40 per cent of the people were paying the higher rate of tax and Fianna Fáil gave an undertaking to reduce that figure to 33 per cent during the life of this Government.  That is a commitment to change the marginal tax rate of one taxpayer in ten and does nothing to face the real problem with Irish tax, that is that the structure is hopeless from beginning to end.  One of the chief failings must be that we have contrived a tax system where a young single worker is given half the tax allowances and half the tax bands of a married person &mdash; that was the Government's response to the Murphy tax decision.  It was wrong <Col N="668" /> then and it is wrong now because it means that to give a comfortable taxation existence to a married couple we give only half the allowances to a single worker. He must be put through all the tax bands at an artificially fast rate while, at the same time, we force him to pay exorbitant tax levels on his earnings.</P>
    <P>Let us put on the record of this House what we have achieved.  We have brought surtax to the masses.  We have brought about a tax system where everybody pays 7¾ per cent PRSI on every penny of their earnings.  After the personal allowances, every taxpayer is paying tax at the rate of 42 per cent and reaches an all-time high of 65 per cent at the average industrial wage.  The consequences of that are that it costs an employer £3.29 to give £1 take-home pay to an employee.  That is one of the chief reasons why this country is failing to create employment.  The incidence of taxation on employment in Ireland is not simply a matter of the gross take of income tax; it is the structure of income tax itself.</P>
    <P>I wish to say on behalf of this party that I totally reject the notion that the system of taxation should be such as to give double the allowances and double the bands to a married couple as opposed to a single person.  It is the young single people who are leaving this country to get a fair return for their efforts.  It is not fair or right that somebody earning less than the average industrial wage has to pay more than £2 in every £3 at the margin to the State and that he or she costs the employer, over the whole range of their income, £2 for every £1 taken home.  That is anti-work taxation and can be changed without a huge alleviation of the tax burden in terms of its relationship to gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>I want to say this to those who talk about there being a trade-off between social justice and high taxation.  That is one of the great falsehoods being propagated. It is being propagated from pulpits and from editorial chairs.  There is not a co-relation between high marginal rates of tax which make the average industrial worker pay two thirds of his marginal earnings in tax and our commitment to <Col N="669" /> tackle social justice; quite the reverse is the case.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that we take the view that social justice without a growing employment base will never be achieved and that no amount of redistribution, no amount of redistributive impetus in Irish politics, will achieve social justice if the bottom line is that this country consigns a growing percentage of its people to the dole queue or the emigrant ship.  I looked at the Minister's speech to try to find even one passing reference to the whole concept of emigration. Of course, there are happy statistics which can be conjured up to suggest that there are more people at work in Ireland at the moment but what cannot be denied is that the live register of unemployed has only been reduced in the context of a huge haemorrhage of our workforce to economies which will offer them remunerative work in exchange for their presence and their contribution and at much lower tax rates than ours.</P>
    <P>I reject the concept that social justice in Ireland is advanced by the notion of a highly progressive tax system which hits work above everything else.  There is no strategic justification now for further increasing the employer tax burden to £20,000 on PRSI and the employee tax burden to £16,700 when the effect of those measures will be to make it more difficult to reward workers for their efforts and make it less likely that people will be employed here.  Those measures are retrogressive and a mistake.  The fact that they are not spelt out in any formal shape in the Estimates is an indication of how futile it is for us to debate columns of figures while keeping the implicit decisions in our inside pockets.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in the House that there should be tax reform and the Minister adverted to that in his speech.  There is a consensus in the House that tax reform cannot take the form of a simple &lsquo;Lawsonian&rsquo; tax giveaway.  This country cannot afford tax breaks which are not funded by public expenditure cuts, widening of the tax base nor restructuring of the individual shape of the tax burden on corporate and income tax.  That is <Col N="670" /> clear and I do not think it has to be stated again and again.  It is wrong of the Minister for Finance to suggest that those who propose tax reform are living in a fantasy world because there is no alternative to our system of taxation.  There are plenty of alternatives to the system of taxation we have and virtually all of them will improve the climate for employment here.  By doing so, virtually all of them will be moving in the direction of increasing rather than decreasing social justice.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in the House that the overall level of public expenditure explicit in these Estimates is at least not too much and not excessive.  I believe there are Members who, like me, would take the view that on this occasion we have missed the opportunity to make further savings of more radical kinds.  There is not, however, any agreement that the Government are getting the Irish people value for their money.  A strategy such as that being followed by the Government, which is being copperfastened by the Book of Estimates, one which leaves in place the overheads in terms of public service numbers and pay, in terms of health boards, semi-State agencies and public sector companies but cuts the level of State sector output in terms of services, is a strategy that is fundamentally weak and flawed.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government have lost their way and have lost momentum.  That is a pity because they have not taken on board the fact that they have a unique parliamentary position which no Government in the modern history of the State have had in that they enjoy general parliamentary support to radically transform the tax system and the nature, size and impact of the public sector in the Irish economy.  It seems to me that the permanent Government have won out. There is ample evidence that the permanent Government, the Civil Service, have triumphed in these Estimates which represent what looks very dangerously like the high tide mark of Government determination in this period of office. That is what I fear and I do not make <Col N="671" /> that statement with any degree of anticipation or pleasure because I genuinely believe that this Dáil is unique in that a great majority of its Members are prepared to pull together in the same general direction.  On this occasion the Government have failed to avail of the opportunity that was presented to them and have, on the contrary, decided to succumb to what I believe is a combination of laziness, departmental thinking, electoral jitters and &mdash; I have to say this as a compliment to the Minister &mdash; a sign that the Minister is relaxing his grip on the tiller to go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The other members of the Government who have not demonstrated the same singularity of mind and the same determination as the Minister for Finance has in playing his part in what should be a team effort have won out in the context of these Estimates.  Their lesser will and determination and willingness to be deflected has won.</P>
    <P>Where there ought to have been, if not the substance this year, a map for future years of root and branch change in the public service, there has been what I would term budgetary bonsai.  Where farreaching reductions in the amount of services have been made inevitable, as in the areas of health and local government, the Government seem content to allow other bodies, the hapless health boards and local authorities, to give expression in whatever way they can to the implications of the cutbacks provided for in the Book of Estimates.  The 8 per cent reduction in the rate support grants to local authorities is a case in point.  I note that it is to be concentrated on the Dublin area, presumably on the basis that somebody in some Department has decided that if Dublin city and county can do without charges, they can do with a greater proportion of the cutbacks.  The implication of that is, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, that they will be obliged to choose between dismantling their system of local government and local administration in a very substantial way or, on the other hand, to renege on their electoral promise, a Fianna Fáil electoral <Col N="672" /> promise it should be noted, not to introduce such charges and to abolish them where they exist.</P>
    <P>It seems clear that the strategy adopted by the Government is to abdicate wherever possible from the real political implications of the financial decisions that are being made.  That is typical and it speaks volumes of a Government who are unwilling, even in the widest ideological sense, to map out a real strategy for the country.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a mishmash of obfuscation. Yet again the trade unions and the Government are at loggerheads with each other in relation to the implications of Government cutbacks as they affect the guarantees apparently given to the trade unions in that agreement.  It seems to me that the agreement was always devoid of a strategic sense.  It was always flawed and self-contradictory but now we are beginning to see the extent of those inherent weaknesses in it.</P>
    <P>The sad fact is that a Government who do not have a direction and who never sought any mandate from the people for any direction now have to resort to mere figures concerned with gross job creation as an alternative to mapping out a strategy for our economy.  Where are we going to be in five years' time?  What number of public sector agencies will be in existence in five years' time?  Must we live in a world of perpetual intellectual striptease where we find, on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today, for instance, that a decision has been made to get rid of the Great Southern Hotels?  Was that decision made on foot of a coherent view that the State should not be the proprietor of a hotel chain?  If such a view is held should the State be the proprietor of an airline, a shipping line or a bus service?  Is there any indication whatsoever of a strategy in any of the measures which are set out in this set of Estimates?</P>
    <P>I note, for instance, that the allocation to CIE has been reduced.  Why?  Is it because you can abdicate responsibility in the circumstances to the board of a semi-State company and let them take <Col N="673" /> the consequences and the political flak for what is set out in this Book of Estimates? What is the thinking behind that reduction in support to CIE?  Are services to be lopped; are people to be sacked or is a portion of that company to be privatised?  None of these matters are made clear because this Government are a Government of all the cliches and none of the purposes which is demanded of a country that is emerging from a crisis.</P>
    <P>It is true that this Government have in many respects controlled public expenditure and have succeeded, because of the consensus in this House, in doing so with relative political ease. I know that because I speak as a member of a party who seem to have suffered in opinion polls for doing so.  Deputy Noonan's party do not seem to be doing great in the opinion polls either as a result of forming part of that consensus.  It is not as if at this stage there is some pressure on the Government or on supporters of the Government to trim their sails, to deflect them from a sense of purpose or to prevent them from articulating a strategy for this country.  There is no political pressure bringing about the weakness that we see in this Book of Estimates.  It is quite the reverse.  There is every opportunity to move forward politically.  This Government have every opportunity to spell out a strategy.  There is every possibility, for instance, in relation to the State sector to mark out a five year programme of privatisation and to specify the industries this Government propose to dispose of.  Nobody, even in Government, is saying that that should not happen.  There is an unwillingness to adopt anything that looks like an ideological view lest the mask of cordiality to the trade union movement should slip from Deputy Haughey's or Deputy Ahern's gaze when they deal with them as social partners in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There are signs that this Government are relaxing on their oars and that the opportunity to dramatically alter the impact of Government in our society, of the State sector on the economy, and to come to grips with re-organising and <Col N="674" /> getting good value from the public service is being lost.  The public sector requires management and a radical willingness to change and to improve it, to end programmes of expenditure which are wasteful or which amount to a transfer of resources to the haves in society rather than to the have nots.  None of that is evident here.  I thought that the 1988 budget was the first real budget that this Government could introduce and that perhaps they were postponing the spelling out of a strategy for one more year. Now we are getting fairly near the budgetary half way mark of this Government and there is still no indication whatsoever of any of their broad plans for this country or its economy.  Apart from vague, wishful statistics about gross job creation in various sectors, there is nothing of substance in terms of the changes this Government want to bring about in the impact of Government, the public sector and the public service on the society in which we exist.</P>
    <P>If this is the beginning of the end for decisive Government it is not because pressure from outside the Government is preventing change; it is because those inside the Government are losing heart. I do not want to say anything that sounds negative or that takes away from the sense of public confidence in our capacity to improve our economic existence and to recover our economic independence.  I do not want to say anything to undermine those welcome developments of recent years.  I want to say that we are not here like children watching the emperor going naked past us.  We will point out that there is a total failure of determination implicit in this set of Estimates, that there could have been something much more dramatic and that there still is an opportunity for something much greater.  There is an opportunity for this Government to use the consensus they now have to spell out a programme of dramatic reform which will transform this economy in the next three years.  There is an opportunity for this Government to seek, across the political divide, consensus in relation to the method in which the tax burden can <Col N="675" /> be internally restructured and widened in its effect.</P>
    <P>The revelations in a recent news magazine article about how the Government went about considering the financing of local government are an eye opener to the ordinary person.  Instead of finding out from the public and the other parties in the State what was available or what could be done, the Government instead sat around the Cabinet table and exchanged memoranda which were totally cynical and electorally oriented in their deep-seated thinking.  They threw away that decision to postpone further consideration of the matter any real capacity to refinance the local government sector in our society.  That to me shows a sense of electorally motivated paralysis which it is very sad to see when things are going so well in some senses for this Government.</P>
    <P>It is very sad to see this Government having a failure of conviction, a failure of courage and a failure of leadership when all the objective, parliamentary and political circumstances dictate that now is the time for bold decisions, for radicalism and for political courage which will bring about real improvement in this country. As I have said, it will not be as a result of outside pressure that this set of Estimates, and what appears to be the shape of the next budget, will mark the end of decisive government.  Unfortunately, all the problems stem from a failure of conviction, a failure of strategic sense and a failure of leadership within the ranks of the Government party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One can stabilise and reduce the debt-GNP ratio in most economies and at the same time one does not have to drift into a mentality that social equity in society is outmoded and irrelevant to the process.  In that framework the Labour Party believe that these Estimates are just no more than a re-enforcement of the mentality that now dominates political society on this island, namely, that any general approach to bringing about a more socially equitable society within the framework of major restraints <Col N="676" /> is outmoded, dated and even harmful to economic growth generally.  We do not accept that view.  We strongly hold the view that budget Estimates are and can be a very powerful weapon in bringing about, in our economic and social system, a greater equity.  We also hold the view that it is possible to have Estimates which simultaneously provide justice to those who are in poverty, to the old, the handicapped and the unemployed.  It is possible to bring about that social justice and at the same time stabilise our national debt-GNP ratio.</P>
      <P>I and my party do not accept that we are just doomed in a mechanistic kind of way to unending, slice by slice, thoughtless financial cuts, with little care for social equity and social justice.  We do not accept that view and we have never accepted it in the context of framing estimates and framing budgets.  Unfortunately, it seems that this Government and to quite an extent the two main Opposition parties have succumbed to a policy framework of what one might call Estimates importance &mdash; nothing can be done, just cut and cut again.  In that process we fail to confront the fundamental problem of poverty.  There is not the slightest effort in these Estimates to give even a token acknowledgment to the existence of that crisis in our society as has been amply brought to our notice time and time again by the ESRI and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>Let us take the individual Estimates. For example in Education, a substantial Estimate, there is no evidence of concern for those on low incomes for any greater access to full second level or third level education.  It is not as if the money were not there.  There are no efforts being made, there are no transfers and no change in policy, just simply cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no policy to confront the now rampant two-tier hospital care system. If we look at the Estimate for Foreign Affairs, to our shame there is almost a racial dismissal of our obligations to the poorest of the poor in the world.  For these reasons and because we are singularly unimpressed by the exercise <Col N="677" /> presented to us today, we in the Labour Party will vote against those Estimates.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle one of the most astonishing statements in relation to the Estimates appeared in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of last Sunday in a report by their political correspondent, Gerald Barry who quoted a source which looks suspiciously as if it were a Department of Finance source, certainly it is in that framework, though I may be wrong.  The final paragraph of that report was:</P>
    <P>For those involved in the cost-cutting proposals, however, it looks very different.  &ldquo;We have spent the last two years re-asserting the control of the Department of Finance over spending by all departments.  It looks now as if that victory, which was absolutely vital, for the good of the country, is beginning to slip away again.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  On the assumption he is a briefing official of the Department of Finance I must challenge what I regard, if it is from the Department of Finance, as the arrogance and the rather specious assumptions behind that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now public knowledge, though I did not disclose it, but I have my suspicions as to who did, that the Department of Finance opposed the introduction of the DIRT tax and then when it was finally pushed through they underestimated the yield by £200 million. That was something in terms of Estimates. We might recall also that the Department were unenthusiastic about the national lottery and that when we finally got it through, with great difficulty, they underestimated it by another £50 million.  When one considers, too, that the Department had reservations, to use the polite official word, as late as <Col N="678" /> November 1985 about the power of attachment in taxation reforms, one begins to question the assumptions behind the statements made.  We have to consider further that in a totally obsessive preoccupation with social expenditure that Department would never acknowledge there was massive ongoing tax evasion and avoidance to the extent of about £350 million a year.  The amnesty brought in £500 million this year but the ongoing evasion is about £350 million a year. However, that was refuted and was regarded as a classical crock of gold attitude on the part of those who kept saying that there was 7 per cent of the GNP lost in the black economy and that the money could and should be got.  The attitude of the Department was &ldquo;no, forget about those things, that is none of your business, it is our business.  Instead let us concentrate on cutting the Health Vote; we will cut also the Social Welfare Vote and then the Environment Vote.  In fact we will cut the tripes out of all social expenditure.&rdquo;  That is the name of the game.  That is the name of running a finance economy.  They have no concern for taxation reform because basically that is a problem for the Revenue Commissioners. That kind of blinkered bias has dominated the Department of Finance. I regret to say that I think the only cure for that mentality is simply to suggest that those who make those kind of statements that I have just quoted should have a career break and live for three years on long-term unemployment assistance.  The most they will get on long term unemployment assistance for a husband and wife with two children is £90.40p.  After that they might came back as chastened public officials.  I say that because I can claim with some validity to be a Deputy who has protected and supported the public service over many years but I have grown increasingly hostile to the substantial elements who regard it as their role in regard to public expenditure to abolish child benefit, as if that was some sort of divine mission. They tried it again this year and they did not get away with it.  They proposed to abolish pay-related benefit and they did <Col N="679" /> not get away with it.  This year they proposed to abolish fuel vouchers but they did not get away with it.  Like last year and the year before they proposed to abolish three months unemployment benefit and they did not get away with it. At least that much of social expenditure is retained.  I reject this kind of perverse policy from whatever source, be it public, private or political.</P>
    <P>Another reason why the Labour Party are opposed to these Estimates is that there is no increased allocation towards job creation.  I was associated with the bringing in of the social employment scheme in the mid-eighties.  This Estimate provision has been cut from £39.1 million for 1988 to £38.6 million for 1989. To cut the social employment scheme in a year in which 32,000 people or 650 people a week, predominantly young people, have emigrated and in a year in which we still have 242,000 unemployed, is scandalous.  From the IDA, from the Minister and from almost every news bulletin we have an unending public relations hype about the 20,000 new jobs. This must be put into some kind of rational perspective.  In 1986 the number of new jobs in manufacturing was 17,662. This year we are going to have 20,000 new jobs which is an increase of 2,300 jobs over 1986, yet the great claim is that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is solely responsible for the 20,000 jobs.  If that is so, why did we have 17,600 new jobs in 1986 and 16,500 new jobs in 1985. The wonderful explosion of employment from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a mirage.  I do not cavil at the production of new jobs but if we put the figures in their proper framework the number of new jobs for the past nine months up to the end of September was 14,500 and it will probably work out at about 20,000 at the end of the year.  That is to be welcomed but the number of redundancies notified to the Department of Labour in the same nine-month period was 7,738.  One cannot talk about job creation if one is not prepared to take into account redundancies against employment creation in a sector.  The <Col N="680" /> 7,738 redundancies in the manufacturing sector are statutorily notifiable redundancies where people have been in employment for not less than 12 months. As we know there is a substantial loss of employment in six to nine months and in less than 12 months, so that the actual total of redundancies may well be much higher.  There is not real evidence that the Government are tackling the unemployment crisis.  To tackle the unemployment crisis we need far more radical investment and taxation policies than are evident at present.  We have the opportunity this evening to go into that area which is imperative in terms of understanding the situation.</P>
    <P>Throughout the last general election campaign this Government plastered the countryside with posters relating to law and order.  I forget the exact words now but I am sure Deputy Noonan as a former Minister for Justice will remember the slogan in relation to law and order.</P>

      <P>What has happened now?  In my constituency there has been a rapid increase in non-detected crime because there are now unfilled vacancies of some 20 superintendents as a result of the embargo.  There are 30 inspector vacancies, 230 sergeant vacancies and effectively there are 280 middle management positions in the Garda unfilled and blocked by the Department of Finance. The Department of Justice do not have the money and the Minister for Justice is a bit paralysed in getting the money although that is his basic job in Government &mdash; to fight his corner for security money.  Is it any wonder that there is demoralisation in every major Garda station? That is the reality.  It puts those preelection posters in stark relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The Labour Party in statement after statement over the last 18 months warned of the dangers inherent in running down the public health services.  It is not hysteria to say now that there is a major crisis in those services.  There has been a 3 per cent increase in the Book of Estimates and that looks well but if one examines closely the G1 and G2 votes with which I am more than familiar, and if one takes the 2½ per cent public pay increase and add to that increments in the health sector where there are still 58,000 people employed, 50,000 of whom are permanent employees, and if one takes the special pay awards of 1986 which have to be in the vote excluding any other awards, these pay increases alone amount to £45 million but the increase in the vote is £26.5 million for 1989.  Also, it looks as though, of the £25 million overall allocation, a certain amount of that in relation to early retirement redundancies will be apportioned to health as a cost of health.  Therefore the 3 per cent increase on the vote is no more than marking a general crisis.  Contrary to the superficial analysis to date of this Estimate, the dire situation will continue in the health services in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The budgets of the health agencies are also cut by another £10 million on balances &mdash; that is moneys which are due from 1987 and 1988 which are paid in 1989.  That puts further major strains on the overdraft accommodation where it is very minimal now in the health agencies and in the carry-over cost of their bills for 1989.  To compound this unholy mess this Government have paid £13½ million in lump sum payments to 1,500 health board and health agency workers.  On top of that, these workers will get pensions for life.  I know of nurses in rural Ireland in their mid forties who have bought calves for their farms with their redundancy money.  They have spent their redundancy money on buying sheep for their farms and so on.  The average redundancy money for a health worker is £9,000 tax free.</P>
    <P>The Government have paid out £3.5 million to 1,500 such persons who opted for the lump sum.  A total of 4,500 have <Col N="682" /> gone but they were temporary staff who were dumped on the side of the road and got nothing.  Quite a number of nurses, male and female, who are in receipt of public service pensions have gone to work in England.  Their Irish pensions are posted to them every month by the health boards and the voluntary hospitals. Others have gone to Australia and the United States.  What are the Government doing?  They have decided to make permanent another 820 of the 7,500 temporary staff and to put them on the pension payroll in due course.  This is ludicrous management of the Health Vote and I boggle at the logic of it.  In a complete about turn, 820 people from the core of temporary, staff are to be elevated into permanent positions which were formerly held by those among the 1,500 who received lump sums and the celebrated early retirement pensions.  It does not even read in terms of a five-year or ten-year cost benefit in regard to public service pay.</P>
    <P>There is a clamour that all would be well in terms of the Health Vote if we could only cut down on administration. It sounds well.  The reality is that administration in any health board amounts to about 2.5 per cent or 2.6 per cent of total costs.  The figure is 3 per cent at the outside.  In the Eastern Health Board it is only 2.4 per cent of the total budget. If we were to close down all the health boards we would be lucky to save £750,000.  Yet this is the kind of nonsense that is being spoken about at the moment. Somebody has to issue the medical cards in a health board area; somebody has to answer the telephone in a hospital, to look after medical records and to pay the staff.  Somebody must be in the office of the chief executive officer when he is attending a meeting in the Department of Health.  If we were to close down the whole administrative sector, we would not save one-tenth of the budget of St. Vincent's Hospital, which costs £21 million per annum to run.  If the administrative staff of that hospital were to be got rid of it would not save £100,000. The reality is that we have to administer community care and family health care <Col N="683" /> programmes.  They are administered at local level and local staff are essential. Somebody must be available to open a health centre in the morning and to close. it in the evening, while somebody must be available to answer the telephone. That is called administration.</P>
    <P>There is a great hosanna about setting up a bord sláinte which would save millions and make us all happy.  It is a very clever ploy but it is flawed.  I put forward many proposals to the Government to set up a bord sláinte.  I was totally in favour of the development of the system from the centre of rationality because I saw that the health boards were being totally politicised and dominated by professional interests and I wanted to stop that political nonsense.  It was not because I expected to save millions of pounds.  I knew the system would still have to be administered.  There has been a substantial reduction in the numbers employed by health boards by virtue of the embargo and the general tightening of their budgets in recent years.  Every health administrator will see through what I regard as a fairly threadbare ploy to avoid opposition to the Vote in relation to administrative savings.  It is bad enough that the politicians are making this ploy but the consultants are at it now.  Last weekend they said the health services would be great if there was not wasteful administration.  They are at it again.</P>
    <P>I have argued time and again that our hospitals and community care programmes need very well paid senior professional managers in charge of the major budget centres.  It is ludicrous to have somebody earning £24,000 or £25,000 a year looking after a budget of £36 million, which is the cost of running Beaumont Hospital in a year.  St. James's Hospital, a budget centre of excellence which runs on £30 million a year, is managed by somebody who is paid £23,000 or £26,000 a year.  I have asked time and again that these people should be paid at least the same as a senior consultant in such a hospital, that is a minimum of £34,000 so that they would have common standing, <Col N="684" /> common authority and the capacity to control the system at the point of entry. That was rejected by the Department of Finance and by the then Department of the Public Service.  In terms of public service pay, there is rigidity, inflexibility and a reluctance to cope with anything. Any Minister who proposes to pay somebody £40,000 per year to run a major budget is looked upon as if he had two heads.  They think he wants to employ the Taoiseach's payroll.  It is unacceptable that in many areas of our approach to the Estimates we have become ossified and incapable of appreciating that budgets must be administered in the most effective possible way.</P>
    <P>As a subscriber to the VHI who has benefited substantially in recent months, I am concerned about its future.  Last year VHI premiums increased by an average of 9 per cent, three times the rate of inflation.  This year, at a time of 2 per cent inflation, VHI rates are due to increase by a minimum of 6 per cent in December.  They are looking for 8 per cent and they may get 6 per cent from the Minister, who is terrified at the situation. They are seeking an increase of 15 per cent for plans D and E; they might get 10 per cent in the heel of the hunt.  We had a 9 per cent increase early this year and we are to have another major increase, at a time when inflation is running at 2 per cent.  The VHI made a net loss of £10 million up to February 1988. I predicted that the Fianna Fáil changes in our hospital system since 1987 would gravely affect the future of the VHI and unfortunately my observations are coming ominously true.  The reason is that as soon as I left the Department of Health there were some new appointments to the board of VHI, which was well known, and the VHI caved in to the exclusive demands of the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Private Clinic, to the extent that there is a massive cross-subsidisation from people like me who are on Plan B to those on Plans D and E and more directly to the hospitals. Money was screwed out of the VHI and we are all being screwed in the process. <Col N="685" /> Fianna Fáil are responsible for what happened in that regard.</P>
    <P>If that was not bad enough, we had the further development of the two-tier system &mdash; over 500 new and converted private and semi-private beds have flourished. This has placed an intolerable strain on the VHI and they have accelerated the two-tier hospital system.  In simple terms, the stark reality now is that the ordinary, non-VHI patient may wait for six to 12 months for a routine appointment. I met recently a woman who had received a letter from the Eye and Ear Hospital saying that further to her letter of 1975, Mr. Maguire would now be available to meet her and to discuss her operation. I am quite serious.  The woman has reared her family since then.  The same hospital sent out another letter to an individual telling her to report for her operation; the husband wrote back saying that the lady was dead.  She did not die from a need for that operation although she had been waiting three years &mdash; she had died of natural causes.  These are examples of the present chaos in the health services.  We have elective operations taking up to two years if one is not in the VHI.  Conventional procedures for medical card holders and non-VHI patients for hip replacements, hernias, cataracts and ordinary gynaecological procedures have waiting lists at most public hospitals of from two to three years.  The Mater Hospital in their latest report mentioned public waiting lists in all departments of 3,400 people.</P>
    <P>Many of us have seen the distress and chaos in the casualty departments of most of our public hospitals which even the introduction of a £10 charge has not resolved, where people want a service and have to wait for hours on end.  I shall not refer to ENT procedures because the waiting list in that regard is horrendous and basic services such as physiotherapy and public dental care have lists which are a rather sad and sick joke.  That is what we have done to the health services in 1987-88.  It has been done with the support of the majority of the parties in this House.  I do not in any way deny that when I was Minister for Health we had <Col N="686" /> waiting lists &mdash; we had waiting lists in health boards and in public hospitals &mdash; but at least I can say that the bulk of the waiting lists were manageable.  In many areas like cardiace surgery or orthopaedics we substantially reduced the waiting lists. That improvement has disappeared.  It was achieved in 1982 to 1987 despite the virulent and destructive opposition of the Fianna Fáil Party at almost every level throughout the country, particularly in the health boards.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Health Estimate, the Irish nursing profession is at present in a shambles.  A recent pilot study of the Irish Matrons' Association, which covered eight medical wards and three teaching hospitals, showed that these wards had unsafe coverage at night.  The Irish Matrons' Association are not known for their virulent public militancy; I think we can say that much.  Their report is an indictment of the extent to which an effective nursing mix on wards has declined.  One of the reasons is that morale has also rocketed downwards because the pay of 1,300 first year students was cut from £132 per week in January 1987 to £58 last January.  That is exploitation of the young people who work on shift rotas, doing trojan work in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>Our mentally handicapped children and young adults have had their allocation of incontinence pads halved, which should not happen.  I know of parents of mentally handicapped children who used to have an occasional break while their son or daughter was taken into residential care during a family crisis or to give those parents a holiday.  That basic facility has been withdrawn at residential and at health board level.  It is not appreciated by most male politicians &mdash; and the Department of Finance is mostly male dominated also and Government is totally male dominated, for effective purposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Women queue in children's hospitals for hours.  They are in the front line with regard to cuts in the services.  We in the Labour Party have circulated on the Order Paper our amendment to the Government motion. I do not propose to read it now.  I move the amendment on my own behalf, on behalf of the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, and all my colleagues in that party.  We shall be voting, accordingly, on Thursday next at 5 p.m. against the Estimates as presented here by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  notes with grave concern that the Estimates for 1989 fail to address the many inequalities in our society, including the increasing incidence of poverty, as outlined in the recent ESRI study commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency;</P>
      <P>(ii)  believes that these Estimates will lead to increased unemployment and emigration, particularly through the reductions in the summary Public Capital Programme and the Rates Support Grant;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  notes that the Estimates fail <Col N="688" /> to address the continuing and growing crisis in our seriously under-funded health service, and will lead to a further deterioration in that service, with consequent hardship throughout the community;</P>
    <P>(iv)  believes that the Estimates fail to take account also of the major reduction in access to education caused by the Estimates of 1987 and 1988, and will give rise to further inequality in that area through, for example, the cuts in school transport;</P>
    <P>(v)  believes that the Estimates will give rise to major cutbacks in essential local authority services, including the fire service;</P>
    <P>(vi)  believes that continuing cutbacks in housing allocations, at a time when there are more than 17,000 families on approved housing waiting lists, will lead inevitably to a major housing crisis, and is socially irresponsible;</P>
    <P>(vii)  believes that the further reductions in bilateral aid under the International Co-operation Estimate are totally unjustified;</P>
    <P>(viii)  notes that there is no provision in the Estimates to enable the continuing embargo on the filling of posts in the security forces (Garda, Army and Navy) which is causing a crisis of morale in those forces, to be ended, and that the provision for army pay is grossly inadequate in view of the Government's commitment to undertake a special review of pay in this area;</P>
    <P>(ix)  believes that the Government's failure to honour commitments to build regional technical colleges and hospitals in communities where the case for these facilities has been long-established is unacceptable;</P>
    <P>(x)  resolves therefore that these Estimates will deflate the economy further, and will increase the level of <Col N="689" /> injustice in our society.  Accordingly, Dáil Éireann rejects these Estimates and declares that it has no confidence in the Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to horticulture, which is a major part of my responsibility in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I am pleased to be able to say that the provision in the Estimate for An Bord Glas has been increased by almost 50 per cent over the 1988 figure. As Deputies will be aware, An Bord Glas was set up by the Government on an interim basis pending the making of the necessary arrangements to set up a permenant board.  Pending the enactment of the legislation to amalgamate ACOT and AFT into Teagasc, it was not possible to complete arrangements for the future structure of An Bord Glas.  The arrangements are well advanced and it is hoped to make an announcement shortly.</P>
      <P>The interim board has not, however, been idle since it was set up.  Over the past number of months it has been examining in detail reports from commodity teams which have examined seven sectors of the horticultural industry in detail.  The recommendations from these teams numbered well over 250 involving, in many cases, substantial Exchequer expenditure. To refine the recommendations down to realistic levels has taken a considerable length of time.  This work is now almost completed and the board is putting the finishing touches to a development plan which will in general terms aim at regaining a share for home producers and increasing exports by a combined level of £70 million worth and in the process laying the basis for the creation of up to 2,000 jobs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On a point of order, can the Minister's speech be circulated in the usual fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be circulated shortly. I am looking forward with great interest to the publication of this development <Col N="690" /> plan and to working in close co-operation with An Bord Glas in implementing it and achieving its targets.</P>
      <P>One of the areas which has caused me most concern since taking office has been the potato sector.  There is no European Community market regulation for potatoes.  Efforts over the years to make such a regulation have not been successful. Potato producers more than any other sector are very subject to market fluctuations as we saw in the early part of this year.  Apart from the lack of market regulations we in Ireland have a number of weaknesses in the sector.  Inadequate storage facilities and badly organised marketing are the most serious.</P>
      <P>In order to address these problems An Bord Glas has offered to part fund the employment of a market co-ordinator by the industry with a view to achieving an orderly marketing structure and better co-ordination of production and market outlets.  We have also been in negotiation with th EC to extend the officially recognised producer group scheme to the potato sector and I am confident that something positive will emerge here at an early date.</P>
      <P>We have also made an approach for increased FEOGA grant aid for the provision of storage for potatoes.  An Bord Glas has already identified the need for an additional 80,000 tonnes of storage which would cover national requirements during the critical period of three-four months just before the new crop becomes available and indeed, at the time of the year where the highest level of imports apply.</P>
      <P>There is no reason that we should not be able at all times to produce in this country our full national requirements of good quality potatoes.  The quality of this product has, I believe, improved in recent times but there is still room for improvement in that respect and great room for improvement in market organisation. The leaders among the potato producers are fully aware of what is needed but there are many who still need convincing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from its work on the preparation of the five year development plan, Bord Glas has also been active in a variety of <Col N="691" /> other areas.  It has been involved in a potato chip promotion campaign and in a promotion campaign on ware potatoes. It has commissioned the making of a video on potato production aimed at educating producers in the proper handling and storage of potatoes and stressing the importance of marketing by providing for the consumers' requirements.</P>
    <P>The board has also been involved in promotion campaigns for tomatoes and in promoting the growing of more fruit and vegetables for the processing industry. As regards the glasshouse sector the availability of natural gas should give a boost to increased heated crop production. An Bord Glas and Teagasc have been liaising closely with Bord Gáis to ensure that the maximum possible number of growers will benefit from the availability of natural gas to the horticultural industry in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The 1988 tomato season has been an encouraging one for producers, the more enterprising of whom now feel that the industry may have turned the corner after a number of years which were made very difficult by high energy costs and foreign competition.  It is estimated that producers of early tomatoes in 1988 improved their returns by 10 per cent over 1987.</P>
    <P>We are importing quantities of onions which could be produced at home.  An Bord Glas has arranged for demonstration onion crops to be grown in Louth, Meath, Kerry and Kilkenny.  The intention is that growers will be able to see onion production with the latest techniques at the various stages from propagation to preparation for market.  It is hoped that the demonstrations will encourage efficiency and stimulate production. One existing large grower in County Meath is, as a result of these demonstration plots, looking into the possibility of organising a group which would grow an additional 60 to 100 acres next year.  A major co-op has submitted proposals to grow and handle 3,000 tonnes within a three year period.</P>
    <P>The apple sector has also been a cause <Col N="692" /> of concern.  Imports of apples in 1987 amounted to approximately 50,000 tonnes valued at almost £20 million. Home production was to the value of only about £4 million.  An Bord Glas has been doing everything it can to promote the development of this sector.  One of the major wholesalers had discussions with the board during the past year and has recently planted 40 acres of dessert apples.  This is an encouraging development in the light of static acreages and rising imports in the past few years.  The same wholesaler has plans for an additional 160 acres and a further 30 to 40 acres are planned by an existing producer group.  These developments should help to supplant imported apples.</P>
    <P>Another significant area not always thought of in connection with horticulture is the business of producing nursery stock.  It is well known how suitable this country is because of our climate for the production of trees and this same advantage applies, of course, to nursery stock.  It is the sector in which An Bord Glas has taken a very definite interest and was the subject of a study by one of the board's commodity groups.  The sector is making good progress and is building up a valuable export trade. There is, of course, as in other sectors of horticulture, room for improvement and development.  This will be covered in the board's development plan which I referred to already.</P>
    <P>Bord Glas is also engaged in sponsoring a course run by Teagasc aimed at assisting young farmers to start off their own business or to modify existing businesses to cater for changes in markets by providing expertise in all aspects of business development.  The emphasis in the course will be on practical training in developing a commercial business.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry has been a major success story over the past eight years with an estimated farm gate value of over £21 million in 1987 and exports worth over £15 million.  On the basis of proposals currently with the IDA and of others which we know are in the pipeline, the industry will double over the next four to five years.  This will result in <Col N="693" /> increases in employment of over 600 full time and 2,500 part time employees, thereby making a significant contribution to the wellbeing of many of the disadvantaged areas of the country.  All of the State agencies have combined to produce a clear blueprint for the development of the sector.  My own Department will be making a major contribution of more than £3 million to mushroom growers during the period I mentioned in grants under the farm improvement programme. Up to 300 potential new growers will have attended a 60 hour training course organised by Teagasc this year.</P>
    <P>The research sector of Teagasc is, I am glad to report, receiving increasing financial support from the industry.  That is very heartening.  The basis of the success of the mushroom industry has been the production of a top quality product which is being marketed professionally by a limited number of companies.  These companies have displayed total commitment to ensuring that mushrooms of high quality, but reasonably priced, are continuously available on the UK multiple market.  More and more the Irish product is going direct into the super-markets and bypassing the wholesalers. The success of the mushroom industry holds out many lessons for many other agricultural and horticultural areas.  For the success of this industry much credit must go to the work carried out at the Teagasc Research Centre in Kinsealy in the development of mushroom growing using the bag system.  Great credit is also due to the producers who took up this new system and used it magnificently. The leaders in this industry set an example for us all.  The success spells out the importance of the individual growers but also the essential need for growers to be closely organised in groups under a group management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend criminal law and procedure and to provide for genetic fingerprinting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the Garda Síochána should be able to avail of all <Col N="695" /> modern scientific techniques in criminal investigations.  It is essential that the Garda not only have the necessary back-up facilities but that, in addition, our criminal law reflects and keeps pace with modern scientific developments.  Genetic fingerprinting is about to revolutionise the criminal investigative process.  It is currently being utilised in some states in the United States and in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  At present, the Garda lack both the forensic facilities to use this technique and the necessary enabling legislation to apply it.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in the context of a Private Members' Bill to provide for public expenditure.  Fine Gael believe however, that it is essential that the necessary funding be provided by Government to establish as a matter of urgency the required forensic laboratory facilities for the Garda to enable them to make use of genetic fingerprinting in the fight against crime.  Accordingly, we call upon the Government to do so.</P>
    <P>It is possible by way of a Private Members' Bill to provide the statutory mechanisms for the use of this technique in crime detection and the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Genetic Fingerprinting) Bill, 1988, which I moved provides the statutory framework necessary.  It is the hope of Fine Gael that we will have the support of all sides in this House for a First Reading of this Bill so that it may be circulated and its detailed provisions debated on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that genetic fingerprinting is the single greatest break-through in the fight against crime since fingerprints themselves were discovered in 1901.  Samples of tissue such as blood, skin, hair or semen left at the scene of a crime can be analysed so as to identify the perpetrator of a crime.  The technique can result in indisputably accurate evidence of identity being obtained at the scene of a crime in many circumstances in which the identity of the person who committed the crime would otherwise remain unknown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Genetic fingerprinting can make a unique contribution throughout the whole criminal justice area and, in particular, in the investigation of serious and horrific offences such as murder, rape and physical and sexual assault.  It can also play a crucial role in the fight against subversive crime.  It is of equal importance that the technique can also be used to ensure that an innocent person is not wrongly accused or convicted of a crime he did not commit.</P>
    <P>In the brief time that I am allowed this evening it is not possible to detail all of the cases in which this technique has been successfully used to date.  Two examples of its use can be given to illustrate its effectiveness.  In January 1988 one Colin Pitchfork was convicted for murder by the English courts.  In 1983 he had raped and murdered a teenage girl and another teenage girl was raped and murdered by him in 1986.  The wrong person was initially arrested by the English police for these offences and if the new scientific technique of genetic fingerprinting had not been utilised that person could have been wrongly convicted and Pitchfork would have been left at large to repeat these horrific crimes.  In Northern Ireland in June 1988 a 21-year-old man was jailed for life for murder in Belfast having sexually assaulted and murdered his neighbour. Without the use of genetic fingerprinting his identity would not have been ascertained.</P>
    <P>In June last I attempted to move this Bill for a first reading but it was opposed by the Minister.  It is extraordinary that since that time the Minister has been silent as to his reasons for opposing a First Reading and for seeking to prevent circulation of the Bill.  In the intervening period legislation has been enacted to provide the use of genetic fingerprinting by the RUC.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister opposing publication of the Fine Gael Bill, no comment has been made by him of any nature whatsoever on the introduction of genetic fingerprinting in Northern Ireland or on the statutory measures relating to its use. I want to emphasise that the Bill prepared by Fine Gael is substantially different <Col N="697" /> from the approach to be taken by the RUC under the statutory provisions relating to genetic fingerprinting in Northern Ireland.  In particular, I want to emphasise that essential protections for civil liberties contained in our Bill appear absent in Northern Ireland's legislation.</P>
    <P>For example, the power conferred on officers in the RUC to take mouth swabs by the use of physical force from suspects would not be conferred on the Garda. This provision in the North has today been strongly and rightly criticised by the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights which acts as an adviser to the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and was criticised by me at the time of the publication of the relevant legislation that subsequently was enacted by the Westminister Parliament to apply to Northern Ireland.  In this context, it is curious that the Minister for Justice while opposing publication of the Fine Gael Bill last June has in the past four months remained totally silent on the Northern Ireland measure.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that in a democratic Parliament which cherishes its democratic traditions, the Government of the day should not be permitted to prevent the publication of proposed legislation so as to prevent its distribution and render impossible an informed discussion taking place of proposals contained in it.  A vote for this Bill this evening is not a vote to accept all of the Bill's provisions unamended.  I want to emphasise that Fine Gael wish to see enacted in this area the best possible legislation and we are willing to take on board any constructive amendments proposed to this Bill that would ensure its proper workings.  A vote for this Bill this evening is a vote to permit its circulation and to allow a detailed and informed discussion on its provisions to take place.  A vote against this Bill this evening is a vote in favour of censorship and a vote to curtail the ability of Members of this House to act as legislators.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are too frequently criticised by the general public for their failure to act as legislators.  The <Col N="698" /> majority of Members of this House should oppose any attempt made by Government to prevent the publication and circulation of a Private Members' Bill on an issue of public importance.  A vote in favour of this Bill is a vote that recognises that each and every one of us in this House is elected to act as a legislator and is a vote to uphold our democratic traditions.  A vote against this Bill at this stage is a vote to restrict and curtail the legislative role each and every Member of this House is entitled to play and to censor our ability to debate a major scientific advance in the area of crime detection.</P>

If circulated we will put forward a number of amendments to the Fine Gael Bill as proposed this evening.  The use of genetic fingerprinting is a very sensitive issue which could affect a person's right to privacy under the Constitution.

We will examine it and consult about it when it is published but we believe that it should be published and debated in this House.  If it has a role to play in providing additional evidential measures in the courts of justice that is to be welcomed, provided the safeguards which are necessary and appropriate to the rules of evidence are there.  It would be a new departure so far as the rules of evidence would be concerned and great care should be taken to ensure that this exercise would be in accordance with the rules of fair play as well as with the rules of the Constitution.  The House should agree to the publication of the Bill so that its provisions can be examined in detail on Second and Committee Stages.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the The Worker's Party I rise again to indicate our agreement in principle with the Bill as made available to the Leaders of the parties by Deputy Shatter in advance of our discussion this evening.  It is a great pity that the opportunity to incorporate the major advances of DNA fingerprinting was not availed of when offered to the Government in the course of the debate on the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, when the availability of this investigative technique was first brought to the attention of the Government by Members on this side of the House.  It was impressed on the Minister of the day to examine this issue carefully.  Later in the session it was a great surprise to us that the Government indicated their objection to the circulation and First Reading of the Bill.  As a party who are considerably dis-advantaged in the operation of the procedures of this House, a party without hope in terms of having many of their legislative proposals debated, at no stage would we seek to inhibit or avoid supporting the circulation of useful, progressive legislation, particularly when all that is being sought is an opportunity to read, circulate and discuss its important provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> It should be pointed out that this DNA fingerprinting constitutes a crucial development in police detection providing a 99 per cent accurate method of detection.  It is important as a civil liberty issue not only in so far as it is capable of detecting those who are guilty but, equally important, of excluding those who are innocent.  If properly developed and utilised it is a detection device which would obviate many major issues surrounding guilt or innocence so tortuously pursued in our criminal courts at present. Consequently, it constitutes an effective detection procedure, when properly employed, which would eliminate a huge amount of cost and delay in the implementation of the provisions of our criminal laws.</P>
    <P>However, it is not confined merely to that area.  The provisions of this Bill provide an opportunity to debate in principle the whole development of a scheme of DNA fingerprinting identification.  If properly developed here it would be a very useful device in civil issues, for example, in relation to those relating to the identity of paternity cases.  Its advantages are not confined merely to criminal investigation although the provisions of this Bill address that one aspect only.  It is worth making the point that it is in areas of crime against women particularly that this detection device would prove to be so useful.  As a Government who have indicated a certain degree of concern, both inside and outside this Chamber, about the protection of women, I must question whether they are serious in that respect.  Their refusal to allow even the circulation of this Bill would tend to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>One aspect dealt with by Deputy Shatter in moving the motion this evening was the suggestion that this Bill is different in principle from the issues now being debated in Northern Ireland and highlighted by Sir Oliver Napier on behalf of the Standing Committee on Human Rights there.</P>
    <P>Having said that my party would agree in principle with the provisions of the Bill, I have already indicated a certain lack of satisfaction with regard to the <Col N="701" /> manner in which the Bill was drafted, the manner in which it utilises the provisions of existing legislation.  For example, the element of consent is not dealt with in its provisions.  I understand that Deputy Shatter would be receptive to the suggestion &mdash; and we would put this case to him &mdash; that, in this area, it would be important to have a positive declaration specifying that consent was a pre-condition to the taking of a sample necessary to establish identify using the DNA fingerprinting process.  That is a matter that could be easily teased out.  It does not take from the fundamental point at issue here this evening, that of simple parliamentary democracy and the assurance of the effective operations of this House.  We are anxious to ensure that we can deal with useful legislation as frequently as possible. This is one Bill with which we should be dealing and my party support it.</P>
    <P>In passing I might say that it is remarkable that a Member of the Seanad told me in the corridors that the Seanad will not be meeting for the next two or three weeks because there is not one Bill to be found in any Government Department to be discussed by them while here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the Deputy's Bill as published earlier this year in a document describing what is referred to as genetic fingerprinting.  While I share the Deputy's concern that the Garda should have the most up-to-date technological advances in their efforts to apprehend the perpetrators of serious crime and while I have no problem with the aims of his Bill I must say that the form and terms of the Bill raise important difficulties for me.  In my view the Bill suffers from very serious defects.  Most importantly, it fails to deal with important issues such as whether <Col N="702" /> and to what extent consent should be required before a sample is taken and, in that event, what is to happen if consent is refused.  We are dealing with a measure which envisages the taking by the Garda of bodily samples such as blood, urine, semen, tissue, hair, swabs from bodily orifices or from the skin.  It will be obvious to anybody that the first question that must arise in considering such a proposal is whether, and if so, to what extent, the consent of the suspected person is required.  But the Bill makes no mention of this aspect and, on the face of it, the Bill would allow all such samples to be taken by force.  This is clearly an aspect that must be dealt with.  Deputies will be aware of the outcry in the North of Ireland against recent provisions allowing the police to take mouth swabs by force, a provision which, I note, was not acceptable in legislation in Great Britain.  There is also the question of who may take the samples, some of which would be of a very intimate and intrusive nature.  This again is not dealt with in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies will agree that these matters are much too important to be left to be dealt with in regulations, as proposed by the Deputy, and should be dealt with in the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>I am also advised that there is a number of technical drafting defects in the Bill which I need not go into now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is my view that, given the importance of the issue, it is preferable that the power to take samples for the purpose of genetic profiling and other forensic testing should be dealt with in a self-contained comprehensive Bill rather than &mdash; as proposed in the Deputy's Bill &mdash; by inserting new clauses into existing statutory provisions &mdash; the Criminal Law Act, 1976 and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which were not designed with this technique or with the type of body samples required for genetic profiling in mind.  For example, the samples &mdash; hair and skin swabs to detect explosives &mdash; that may be taken under the provisions of the 1976 and 1984 Acts are types of samples that people would agree could reasonably be taken without consent. Totally different considerations arise in <Col N="703" /> relation to the intimate samples envisaged in the Bill.  Therefore mere adaptation of the 1976 and 1984 Acts, as proposed in the Bill, is not the way to deal with the matter.  For this reason I believe the Bill is not one that could be usefully accepted on the basis that it could be amended by the Oireachtas.  In my view the Bill would require to be totally recast.</P>
    <P>As I shall explain, the Forensic Science Laboratory have been clearing the ground for the introduction of genetic testing and expect to be in a position to undertake testing by the middle of next year.  In addition, my Department have been preparing proposals for legislation to regulate the taking of samples for genetic and other testing.  That work is at an advanced stage.  I hope to bring forward a comprehensive Bill on the matter in a matter of weeks.  Of course it is my purpose that that legislation will be in place by the time the forensic laboratory are in a position to commence testing.</P>
    <P>As far back as last April arrangements were made for a scientist from our Forensic Science Laboratory to be trained in the genetic profiling technique.  This scientist will be qualified in the technique by the end of the year and another has commenced training.  I have made provision for the purchase of the additional equipment which will be required by the laboratory to carry out these tests. However a further matter which has yet to be resolved before the laboratory can start using the technique is the question of obtaining a licence from ICI who are the holders of the patent.  The laboratory are confident that they will be in a position to undertake genetic testing by about the middle of next year.  While speaking of the laboratory I should like to take this opportunity to commend the work which is being done by them.  While of relatively recent origin the laboratory have achieved a very high professional standing which is widely recognised.  I believe they are one of the first forensic science facilities outside of the United Kingdom to be in a position to shortly provide the test. I think I can safely include all sides of the <Col N="704" /> House in expressing appreciation of their valuable work.</P>
    <P>To summarise the position, the Deputy's Bill is not adequate to deal with the matter.  The necessary technical arrangements are being made to have the genetic profiling test available at the Forensic Science Laboratory as quickly as possible. My Department have also been preparing a Bill to give the Garda powers to take samples for genetic and other forensic tests and I would hope to be in a position to bring forward such legislation in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his Bill on the understanding that I will shortly be bringing forward a comprehensive measure.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Shatter insists on circulating and publishing a defective and inadequate Bill to deal with the problem, so be it.  My comprehensive Bill will be available in a matter of a few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, sharing the serious public concern about the quality of health care, calls for a fundamental reorganisation of the delivery of health services, in order to free resources which could then be used selectively to improve the quality of service and expand the provision for priority needs.  The following reforms are required:</P>
      <P>1.  The establishment of An Bord Sláinte, a semi-State body, to replace the Health Boards and streamline the management and delivery of health services.</P>
      <P>2.  Cost-cutting reforms in the areas of administration, the purchase of medical and non-medical supplies, certain consultants fees, the rationalisation of laboratory facilities, the greater use of computerisation and better property management.</P>
      <P>3.  A revision of the method of funding voluntary public hospitals by the introduction of clinical budgeting and separate ear-marked allocations for National Tertiary Services.</P>
      <P>4.  The appointment in each hospital of a general manager.</P>
      <P>5.  Hospital managers and An Bord Sláinte should be specifically charged with ensuring much greater co-ordination between hospitals and Community and Primary Care Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.  An Bord Sláinte should draw up and implement a National Hospital Plan for acute services, including the concentration of the most modern equipment and advanced skills in regional centres of excellence, where they can be fully utilised to the benefit of the community. These centres should be backed up by the complementary <Col N="706" /> provision of local hospitals with specified levels of care.</P>
    <P>7.  Improved medical management through greater development of General Practitioner Services including improved access to Hospital Diagnostic Services and Consultant opinion.</P>
    <P>8.  The re-examination of methods of payment for health care on the basis of giving incentives to preventative medicine and positive health activities.</P>
    <P>Throughout the summer we have all witnessed a litany of individual cases of hardship throughout the health service, children unable to gain admission to hospitals such as Temple Street, the growing waiting list for an ever-increasing number of hospital treatments including cardiac surgery, orthopaedic operations, ENT and ophthalmic care.  It has been estimated that, in total, some 23,000 people are awaiting different kinds of orthopaedic hospital treatment. Specifically, 8,000 people are on a three year waiting list for those requiring hip replacement.  In recent weeks there has been a recurring incidence in Crumlin Hospital and in St. James's Hospital of elective admissions with particularly serious consequences for vascular treatment.</P>
    <P>Wrongly, the public impression has been created that most of the difficulties in the health services at present arise solely in hospitals.  There are, however, huge gaps in other elements of the service. The elderly, especially those living alone in the community, find little or no comprehensive community care to deal with their specialised needs.  The dental service is in a shambles with the effective abolition of the 1979 <i>ad hoc</i> scheme, resulting in a situation where medical card holders can get virtually no treatment and, in a majority of health board areas, cannot even get a pair of dentures after teeth extractions.  They are advised that they would have to pay £200 or £300 privately for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> There has been an increase in discharges from psychiatric hospitals without proper, adequate community responses to meet their needs.  Public health nurses cannot operate effectively due to the curtailment of travelling expenses and lack of proper super-intendent posts to direct their work effectively. We have seen no sign of a positive commitment of resources to meet the obvious needs arising now and in future from the child care legislation to be completed in this session.  Each day columns of our newspapers are taken up with the individual cases concerned with specifically national specialities within the health services.  I refer to the oncology unit in Crumlin Hospital which I have visited and where I have seen at first hand the parents filling in for the lack of an adequate number of nursing staff.</P>
    <P>We must examine the Minister's response to this crisis.  To exacerbate the problem, the public are totally bemused by the indifference of the Minister for Health in responding to the crisis.  He is always one report or one committee away from making a decision to rectify the situation.  On the other hand, he is publicly attacking the consultants or the hospital authorities.  This resulted in a situation last month whereby one public voluntary hospital &mdash; the Meath &mdash; felt obliged to place advertisements in national newspapers to clarify their position. Is it any wonder, in the circumstances, that 1,800 nurses are applying to An Bord Altranais for certification to emigrate this year?  Is it any wonder that morale among the 56,000 people working in the health service has never been lower?  The Minister continually complains about having to grapple with the problem he inherited from the Coalition Government of cumulative health board deficits of £55 million.  These protestations from the Minister ring somewhat hollow when one reflects on his role as Fianna Fáil health spokesman in Opposition for four years.</P>
    <P>In 1985, Fianna Fáil, subsequent to the local elections, took control of most of <Col N="708" /> the health boards and obstructed the cost-cutting reforms of the last Minister for Health.  Moreover, one must question his role in the last election knowing the financial situation in relation to these deficits in the health service when his party erected hoardings right across the country proclaiming that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's clear view is that the current chaos in the health service could and should have been avoided in the context of financial savings if the prior necessary reorganisation and restructuring of the health service had taken place.  The Minister's policy, in so far as there had been any health policy, has been one of cash limitation to health boards and hospitals, coupled with an embargo on staff.  These two instruments bear no relationship to efficiency or health needs and that point above all needs to be emphasised.  The Minister's policy has been to close the hospitals or to tell them that they will have so much cash and no more.  He has said they will have to operate a crude embargo and that bears no relation to efficiency or to the needs of the patients.</P>
    <P>The fundamental flaw in the Minister's approach to the health service has been that he has failed to manage the massive resources of a complex service to improve the quality of care to the public.  There has been little or no planning with all allocations on a year to year, hand to mouth basis; all health workers are frustrated by the lack of direction and purpose by the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of decisions now taking place.  We must ask ourselves, in this limited debate, if more money is the answer.  Given some of the amendments put forward by some of the leftwing parties, I wish to spend some time analysing health figures.  Health expenditure in 1972-73 was £108 million according to the Dáil Estimates of that year.  It should be pointed out that the reason for it being 1972-73 was that we were not on a calendar year financing at that time.</P>
    <P>The health budget is now, approximately, £1,200 million, comparing like with like, with capital and current budgets. This represents, over a 15 year period, an elevenfold increase in State <Col N="709" /> health expenditure.  If we divide that amount of money into the number of households in the country, some 970,000 in total, we will find that the annual cost of the public health service is some £1,230 per household.  When we take into account that at least one-third &mdash; and it is nearer to 40 per cent &mdash; of the households are at a minimum level of income and have free medical care through medical cards, the minimum cost per household, for those who have to pay for the service, is something in the order of £3,400.  If the answer to the problems of the health service is based solely on spending more money and if we repeat the growth of expenditure on our health services over the next 15 years, between now and the year 2003, we are faced with some frightening cost consequences with those parties advocating throwing more money at the system.  Those parties need to study the matter.</P>
    <P>By the turn of the century the cost of the public health services run by the State would be of the order of £13 billion if we were to repeat the growth we have shown over the last 15 years.  If we allow for an increase in the total number of households to a million then the cost per household will at that time be £13,000.  If at that stage we still have one-third of the households eligible for free medical care through medical cards, then for the households who would have to pay for it the cost would be £34,000 per household at the turn of the century.  Those figures are simply unsustainable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the basic arithmetic of throwing more money into the health services in the short, medium and long terms leads to a situation which is simply unaffordable when one looks at the figures for an average industrial wage somewhere between £6,500 and £7,000 per annum at present applying.  Those who argue for unlimited resources to be spent on health have to address this issue. Moreover, I must ask whether our health service now has greater equality in terms of access than the health service of 15 years ago and whether our health service is more caring and efficient.  I fear there are the same if not greater levels of <Col N="710" /> inequity adhering to health care now.  I must also question whether health service employee numbers can be greatly increased when the current ratio is of the order of one health worker for every three people employed in manufacturing industry.  The simple fact is, and this is one of the few points on which I agree with the Minister, that there is no limit to the possible expenditure on the health services.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what are the solutions? Fine Gael believe a fundamental reorganisation of the delivery of health services can no longer be postponed and that such a reorganisation would free resources within the health services to meet the areas of priority needs and improve the quality of certain services.</P>
    <P>Let us first look at the area of potential savings.  Approximately 70 per cent of health expenditure is on pay and 30 per cent on the purchase of medical and non-medical supplies.  In the pay area I feel the level of expenditure on administration at 6 per cent is high by international standards.  I have seen figures for administration and the level spent on administration questioned.  I think those who are administrators tend to look at the figure for management expenditure and say it is a great deal less than 6 per cent.  I would say a 1 per cent figure for management expenditure at health board level would be acceptable, and it varies between one and three, I notice, between the Midland and other health boards, but overall administration is too high compared to the GMS.  Because Deputy Desmond said in the House if you sacked everyone in administration you would not save a small fraction of St. Vincent's Hospital budget.  I think he is not looking at what really is administration.  Many of long experience have told me that a whole new layer of bureaucracy was inserted when the health boards were created in 1972.</P>
    <P>However, I accept the need for a regional management structure.  We should set ourselves a target figure of 3 per cent expenditure on administration. To meet this we need to rationalise certain labour-intensive areas in the health <Col N="711" /> services that do not affect the quality of health care to the patient.  I am referring specifically to the need to rationalise the number of laboratories, principally in the Dublin area, within hospitals.  After 5 p.m. each hospital maintains a laboratory and is paying dearly for the on-call charges and after midnight charges.  There is no reason why these cannot be curtailed and rationalised.  Similarly, medical records represent high administrative costs.  Given international expenditure, there is no doubt that major savings can be obtained through computerisation in this area.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, I am not satisfied or convinced that many elements of the community welfare programme rightly belong in the health services.  I question seriously why there is a need in nearly every provincial town and &mdash; and I quote Enniscorthy where Deputy Browne and I come from &mdash; for an employment office, a social welfare office and a health centre, all issuing income maintenance.  Why is this necessary?  Why can people not go to one welfare office where their comprehensive income maintenance needs are found?  The payments of disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance and so on could be carried out very competently by reorganising the role of staff of the Department of Social Welfare incorporating some of the work of community welfare officers.  Similarly, much of the work of CWOs in terms of income assessment for medical cards and other eligibility should be rationalised in a more clear cut system of entitlement.  Also in the pay area I must confess to being deeply disturbed about certain information I have concerning the incomes of some &mdash; I emphasise only some &mdash; radiologists and pathologists.  While the arrangements of some of these machinerelated consultants <i>vis-à-vis</i> the common contract in 1981 are not uniform between hospitals, it is obvious that some pathologists specifically are earning an income in excess of £250,000 per annum each. More disturbing is that with the developments of technology much of this work <Col N="712" /> is not carried out by themselves but by assistants who approve of the various tests, which is the case in blood tests.  I am not speaking about biopsies or other specific good work being done by pathologists, but for the run of the mill, bread and butter work we are seeing the State and the VHI paying ten times the cost of a blood test.  In my view it is a scandal and should be stopped as soon as possible.  I call on the Minister urgently to investigate why the State is paying ten times over the cost of some of these services and immediately renegotiate to alter the present situation regarding the income of pathologists.</P>
    <P>In the area of purchases of supplies for the health services I have a number of serious concerns about needless costs because of a poor commercial approach to the health service as a major if not almost monopoly consumer.  The first area of concern is in the most expensive item of drugs.  Total expenditure on drugs has risen from some £85 million in 1983 to a present level of £120 million per annum.  Alarmingly, I note next week on 1 November there will be a price increase across the board on drugs somewhere between 6 and 15 per cent.  My concern about drug costs firstly relates to the fact that we are tied to a percentage increase over and above the price of drugs in the UK.  This is unbelievable when we now find that British drugs are among the dearest in Europe, when we should be allied to prices in France, Belgium and Italy.  This alone would represent a major saving.</P>
    <P>My second area of concern relates to the cost of drugs to hospitals.  In this area hospitals do not benefit from the 5 per cent rebate paid back by drug companies to the GMS, and the 104 per cent weighted average price over and above UK prices does not apply to the cost of hospital drugs.  Given the level of bulk purchases in hospitals this is simply inexplicable.</P>
    <P>The other area of drug saving lies in the prescription and greater use of generic drugs.  I fear there may be over-promotion by the chemical companies to <Col N="713" /> general practitioners with various inducements from free samples to post-graduate training to other areas to prescribe freely different and more expensive drugs.  I understand chemical companies in this country have some 300 people selling their wares to GPs in this regard.  There is conclusive evidence to show that generic drugs within their range are simply cheaper because of the lesser research and development costs, there being no patent involved, with no inferior quality to the patient.  I am not satisfied with the present details of the revised GMS contract for general practitioners in this regard in terms of the obligation to use a formulary of generic drugs where possible, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;obligation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In overall terms in the drug area I do not accept the argument that the chemical industry in Ireland would be excessively adversely affected by a further renegotiation of the present FICI-Department of Health agreement in view of the fact that only 5 per cent of drugs purchased by the Department of Health are made in Ireland.  Moreover, I believe the industry representatives I have met are only too well aware of the current market forces imposing difficulties in the areas of public expenditure and health care.</P>
    <P>In the area of medical equipment I am not satisfied with the present purchasing arrangements.  Greater utilisation of technical as opposed to medical expertise is required first.  This seems to be a major flaw in current purchasing in so far as we have no equivalent to the British Institute of Technicians in this field.  Secondly, a small purchasing unit could negotiate directly with British manufacturers and elsewhere supplies of medical equipment at much reduced prices.  I note with interest the current report being commissioned by the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts on the cost of catering in the health services.  This is a very large budgetary item under our hospital programme. I note the interim conclusions of this report which point to areas of major saving through rationalisation of the number of kitchens and tightening up <Col N="714" /> on food wastage and over-production.  I await the final report with interest and would direct the Minister to follow up on it immediately once it is published.</P>
    <P>I turn now to reorganisation as opposed to direct savings in the health services.  The savings I have referred to so far would, in my view, amount to something in the region of £30 million. However, the area of huge cost control lies in the way we organise our diagnosis and treatment of patients.  There is a great deal of documentary evidence not only in such reports as Dale Tussing and others but an endless supply of information in relation to the NHS in Britain. It is obvious from these data that a clear direction of health policy can reorientate the health services.  I am referring initially to preventative medicine.  A simple example that would cost nothing would be a ruthless get tough policy on the wearing of seat belts, an area in which we only have a 50 per cent observance at present.  All that is required in this regard is a change in public attitudes.  Proper observance of this law would bring about a major saving in certain health costs.  I note that in Sweden for example, the concept of all dental decay being preventable is actually applying because of the steps that have been taken to improve oral health and which have resulted in the major rationalisation of dental schools there.</P>
    <P>One out of every two people in this country die from heart disease.  We have no overall preventative policy in terms of regular compulsory check-ups for blood pressure and cholesterol levels.  In fact our screening level for early diagnosis and treatment for umpteen different forms of sickness is either non-existent or pathetic.  At a time when all the statistics show that early action is cheaper and better for the patient we are not taking such action.  Smoking and other substance abuse is the subject of a clear Irish double think and yet it imposes massive cost burdens on the Irish health service. It must be acknowledged that in the medium to long term these are the areas that must be the ones of priority policy <Col N="715" /> development as the most cost effective response to the current dilemma.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the biggest item of expenditure in the health service, our hospitals, which account for in 1988 terms, £715 million, something like 53 per cent of the budget.  The Minister has stated publicly that he is not satisfied with the level of management in some of the hospitals, particularly public voluntary hospitals.  What has he done to rectify this?  In this motion Fine Gael are calling for a national hospital plan to set out, in an orderly way what regional facilities, including diagnostics and treatments should be made available and on what catchment area general practitioners should be confined to in observing these regional specialities.  I am concerned that a GP, for some routine surgical treatments, can refer their patients, privately or publicly, to the most expensive teaching hospital in Dublin &mdash; the Minister referred recently to the cost of these teaching hospitals in terms of high quotas of junior doctors and so on &mdash; when the same operation could be done at a quarter of the cost in their local general hospital.  We must impose catchment areas in this regard if we are to be cost effective.  This would be followed by, in this national plan, local hospitals which would provide specified levels of care. These could have GP access, proper accident and emergency facilities, as well as dealing with sudden conditions such as heart attacks and car accidents.  I cannot accept that the Minister has been successful in this area.  Clearly there is no plan at present as can be seen from the fiasco in his own constituency of the major provision, at a cost of some £26 million, of Cavan hospital.  Not to be outdone this present Minister lobbied the last Government to make his high tech in terms of European standards hospital a 336 bed facility.  It is shameful to see such a monument to the taxpayers' commitment lying idle without one patient in it and costing, annually, over £.5 million to heat and maintain.  We cannot afford this type of self indulgence when there <Col N="716" /> are such pressures in other areas of the health service.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael are calling for the appointment of a hospital manager in all hospitals.  We believe the present structure, especially in public voluntary hospitals, is unclear, inefficient and ineffective. We have a management board structure which is invariably part-time in its well meaning approach, a secretary manager, perhaps of limited managerial qualifications, a matron in charge of one of the most vital parts of management, nursing and, most important of all, the gatekeepers within the context of hospitals, of cost and demand, the consultants. It is debatable as to who is actually running a lot of our hospitals.  We envisage the position of a general manager having a clear responsibility to patient standards care in hospitals with undeniable, clear authority to manage, including greater discipline over consultants' arrangements.  I am advised that some of the problems in St. James's Hospital recently could have been avoided if this clear managerial structure had been defined and put in place.</P>
    <P>My greatest concern, however, in relation to hospitals lies in the Government's financial approach to the way allocations are made.  Some hospitals get their allocations through health boards and others directly through the Department. When one studies the method of allocation to date one sees that it is based on some <i>ad hoc</i> traditional method depending on the overall availability of resources.  It has no regard for the number of patients treated.  In fact the level of information in hospitals in this regard is very scant.  It also has no regard for those hospitals that, in the early eighties, did impose greater savings and efficiencies only to find themselves further penalised for so doing as their subsequent year's allocation was based on the outturn of the previous year.  This resulted in a situation where inefficient hospitals that ran over budget were effectively condoned in the way money was allocated to them in the following year. To exacerbate matters it did not help when the Minister, recently in the <Col N="717" /> Seanad, made public comparisons between hospitals as to their bed numbers and their allocations without any regard to their out-patient facilities, activities and expenditure.  The Minister knows full well that the comparisons he made in the Seanad <i>vis-à-vis</i> Temple Street Hospital were not fair.</P>
    <P>The only way to ensure cost effective hospital services is to put the whole focus on the patients thereby making finance available on the basis of the number of patients treated, the public health requirements for the given catchment area and, most important, standard costings based on comparisons between hospitals for individual types of treatment. In other international experience of trying to grapple with the spiralling costs of health care they have found that unless clinical budgeting and diagnostically related groups are introduced to bring about some level of uniform costings of treatment they will find it impossible to make savings without the type of chaos we have seen.  At present some hospitals are being very unfairly treated resulting in massive waiting lists relative to the applications to other hospitals.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past, in relation to hospitals the debate is one of whether we should have statutory hospitals versus voluntary hospitals.  I believe only two types of hospitals exit, those that are efficient and those that are inefficient, and we should progress the development and financial allocations of these hospitals on the basis of incentives for those that become efficient.  Included in this would be a clear earmarking of specific allocations for national tertiary services and I would make a specific appeal to the Minister tonight, as these allocations are currently taking place, to do so in the context of the cancer unit at Crumlin Hospital and the excellent work being done there.  It is not right that Crumlin Hospital should be allocated a global figure of £12.25 million and that it be left solely up to the management board of that hospital as to what national tertiary services should get.  I would single out the oncology unit and the cardiac unit for a specific allocations so that we could <Col N="718" /> relate money to a national service and a national need.</P>
    <P>Once hospital allocations are made on the basis of proper incentives and sound economics coupled with professional, well remunerated, trained management we can then deal perhaps with savings in the hospital budget.  To go about it in an unplanned <i>ad hoc,</i> across-the-board manner, without such reorganisation can only lead to the present level of chaos.</P>
    <P>This confirms Fine Gael's basic thinking in relation to the current health crisis, that the primary issues are of reorganisation and management rather than simply spending more money.</P>
    <P>The most cost effective and cheapest form of treatment is self medication.  We should look at the area of limited deregulation to allow pharmacists the discretion of using their qualifications to allow the public access to medicines without reference to a prescription for such minor aliments as sore throats and headaches for which is it not necessary to go to a doctor.  I believe that virtually all the medical profession would support such a limited move and thereby reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The second area of cheaper medical management obviously involves the maximum level of care at the primary level, that is, through the general practitioner. A far greater role can be played by general practice here.  We need to develop general practitioner surgery facilities so that as much diagnostic work as possible can be done in the community. I support the principle of a capitation payment to GPs under the GMS and would specifically call on the Minister to ensure that the £3 million allocated annually for specialised work be targeted in the area of diagnostics to ensure developments at general practitioner level in the realm of diagnostics.  I am specifically referring to ECG cardiographs which can be done at one fifth of the cost in a GP surgery, and urine and blood tests which can be done more cheaply outside the hospital environment. This whole area of the GMS contract is somewhat too nebulous at the moment.  I am aware that there is a working <Col N="719" /> party examining this at present but in terms of value for money there is a clear need for ministerial direction.  Moreover, I am very concerned about the relationship between consultants and GPs.  I immediately call for the Department of Health to issue a circular to all hospitals to make available the maximum amount of diagnostic facilities within hospitals to GPs.  It is a scandal that certain diagnostic work and consultant opinion has to be carried out on an expensive in patient basis at present, often in beds in teaching hospitals costing over £1,000 per week. This is a vital area of medical management of scarce resources to minimise cost without any less care for the patient.</P>
    <P>Similarly, international experience has shown that the evolution and expansion of day hospitals and day treatments can create enormous savings.  Up to 40 per cent of all hospital treatments in some areas can be done through such day facilities. At present in Ireland we are only operating some 10 per cent of hospital treatments in such day facilities.  We need to convert more beds in our acute hospitals into day wards and day surgeries and I call on the Minister to issue a similar circular to hospitals in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this Fine Gael motion we call for the establishment of An Bord Sláinte, a semi-State body to replace the health boards and to streamline the management and delivery of the health services. This is a new concept and like all new concepts invariably there will be a resistance to change, especially among those in the health sector.  As can be gathered from what I have already said, I am not in any way satisfied with the effectiveness, efficiency and planning of the delivery of our health care services. This must raise the most fundamental questions about the current structures applying and the attitudes of civil servants to what are basically straightforward commercial matters such as purchasing.</P>
    <P>At present I am far from satisfied about the level of co-ordination within our health services.  Some brief examples in <Col N="720" /> the Dublin area would highlight this.  The authority with responsibility in Dublin for community care have little or no interaction with the vast majority of acute voluntary public hospitals in Dublin.  In some instances this has resulted in unnecessary pressure on casualty and accident and emergency facilities in some hospitals due to weaknesses in general practice and general practitioner cover at night.  It has also led and will lead to further problems in the area of discharges of patients from hospital if more pressure come on hospitals to reduce the length of bed stays per patient.</P>
    <P>I fear that many of our public voluntary hospitals are operating as islands, doing their job on their own regardless of the overall picture of the health services to which the patient requires a comprehensive response and for which the same taxpayer is paying.  It is incredible that some hospitals should have such an exclusive arrangement to their local health board.  This is simply unworkable and it needs to be co-ordinated.  There is only one person who can co-ordinate it and that is the Minister for Health.  When I specifically put this question to senior managerial executives in the Eastern Health Board and to people in the public voluntary hospitals they have referred to the need for co-ordination.  Quasi committees have been set up but nothing has effectively been done to deal with this issue.  The more people that are treated in the community the cheaper it will be done and the better the care for the public.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the quality of management in some area of the health services.  There are some excellent, top class, under-paid managers who are doing a remarkable job but, unfortunately, they may well be lost to the public sector because of their low level of remuneration.  Allied to this is some very mediocre management.  I believe that new structures would ensure the best people in the most strategic places of the health services with proper levels of remuneration and an upgrading of performance through priority being given to <Col N="721" /> greater management, training and expenditure.</P>
    <P>The present allocation of finance within health boards, given the clear division of programmes under different managements such as community care, special hospitals and general hospitals, creates divisive competition which is unhelpful to say the least.  What is required is an integration of the health services at local level under an area manager who in turn would be responsible to a regional manager who in turn would be responsible to a well managed national board.  I believe the semi-State structure is the only way in which this can be achieved. Past experiences outside the health area, such as the establishment of Telecom Éireann and An Post, show the remarkable transformation which can be achieved in services to the public as well as in financial performance, in comparison with the old lacklustre Department of Posts and Telegraphs which was excessively bureaucratic and outdated.  I believe a similar transformation can take place within the health services.  This does not involve any principle of ideology or privatisation, simply one of better management of finite resources.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about the present operation of health boards.  The composition of boards can often be geographically unbalanced leading to a particular bias which can be unfair within a region in terms of the delivery of health services.  Here I would point to the current difficulties in the Western Health Board.  Moreover, there could be direct vested interests having an executive role rather than a consultative one.  I do not believe you can handcuff chief executives in this way and expect them to perform to high standards of professionalism. Moreover, some of the geographical regions create crazy situations in relation to the catchment areas of individual hospitals and health care services and subsequent transport services.</P>
    <P>Only a national body can see through and rectify these expensive and wasteful practices.  That is not to say that there should not be consumer and public scrutiny of the health services.  There will <Col N="722" /> always be a need for political accountability on the part of the Minister in terms of policy and resources.  At local level Fine Gael favour the establishment of advisory committees at county level which can make recommendations in relation to local service needs as well as ensuring accountability on an annual basis on the part of area managers.</P>
    <P>What is not important here are the minute details of structures.  What is important is the attitude to a national health service which does not allow the individual components of that service to see their role in a blinkered narrow way as the sole function of health service matters. Until such time as we take a radical step in this direction uniform cutbacks by the Minister can only inflict untold hardship on the public, as we have seen. Such a semi-Sate body could quickly observe demographic changes which could require greater resources in orthopaedics <i>versus</i> a declining demand for obstetrics and independently implement such a policy.  Such a body could carry out a national review of hospitals to obtain the best performance in terms of energy conservation.  They could also ensure that a purchasing officer buying everything from eggs to cotton wool would know what everyone else in the same health service was paying for them. The lack of information about what others are paying for them in the sector appals me.</P>
    <P>The cost containment unit of the Department of Health has not tackled these issues to date effectively.  Such a semi-State body could clearly get better value in the non-medical aspects such as hotel accommodation in hospitals and the greater utilisation of outside management consultants.  Such a body could deal comprehensively with the level of bad feeling and I emphasise to the Minister the deep sense of bad feeling which currently exists between the health boards as to the discrepancies, anomalies and inequities in the different allocations to the regions not being based in any way uniformly, either <i>per capita</i> or otherwise. There has been no basic innovation such as the RAWP system in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> Does it make sense to have one health board responsible for some 40 per cent of the population, catering for 1.2 million people out of a population of 3.5 million while it takes seven health boards to cater for the balance?  A lot of experience and knowledge has been accumulated since the 1970 Health Act.  It is now almost 17 years since the establishment of the health boards.  Surely it is time for a fundamental review of the structures in health.  Is it right that in some health board areas one can obtain a drugs refund for monthly expenditure in excess of £28 on medicines per month while in other areas the figure is £33 per month?  Is it fair that one health board out of eight charge £10 for an appeal on a medical card refusal and a mortuary charge of £40, while the rest do not?  Is it right that only one health board should have a salaried orthodontist while the rest do not?  Surely, the public have some rights in regard to a uniform health care service and user charges.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I wish to refer to and which has received attention lately and which the Minister may refer to tonight and that is the announcement that some 850 full-time temporary nursing posts are going to be made permanent. I want to assure the Minister that nobody in the health services is conned into believing that this will solve their problems.  In fact, I cannot understand why it took so long to deal with this.  When we look at the cost of PRSI for full-time temporary nurses and the cost of PRSI for permanent staff we will see that there is a discrepancy of over 12 per cent of gross salaries.  It is cheaper to make people permanent, except perhaps in the short term.  In the long term there is the additional cost in terms of the incremental scale over a nine year period in the career structure of nurses, but nobody in the health services believes that that will provide one extra nurse or better care for patients.  Everybody will be very disappointed tonight if the Minister is relying on that as his response to the present crisis.</P>
    <P>Finally, Fine Gael seek to set out a <Col N="724" /> constructive resolution to our health crisis that clearly recognises that one could easily spend £2 billion on the health services next year without rectifying the fundamental causes of the present problem. We appeal to all the other Opposition parties to support this motion which, basically, will give the Dáil tomorrow evening, or whenever the vote is taken, two choices &mdash; between the Government's cutbacks and mismanagement leading to well-documented hardship for public patients or the choice that my party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will not be afraid to give this Minister every support in dealing with the restrictive practices of dentists when he comes to deal with the auxiliaries, DSAs or dentists.  That support is here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the scarce resources, we cannot flinch from these managerial issues.  I hope in this limited debate that all Opposition parties, having put forward their own preferences by way of amendments, at the end of the day will unite behind this motion to give the House an opportunity to give some sense of direction and leadership to the health services which <Col N="725" /> is badly needed but is sadly lacking at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened very attentively for the last 40 minutes to Deputy Yates and the one thing he seemed to forget was that the health services are about patient care and looking after patients.  He stated that there should be a hospital catchment area and that a patient would have to go into that specific hospital, that he would have no choice of going to another hospital and that he should not be going to the more expensive hospitals.  His thesis was based on cost and spending money.  There was nothing about patient care, and the same applied to drugs &mdash; generic drugs had to be forced on patients.</P>
      <P>He spoke about Cavan Hospital.  We allocated £2.5 million to equip that hospital.  The health board spent £1 million of that allocation and still have £1.5 million.  There are no beds in the hospital, there is no laboratory equipment and only half the operating equipment is installed.  It will take another six months before the hospital is fully equipped.  Yet, Deputy Yates complains that there are no patients.  If his approach to the health services is that once half the equipment is installed the patients should be taken in because the hospital was being heated and we would save money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I noticed Deputy Farrelly left the House when Deputy Yates was talking about abolishing the health boards.  That was significant.  I have considerable difficulty responding in any coherent way to this motion.  Deputy Yates, presumably with the agreement of his front bench colleagues, has gathered together a number of ideas, most of them <Col N="726" /> in my view a reaction to his last conversation with various health workers. For example, he said no provision had been made for investigation and management of child abuse.  I provided £500,000 this year for the first time ever for the management of child abuse services. He is now asking this House to treat this assorted mixture of ideas as a serious policy proposal.  I would have hoped the Deputy would have exercised greater discrimination and a good deal more insight in formulating such a serious motion as we have before us this evening.</P>
      <P>Most of his proposals are simplistic answers to difficult questions which have taxed the minds of health professionals in all developed countries for the past 20 years.  I have to reject utterly the suggestion that there is a problem about the quality of health care in this country.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied, as are most objective commentators, that we have by any standard an excellent service available here and it is unfair and alarmist to suggest otherwise.  I accept, as I have already acknowledged on many occasions, that we have problems, mainly in the timely supply of services for certain conditions, but I am satisfied that with better and clearer deveployment of our existing resources we can quickly address the most urgent problems and eliminate them.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that 1989 will also be a difficult year.  Because of the national financial problems the £32 million extra allocated for 1989 will not be sufficient to allow for significant developments in the health services.  The problems in the health services are increased by effects in the £550 million overrun by the Coalition Government in 1985-86.</P>

They have continued to provide a very high quality service in what we all recognise are very difficult times.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates talks about the need to streamline services.  The fact of the matter is that there have been more positive changes in the past 18 months in terms of streamlining services than anything achieved previously.  It is quite wrong to infer that the situation is all doom and gloom.  Over the past two years, steady progress has been made in completing and commissioning many new facilities, including, St. James's Hospital, the Mater, Castlebar, Cavan, Mullingar and Swinford.  Work is well advanced on major developments at Wexford, Ardkeen and Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital system continues to provide services to a huge number of people. In 1987, there were over 1.5 million attendances at outpatient departments, while over 500,000 people &mdash; inpatients <Col N="728" />&mdash; were discharged from hospital.  Productivity increased significantly at all major centres.</P>
    <P>Although bed numbers in the Dublin area have been reduced by about 15 per cent since January 1987, the number of patients treated has increased overall.  In the six major Dublin hospitals on the accident and emergency rota, admissions in February to July 1987 were 14,266: in 1988, for the same period there were 17,430 admissions, an increase of 22 per cent.  In St. James's Hospital, although the number of acute beds has been reduced by about 25 per cent, the number of admissions has actually increased by 7 per cent comparing January-August 1988 with the same period last year.  In the same hospital, day activity, surgical and medical has increased by 25 per cent, and in the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospital there has been an increase in day cases of nearly 40 per cent since the beginning of 1986.</P>
    <P>Can Deputy Yates point out to me any health service in a comparably wealthy country that is managing to meet all the demands placed on it?  I would ask him not to make charges against the quality of our service when he intends no more than to draw attention to certain gaps which may exist in the provision of services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates calls for a fundamental reorganisation of the means through which we deliver health services as the solution to our current and future problems.</P>
    <P>My position is simply stated.  I see organisation as a means to an end.  If I can achieve my objectives through the existing system, I do not see any case for change.  If change in parts of the existing system is sufficient to produce the desired results then I will see that it is done, and I am, and will be, addressing areas in which there is a need for the rationalisation of both organisation and structures. If the entire system must be changed in order to ensure effectiveness and efficiency, I am quite prepared to do that, once I am clear about the full implications and potential of the alternative model.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> I am not at all convinced that the abolition of our health boards is necessary or justified.  As I will demonstate later in my response.  I believe that it is possible, within the existing framework, to bring about many improvements in management, in delivery of services, in value for money and in integration of services. I have found relatively little difficulty in taking initiatives in a whole variety of areas.  I have found existing health agencies, the health boards and the voluntary hospitals, and their managements, enormously positive in coping with the problems which have been posed by the restriction on funding, made necessary by the need to put our national finances on a firm footing.  That being said, I am not in the business of protecting any system that can be or ought to be improved.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I took the initiative in establishing the Commission on Funding, whose report will include in its recommendations proposals for the future organisation of our delivery system, bearing in mind the need to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in the use of health funds, irrespective or how they are raised.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will approach the commission's recommendations with a very open mind.  There will be no delay in implementing the recommendations the Government believe should be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Deputy Yates's party, when in Government, considered detailed proposals for replacement of the health boards.  It is my understanding that a number of alternative arrangements, including the establishment of Bord Sláinte for the whole country, were considered but, at the end of the day, no decision was taken to change the existing system.  I can only wonder what has happened in the meantime that makes Deputy Yates change his view.</P>

      <P>Much is being done within our present structure to improve <Col N="730" /> effectiveness and efficiency.  More can be done and is being planned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates has drawn comparisons between the health services and the ESB and Bord Telecom in advocating the introduction of a single executive authority. I find the comparison inappropriate and simplistic.  Apart from the huge differences in the complexity of the the two services, there are different social and consumer dimensions to be considered in relation to the health services which, I suggest, do not arise in making arrangements for the efficient supply of a public utility such as electricity.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy and his party, have not had a change of heart in their support for the development of community based and community supported services.  I would like to know how community services would be organised from a central body such as proposed without any local input.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the House that in implementing Government policy on public sector employment my Department have directed local management to ensure that essential services are protected and have established an employment control mechanism which ensures that critical staff vacancies are filled.  I do not accept that the health services are over staffed by administrators. In fact, clerical and administrative staff in central administration, that is in the headquarters in the various health boards, amounts to about 2 per cent of all health board staff.</P>
      <P>The remaining administrative staff work in the front line in hospitals and the community in the provision of services directly to patients such as casualty, out-patients, medical records and the essential support for health care providers.  In fact, the term, &ldquo;administrative&rdquo;, may be a misnomer in describing the vital functions performed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> It might be of interest to the Deputy to know that overall numbers of administrative personnel employed in headquarters functions has in fact been reduced by about 11 per cent in the last 18 months.  Staffing policy must have strict regard to the reality of available financial resources.  Within these strictures the maximum flexibility possible will be devolved to local management and my Department will continue to ensure that critical staff shortages are quickly assessed. In addition to resolving the immediate staffing problems in particular areas the crucial question of manpower planning in the long term, particularly in the nursing and medical areas is being addressed.</P>
    <P>One area of medical manpower planning where we can proceed with greater confidence is in relation to the balance of medical posts within our health service and in particular the balance between permanent career and training posts.  I indicated that I am fully alive to the dangers which attach to any such proposal and I acknowledge that it must be pursued with caution.  Nevertheless, I believe that it is an area which cannot be ignored and I have asked my officials to prepare a consultative document to establish the views of all the relevant interests and the possibilities for action in this area.</P>

      <P>Another report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to ensure that the health board members do not see themselves simply as the advocates for a population or sectional interest within the health board area.  Their role as accountable policy makers must be defined more clearly to reflect the current situation. Their relationships with central Government and the managements of the board must also be defined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management must be allowed to manage by clearly defining their roles and relationships and giving them both the authority and the responsibility to carry out their functions.  Such an approach <Col N="732" /> must operate at all levels within the management structure with accountability both for service provision and resource management being assigned as appropriate. I am at this time considering proposals for pilot systems of administration.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of reform referred to in the motion concerns medical and non-medical supplies.  I accept that potential cost savings exist in the health services in the areas of purchasing generally.  In this area of cost containment work is being done on a number of fronts both at national, regional and hospital level. Nationally a major effort is being made to achieve savings on the purchase of medical and surgical consumables in which there is an expenditure of some £125 million and in the area of drugs expenditure which is already covered by a price agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  In relation to that agreement I should like to point out that Deputy Yates, in the course of a radio interview, said that I had negotiated an agreement which had a 15 per cent price differential in relation to medicines sold here and in the UK.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospitals are paying too much for drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I negotiated an agreement which reduced by 5 per cent the differential in the price that the Coalition Government negotiated a year before. As a result, and because of fluctuations in exchange rates, we are paying figures comparable with the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>And British drugs have shot up the league ever since.  They were middle of the league and now they are at the top of the price league.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates has a simplistic approach to prescribing generic drugs.  I am glad to say that as part of the GMS negotiations we have agreement to introduce a formulary.  I will be encouraging doctors to use the formulary when it is produced but they will continue to have the right to prescribe what they <Col N="733" /> believe to be in the interests of their patients.  This is all about patient care.</P>
      <P>One of the major findings of a 1986 study on purchasing arrangements was that there was considerable variation from hospital to hospital in the prices paid for similar items particularly where there were a number of alternative brands.  This study recommended that as much information as possible should be made available on a regular basis to those involved in purchasing to assist them in getting the best value for money.  A cost containment unit which was set up by me in the Department of Health has concentrated initially in this direction.</P>
      <P>At regional and individual agency level, efforts are being made to improve business efficiency in the areas of purchasing through the greater exercise of purchasing strengths, greater stock control and improvements in buying strategies. I would be hopeful that the benefits of these efforts would be reflected in greater and more efficient service provision in 1989.  A considerable amount of preliminary work has already been done in reviewing the organisation of our laboratory services.  There is scope in this review to look not only at hospital based laboratories, but also at medical research laboratories in universities and the possibility of more efficient linkings between all laboratories engaged in broadly similar activities.  The results of this review will begin to bear fruit in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased computerisation has its part to play in improving efficiency and effectiveness in the health services.  When I took office I set up a review group in the Department.  This review was carried out by a group representative of the Department, the health boards, voluntary hospitals, other health agencies and an independent expert in computerisation. As a result of the recommendations made by the group I have decided that future policy should be based on competitive tendering, that the selection of hardware and/or software should be solution driven, and that the selection of suitable hardware and of applications software should be primarily a matter for decision <Col N="734" /> by the health agencies on the basis of guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that these changes will mean more extensive use of computerisation in the health services resulting in greater efficiency and effectiveness in running our health services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy seems to have a misunderstanding of the present methodology used in the allocation of resources to the various health agencies providing services as is made clear by the Deputy's reference to clinical budgeting. Despite any impressions he may have, the existing allocation process is done in an objective way and on the basis of the best information available and reflects the role that each individual agency is expected to play in the provision of services. Funds are not applied simply on an arithmetic incremental basis.</P>
    <P>The problems which arose in certain of the major national specialties this year were not the fault of the existing allocation process but were a consequence of significant increased activity which were not foreseen by either the hospitals or the clinicians, and lack of sufficiently rigorous internal budgeting arrangements in certain hospitals.  The Deputy said that he was in Crumlin.  I am sure he was told that bone marrow transplants were carried out on seven children in 1987 and they hope to carry out a similar operation on 17 children in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>They told me a lot more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the management of resources, which the Deputy seems to confuse with the allocation process, I have continuously stressed the need for the active involvement of the heads of all Departments, including clinical, in the process, both at speciality level and hospital corporate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our course is now firmly set and every initiative in relation to hospital budgeting will be aimed at achieving a system within which the individual consultant will have the responsibility and accountability for the effective and efficient use of the <Col N="735" /> resources made available to him.  Furthermore, the system will be designed to support and reward good performance and to identify those who are making less than optimal use of the resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The principle of earmarking budgets for national specialties has already been established, for example, in relation to cardiac surgery at the Mater Hospital. That principle will be extended in targeting the placing of resources in 1989.  I must, however, point out that this is no panacea; we must ensure that the interests of the great majority of patients who require relatively straightforward treatment are not compromised by the imperatives of high technology medicine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates proposes the appointment in each hospital of a general manager. In fact most of his speech here tonight was devoted to more and more administration &mdash; local managers, regional managers, national managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fewer managers but better run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are having discussions with St. James's Hospital to establish what further support that hospital needs to build on the initiative it has already taken to establish a general management system.  I have been in discussions with the Southern Health Board about a general manager for Cork Regional Hospital.  Again, with the MANCH hospitals, we are looking for unified management between the Meath, the Adelaide and the National Children's Hospitals.  These are but a few of the initiatives which are being taken to introduce general management into all major hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased with the progress which is being made at Beaumont Hospital in establishing good management throughout the hospital.  I am particularly pleased that the chairman and acting chief executive are receiving such ready co-operation from the medical and nursing staff in developing good information systems and tackling some <Col N="736" /> very difficult issues regarding the best use of the resources available to the hospital.</P>
    <P>People who think that there is no service available should look at the performance of Beaumont Hospital.  In the first nine months of this year there were 15,260 admissions; 43,198 patients were seen in the accident and emergency unit and more than 70,000 patients were seen at the outpatient department.  With the development of more scientific and assertive management, hospitals will tend to accept only work that they ought to and can do.  This, in turn, will force other parts of the system, including general practitioners, to take a more inclusive responsibility for their patients while ensuring that the hospital gives them the diagnostic support which they need.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to co-ordination between hospitals and primary health care services.  The health care system of the future will have to be an integration of the main delivery areas of the system in the appropriate balance as the needs of various areas and the patients dictate. It is not a question of greater co-ordination between hospitals and community and primary health care services.  It is a question of removing the traditional, artificial barriers which have been erected between the various service streams.</P>
    <P>The motion advocates the development of a national hospital plan.  The evidence is there for Deputy Yates and others to see that we are well past the planning stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have moved, since I came into office, to eliminate facilities that were clearly surplus to requirements, to clarify the role and responsibilities of each hospital, to promote grouping of hospitals, particularly in urban areas, and to protect the capacity of major general hospitals, in so far as resources permit. Productivity has been greatly increased, thanks mainly to the efforts of medical and nursing staff and their willingness to adopt the most modern methods of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> There is, of course, much work still to be done.  The discussions which have been initiated on grouping of hospitals to provide a comprehensive range of services in areas such as the south-east of Dublin and west Wicklow, in Cork and in the Mid-Western Health Board area should bear fruit from now on.  I believe that our smaller hospitals, by having the right working relationships with the regional centre and by concentrating on discharging an agreed role, can make a major contribution to the provision of general hospital services.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind this House of the negative and destructive attitude taken by Fine Gael in opposing my decision to rationalise the hospital situation in Limerick. As a result of that rationalisation it is now possible to develop a cohesive acute hospital service for the mid-west and to copperfasten the future role of the smaller hospitals, which indeed, I believe, Deputy Yates will agree with.</P>
    <P>I think it will be clear from what I have outlined here this evening that we are not dependent on major reorganisation to implement many of the improvements which are necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>The previous Government, of which the Deputy's party were the senior partner, made no attempt whatsoever to undertake this review and yet he has the gall to stand up here tonight and call for its reform.  For the benefit of the Deputy, I would remind him that apart from recommencing the negotiations on the General Medical Service, on which the Coalition Government were able to make no progress &mdash; they were supposed to commence the review of the common contract in 1986 but they were unable to do anything about it &mdash; I am glad to say that we commenced the review of the common contract and to date eight meetings have been held and key issues have been identified on an agreed agenda and are under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>What about pathologists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the delicacy of the negotiations and the importance being attached to the talks, <Col N="738" /> and as they have reached a crucial stage in relation to the scheduling of the consultants' commitment, it would not be helpful or appropriate to elaborate any further other than to say that progress has been achieved in this area and I am hopeful that further progress will be made.</P>
      <P>The crucial role played by consultants in the hospital service is well known.  In fact, it can fairly be said that most of the activities and costs of an acute hospital are determined by decisions and practices of consultants.  It is, therefore, of great importance for the quality of patient care that consultants and hospital managers should co-operate closely to ensure that the best possible use be made of the very substantial resources committed to the hospital service.  To date, there has been a widespread conviction that consultants have not been willing to become involved in the task of allocating and managing resources on a continuing basis to promote an integrated and efficient service.</P>
      <P>The positive and constructive engagement of consultants in the explicit management of resources, in which they are implicity engaged on a day-to-day basis, would be a most useful development.  For that reason management welcome any proposal for a greater willingness on the part of consultants to become so involved.</P>
      <P>The Irish people are fortunate to benefit from the strong tradition of family medicine and most people rely on the services of a general practitioner to deal with most episodes of illness and refer them for appropriate specialist care when necessary.  While free general practitioner services are provided to less than 40 per cent of the population, the way in which that service is organised and funded has a very important impact on the quality and direction of the general practitioners as a whole.  The operation of the General Medical Service has been under examination for some time, including the report of the working party which examined it in detail and reported in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that an agreement has been reached on a significant change <Col N="739" /> in the General Medical Service following negotiations between my Department, representatives of the health boards and the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
    <P>With regard to future directions in the general practitioners service, I am confident that it will be possible over a period to transfer to the surgery of the general practitioner a number of activities which are currently hospital based.</P>
    <P>Developing technology is putting at the disposal of the family doctor investigations and treatments which formerly were available only in more specialist settings.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary, of course, to ensure that access to services, both in the hospital and elsewhere will be matched by both competence and effectiveness in their use.  It follows, therefore, that access to diagnostic and other facilities must be based on agreed protocols as to the occasions on which the facilities will be used and the manner in which their use will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned at 7 p.m. I had been paying tribute to the Teagasc research centre in Kinsealy for the contribution it has made to the development of the mushroom industry.  There is no doubt that the new production techniques developed there over a period provided the dynamic for the development of this rapidly expanding industry.  We also had the opportunity to pay tribute to the far-seeing producers who adopted that technology and put it to very good use in the development of the industry at primary production level.</P>
      <P>At present we have approximately 9 per cent of the fresh mushroom market in Britain.  We envisage that increasing rapidly in the next few years; indeed we envisage that our percentage share of the British market will increase to 16 per cent in a few short years.  There is no doubt that the leaders in the mushroom industry have set an example for us all.  This success spells out not only the importance of the individual growers, but the essential need for growers to be closely organised in groups under a group management which takes full account of new technical developments and of the need at all times for good marketing and top quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate coincides with getting under way of the new academic year and with the past academic year drawing to a close.  Inevitably at a time like this there will be much focus on examinations results &mdash; the marks obtained and grades achieved.  It seems therefore, an appropriate time to report on the grades achieved by the Minister for Education.  What might such <Col N="741" /> a report say?  Might it say: &ldquo;this was a student of whom much had been expected; expectations had been increased by her performance in Opposition, during which she had vigorously supported increased expenditure on every aspect of education but this early promise has not been fulfilled&rdquo;.  Particularly disappointed, I suspect, will be those concerned about the charges for school transport because they will remember Deputy Mary O'Rourke's earliest months as Opposition spokesperson. They will recall her &ldquo;crusade&rdquo; not a particularly modest or self-effacing description but her work to describe her opposition to the decision by the then Minister, Deputy Gemma Hussey, to introduce, though in an ameliorated and modified form, the decisions announced by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>Last year the Estimates provided for a reduction of £6.5 million and in this year's Estimates we again see substantial cuts in regard to school transport.  One wonders what views those concerned have about the fidelity of such a crusader?  One suspects that they may have to think again.</P>
      <P>The past 18 months has been a dismal period in Irish education.  The Minister, who in Opposition had disdained the achievements of the then Government, such as &ldquo;The Ages of Learning&rdquo; which resolved the vexed question of how many years the students were to spend at second level and of the stage at which they were to enter the primary level, which opened up the education system to support from the European Social Fund at second and third levels and which brought about achievements in the area of curriculum reform, has presided over a period of confusion and decline in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That period of confusion, decline, and floundering uncertainty has been exacerbated by these Estimates.  The Minister's period in office has been characterised by a series of misjudgments which have dismayed the education world, embarrassed her colleagues in Government and betrayed those who are her charges &mdash; pupils and students for whom she has responsibility.  We recall, for example, <Col N="742" /> the decision to increase class sizes in primary schools and to do so right across the nation without regard to whether the school was developing or was in a disadvantaged area and without regard to other factors.  That decision which was anathema to every precept of natural justice was taken by a Cabinet that clearly did not understand and had not had pointed out to them the implications behind their decision.  Parents rallying to the attack on their children saw the worst effects of that decision ameliorated, though indeed that amelioration was offered not by the Minister for Education but by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>We all recall the extraordinarily parliamentary performance on the occasion when the Taoiseach had donned his black tie and headed off to the Burlington and the Minister was left alone and hapless in his absence to face the Opposition.  The baffled Chief Whip was sitting beside her offering his instructions.</P>
    <P>We then had an attack on the community, comprehensive and vocational sector, the sector that has traditionally been charged with the care of the disadvantaged. Central to its reason for existance is that it should be in a position to offer a wide range of subjects but the Minister's decisions strike at this, their basic ability.  She stumped up with the argument that all she was doing was seeking to achieve equality.  What equality is there for a school in a disadvantaged area?  It was brought to my attention that a school in what is probably the most disadvantaged and deprived area in the west of this city will have fewer teachers than it had last year despite the fact that as a relatively new school it is catering for an extra year and will have extra students.  This school is in an area where unemployment is running at an estimated 63 per cent.</P>
    <P>Again there was some partial retreat. The Minister was not relied on to announce that the mechanism for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> had to be used.  Schools know that the academic year is going to cause problems and that they are going to have to provide the service with fewer teachers and fewer <Col N="743" /> teaching hours than were available last year.  Those difficulties were compounded by the Minister's ineptitude and procrastination, about which she had been warned.  She was told that her failure to inform schools, particularly in the community, comprehensive and vocational sector, of their allocation of teachers could have only one result.  It had that result, the schools reopened to chaos.  A school in Ballymun opened without a French or a home economics teacher.  Despite the pleadings of the public representatives of the area and the teachers concerned the weeks of the academic year tick away week by week without the necessary teachers.  That school is expected to compete.</P>
    <P>The school transport service was the Minister's area of personal crusade.  Last year £6.5 million was taken from the service only to have it restored, not by the Minister for Education but by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  It is very curious that the unfortunate Minister always finds herself in the position that she announces the original decision, the bad news, and when the Government run scared, someone else intervences and says &ldquo;It is not as bad as Mary told you.  We have managed to sort something out&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give her her full style and title with the greatest of pleasure.  The £6.5 million that was taken out last year was put back again in the budget but this year's Estimate provides for a reduction of 18 per cent, from £31,900,000 to £26,200,000.  What will that mean?  It will mean higher charges and a squeezing of the system.  Only today a teacher who deals with the mentally handicapped in Roscommon told me of the plight of two young mildly mentally handicapped children who are sitting at home because transport will not be provided by the Department to bring them to a school catering for the needs of the <Col N="744" /> mildly mentally handicapped.  There are other children in the area for whom arrangements can be made for the payment of a grant but in these two instances the parents are not in a position to bring the children to school and the youngsters stay at home.  As a result of these Estimates there will be more examples of that.</P>
      <P>Another example of this &ldquo;in, out, in&rdquo; system is the capital allocation for school buildings in the primary sector.  Last year a swathe was cut right through the allocation. Then there was partial relief from the Minister for Finance in last year's budget when he put in something that had been taken out by the Minister for Education in the Estimates in a second bite of the cherry.  One wonders whether the Minister knows whether she is coming or going.</P>
      <P>Then we had what appeared to be the Minister's crowning glory, the decision to reduce all schools in the secondary system to a five year cycle.  In doing that the Minister was setting at nought one of the major achievements of her predecessor but that did not worry her.  That decision did not last too long.  On that occasion it was the Taoiseach who intervened to say that that decision was not going ahead. The Taoiseach managed to rescind that decision when a TV mike was placed in front of him on a visit to a school and he appeared to do that without even informing the hapless Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Right through this year's Estimates it is again clear that the Minister has failed to protect the education system.  I have already mentioned school transport and school buildings.  Particularly shameful in this year's Estimates is the reduction in services for children in care.  The allocation for the neediest of the needy has been reduced.  That decision is redolent only of the attempt last year to cut off education for travellers.  At least that was dropped by the Minister, but only when an anguished Sister Collette had journeyed to the Minister's home and pleaded to have that extraordinary decision reversed.  What will it take to cause a rethink of this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> This year singled out for attention in the Estimates is third level education.  By way of mitigation, fair warning was given. Every briefing, every leak in the months leading up to the publication of the Estimates indicated that third level education would receive the Minister's special attention.</P>
    <P>For the PTA sector in the Estimates there is an increase of 3 per cent.  That seems reasonable on the face of it.  In the present financial climate, at first sight it appears better than one might expect but of course, the figures do not tell the whole story.  The apparent 3 per cent increase does not reveal that the universities have to pay for the various special pay awards granted over the last year and it does not take account of the fact that the universities have to pay for the general pay agreement across the public service.  If those factors are taken into account there is a reduction in real terms in terms of their ability to deliver services of some 1 or 2 per cent.  That on top of what has been happening to the university sector in the last few years means a disimprovement in services, fewer tutorials and when tutorials are held more students will be crammed in.  It also means that the students who do not come to tutorials because they will not be organised for them, who head off for the libraries, will find themselves with an ever deteriorating library service.</P>
    <P>Within the higher education area it is the RTCs that come in for particular attention.  In this area we have revealed the real short-sightedness of the Minister's approach.  The Estimate provides for a reduction of 1 per cent for the RTCs in the coming year.  That does not sound too catastrophic and it is the sort of thing one might expect to have to live with in the present economic climate.  However, the raw figures disguise the real severity of the cut.  In context, that cut of 1 per cent is the same scale cut that last year caused some riots, anguish and chaos in the vocational, community and comprehensive sector.  That 1 per cent last year led to the marches, the anguish, the protest meetings and to a situation now where schools are reducing their range of <Col N="746" /> subjects throughout the country.  It is a 1 per cent cut only on the most cursory examination.  Again, we have to take into account that it does not allow for the special pay increases which are very significant in that sector or for the general pay agreement or for increments.</P>
    <P>Given that we are talking about a reasonably young sector where most members of the staff will not be on the top of the scale, the question of increments is of major significance.  The real cut there is in the order of 4 or 5 per cent and how will that be achieved?  It can only be achieved by job losses and by redundancies among the academic staff.  That will mean narrower choices for students and that courses will be terminated.  This is very short-sighted.  Has the Minister taken no account of what is happening within the European Community? Thanks to the efforts of the Minister's predecessor, the RTC sector is substantially supported by the European Social Fund.  The Structural Funds are being reviewed and in that review there is the prospect of a significantly higher intervention rate for areas of priority and Ireland is one such area.</P>
    <P>If one allows for the fact that we already get Social Fund money and that we will be getting it at a higher rate for our RTCs, and if one allows for the fact that the staff employed in the RTCs are for the most part in the higher tax bands &mdash; and whatever happens on the tax front we can take it that they will remain in the higher tax band &mdash; it will be possible in a year or two to actually run our RTCs at a profit, thanks to the good offices of the European Community.  However, the Minister appears oblivious and takes no account of that prospect.  Instead there is the shortsighted approach of cutting now. One has to say that a complete unawareness, to put it at its most charitable, of what is happening in Europe permeates much of the Minister's activity.  Again, I take an example from the RTC sector. In the early summer months the Council of Education Ministers considered a directive on mutual recognition of third level qualifications, an area of vital importance to Ireland.  The Ministers <Col N="747" /> adopted a directive covering qualifications which follows on a three-year course.  Did the Minister not know or did she not care that the staple diet of the RTCs for which she is responsible is the two-year national diploma?</P>
    <P>Another area of bitter disappointment in the RTC sector is the capital provision. Where is the provision for RTCs at Thurles, Castlebar and Dún Laoghaire?  There is no provision.  Most shameful of all is the fact that there is no provision for Tallaght, an area which cries out for attention but which is again to be neglected.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was compensating in other areas for her failure to win resources, people might be prepared to be generous.  They might say that although she lacks clout at Cabinet she is clearly interested, committed and serious but there is no indication of a willingness to take decisions in other areas, even where there are no financial implications. Where is the decision in relation to the status of the NIHEs?  Their case for university status has been established internationally but the Minister refuses to come forward with a decision.  What action is being taken to have a centralised system of applications for all third-level colleges and institutions for students sitting the 1989 examinations?  Why do the Mercy Order find themselves in the position of having to act as innkeepers advertising for paying guests on the back pages of the newspapers because the Minister fails to come forward with proposals for alternative uses for Carysfort?  Why has legislation not been brought forward which would allow the RTCs the capacity to raise funds themselves?  These facts, on top of the Minister's failure to secure resources, present a dismal picture.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that it was a question of what grades might be awarded to the Minister.  The judgment has to be that her performance is disappointing and that she does not merit rising with her year. In those circumstances one might have thought that the option of repeating a year would be a possibility, since it is usually offered to a weak student.  Of <Col N="748" /> course, the Minister has taken out that option.  Under this Government, weak students are not allowed to repeat their year.  With that option removed, there is only one possibility available to those who cannot measure up academically &mdash; exclusion from the course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The action which has been taken by the Government since coming into office has created an environment which we all agree has been good for business. One only has to look closely at the results in that period.  We are now dealing with an inflation rate of the order of 2 per cent, less than half the British rate and significantly lower than in most of Europe.  Interest rates are lower.  The prime rate is now about 8 per cent, which is also below the British rate.  Industrial costs are falling.  Electricity costs are now in line with those of our competitor countries. Our postal and telecommunication charges are coming into line with international charges.  My colleagues and I have been involved in a campaign to reduce insurance costs and we have met with considerable success.  We recently announced the results of a survey which clearly showed that insurance premia were falling in the public employment area and in the motor area particularly. I put these facts before the House to indicate that business does not operate in a vacuum.  It can only operate and provide employment against the correct background and I would argue that this background has been and is being created very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Book of Estimates confirms the Government's commitment to continue the tight control of expenditure which we began on first coming to office.  Cuts are still necessary and are still being applied, but I stress that the development side of the economy is not being neglected.  This is clear from the number of developmental projects under way.  The Government's clear signal to industry that the State's finances will be kept under control is a major point of reference for the financial community and <Col N="749" /> business generally.  Business needs that confidence and assurance.  I would argue that because they know the Government mean business in regard to public finance and keeping public expenditure under control and will never again allow the public finances to be out of control, the marketplace is responding satisfactorily. I refer to the level of interest rates, the level of inflation, the level of gilts and the general level of investment in the economy.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating that Government create the conditions within which business can flourish.  We have seen business responding to the creation of that environment. I have great confidence in business people in both the public and private sectors.  If we create the conditions and the atmosphere they will do the rest. We cannot expect them to operate in an economically hostile environment, as they had to do for too long.  Industry has been responding wonderfully to this new environment.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to salute in particular the Irish exporter who wins markets overseas, sometimes against very heavy competition.  Perhaps it is not realised just how dependent on trade this country is.  Some 55 per cent of our GNP comes from trade.  This country is proportionally more dependent on trade than Japan or the United States of America.  We depend for our livelihood on earnings from exports.  Ours is arguably one of the most open economies in the OECD.  We have no choice but to win market share outside this small island.  This can only be done if we are competitive and know what we are doing. That is why I salute our exporters.  In the past two years, against very strong international competition, they have brought home the orders.  Our exports are booming across all sectors of the economy.  In 1987 our exports hit the figure of £10.7 billion and we ran a trade surplus of £1.56 billion.  I wonder if it is realised just what a turnabout this is. For 20 years we ran a trade deficit and imported more than we exported.  For the past two years we exported more than we imported.  For that reason, if for no <Col N="750" /> other, I salute the Irish exporter operating in that environment.  Throughout that 20-year period industry was not able to turn the international marketplace to its advantage to the extent that has been possible in the past two years.  Their success has been due to low interest rates, low inflation, reducing insurance and electricity costs and falling input costs generally.  For that reason they have been able to achieve these tremendous results.</P>
    <P>I was able to announce a few days ago that exports for 1988 will hit the £12 billion figure, that is £1 billion a month which Irish industry is selling overseas, a trade surplus of £2 billion since we are importing £10 million and exporting £12 billion.  It is important that that be put very strongly on the record.  It is a tribute to the Irish business community and to the atmosphere within which they are now operating that of all the countries of the EC this is, proportionally of course, the best trading performance.  It has been turned in in the past 12 months by Irish industry &mdash; and Irish exporters in particular. This House should salute the Irish business person and exporter for this.</P>
    <P>These results were not just confined, as some commentators have suggested, to the multi-nationals.  It is not just the big companies that are turning out the exports.  Right across small business and small industry, our own companies are matching international competition and winning orders in magnificent style. There are clear signs that in the indigenous sector exports are growing.  I would expect a growth of 16 per cent this year over the figure for last year.  That is a very significant increase.  Government strategy here is not to rely completely on the international and multi-national companies.  Let me say how welcome these companies are in doing business here and exporting from this country.  It is perhaps not said clearly enough and often enough that that type of industry is welcome here because of the employment which it creates and exports which it generates.</P>
    <P>The Government's job now is to find increasing linkages from those exports <Col N="751" /> back to employment on the floor of the factory and to try to develop our own industry alongside and parallel with the international companies.  It is not a question of either multi-nationals or indigenous; it is a question of both because they learn from each other, have linkages with each other and are very important to each other.  It is a question of a parallel development of the Irish firm alongside the international company.  If we can do that successfully, our exports will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>There are some signs, which worry me quite a trifle, that imports are increasing slightly.  That is perhaps due to the lower interest rate charged and the slight heating up that might be beginning in the economy, but it should not throw our trade surplus out of kilter.  It is important that I put firmly on the record my appreciation to the Irish business person and particularly of the Irish exporter for turning in the best trading performance of any country in the EC in the last 12 months, and I take this opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Apart from the better climate in industry, there have been a number of specific initiatives which I have taken in my own office and which I would like briefly to put on the record of the House.  First, we have engaged in a complete reorganisation of CTT, the Irish export board.  There have been a substantial number of redundancies in that organisation brought about voluntarily and there has been a whole new focus brought to that export board, principally by instilling into them a payment by results ethos or philosophy whereby Irish exporters who are successful pay the State agency for that success, that the State agency ultimately, through a variety of mechanisms, share in that success.  For too long we have assisted industry and industry, when successful, has reaped the reward of that success.  We have put in place in the Irish Export Board a mechanism whereby as CTT assist exporters in winning markets abroad, the exporter, in turn, will refund or pay back in some way to CTT some share of that action.  It is in <Col N="752" /> crude commercial terms called &ldquo;No foal, no fee&rdquo; but it is also a very important concept or philosophy perhaps for all State agencies, and certainly for this one.</P>
    <P>For too long the Irish export board, having very successfully helped exporters throughout the world to win these marvellous exports, have received a very nice letter of thanks from the exporter and nothing else.  From now on they will get a nice letter of thanks and, it is hoped, a cheque which will be related to the exports won by that exporter overseas. That is a radical change of direction for the board and one which I am happy to tell the House is beginning to work.  If the exporter is not successful overseas, then he does not have to make any payment at all to the Irish export board. It is important that the agency would operate, in so far as it can, on a payment by results basis.  If it helps to get the results, then it should share in the rewards of its work.  That is not possible in some of the board's activities such as in the traditional trade board area where the board have to carry out trade missions and trade fairs, that kind of missionary work which is always important.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Irish export board, in the office of trade and marketing we have established the trading house regime.  I have a particular interest in this area because I see this as an exciting new development in Irish business.  I have licensed six trading houses under the trading house legislation passed by this House last year.  Basically, a trading house are a company who buy from manufacturers and export abroad.  Provided they buy from Irish manufacturers they can avail of the 10 per cent rate of taxation and of business expansion money also.  That is a scheme under which you can invest up to £25,000 of your own funds in a company and write it off against your income tax.  There have been some 200 or so very serious inquiries about trading house licences.  The six that we have issued cover technology software, engineering, construction, supply of health care products and the food area. I estimate that the exports for these six trading houses in the first three years <Col N="753" /> will be of the order of £100 million of additional exports which we are not getting currently from the export system as it is.</P>
    <P>I am confident that if we nurture these trading houses systematically, if we license only the best ones and monitor them carefully, in years to come the Irish trading house movement will be as important to this country as it is to Japan or other countries that have used the model for many years.  One reason that we needed these is that there are some 7,000 small manufacturing companies here, of whom only about 2,000 export.  One way of getting the other 5,000 into the business of exporting was to create a structure whereby they could export easily.  You cannot expect 5,000 or so small firms to travel around the world trying to sell their products.  These are companies dealing perhaps with very small products and giving very small employment.  However, they can sell to trading houses and the trading houses can do that work for them. I hope to license an additional number of trading houses in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>We have established a national marketing group which is currently completing its work.  I would hope to put to the Government shortly a national marketing plan which will identify how Irish firms can be supported in securing increased market shares on home and overseas markets.  I would expect quite a number of radical suggestions in that national marketing plan as to how we sell the notion overseas of Ireland Incorporated, how we streamline our agencies abroad so that they are all singing out of the same hymnbook and how we focus our agencies overseas to win additional business.  It is essential for this country that we win that business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established an overseas consultancy group which is advising me on how best to win additional overseas business and their report will be <Col N="754" /> available shortly.  We have also established and have had lengthy discussions with the entertainment industry here to see how we can mould that entertainment industry into an industry that can win additional foreign revenue.  I hope to have some proposals in that regard in the not too distant future.  With the Marketing Institute of Ireland we have put in place a fostering scheme and there are now some 53 companies involved.  This is where the larger companies give, free of charge, marketing expertise to smaller companies and that scheme is working very successfully at present.</P>
      <P>Against the background of all of this development work the Irish Goods Council have been making considerable strides.  The council focuses on domestic marketing.  It is all very well to win markets overseas and that we need to do but the Irish Goods Council have informed me that there is perhaps a thousand million pounds worth of products being imported here currently that could be manufactured in this country either in existing firms or in firms that could be established.  I would pose this question for Irish industry in the strongest possible manner.  Irish industry has about 45 per cent of its own market place; the other 55 per cent is held by other countries.  If we cannot win additional shares of our own home market how will it be possible for us to win additional shares of markets overseas?  We have got to concentrate to a larger extent on winning market share in our own country and the Irish Goods Council are very successful at doing that and have received the funds to do it again this year.</P>
      <P>I wanted to refer to those few items which come directly under the office with responsibility for trade and marketing.  I touched briefly on the question of insurance which we also deal with and in that area I have talked about the reduction in premia which has been brought about and which I announced recently.  The survey indicated that the rates were coming down substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement is now running at about 6 per cent; some two years ago it was running at 13 <Col N="755" /> per cent and the nation was on the brink of financial collapse.  In a very short period this country is being turned around.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement is now down to 5 per cent or 6 per cent and that more than anything else indicates the success of the financial strategy of the Government.  Because the financial strategy is being successful, industry is sure-footed and understands that there is leadership in the economy. In that regard and in saluting the exporters to whom I referred earlier, I would like to say that what I have learned about Irish business in my short period in this office is that where companies or business are strongly led by individuals who are determined, despite the obstacles, to make a success of the particular business venture then it is a success.  The other approach is where companies are often very well managed but people have a long list of its &mdash;&ldquo;If only I had more funds from the State&rdquo;, &ldquo;if only I did not have the VAT problem&rdquo;, and &ldquo;if only I did not have all the other problems, I could be a successful company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My experience in the short 18 months or so I have had to observe industry at close range has been that wherever the companies are properly led and wherever that leadership is provided in business the companies succeed.  That kind of leadership is being provided by the Government at national level and I would ask Irish industry particularly to make sure that that kind of leadership is provided in their own company.  If it is, then the export figures I have been talking about can be continued.</P>

Is dócha gurb í an tríú fadhb, agus b'fhéidir atá chomh tábhachtach leis an dá cheann eile, ná an ráta ard cánach atá <Col N="756" /> sa tír seo, agus sílim go bhfuil dlúthcheangal idir na trí cinn, go bhfuil ceann acu ag teacht ón cheann eile.</P>
      <P>Ag breathnú ar Leabhar na Meastachán seo a foilsíodh an tseachtain seo caite, caithfimid a bheith fírinneach agus a rá gur beag atá sa Leabhar Meastachán seo faoi choinne na fadhbanna dífhostaíochta agus imirce a réiteach.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an dífhostaíocht ag 236,000 anois, agus má áiríonn tú leis sin an 30,000 nó an 40,000 a d'fhág an tír le bliain anuas agus an uimhir daoine atá fostaithe go sealadach ar scéimeanna éagsúla i láthair na huaire, déarfainn gurb í an uimhir 300,000 ar a laghad, nó níos airde, an fhíor-uimhir.

Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le Roinn na Gaeltachta, an Roinn a bhfuil suim ar leith agam féin ann, sílim gur dona an scéal é go bhfuil ísliú 16 faoin gcéad ar an Meastachán i mbliana, ceann de na hislithe is mó, sílim, sna Meastacháin ar fad ag dul do Roinn na Gaeltachta: ó £15.023 milliún i 1988 go dtí £12.637 milliún.

Ar dtús, sílim gur ísliú céime é nach bhfuil aon rud curtha ar fáil don Ghaeilge faoin cheannteideal sin. Tharla an rud céanna anuraidh chomh fada agus a bhain sé le cúrsaí óige agus cúrsaí spóirt, ach ar a laghad tá siadsan ar ais arís sna Meastacháin i mbliana.  Na daoine atá ag obair sna heagraíochtaí seo agus ag plé leis na heagraíochtaí seo, tá sé an-deacair pleananna agus scéimeanna agus aidhmeanna a dhéanamh amach faoi choinne na bliana seo chugainn nuair nach bhfuil an t-eolas cruinn acu cad é an méid airgid a bheidh ar fáil dóibh.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, sílim go bhfuil rud níos measa, mar tá sé ráite, agus tá sé inghlachta leis go coitianta anois, má tá fonn ort airgead a fháil as an chrannchur náisiúnta, go gcaithfidh an tAire nó an tAire Stáit nó an Teachta Dála a bheith sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt duit, agus más mar sin atá an scéal, sílim go bhfuil contúirt mhór go bhféadfadh sé seo cur isteach ar neamhspleáchas na n-eagraíochtaí seo agus go bhféadfadh siad a rá leo féin &ldquo;Is fearr dúinn gan aon rud a dhéanamh a chuirfeas isteach ar an Rialtas, nó ar an Aire, nó b'fhéidir nach mbeidh mórán le fáil againn as an chrannchur náisiúnta faoi choinne chur ar ár gcumas ár gcuid oibre a dhéanamh&rdquo;. Sílim, mar a dúirt mé, go laghdaíonn sé neamhspleáchas na n-eagraíochtaí.  Is é seo an chéad uair a tharla sé agus tá súil agam gurb é seo an uair dheireanach a tharlóidh sé, mar tá míshásamh mór i measc na n-eagraíochtaí seo faoi nach bhfuil aon rud curtha ar fáil dóibh sna Meastacháin.</P>
    <P>Gné eile de Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta ná an teorainn atá leis an mhéid airgid atá curtha ar fáil do na coláistí Gaeilge.  Tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann an mhórchuid de na Teachtaí an tábhacht atá leis na coláistí Gaeilge.  Is <Col N="758" /> dócha gur beag duine nach ndearna freastal ar na coláistí Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhí siad ag dul ar scoil nó nuair a bhí siad ag dul tríd an chóras oideachais, agus is mór an cuidiú é do eacnamaíocht na Gaeltachta.  Anuraidh tharla dhá rud, sílim, a chuir isteach go mór ar na coláistí agus ar ghluaiseacht na gcoláistí Gaeilge. Uimhir a haon, cuireadh teorainn leis an mhéid daltaí a raibh sé de chead acu dul go dtí na coláistí seo.  Dúradh anuraidh nach mbeadh cead níos mó a dhul i 1988 ná mar a chuaigh i 1987, agus chuir sé sin isteach go mór ar fhorbairt na gcoláistí Gaeilge, agus sílim gur olc an polasaí ar fad é má táimid dáiríre maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, go gcuirfí teorainn agus cosc agus stop le daltaí ón chuid eile den tír ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus freastal a dhéanamh ar na cúrsaí sin.</P>
    <P>I mbliana ní shílim, de réir na Meastachán seo go bhfuil feabhas ar bith ar an scéal, mar níl aon ardú curtha nó níl aon bhreis airgid tugtha don cheannteideal sin, agus de réir cosúlachta beidh an scéal mar an gcéanna arís.  An dara rud, ar ndóigh, a tharla do na coláistí Gaeilge anuraidh, agus baineann sé seo leis na mná tí, gur tugadh isteach sa chóras cánach iad.  Anois, tá a fhios againn go bhfuil fonn ar an Rialtas gach pingin chánach dar féidir leo a thabhairt isteach agus bhí tacaíocht ón taobh seo den Teach le fáil acu sna giorruithe atá déanta go dtí seo.  Ach mar sin féin, nuair a bhí ar na mná tí nach raibh aon teacht isteach eile acu na foirmeacha seo a shíniú sílim gur chuir sé ag machnamh iad, agus chuir sé saghas eagla orthu.  Ní hé nach bhfuil siad sásta a gcuid cánacha a íoc ach nach dtaitníonn sé leo a bheith ag líonadh na bhfoirmeacha seo, agus ba mhaith liom, am éigin, go ndéanfadh an tAire nó an tAire Stáit tagairt don cheist sin.</P>
    <P>Gné eile den Ghaeltacht agus de Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta ná an caiteachas atá á chur ar fáil do Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus, mar atá a fhios againn, is ar Údarás na Gaeltachta atá freagracht fostaíocht agus postanna agus monarchana agus tionscail a bhunú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus inniu féin cuireadh tuairisc bhliantúil 1987 ar fáil ag an <Col N="759" /> Údarás.  Tá éirithe go maith leo ó bunaíodh iad i 1980 a gcuid cuspóirí agus a gcuid aidhmeanna a chur i gcrích.  Gach bliain ó 1980 tá éirithe le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta breis fostaíochta agus breis postanna a chruithú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus d'éirigh leo é sin a dhéanamh mar go bhfuil na feidhmeannaigh agus an Bord ag obair go crua, agus mar a dúirt mé, d'éirigh leo an rud céanna a dhéanamh i 1987.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhféadfadh athrú a bheith ar an scéal i 1988 agus go speisialta sa bhliain seo chugainn, 1989.  An caiteachas caipitil a cuireadh ar fáil do Údarás na Gaeltachta i mbliana, 1988, bhí sé 13 faoin gcéad níos ísle ná an méid a fuair siad i 1987, agus an caiteachas atá curtha ar fáil dó i Leabhar na Meastachán os mo chomhair anseo faoi choinne 1989, tá titim eile 13 faoin gcéad, is é sin, le dhá bhliain go bhfuil caiteachas caipitil do Údarás na Gaeltachta íslithe 26 faoin gcéad.  Is é an toradh atá air sin, i mbliana ó mhí na Bealtaine seo caite nach raibh sé ar chumas Údarás na Gaeltachta aon tionscnamh nua a cheadú don Ghaeltacht. Bhí cosc nó stop ar fad le haon tionscnamh a cheadú, le haon phostanna a chruthú sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Agus sin mar atá an scéal i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Má chuireann tú é sin i gcomparáid le húdaráis eile forbartha ar fud na tíre ní hamhlaidh atá an scéal.  Tá airgead go leor acu agus tá siad ag cruthú postanna sa chuid eile den tír, ach sa Ghaeltacht tá cosc ar fad i láthair na huaire ar aon phostanna a chruthú.  Chomh maith leis sin, cé go ndeir sé i Leabhar na Meastachán go bhfuil ardú 23 faoin gcéad ar an chaiteachas reatha i mbliana, ní hamhlaidh atá an scéal.  Is é fírinne an scéil go bhfuil ísliú ar an chaiteachas reatha fosta, beagnach 3 faoin gcéad, mar ní dhéantar tagairt i Leabhar na Meastachán gur tugadh £450,000 sa bhreis i rith na bliana seo thar mar a bhí luaite i Leabhar na Meastachán i 1988.  Mar sin, tá titim ar an chaiteachas reatha chomh maith leis an chaiteachas chaipitil; agus, mar a dúirt mé, cuirfidh sé sin isteach go mór ar chuid oibre an Udaráis agus ar éifeacht an Údaráis.  Níos luaithe sa bhliain bhí sé <Col N="760" /> mar chúis áthais dúinn uilig gur tugadh breis freagrachta don Údarás agus gur tugadh freagracht dóibh i bhfeirmeoireacht éisc.  Anois, cosnaíonn sé seo go leor airgid agus ní shílim go bhfuil aon mhaitheas freagracht mar sin a thabhairt don Údarás mura bhfuilimid sásta an t-airgead a chur ar fáil dóibh faoi choinne na hoibre atá le déanamh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don ísliú atá ar an mhéid airgid a tugadh don Roinn Comhshaoil, Roinn an-tábhachtach, agus go speisialta an t-ísliú tubaisteach, i mo thuairim, ar an mhéid airgid a fuair siad i gcomhair tithíochta, tithe úra a thógáil agus feabhas a chur ar na tithe atá ansin cheana féin.  Tháinig titim 20 faoin gcéad ar an airgead sin, ó £49 milliún go dtí £39 milliún, agus is é an chiall atá leis sin gur beag teach úr a bheas ar chumas na nÚdarás Áitiúil sa chathair nó faoin tuaith nó in aon pháirt den tír a thógáil i mbliana.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le mo chontae féin, is tubaisteach ar fad an scéal é sin, mar go bhfuil géarchéim tithíochta i dTír Chonaill i láthair na huaire.  Tá 4,000 nó 5,000 duine ag fanacht le tithe, agus de réir na Meastachán seo is beag dul chun cinn a dhéanfar air sin sa bhliain seo chugainn.  Bhí an scéal go dona i mbliana. Is beag teach a tógadh, agus is cinnte go dtógfar i bhfad níos lú an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, tá titim mhór ar an mhéid airgid atá curtha ar fáil le haghaidh fheabhsúcháin ar thithe, titim 49 faoin gcéad.  Agus an Comhrialtas, ceann de na scéimeanna is fearr agus a chuir siad ar bun ná an deontas feabhsúcháin tí, agus baineadh úsáid as go forleathan ar fud na tíre, sa chathair agus sa tuaith.  Rinneadh feabhsúcháin ar a lán tithe, chuir sé fostaíocht ar fáil.  Cuireadh deireadh go tobann leis an scéim sin, agus chuir sé sin isteach ar fhostaíocht, agus feicim go bhfuil níos lú airgid i mbliana ná mar a bhí anuraidh ná na blianta a chuaigh roimhe sin.</P>
    <P>Titim mhór eile ar chaiteachas sa Roinn sin ná an caiteachas ar sholáthar uisce agus séarachas, thíos 13 faoin gcéad.  Cuirfidh sé sin isteach go mór ar oibreacha atá beartaithe ag na hÚdaráis <Col N="761" /> Áitiúla ar fud na tíre.  Tá a fhios againn go léir an tábhacht atá le soláthar ceart uisce a bheith ar fáil i ngach ceantar. Tá sé an-tábhachtach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le forbairt tionscail.  Tá sé tábhachtach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le forbairt na hiascaireachta, agus i mo cheantar féin sna Cealla Beaga tá sé an-tábhachtach chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le forbairt thionscal na hiascaireachta agus próiseáil an éisc.  I láthair na huaire sna calafoirt, sna Cealla Beaga go mórmhór, tá an-ghanntanas uisce ansin, agus is deacair forbairt a dhéanamh ar phróiseáil éisc, mar go bhfuil siad ag brath go mór ar sholáthar ceart uisce.  Tá titim mar an gcéanna ar an chaiteachas a bhaineann le scéimeanna feabhsúcháin tithe sa Ghaeltacht, agus, mar a dúirt mé, seo an dara bliain as a chéile ar tharla sé. Cuireann sé iontas mór orainn uilig gur mar sin atá an scéal.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an Taoiseach é féin mar Aire Gaeltachta, agus cé nach bhfuil sé linn an tseachtain seo tá súil againn go mbeidh sé i mbarr a shláinte agus anseo gan mhoill arís, sa dóigh is go mbeidh muid ábalta ceist a chur air féin go díreach cad é atá i gceist aige chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an Ghaeltacht, an bhfuil sé dáiríe faoin Roinn in aon chor, nó cad é an dearcadh atá aige?  Nuair a ghlac sé an cúram seo air féin bliain go leith ó shin bhí go leor againn den bharúil go raibh ré úr i ndán don Ghaeltacht, agus do Údarás na Gaeltachta agus don Ghaeilge, agus choinnigh muid ár gcomhairle againn féin ag an uair sin, choinnigh muid ár gcuid méar trasna ar a chéile agus muid ag súil leis an lá go rachadh rudaí i bhfeabhas.  Ach is eagal liom gur a mhalairt a tharla, agus mar a dúirt mé, ar na Meastacháin atá curtha os ár gcomhair ag an am seo tá siad i bhfad níos measa ná, fiú amháin, mar a bhí an scéal anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is iad na fadhbanna móra a fheicimse atá againn i láthair na huaire sa tír ná an uimhir ard atá dífhostaithe, agus chomh maith leis sin an uimhir daoine atá ag dul ar imirce, 30,000 nó 40,000 duine sa bhliain, a lán acu seo an-óg, agus as gach páirt den tír, agus sílim gur beag ar fad <Col N="762" /> atá i Leabhar na Meastachán seo a thabharfaidh faoi na fadhbanna sin a réiteach i mbliana, agus de réir chosúlachta is ag dul in olcas a bheas na fadhbanna sin i rith 1989, mura dtagann athrú ar chúrsaí nó ar na pleananna atá beartaithe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the 1989 Abridged Estimates Volume and of the 1989 Summary Capital Programme at this time of the year, which is earlier than had come to be the practice, is a reflection of this Government's commitment to reducing the level of public expenditure and to enabling constructive debate on its policies in this House.  It is now generally accepted that the growth in the level of public expenditure in previous years could not have been allowed to continue.  The procedure adopted by this Government of carrying out detailed reviews of the spending programmes during the summer, followed by detailed examination of each Department's Estimate proposals has identified areas of possible savings resulting in reductions amounting to £311 million compared to what expenditure would have been in the absence of these measures.</P>
      <P>This careful management of our public finances has lowered our interest rates; the prime overdraft rate, for instance, has come down from 14 per cent in March 1987 to 8 per cent in September 1988. Our industries have been made more competitive.  We are now close to a situation where the debt-GNP ratio can be stabilised and reduced to a sustainable level.</P>
      <P>In the timber industry, as in other sectors of the economy, we have seen a remarkable increase in business confidence in two years.  This is translating into increased investment, output and employment.  Together with Coillte Teoranta, the new forestry company, we now have all the ingredients for the future prosperity of this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have targeted forestry as a key national development activity, recognising, as they do, the major contribution forestry can make to <Col N="763" /> economic prosperity and to regional and social development.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office the Government have implemented a firm action plan for forestry development.  The results of their efforts are now to be seen: in 1988 a record 10,000 hectares of State planting was achieved; private planting in 1988 will be about 5,000 hectares, 15 times the 1983 level and Coillte Teoranta which will run State forestry activities is shortly to be launched.  Our expectations for this company are high.  I will expand on them later.</P>
    <P>While much progress has been made, much remains to be done.  In particular we must aim to expand considerably the area under forest in Ireland.  At present only 6 per cent of our area is under forest compared to an EC average of 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>Both the State and private sectors will have crucial roles to play in meeting national planting targets.  As I have mentioned earlier, private planting, as actively encouraged by this Government has increased dramatically in recent years.  It can be expected therefore that the private sector will assume an increasing proportion of national planting.  At the same time, the State sector, which for many years has taken the lead in the implementation of Government planting policies, will also make an important contribution.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is the encouragement of private investment in forestry.  Since taking office the Government have actively promoted the expansion of forestry through increased planting in both the State and private sectors.  Last year the State planted 8,000 hectares.  This, combined with private planting of 3,200 hectares, gave a record national planting level of over 11,000 hectares, a level never previously achieved in the history of the State.  This was increased in 1988 with the State planting 10,000 hectares and 5,000 hectares being planted by the private sector.  An even more ambitious programme will be achieved in 1989.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> Positive steps are being taken to sustain the momentum which has built up in private forestry in recent years.  The various grant schemes have been improved and extended.  The main development has been the revision of the western package forestry scheme with effect from 1 July 1988.  This scheme is now available to private planters in all the disadvantaged areas of the country.  This extension in the coverage of the scheme benefits an additional 500,000 hectares of land and will ensure a further expansion of private afforestation in 1989.  Under the scheme, farmers qualify for afforestation grants of 85 per cent of costs and non-farmers qualify for 70 per cent of costs subject, in both cases, to a limit of £800 per hectare. Grants of up to £12 per metre for the construction or reconstruction of forest roads are also available.  In the past, these grants were financed equally by the State and the EC.  However, 70 per cent of the cost of these grants is now available from the EC.  This welcome development reduces substantially the cost of grants to the Exchequer and enables the maintenance of a high private planting programme at a low net cost to the State.</P>
    <P>As well as the western package, there are a number of other schemes in operation. A special farm forestry scheme launched earlier this year makes grants for afforestation, forest roads and woodland improvements available to farmers in all parts of the country.  The afforestation grants range from £550 per hectare for conifers to £850 per hectare for broadleaves and 25 per cent EC assistance is available.  The State private planting grant scheme provides grants of £500 per hectare for conifers and £800 per hectare for broadleaves and satisfies the needs of non-farmers outside the disadvantaged areas.  Finally, farmers in receipt of headage payments for livestock can continue to receive such payments for 15 years if they afforest all or part of their land.  These payments are provided for under the Vote for the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £4.1 million in the Abridged Estimates Volume is a 100 per <Col N="765" /> cent increase on the original 1988 provision and will finance the grant-aiding of over 6,500 hectares of private planting in 1989 and over 8,000 metres of private forest roads.  This level of expenditure in 1989 will generate £2.7 million in EC funding towards the grants.  It will also generate employment in forest establishment work and ensure the maintenance of jobs in private nurseries and forestry contracting companies.  The increased level of afforestation resulting from the 1989 allocation will lead in time to increased national output in the form of domestic timber production, with attendant economic and employment benefits.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that both the State and private sectors will be essential elements in the implementation of an accelerated forestry programme.  It is also clear that such a programme must receive substantial EC funding.  Forestry as an activity uniquely meets all the current major policy objectives of the EC in areas of regional and national development.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> committed this Government to a major drive to increase the level of EC funding for forestry.  I have to say that it is a source of disappointment to me that to date the EC does not provide direct grant assistance for State planting.  In saying this I wish to acknowledge the assistance by the EC for private planting, particularly under the western package.  As I have mentioned earlier, however, both the State and private sectors have a major role in achieving national planting targets. In the current adjustment of the EC structural funds, therefore, the Government are pressing very strongly that EC funding should be made available to the two sectors.  In their view any other approach by the EC would be discriminatory.</P>
    <P>The initiatives taken have already yielded substantial results.  Last January the Regional Development Fund committed £8.1 million for road construction in State forests &mdash; the first time that this fund has injected substantial resources in mainstream forestry activities.  Last November the European Investment bank approved loans totalling about £28 million for forestry projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Notwithstanding these substantial achievements, work continues with the objective of having forestry programmes in general, both State and private, accepted as activities which can receive funding from the structural funds.  Success in this area will transform the financing of Irish forestry programmes and allow continued expansion of the national forest estate while reducing the burden on the Irish Exchequer.  This objective is being rigorously pursued in the context of the ongoing discussions on the reform of the structural funds and in the context of the proposal for a strategy and action programme which Commissioner Andriessen has this month forwarded to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that progress is also being made in this area. The strategy for Forestry provides for substantial increases in the level of EC aid for forestry programmes.  In the medium term a 3.6 fold increase in the level of EC funds devoted to forestry between 1989 and 1993 is envisaged.  The Commission's strategy also recognises, for the first time, the role that public forestry can play in the development of this sector.  This is of immense importance to Ireland where State forestry has played such an important role, indeed the predominant role, in Irish forestry development.  While I am more than satisfied with the progress made to date in relation to the EC some problems remain.  Chief among these is the relative scarcity of funds proposed for forestry in the years to 1992.  These are not sufficient to meet the demands of expanded private and State forestry programmes.  In negotiations with the EC over the coming months I will be concentrating on pressing for increased aid from the Structural funds for forestry in these years.</P>
    <P>Forestry receipts are expected to reach £27.5 million in 1989 compared to a figure of £16 million in 1986.  The bulk of this revenue will derive from sales of sawlog to the sawmilling industry and of pulpwood to the two main pulpwood processors Medite and Finsa.  The highest ever volume of timber, at just under 1.5 million cubic metres, is expected to be sold in 1988 which represents an increase of 100,000 cubic metres on 1987.  This <Col N="767" /> record level of sales will be repeated in 1989.  The top grade sawmills are all achieving record throughputs and Irish timber dominates the domestic market and holds an estimated 60 per cent share, up 10 per cent on last year.</P>
    <P>As part of the Forest Service's objective of ensuring continuity of supply to the sawmill industry and to allow the industry to plan output and marketing strategies more effectively, a number of amendments to existing sales methods were introduced during the year, including the introduction of a quota scheme for small sawlog and the marketing of an additional 50,000 cubic metres of premium sawlog.</P>
    <P>A quota scheme for large sawlog was first introduced in 1981 with the objectives of improving industrial efficiency, achieving further added value, and contributing to import substitution in the construction sector.  The scheme was revised in 1986, placing greater emphasis on the standard of sawing, drying, grading and presentation of timber.</P>
    <P>Although the possibility of extending the scheme to sawmills with production lines concentrated around the use of small sawlog has been under consideration since 1984, it was only last year that supply constraints had eased sufficiently to allow the introduction of a pilot scheme.  A full scheme is in operation in 1988 and should help to further improve the image of Irish sawnwood.</P>
    <P>The time is ripe to develop a sectoral marketing strategy and to this end I have set up a task force on the marketing of timber and timber products.  The task force will be charged with developing greater expertise and a more aggressive approach in the marketing of timber and gaining new markets at home and abroad. The Irish Timber Council, the IDA and Coillte Teoranta are represented on the task force and will report to me on a regular basis.  I would like to stress that I have never been prepared to accept second best and there should be no doubt in anyone's mind but that quality products which meet the highest standards are the only ones which are acceptable to me. From the beginning of 1989 we will show <Col N="768" /> that we mean what we say and all structural softwood timbers &mdash; both Irish and imported &mdash; will have to meet the requirements set down in the EOLAS Standard Recommendation &mdash; SR 11/88.</P>
    <P>A number of studies are now in train which, when completed, will enable me to announce a strategy for the development of the timber industry to the year 2000.  This strategy will cover the pulpwood and sawmill sectors and will be the most comprehensive document ever produced for the timber industry.  In the meantime, I am pleased to announce that the IDA, following consultation with my Department and the Irish Timber Council, have adopted an interim strategy for the sawmill industry.  The strategy is aimed at encouraging investment in mills which have the capacity to process at least 25,000 cubic metres per annum, meet the highest standards and are export-oriented.</P>
    <P>The essential element of all these strategies is to ensure that the future development of the Irish timber sector is focused sharply on the needs of the Irish and international market places.  By putting the emphasis on market driven development and by using all the resources of the State, including the IDA and their company development programme, CTT and their Marketing Programmes, Eolas and their Technology Programmes, the Forest Service and their planting, silvicultural and marketing programmes, the industry as a whole can more easily prepare itself for the challenge and opportunities of 1992.</P>
    <P>This country is entering a new era of prosperity.  I intend to ensure that the timber industry prospers and &mdash; let me make it clear to everyone &mdash; I expect the State, through Coillte Teoranta, to share in that prosperity and to get a full return for the very substantial investment by the State in the past.</P>
    <P>In addition, other markets are also being exploited including the sales of transmission poles to the ESB and Telecom Éireann and for many years the Forest Service has been the principal supplier of Douglas fir and larch poles to these companies.  It is expected that Coillte Teoranta will continue in this role and obviate the need for these firms to import <Col N="769" /> poles.  Although the species currently used for pole production are minority species it is hoped that research currently being undertaken will identify additional suitable species for use as transmission pole material.</P>
    <P>The approaching Christmas season provides a timely reminder that the Forest Service have traditionally been the main supplier of Christmas trees to the home market.  Norway Spruce was the traditional species used in Irish homes but in the last few years the species has been relegated to third place in popularity behind Noble Fir and Lodgepole Pine.  In 1987 the first ever national auction of Christmas trees was held and was an outstanding success.  I intend to repeat the practice this year and expect that this will form part of the strategy for Christmas tree sales in future years.  In addition to the auction, the Forest Service will sell trees on a retail and wholesale basis throughout the country.  I expect such sales to realise £0.75 million in 1988 and for this to be increased in future years.</P>
    <P>Sales of decorative foliage have been a very minor element of the Forest Service's activities up to now and the vast bulk of the material has been exported in a raw state to the Continent.  The principal species has been Noble fir which is mainly used for the manufacture of Advent wreaths in Germany.  This year a number of customers prepared to manufacture the wreaths here have been identified and will export the finished product to Europe.  Apart from the additional revenue accruing to the Forest Service, this marketing success has provided extra jobs here and I hope it can be developed into a year round operation.</P>
    <P>The most exciting development this year will be the launching of Coillte Teoranta. The Bill setting up this company passed both Houses of the Oireachtas just before the summer recess.  I would like to acknowledge the many helpful contributions which were made from all sides during the passage of the Bill.  A deep interest in forestry was evident from these contributions.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume and 1989 Summary Capital Programme is another stage in the <Col N="770" /> metamorphosis taking place within the Forest Service as they prepare to exploit their full potential in the commercial arena.  The Abridged Estimates Volume, in so far as it relates to expenditure by the new company, Coillte Teoranta, includes only current expenditure.  Prior to the publication of the post-budget 1989 Revised Estimates volume, appropriate adjustments will be made to the existing subheads to provide a new grant-in-aid for Coillte Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The company's capital expenditure on their planting programme will be financed through non-voted Exchequer funding in the form of £15 million equity and from own resources.  The level of funding will enable the company to complete a 10,000 hectares planting programme in 1989 and to build up a land reserve in preparation for future planting.</P>
    <P>It has been a great pleasure and privilege for me to oversee the developments towards the establishment of Coillte Teoranta in what I certainly regard as one of the most significant years in the history of forestry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The principal State policy in regard to afforestation in Ireland has, up to quite recently, been to establish a million acres of forest.  That target has now been achieved. It has been achieved by the dedicated efforts of many many people down through the years whose expertise, professionalism and administration have contributed to the establishment of a great national resource which has generated many tens of thousands of jobs directly and indirectly in the forestry and timber industries in this country.  The availability of this resource now gives the country the opportunity to harvest the rewards of those efforts and the investments made over many years.</P>
    <P>While it was appropriate and indeed necessary that the development stage of forestry over the past 80 years should be carried out through direct State intervention, it is also appropriate that we move now to a new and commercial structrue to ensure that the rewards are harvested to the best advantage of the State. It was for that reason the Government decided to create a private company who would have the freedom and capacity to commercially exploit the forests and <Col N="771" /> would be given onerous targets to achieve in doing so.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it quite clear that I intend the company to have the fullest possible freedom to pursue those targets and that my role and the role of my Department will not be one of interference but one of support and co-operation. Equally, however, by monitoring their performance, I intend to ensure that they are achieving the targets which will be set for them.  The vast investments made by the taxpayers down through the years requires that I should do no less.</P>
    <P>The company will commence operations with a vast asset resource and a future production schedule which practically guarantees a cash break-even point within the next decade.  I will not be impressed, therefore, to know that in the next decade they have managed to achieve a cash break-even situation.  I will, however, be impressed to know that they have achieved it ahead of schedule through increased efficiency and effectiveness and that their balance sheet and profit and loss account reflect profitable operations.</P>
    <P>In essence the objective of the Government in establishing the new company is to ensure that State forestry will be run on a commercial basis and with optimum efficiency.  The new company will be expected to operate on the same lines and to the same criteria as a private company. The structure of the present organisation is, I believe, in need of examination to ensure that they have the best fit for the new commercial environment and to fully exploit the opportunities of the future.  It is probable that such an examination will lead to a streamlining of all or part of the present structure and a general reorientation of attitude and procedures toward cost-effective management and greater efficiency in operations.  I shall expect them to carry out such an examination as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the strains on the organisation and on the staff of the Forest Service at such a time of change. While there are problems, I believe there are also opportunities which they have shown in the past they are capable of grasping and utilising.  I would like to say <Col N="772" /> to them now that I, and I believe all people in this country, are proud of their many achievements, in pioneering and developing a vast forest asset.  No less than in the early days of forestry in Ireland, I believe it is again a time of opportunity and I have every confidence in their capacity to fashion a new and successful organisation to take forestry into the next phase of its development.</P>
    <P>The vesting day for the company will be 1 January 1989, and all necessary preparations are being undertaken at present to facilitate a smooth transfer of operations to Coillte Teoranta on that date.  I look forward to the appointment of the board and the Chief Executive of the company in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  These are exciting times for Irish forestry, both in the State and private areas.  I think we can look forward with great confidence to maintaining the impetus which has recently been generated.  Forestry is a priceless national asset.  It is up to us to realise the potential of that asset, both for our sake and for the benefit of future generations.</P>
      <P>There may be cynics who would question our aspirations for forestry.  Let me say to them that cynicism never created one extra job or exploited one commercial opportunity.  Cynicism can do much but it can never put a permanent brake on the development of new and creative ideas.  Cynicism represents the byways of the past.  The new ideas represent the highways of the future through which the implementation of development measures, of which forestry is an integral part, will help to put this country on the road to success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not the worst of them.  Detailed analysis of <Col N="773" /> the Book of Estimates has already demonstrated clearly that the cutting edge of the Government on public expenditure has been severely blunted.  It is clear that many of the alleged cuts are phony, and many savings have been achieved by way of figure juggling or additional taxation. It is also clear that job creation has a very low priority with this Government and that the poor and unemployed can expect no relief while this Government last.  Last year the Central Bank funded voluntary retirement scheme was off balance sheet. This year it is included.  Why?  A lower draw down in 1989 is classified as a saving. That seems to be the only reason for the change and it is now classified as a cut in expenditure.  Again, we have in other areas semi-State borrowing instead of the Exchequer.  Are these real cuts or mere figure juggling?  I suggest they fall into the latter category.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of additional taxation, we have quite a number of examples and I will mention just a few. The cut in the rate support grant will inevitably lead to increased local charges, so also will the cut in the allocation for school transport.  They are just a few of many examples in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most obnoxious impact of this approach is in the area of social welfare where increased payroll taxes will inevitably damage our job creation prospects.  The words of the Minister for Finance earlier today ring hollow when this saving is examined.  He stated during his speech: &ldquo;Make no mistake, the Government regard unemployment as their No. 1 priority.&rdquo; It is pure nonsense to proclaim that as a central Government objective there is the objective of reducing unemployment while at the same time imposing additional taxation on employment. The payroll taxes cannot be considered in any other light.  I suggest that it is clearly timed to genuinely establish job creation as our number one social objective.  We should not just pay lip service to it but take the necessary radical measures to reform and gear our tax and social welfare system towards that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I turn to the Estimate on Social Welfare let me refer to the continued <Col N="774" /> decimation of the capital budget.  I accept it is a soft target, but it has been continually trimmed over the past number of years.  The capital budget is the main State vehicle for the encouragement of job creation.  How then can a Government genuinely committed to job creation follow the line of approach which it has followed in these Estimates?  The Estimates purport to establish £118 million in current expenditure cuts.  Let me say straight away that I accept that we will make no real progress on either the economic or social front until we restore national solvency, but within the overall figures I have to question the focus on social welfare.  Effectively what has happened is that there has been a cut in social welfare of £88.5 million.  Consider that in the context of the total figure of alleged cuts or savings on the current budget side. Effectively that amounts to 75 per cent of the total figure of £118 million by way of reductions on the current side which is achieved by a combination of reduced expenditure and increased payroll and other taxes.  I would have to seriously question the commitment of this Government to the poor and the under-privileged and in particular to the unemployed when there is such an enormous focus of attention on the Department who have a particular responsibility for looking after people in that area.  Essentially 75 per cent of the overall savings are focused on that Department.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the question of the increased payroll taxes.  Nobody will deny the impact of these increases on employment and on job creation.  Perhaps it is significant that the Minister for Social Welfare in his statement on the day the Estimates were published, evaded the point.  It is now clear that obfuscation is becoming the hallmark of this Government. He issued a two page script and he referred to the reason for the lower Estimate for his Department.  He referred to the significant reduction in the numbers claiming unemployment but did not, of course, mention the thousands who are emigrating.  He did refer to the fact that there was to be a reduction and referred to other aspects which would bring about the savings within his Department, including the additional taxation <Col N="775" /> that would accrue from the fact that there was an increase in the PRSI for the self employed and that it would apply for the full year.  Surprisingly he did not refer at all to the proposed increases in payroll taxes.  It is only really by a process of leaking or questioning by the media that it has since been elicited that it is proposed to increase PRSI limits for the employee by £500 and that there is to be a dramatic increase in the employer RSI limit to £20,000.  Surely the Minister must have been aware of the impact that would have on employment.  I presume that is the reason he did not refer to it in his statement.  It is certainly attempting to evade the issue not to even touch on that aspect in his statement on the day the Estimates were published.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a contradiction between what the Minister for Finance had to say today and the actions he is pursuing.  We on this side of the House quite justly and legitimately criticised that approach because we believe in job creation.  We are also prepared to propose the necessary measures which will encourage job creation be they in the tax or the social welfare area.  In the social welfare area it is quite clear that the employer contribution as it is based at present is a significant disincentive for firms to take on additional employees. That is why we in Fine Gael are advocating the adoption of a new approach to employer RSI contributions.  We believe that such contributions should be based on turnover and not collected as they are at present.  If our approach is adopted we will see a shift of the burden from labour intensive to capital intensive industries. We will also see a reduction in the cost of employing additional people and, of course, there will be an incidental benefit of a greater contribution from the multinational sector.  That approach is in stark contrast to the approach adopted by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Again in relation to RSI for the employee we believe that for low paid workers, and indeed to encourage more people to take the jump from social welfare into employment, that the first £3,000 of RSI for the employee should be abolished.  One might ask how it will <Col N="776" /> be paid for.  Our first proposal is self financing because one would charge an amount on turnover which will bring in about £600 million that at present comes in from employer RSI.  In relation to the second proposal I would be prepared to accept the removal of the upper income limit.  An alternative strategy would be to totally integrate the employee RSI with the tax system as essentially it is a tax on employees, but we have seen no new approach, no creative thinking.  The only reaction from this Government is to increase the take first from the employee but to an enormous degree from the employer.  How can we expect employers to take on extra people when that is the attitude of this Government?</P>
    <P>I will not have time to go into the Estimate in detail but it is relevant to refer to the figure for the family income supplement.  The figure last year was £5,300,000; it is exactly the same for 1989.  I see the family income supplement as a bridge between those on social welfare and those in low paid employment. It is clear from recent reports, particularly the combat poverty report based on the ESRI survey and the documents of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors that there has been a very low uptake of this supplement, not more than 50 per cent.  If there is a belief that the family income supplement is an encouragement to cross the bridge from being on social welfare to taking up a job it is clear that a number of issues have to be tackled.  The first is the low uptake.  There must be an analysis of the reasons for that low uptake and an effort must be made to ensure that there is a much fuller uptake.  Again, it is clear from the Estimates that there is no such intention on the part of this Administration.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it is very obvious that it will be necessary to improve the workings of the family income supplement.  The report of the Combat Poverty Agency recommended the improving of the workings of the FIS through such measures as removing the limit on the maximum payment and calculating the payments on net rather than gross income.  They also recommended the provision of better information about this scheme.  While the Government may not <Col N="777" /> totally accept those proposals what they must accept is that there are problems with that scheme.  There are problems in regard to the way it is being operated, there are problems in regard to low uptake but the Government are evading this issue.  It is an important instrument which could be used in job creation.</P>
    <P>In relation to supplementary welfare the same Combat Poverty Agency report referred to the very significant fact that even with the low level of payment, about £37.80 for a single person and £63 for a married couple, one person in ten falls below the supplementary welfare income level.  They are the poorest of the poor. Why is this?  A number of reasons have been put forward.  What are the Government doing about it?  Surely, if we have any interest in helping the weakest in our society, be they the handicapped, the old or the underprivileged or whatever those marvellous noticeboards used to say a couple of years ago before the last election, our attention must be focused on those on the bottom rung of the ladder, in fact on those below the bottom rung of the ladder.  There is no indication in these Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are many other things that I would like to say in regard to this Estimate tonight but I had not realised that I had run out of time.  In general I believe that the Government have lost their sense of direction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I will use that time to highlight a couple of other aspects.  I <Col N="778" /> was referring to supplementary welfare. It seems that there has been a change on the part of the Government in this regard.  No effort has been made to reach the poorest of the poor.  This particular system is used to help the long term unemployed and others with their ESB bills and other difficulties and it would appear that pressure is now being applied to reduce the level of those relieving payments.</P>
      <P>When talking about the social welfare system we are talking about a highly complex system.  We also need to focus on the administration costs of that system which are very high indeed.  Part of the reason for this is the complexity of the system.  The system needs to be simplified and apart from the benefits of this to recipients it would also result in considerably reduced administration costs.  It is difficult to ascertain what exactly the administration costs are because according to the Book of Estimates the provision for salaries, wages and allowances amounts to £48.5 million with other administration costs bringing that figure up to about £80 million.  Of course what is not referred to is that there are also substantial administration costs in the operation of the Social Insurance Fund. We have no figure for this in the current Estimate.  Last year these costs amounted to £67 million.  There were also administration costs in respect of the operation of the occupational injuries fund which last year amounted to £3 million.  If we add all of these figures together we are talking about a very substantial figure indeed.  What is needed is a simplification of the system which would involve the Government in putting some creative thinking into the development of the system.  That is absent at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped to refer to the anomalies which are emerging in the new fuel scheme.  It is quite clear that new anomalies are emerging and these include the exclusion of many women on low maintenance payments, the exclusion of those on low occupational pensions, the exclusion of those on social security pensions from other countries and, worst of all, it involves the exclusion of hardship cases which were dealt with by the health boards in the past and which are now <Col N="779" /> largely eliminated from the scheme. Worse than that, it is almost impossible to obtain information on the scheme.  I tried but failed to obtain details of the circular outlining how the scheme is to be administered.  I believe one is in existence and it is outrageous that the spokesman on social welfare for the main Opposition party is unable, despite requests, to obtain that information.  I can assure the Minister that I will be pursuing this matter further.</P>
    <P>Finally, I submit that the Government have lost their sense of direction.  It is very clear what their main objectives should be, ones which we can all subscribe to.  We all agree on the need to expand employment, the need to stimulate economic growth, the need to eliminate deprivation in our society and the need to remove inequities from our economic and social system.  This Book of Estimates will do nothing whatsoever to achieve those objectives.  In conclusion, while being prepared to note the Estimates which are but one half of the balance sheet I reserve judgment on the Government pending sight of the budget figures.  Obviously, we will need a full debate on each Estimate, as amended, as soon as possible after the 1989 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to this debate but before going on to make my main points I do not think I can let this opportunity pass without referring to some of the comments made by Deputy O'Keeffe.  It was laughable to hear some of his comments and those of some of the speakers from the Opposition parties in relation to these Estimates.  There is no doubt that one cannot please everyone. Both Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have said that we have not cut enough and the parties on the so called Left have said that we have cut far too much.  It makes me wonder how the Coalition partners ever got together when we see the stances they have now adopted.  Over four and a half years they literally brought the country to its knees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier Deputy O'Keeffe, referring to the unemployment problem, said there was no commitment on the part of this <Col N="780" /> Government to tackle this area.  These are all questions which I am sure the Minister for Social Welfare will be answering but I should point out that in the last budget there were substantial increases for the unemployed in the Social Welfare Estimate.  There was an increase of 11 per cent in unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to national solvency but he should remember that during the four and a half years the Coalition Government were in power the national debt increased from £12 billion to £24 billion.  On coming into power this Government stopped that rate of increase and it was only through the good offices of the Government over the last 18 months that this was done.  I do not accept that there is no commitment on the part of the Government to job creation and the recent published figures have proved beyond all doubt that we have turned the corner for the first time in years.  Therefore, it was nonsensical to suggest that there is no commitment on the part of the Government to job creation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe also referred to the Estimate for the Department of the Environment and said that there would be increased local charges.  In my own county we had our first meeting last Monday in regard to the Estimates.  For the first time since I have been on the council we completed our estimates in one meeting.  Last year it took nine meetings and the year before eight meetings. The fact is county councils are turning the corner.  We did not have to increase our charges as a result of decisions made by this Government over the past 18 months &mdash; taking over the charges for ACOT, drainage and the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Estimates before the Dáil so quickly for the second consecutive year.  This runs counter to the dithering of the Coalition in their four years in office.  I understand the last Estimates brought before the Dáil by the Coalition were introduced at the very last minute.  I believe one of the reasons the country was going to the wall was the uncertainty in our economy.</P>
    <P>Before Fianna Fáil came to power we <Col N="781" /> were laughed at when we said we would bring back confidence into the economy. This we have done and the figures speak for themselves.  We have the best trade figures in the EC.  We have an export boom.  We have a dramatic fall in interest rates, 6 per cent.  We hear a lot about the need for tax relief, but a decrease of 6 per cent in interest rates is the best tax relief we can give anybody.  Anyone with a mortgage will admit that their repayments have dropped drastically in the last 18 months.  That is the result of the good policies implemented by this Government, and this has also had a dramatic effect on county council estimates.</P>
    <P>Another phenomenon we had in the bad old days of the Coalition was the black hole.  There is no such thing any more.  Money is flowing into the country, not out as happened in the days of the Coalition.  Inflation is down and that is the best indicator of progress in our economy. There is no doubt that this country has turned the corner and in the next few years we will see even better times.  We have one of the best growth figures in the EC.  Increased tax receipts is another indicator that economic activity has turned the corner.</P>
    <P>I often say the Government can only create a climate within which business will grow, and there is no doubt this Government have done that in the past 18 months.  The tax amnesty was tried before.  I would like to know from the Deputies opposite why it did not work under the Coalition.  Was there no commitment to it then?  There certainly is a commitment to it now.  This move has been a tremendous success.  This raises the question: is there more money out there?  In my view, we should carry out an analysis into that £500 million collected because I know people who borrowed before the deadline to pay the money they owed.  Will these people be in financial difficulties in the coming years?  I hope not.  However, this is something that will have to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to suggest that the Revenue Commissioners adopt a commonsense approach to the tax amnesty.  I have spoken to a number of people who feared that people who hastily submitted documentation before <Col N="782" /> 30 September may be told when the documents have been checked that there is something wrong.  I ask that the Revenue Commissioners adopt a commonsense approach to this.  I saw with some disquiet that an official of the Revenue Commissioners was suspended recently for writing off £5,000 or thereabouts for a hardship case.  Again, I ask that the commissioners take a commonsense approach to cases like this.</P>
    <P>As regards the £500 million, the Minister and most people would agree that this is a once-off payment and does not greatly affect our national debt, but we must have a balance between a tax reduction and increased social welfare payments.  Most Deputies would agree there is a need to increase social welfare payments.  One area the Minister could look at in the forthcoming budget is capital taxation because in my view there is a great deal of scope in this area and this might offset income tax or indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>Another area close to my heart and which has caused a lot of disquiet around the country is the sheriffs and the way they operate.  The figures issued recently showed different levels of collection from county to county.  This should be looked at.  Some sheriffs have adopted what I can only regard as bully boy tactics.  Most Deputies will have come across instances where sheriffs have used tactics which should never have been allowed.  There is a point I wish to put to my friends on the Opposition benches.  I question the appointment of these sheriffs.  I did not see any advertisement for the appointment. I wonder if this smacks of jobs for the boys, because it is very interesting to note that all these people were appointed in the last throes of the Coalition's period in office.  There should be a proper control in sheriffs because I have come across very disquieting cases showing the attitude they adopted to various defaulters. People who owe taxes should pay them, but I believe some of the tactics in certain cases are questionable.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government for introducing self-assessment which is long overdue.  Most parties agree with it.  The previous Government said they would introduce it some time in the future. However, self-assessment may have been <Col N="783" /> dovetailed too quickly into the tax amnesty deadline.  A number of people have been hard pressed to make the payments due before the deadline for the tax amnesty and in a few months they will have to find more money to pay under the self-assessment system.  This, too, should be looked at.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare, there is no doubt the budget has been reduced but it has been reduced as a result of good management.  It is amazing &mdash; and nobody on the Opposition benches has queried this &mdash; the amount that has been saved as a result of good management and a tightening up of the procedures in the social welfare system.  Despite what Deputy O'Keeffe said, all the rates have increased over the past 18 months, and some of them have increased substantially.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Social Welfare in the run-up to the budget to look at two areas, that is, the payment to single parent families and to married couples with large families.  Their payments in recent times have slipped back in comparison with other payments.  The Minister for Social Welfare should be given credit for holding the Christmas bonus at the previous rate.  I welcome the announcement that the alleviating payments will be retained.  I am sure most Members welcome those decisions and they should give credit to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government for them.  I note in the Estimate for Social Welfare that the amount allocated for office premises has been increased substantially, by almost 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Birmingham gave notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the circular issued by the Minister for Education in relation to the repeat year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank the Chair for giving <Col N="784" /> me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Very shortly after the Dáil went into recess last summer the Minister and her Department issued Circular M8/88.  It was an interesting document and not the least interesting because of the obligation imposed on the recipients to acknowledge receipt by returning an enclosed slip provided for that purpose. I gather that was the first occasion when that obligation was placed on anybody and it indicates the response the Minister and the Department expected from the circular.</P>
      <P>The circular in question is a shabby, tawdry, dishonourable document.  It is destined to go down alongside Circular 20/87 as one of the documents of this era and it shows a scant disregard for the academically weak and for those who are disadvantaged or deprived.  The circular comes from the same stable that produced the proposals for increased primary school classes and from the same stable that proposed a particular attack on that section of the educational system that historically has been charged with responding to the needs of the disadvantaged, the vocational sector.</P>
      <P>The circular deals with the vexed question of the number of years a student must spend at second level education. Clearly, there is room for much discussion and debate on it and I have no doubt that some aspects of it will arise at Question Time in the future.  However, I have sought leave to raise one provision of this circular tonight, that dealing with the question of pupils repeating a year. Paragraph 7, the offending paragraph, states:</P>
      <P>No pupil may repeat any year of the post-primary course &mdash; save as provided for in paragraph 8 &mdash; whether in the same school or in any other school, except with the prior approval of the Department.  Approval will only be given in exceptional cases such as prolonged absence due to ill-health or change of school necessitated by change of domicile.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 8 deals with those who want to repeat the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the circular was issued there was immediate criticism from educational <Col N="785" /> interests.  To those criticisms the Minister has not responded.  She has made no effort to date to explain what the basis of the circular is, what its justification is either in educational or financial terms.  I should like to know what basis she says this circular has in any kind of educational philosophy.  How is it to be defended?  I should like to know what kind of apparent savings, she claims she is going to make.  I should like to know if the Minister took any advice as to whether her actions were constitutional because at first sight it seems to me that her actions were in flagrant violation of Article 42 of the Constitution.  That Article clearly establishes that the primary role in education is that of the parent but in this instance the Minister has seen fit to ride roughshod over the rights and views of the parents and the teachers.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what is involved.  What we are talking about is a youngster, perhaps 13 or 14 years of age, who is weak and is not keeping up with the class.  In the view of the parent, the teacher, and the school principal, the proper and appropriate course of action is that that child should repeat the year.  The Minister takes the view that that is not an educational judgement to be made by the parent, the teacher or the principal but that it is a matter for her and her Department. She is deciding that she is going to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the academically weak unless they can bring themselves within one of the exceptional qualifications about illness or change of domicile.</P>
    <P>What is the justification for that kind of unparalleled intervention?  I know of no other area of the educational system where any Minister has ever believed that they have a right to intervene in this type of very individual decision of parent, teacher and principal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What is interesting about this circular is the difference in language between it and previous circulars. Of course it is the case that Ministers for Education have to be concerned at a time when there is emphasis on <Col N="786" /> pupil/teacher ratio, at a time when resources are limited on how many pupils there are going to be within the school system at any given time because that will determine how much they will have to spend.  However, on every previous occasion when this has been addressed it has been done on the basis that the interests of the weak pupil have to be considered and on the basis that the people to make that judgment are the parents and the teachers who best know the pupil.  What does the Minister, or the Department of Education, know about whether the interests of a 13-year old who has the reading age of an 11-year old are served by waiting another year or not? How can the Minister or any official of the Department form a judgment on that?  Should the judgment not be formed by the person who knows best, the teacher, who is with that child in the classroom day after day each week?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister what savings she believed would be achieved by this and qualified that by asking what apparent savings will be achieved because, in fact, this represents rank bad value for money. What is involved is that the unfortunate people who, despite the considered opinions of the parents and the teachers, will be kept on the conveyor belt and shuffled through the system.  That will be despite the judgment of those who know the pupil best that he or she is not in a position to pass on and needs another year.  Such children are to be kept moving through the system and we know what that means.  It means that the moneys that will be expended on that pupil during the remainder of the period they spend in the classrooms will be wasted because they will not be achieving anything.  We know that this is likely to mean an increase in the number of youngsters who are not capable of keeping up.  As a result some of them are going to be troublesome, there will be more discipline problems and the quality of education for everybody else in that classroom will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an educational system which pays lip-service to the principles of equality of opportunity and that is all it does. The schools in the State sector are squeezed and their subject options are cut.  At <Col N="787" /> a time when we are all talking about languages and the importance of encouraging children to take on extra continental languages, a flagship community school in north Dublin which in the past was able to offer German, Italian and other languages now finds it must return to French only.  Higher education continues to be all but closed to children from working class backgrounds.  This circular represents further movement in the direction of entrenching privilege and a further blow to those who are already disadvantaged, either because of their social background or because they are just academically below the average of the class in which they happen to find themselves.  The circular is unjust and unwarranted.  It has aroused ire throughout the educational world.  Because it represents a tax on individuals, we have not seen the kind of mass protests on this occasion that have greeted other decisions of the Minister, but this circular is unwarranted, oppressive and, very likely, unconstitutional.  I suspect that one of the reasons we have not heard more about it is that, to my certain knowledge, quite a number of schools have decided that they are simply going to ignore it.  They have taken the view &mdash; I have no idea whether they are right about this &mdash; that the Department are quite incapable of finding out whether, if a pupil does repeat the year, he will not be caught out.  It may well be that the Department are in a position to exact revenge and will do so when it comes to calculating the capitation grants or whatever. Nowhere in the educational world would anyone, on educational grounds, defend a decision that people are to be channelled through the system, kept on the conveyor belt, put into a classroom for which they are not, in the view of their teachers, equipped and that this should continue.  I want to know from the Minister from where did this emanate. What was the thinking behind it and what possible justification for it can she put forward now?</P>

      <P>First, I wish to thank Deputy George Birmingham, the Opposition <Col N="788" /> spokesperson on Education, for bringing this matter to the Dáil tonight.  I congratulate him on his appointment to the Opposition Front Bench and wish him many years of opposition spokes-personship, perhaps not always in the education portfolio but in many other portfolios as well.  I am very glad that we have got together at last.  On previous occasions mishaps have kept him from me but I hope that will not be the future role we will adopt.</P>
      <P>Before I go into my formal reply to the Deputy, I want to say that I find it offensive that he talked about me in stable terms, whether I be a woman or a man.  He mentioned that this circular comes from a similar stable.  It is not the first occasion this has happened.  I was in the role he is in now and he was Minister of State when I had occasion to say to him that I objected to being harnessed with somebody else.  He knows to what I refer.  I object very strongly to the terminology the Deputy has used tonight. He has a propensity for doing so.  I want to put that on the record.</P>

In so far as the senior cycle is concerned practices that result in a <i>de facto</i> three year leaving certificate course will not be accepted in my Department, with no caveats and no let out&rdquo;.  The genesis of my circular to which the Deputy referred is Circular M85/85, signed by the then Secretary of the Department under the aegis of the then Minister for Education, we want to get that quite clear.  The Deputy then went on to ask if anybody knew what I had done.  I want to list the various bodies with whom I met after the issue of this circular.</P>

      <P>Do not be quite silly. The Deputy knows you do not meet with people before you do things.  I met with the JMB, the parents, the IVEA, community and comprehensive schools and the various unions.  The last meeting took place one month ago.  I have had seven meetings on the issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's further dissertation on his reading of my circular, he has left out a very important point. Paragraph 7 of the circular states that approval will only be given in exceptional cases such as prolonged absence &mdash; the Deputy has quite deliberately not focused on &ldquo;such as&rdquo; and all the other reasons, for granting exemptions.  I take very seriously the element of confidentiality imposed on me by principals and I do not intend to laud here tonight the reasons we have granted exemptions.  Many of them are peculiarly personal, private, social reasons which have been given to me in confidence and I do not intend to bandy them across the Floor of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to begin by rebutting the <Col N="790" /> view being peddled here this evening that my Department's Circular M8/88 is in any way different from the circular of 1985 or is a draconian measure devised by a heartless Government to discommode all and sundry.  I propose moreover to eschew the hyperbole resorted to by Deputy Birmingham and to place this matter in its proper perspective.  I would remind the Deputy and the House that an earlier Circular M85/85 which was issued by Deputy Gemma Hussey, prohibited pupils from repeating a year. In so far as the present arrangements are concerned there are clearly defined procedures and guidelines in operation in my Department which ensure equitable treatment.  They allow for approval of a repeat year in a number of circumstances, for example, continuous absence from school, change of school, serious illness, death of parent or serious family trauma, none of which I would put into a circular because they are far too private.  Other instances would be in the case of change of subject or of very poor academic progress.</P>
    <P>To underline how fair this approach is I would like to cite statistics for the Deputy.  In the 1987-88 school year my Department received 449 applications and approved 334, over 74 per cent.  In the present school year my Department have considered 700 applications and approved 77 per cent.  Other applications are receiving consideration but I have no reason to believe that the level of approval in these cases will show any significant divergence from the current approval rate &mdash; 77 per cent to 80 per cent.  Those figures should demonstrate that the restrictions on repeat years are not draconian.  I have looked back on records and I realise that they are far more liberal than those in the years to which the Deputy does not wish to refer and they are being effected with understanding and compassion.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take the opportunity of dispelling any misunderstanding there might be in relation to repeating the leaving certificate.  Pupils, and indeed Young Fine Gael, were very quick to ride on the misery, as they thought, of students receiving their leaving certificates on the day they were issued, by <Col N="791" /> making statements which were competely untrue.  Students can repeat the final leaving certificate year on a payment of a course fee of £100, the exact same as last year, and an exam fee of £100.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Pupils whose parents are holders of medical cards are exempted from payment of the course fee and are required to pay the normal leaving certificate fee.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two other points.  The Deputy talked about the vocational education sector and how they were being penalised unduly.  I wish to remind the Deputy that it was an amendment by his party spokesperson on education &mdash; by consensus it was agreed to by me and by our party &mdash; which sought to ameliorate the current situation with regard to vocational schools.  That amendment was adopted and implemented by the previous Government, so to talk of it now as unfeeling and uncaring is rather odd. The Deputy referred to remedial pupils. I have made complete arrangements, particularly in vocational schools where they have a remedial class, that that class receive complete exemption which was not allowed for previously.  Now they will be allowed the facility to repeat a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> Let me repeat, a Cheann Comhairle, as the Deputy may now know, that the date of the census return for all schools is 30 September and all schools know this.  The Deputy said that nobody seems to know whether they can include names in the census but from time immemorial 30 September has been the census date for schools.  This is not something I invented; it has been there since we started the census.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat, 400 pupils applied last year to repeat a year and 74 per cent were allowed.  Some 700 pupils applied this year and 77 per cent were allowed.  Provision has been made for remedial pupils. Special social cases which are submitted in confidence by the school principal are treated with great compassion and with great flexibility and I have involved myself in that process.  There is much greater flexibility and compassion being exercised now with regard to repeat years than was the case with the issue of Circular 85/85, which came not from a stable but from the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>To explain the background to the designation of ports let me clarify the objectives for the Celtic Sea herring fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary objective is to establish a regime of management which can protect the livelihood of fishermen from overfishing and consequent collapse of the <Col N="552" /> stock.  This happened in the recent past and led to the closure of the fishery for a number of years.</P>
    <P>My secondary objective is to ensure that with available quotas the fishery is conducted in a fashion that maximises the amount and duration of sustainable income and employment in fishing and fish processing.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that my Department met representatives of fishing organisations in early September in an effort to agree a regime for management of the Celtic Sea herring.</P>
    <P>Designating ports of landing is, as I have explained an integral part of effective management regimes.  Unfortunately the different interests representing the industry could not agree on the ports which should be designated.  I thus chose four ports &mdash; Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Cobh and Baltimore to cover those areas for which the fishery was open between 16 and 30 October.</P>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible to designate more ports on the south coast, but this would make management considerably less effective, and the future of fishing interests considerably less secure. I have no plans at this stage to approve landings of Celtic Sea herring in Schull between now and Christmas.  This is in line with the general trend where the herring stocks move eastwards and fishing during December/January is concentrated off Dunmore East and possibly Cobh.  My Department would be happy to examine any agreed alternative ports to those designated on the south coast that may be suggested and agreed by representative industry groups.</P>

    <P>Within the constraints imposed by the Common Fisheries Policy, I am satisfied that this quota, which was agreed after protracted and difficult negotiations at the Council of Ministers last December, provides for the continuing development of the Irish fishing industry.

However officials from my Department have raised my concerns with the Commission and have participated to the fullest extent possible in the deliberations of the various scientific bodies, whose advice will form the basis of the 1989 proposals.  Within the need for conservation of stocks, the development of the industry is being addressed through strengthened management procedures developed in consultation with the industry.

      <P>Gross expenditure by the fisheries boards in 1987 amounted to £6,186,000.  The Exchequer grant amounted to £4,762,000 and the balance was funded by the boards' own resources.  These resources included revenue from licence sales, fishery rates, payment in respect of services provided by the boards and voluntary contributions.</P>
      <P>In many instances, those who made donations specified that the money should be used for specific purposes in specified areas.  These purposes mainly related to pollution control and protection.</P>
      <P>Those groups who made voluntary donations are to be commended and, indeed, their assistance was particularly beneficial to the boards.  These receipts however, while extremely valuable and to be encouraged would form only a tiny proportion of the resources available to the boards in the pursuit of their statutory functions.</P>

So, out of almost a quarter million pounds, which amounted to 43 per cent of money spent on development fieldwork in the western region for the year, less than 1.75 per cent came from clubs and less than one tenth of 1 per cent from anglers' registration fees in 1987.</P>

      <P>I would not be aware in my capacity as Minister for the Marine of submarine movements in the Irish Sea and the continental shelf.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that when a fishing vessel sinks for no apparent reason speculation will take place about the cause.  In recent years it has been suggested that there was submarine involvement in some cases.</P>
      <P>I have ordered preliminary inquiries under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, into a number of sinkings of small fishing vessels which have been described as unaccountable in newspaper reports.  Fishing boats may sink for a large number of reasons such, for example, as instructural defects, human error, unfavourable weather conditions, and the purpose of section 465 is to have a mechanism for establishing the cause.</P>
      <P>The statutory purpose of preliminary inquiries is to enable the circumstances of a shipping casualty to be established and to determine whether the circumstances are such as to warrant the holding of a formal investigation under section 466 of the Act.  The reports of preliminary inquiries are confidential to the Minister and it is long-established practice not to publish such reports.</P>

This publication involved no revisions to the official estimates for previous years.</P>
      <P>The labour force estimates for the years 1983 to 1988 are shown in the table as follows:</P>

    <P>The figures include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in 1987-88 and to earlier accounting periods in so far as such relief was allowed during 1987-88.</P>
    <P>(³)Manufacturing profits</P>
    <P>This figure represents the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at normal rates.</P>
    <P>(4)&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</P>
    <P>This figure includes preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The £94.8 million is a gross figure and does not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £14.4 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>(5)Urban renewal</P>
    <P>Relief from income tax and corporation tax was introduced under Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1986 to promote urban renewal and development in certain areas.</P>
    <P>No account is taken of the fact that without these incentives many of the enterprises involved might not have been set up in this country.  To the extent that the profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes <Col N="562" /> part of each cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of revenue which would be foregone if the top rate of income tax was reduced from 58 per cent to 50 per cent and the amount of revenue which has been foregone since the reduction of the top rate of income tax of 77 per cent in 1977, of 65 per cent in 1983 and since the reduction of the top rate of tax from 60 per cent to 58 per cent in 1986-1987.</P>

      <P>The full year cost, estimated by reference to the 1989-90 tax year, of a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 58 per cent to 50 per cent is estimated at £75.2 million.</P>
      <P>The relevant statistics relating to the cost in terms of tax foregone of the reductions in the top rates of tax from 77 per cent, 65 per cent and 60 per cent are available only in respect of the income tax year ended 5 April 1981 and subsequent years.  The following table sets out tentative estimates of the revenue which would have accrued to the Exchequer if a 77 per cent rate had been applied as the top income tax rate for each year instead of the actual top rate in force for that year.  It should be noted, however, that there were substantial changes, for example in the number and size of tax bands, over the period in question which were taken into account in deciding the top rate of tax to apply in those years and which influence the estimated yield from substituting a top rate of 77 per cent in those years.  In addition, the figures in the table are compiled on the basis that application of a 77 per cent rate would not have altered the behaviour of taxpayers subject to it; this assumption is unlikely to be realistic.</P>

    <P>The administrative arrangements which have been adopted for the preparation and co-ordination of the subregional plans are as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  A Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries, chaired by the Taoiseach, will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of new Structural Fund arrangements.</P>
    <P>(2)  A working group representative of the relevant Government Departments, assisted as appropriate by the relevant State bodies, together with the management of all county councils and county borough corporations, in the sub-region and the EC Commission will be responsible for the preparation of the operational <Col N="565" /> programme for each of the sub-regions.</P>
    <P>(3)  Each working group will prepare their operational programme in close liaison with a separate advisory group for the sub-region which will be composed of all the main representative bodies with an interest in development &mdash; CII, CIF, chambers of commerce (one to represent all in the sub-region), ICTU, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme &mdash; as well as the county councils, county borough corporations, borough corporations and urban district councils over 15,000 population in the sub-region which will be represented by their chairmen in each case.  (In the Dublin sub-region, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce is represented on the working group.)  These advisory groups will accept submissions from interested persons and groups and, on the basis of such submissions and their own thinking, will make recommendations to the working group on the content of the programmes.</P>
    <P>Final responsibility for the content of these programmes will rest with the Government in order to ensure consistency between them.  There will be scope for feedback from the sub-national programmes to the plan and the national programmes and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>The chairpersons and secretariat of the working groups are being provided by my Department as will the secretariat of the advisory groups.  It is expected, however, that the advisory groups will select their own chairpersons.</P>
    <P>It is not the convention to name officials in the House and, accordingly, I do not propose to give the names of members of the working groups.  Nominations are still awaited from most of the bodies represented on the advisory groups.</P>
    <P>The timetable envisaged by me is that the national development plan will be submitted to the Commission as early as possible in 1989 and by 31 March 1989 at the latest &mdash; which is the date specified in the relevant regulation.  The EC Commission will complete the Community <Col N="566" /> Support Framework (which will set out the extent to which the Commission is willing to provide assistance from Structural Funds in respect of the national development plan) within six months of receipt of the plan, though it is to be hoped that less time will be needed.  It is hoped that the operational programmes can be submitted at the same time as, or as soon as possible after, the plan.</P>

      <P>Under the Animals Act, 1985 a member of the Garda Síochána or any local authority may impound any animal found wandering on a public road or in any public place.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are aware of the problem posed by wandering horses in the areas referred to by the Deputy and that, having regard to the many other demands on their services, the Garda are taking all practicable steps to bring about an improvement in the situation.  I am informed that so far this year there have been over 1,000 impoundings of horses found wandering in the Garda divisions which cover the areas concerned and that resources will continue to be deployed to deal with the problem in these areas.</P>
      <P>Statistics relating to the number of horses impounded since 20 September 1985 when the provisions of the Animals Act, 1985, came into force are not readily available.  The Garda Síochána are currently compiling these statistics and I will communicate them to the Deputy when they come to hand.</P>

    <P>The establishment of additional pounds is a matter for the local authority concerned.  I understand that Dublin County Council provided a new pound at Boherboy, Saggart, last year and that the <Col N="571" /> question of providing a further pound in their area has been raised with the council by the county registrar.</P>
    <P>Pound fees are based on the cost of keeping animals in pounds and are revised from time to time to take account of increasing costs.  If a deterrent or punitive element were to be added to these fees, amending legislation would be required.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at present for any amendment of those aspects of the legislation relating to animals for which I have responsibility.</P>

Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.

      <P>Persons who have previously <Col N="584" /> been employed in insurable employment may, in general, preserve their entitlements to pension by becoming voluntary contributors.  Those who do not avail of this option and who are available for and genuinely seeking work may preserve their entitlements by signing the register of the unemployed for credited contributions.</P>
      <P>Whilst the basic requirement has always been that all persons signing for credited contributions should prove unemployment each week, over the years some relaxation of this requirement was allowed at a number of local offices.

      <P>Prior to 6 April 1988 ministers of religion and members of religious orders, apart from ministers of the Church of Ireland, were not included in the social insurance system and were not liable to pay any PRSI contribution.  However, <Col N="585" /> they may have been liable to pay a contribution of 2.25 per cent, comprising the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy, which is presumably the contribution referred to by the Deputy in the question.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1988, provided for the extension of social insurance to the self-employed from 6 April 1988. Persons who are in receipt of reckonable emoluments or income, as defined in the Act, are now liable to pay pay-related social insurance contributions.  Certain ministers of religion who are engaged in pastoral duties are in receipt of reckonable income and are, accordingly, liable to pay social insurance contributions as self-employed contributors this year at the rate of 3 per cent.  This contribution is in addition to the 1.25 per cent health contribution and the 1 per cent employment and training levy.  Such contributions provide cover for contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>Social Insurance is being introduced on a phased basis for self-employed contributors and will be raised to 4 per cent in the 1989-90 tax year and to 5 per cent in the 1990-91 tax year.</P>
      <P>Following the extension of social insurance to the self-employed from 6 April 1988 other ministers of religion and members of religious orders employed under a contract of service in a whole-time, part-time or temporary capacity were brought into social insurance for the first time.  The extent of social insurance cover for such religious employees is determined by the nature of their employment.  The majority of religious brought into the social insurance system as employed contributors from 6 April 1988 are working in a permanent and pensionable capacity in teaching and the health service and are, accordingly, now liable to pay PRSI at the Class D rate of contributions that is 3.15 per cent.  This represents an additional contribution of 0.9 per cent on the levies amounting to 2.25 per cent which they had previously paid.  Class D PRSI contributions provide cover for limited social insurance benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Religious employed in a temporary <Col N="586" /> capacity in teaching or the health service are liable to pay Class A PRSI contributions, that is 7.75 per cent.  This represents an additional contribution of 5.5 per cent for social insurance onto the 2.25 per cent previously paid in respect of levies.  However, they are now entitled to additional tax relief through the PRSI tax allowance which is currently £286 per annum.  These Class A PRSI contributions provide cover for all social insurance benefits, including disability and unemployment benefits, invalidity, old age (contributory) and retirement pensions.</P>

He lives with his wife who is in receipt of disability benefit which is not a qualifying payment for the receipt of the fuel allowance.

      <P>No benefit is paid for the first three days of a period of incapacity and so she received a cheque for £19.60 in respect of 17 and 19 September 1988.  Sundays are not counted for the purposes of paying benefit so no payment was due for 18 September 1988.</P>

      <P>While the above controls apply to all categories of vehicles, it seems to me that controls relating specifically to the parking of heavy vehicles may be warranted.

      <P>In December 1986, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities generally authorising the use, on <Col N="604" /> an experimental basis, of a new traffic sign to be provided at the approaches to schools in certain circumstances.  While initially the scope of the experiment was limited to four chosen counties, subsequently each local authority was advised that 50 per cent of the cost of the provision of signs at the approach to one school in their functional area would be recouped following receipt of an appropriate application.</P>
      <P>I understand that Meath County Council have provided the sign at the approaches to Rathbeggan school in Dunshaughlin.</P>
      <P>In June 1988, Meath County Council requested that the provision of signs at the schools referred to by the Deputy be authorised.  They were informed by the Department that, pending completion of an evaluation of the effect of the signs provided as part of the experiment, the provision of additional signs could not be authorised.  This evaluation will be completed as soon as possible.  In the meantime, it would not be appropriate to take the action referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Under the Redundancy Payments Acts the responsibility for payment of a redundancy lump sum is a matter in the first instance for the employer concerned.  If the employer refuses or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, an employee can apply to my Department for direct payment from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  Such application must, however, be supported by evidence of entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a redundancy certificate (R.P.2) issued by the employer or, where entitlement is contested by the employer, a decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>
      <P>The person concerned in the question should, therefore, approach his employer in the first instance about payment of any redundancy lump sum to which he considers he is entitled.

The other dentist continued working at the health centre until going on sick leave on 5 October 1988.  It is unlikely that this dentist will be fit to resume work before Christmas.  The health board made several efforts to secure a temporary replacement when the first dentist left but were unsuccessful. The board have now secured the services of another dentist for the North Strand health centre but he can attend for only three sessions per week.  The principal dental surgeon for the area also attends the North Strand health centre every Friday and provides minor orthodontic treatments.  The health board are continuing in their endeavours to recruit full-time dentists through the Local Appointments Commission who recently advertised five posts.  A full-time dentist will be assigned to the North Strand health centre as soon as one becomes available.  At present there are approximately 600 children awaiting dental screening/treatment at the North Strand health centre.</P>

    <P>At present there are 19,223 children <Col N="609" /> awaiting assessment and/or orthodontic treatment in the health board system.</P>
    <P>International research indicates that in the long term the proportion of children requiring some degree of orthodontic treatment could be more than 25 per cent.  However, this would include treatments for non-essential, e.g. purely cosmetic reasons, which would be excluded under the terms of the guidelines for the provision of orthodontic treatment laid down by my Department.  The proportion of children qualifying for orthodontic treatment by the health boards would, therefore, be considerably lower than the internationally quoted figure of 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment for eligible persons was part of the recent general review of dental services carried out by a working group under the chairmanship of my colleague Deputy Terry Leyden, Minister of State at my Department. I am at present considering the findings and recommendations of the review group including those relating to the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>Although all health board dentists can and do provide a certain degree of orthodontic treatment, the more complicated cases require the services of specialist orthodontists.  Six full time posts of consultant orthodontist have been approved for the health boards but competitions held by the Local Appointments Commission over the past five years have only succeeded in filling one of these posts. Efforts are continuing to fill the other five posts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of the first three persons mentioned, the Eastern Health Board have no record of applications for chiropody cards.  The board have now issued chiropody application forms to these individuals. These will be dealt with immediately by the board on receipt of the completed application forms.  A chiropody card was issued to the last named person in June 1988.  As the person does not appear to have received this card a duplicate has now been issued.</P>
      <P>In each community care area of the Eastern Health Board the expired chiropody card must be returned before a new card is issued, as evidence that the applicant continues to require treatment and also for accounting purposes.  In some areas a completed application form is also required on an annual basis. However, the board are satisfied that the existing procedures for the issue of chiropody cards are both efficient and cost effective.</P>

      <P>For a candidate to be eligible for the award of a higher education grant, the reckonable income of the candidate and of the candidate's parents or guardians must be within the income limits set out in the relevant scheme.  For the purpose of the scheme reckonable income means gross income from all sources, less any sum paid by way of contribution to a superannuation fund, and excluding also children's allowances under the Social Welfare Acts, holiday earnings of the candidate and payments under the family income supplement scheme.</P>
      <P>For self-employed persons the income to be reckoned includes the profits from business/farming activities (including lettings of land, equipment etc.) after deducting expenses incurred in earning these profits, such as rent, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchase of seeds, fertilisers, business interest and stock relief.  When reckoning expenses which may be taken into account as expenses incurred in earning profits no amount shall be included in respect of depreciation (including capital allowances such as on plant or equipment), expenditure on the construction of fences, roadways, holding yards, drains or land reclamation, expenditure on construction of farmhouses or farm buildings, expenditure on the construction of business premises or expenditure relating to personal use, for example the elements of expenditure relating to personal use contained in such items as light, power, fuel, telephone, insurance, motor expenses and bank interest and charges.</P>
      <P>The basis for assessment of reckonable income of self-employed persons under the higher education grant scheme for the 1988-89 academic year is in keeping with the arrangements I have outlined above.  These arrangements have been in operation since 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood from Wexford County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with administration of the scheme, that the reckonable income (calculated in <Col N="618" /> accordance with appropriate guidelines) of the persons (details supplied) exceed the limits for the award of a grant, in each case.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on local authorities to accept tax assessments by the Revenue Commissioners as the sole criterion for determining reckonable income/eligibility for higher education grants.</P>
