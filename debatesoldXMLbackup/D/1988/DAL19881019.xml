      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has satisfied himself that the existing codes of practice and procedures pertaining to the giving and receiving of ministerial gifts by members of the <Col N="3" /> Government with the Ministers and representatives of other States are acceptable; if not, if he will outline any changes which he proposes to recommend to the code of practice; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Successive Administrations in Ireland have conformed to the long-established international practice whereby on the occasion of an official or State visit gifts are exchanged between host and guest. Details of such gifts, which may be personal or official, are not publicised and it would be clearly inappropriate, if not offensive, to attempt to have them valued.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has advised that it is the intention of the donor which determines whether a gift is to become State property under the State Property Act, 1954.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could preface my supplementaries by saying that I am sure the House hopes the Taoiseach will be back with us shortly in full health.  Is the Tánaiste seriously telling us that there is no question of gifts of an extremely high value having recently been received by the Government and parties associated with the Government and that it is the intention to retain those gifts for personal use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, there is no question of value involved.  What is involved is whether the gifts are personal or to the State and that is a matter entirely for the donor.  I would ask the House to remember and keep in their minds that, through successive Governments, we have established excellent relations with the Moslem nations both on trade and political levels.  It would be in my view <Col N="4" /> clearly offensive to start any investigation into particular gifts they may choose to make and on what basis they choose to make them, whether it be a personal or official basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is of a more general nature.  I am asking if the Government propose to introduce guidelines in relation to the receipt of gifts either from foreign countries or from commercial interests.  Will the Tánaiste indicate if he proposes to introduce such a set of guidelines and whether such guidelines would include the creation of a register of such gifts and perhaps the rule regarding value or how much a gift would have to be worth before it would be handed over to the State?</P>

      <P>It is entirely a matter for the visiting dignatory in this case to decide whether it should be an official gift or a personal gift.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that in the past there have been guidelines in existence as to the conduct of members of the Government and other office-holders in regard to acceptance of gifts of a personal nature?  Does he not further agree that those guidelines do not seem to have been even dusted out on this occasion or looked at?  Does the Tánaiste not agree that it is utterly irrelevant to make the distinction he is now making between personal gifts or State gifts since if they were State gifts the question would not arise in the first place because the objects would be handed over to the State?  Would the Tánaiste not agree that the answer he is giving completely evades answering the question which is, &ldquo;have the guidelines which existed in the past been applied to this case?&rdquo;  Has any attempt been made, as I have asked in my second question, to value the gifts in <Col N="6" /> question?  Would the Tánaiste not accept that there can be no question, in applying our own internal guidelines, of giving any offence to any third party or other state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Opposition have mistaken the whole basis of my reply to Deputy De Rossa.  What I am saying here is germane to all the questions regarding an inter-state gift.  There are guidelines, of course, with regard to commercial gifts.  These guidelines have always been observed.  They do not arise in this case.  What arises in this case is an inter-State matter between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Government of this country of ours.  That is what is involved and there is no departure from any of the previous guidelines under either of these two headings.  The only heading that arises is the last one and there is no departure from that.  It would be clearly offensive for us to carry out an investigation into what the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has proposed to donate on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked two questions, the first is in relation to the estimated value of the gifts and whether the Taoiseach intends to hand those gifts over to the State and the second is in relation to the existing guidelines regarding the acceptance of gifts.  With regard to the second question, I again ask the Tánaiste if he is not aware that there is already in existence in print a set of guidelines about the acceptance of gifts.</P>
      <P>Further, if I am to understand from what the Tánaiste has said that the gifts in question &mdash; the ones we are talking about &mdash; are gifts from State to State, which seems to be what the Tánaiste is saying, can I then take it that the Taoiseach is either about to hand over those gifts to the State or has already done so. If they are in fact gifts from State to State, as the Tánaiste appears to pretend, why are they not now in the possession of this State without giving offence to anybody else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concerned to inform the Deputy that this is not a gift <Col N="7" /> from a commercial firm.  There are guidelines governing such gifts and gifts on an inter-State basis.  It is a matter for the donor State to decide whether its gift, given on the occasion of an inter-State visit, is on a personal basis or under the State property basis.  Is that quite clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to ask the Tánaiste whether he is now saying, having said at the very beginning that the matter is one for the Attorney General to decide, that he is disallowing what he said and is now trying to say that it is a matter for the donor to decide.  The Tánaiste started off by saying that it was a matter for the Attorney General to decide but I am asking again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to answer that because, despite the laughter in the House, it is quite clear that Deputy Dukes does not understand what I have said.  The last paragraph of my direct reply which he listened to three minutes ago and which I will now repeat was:</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has advised that it is the intention of the donor which determines whether a gift is to become State property under the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Tánaiste tell us what it is on this occasion?  Is it a gift from State to State?  He has evaded that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs must have regard to the sensibilities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, that is his job, but I have to have regard for the legitimate concerns of the people who put me into this House, that is my responsibility.  Quite frankly their concerns are that the reported scale and value of the gift that has been received is way in excess of any token or gesture of friendship and is open to interpretation that seriously offends the sensibilities of this republican democracy.  I ask the Tánaiste if it is the intention of this Government to allay any such fears without causing diplomatic offence by transferring forthwith the gifts that were received from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into the safekeeping of the Irish State as seems to be indicated by the Tánaiste's response?</P>

      <P>I ask the Tánaiste to agree with me that in a case like this it is not the intention of the donor which determines a thing so much as the public conscience of the recipient.  If the recipient has been given a present, and I make no special case about this instance, because of the position he holds, surely the Tánaiste will agree that a certain sense of propriety and as Deputy Quinn has said, a certain sense of proportion, would impose standards quite independent of the donor's intention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said many times that I am willing to enter into talks with Unionist leaders, without preconditions, about how we might establish the basis for lasting peace and stability on this island.  My position <Col N="11" /> on this remains unchanged and the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in San Francisco is in line with Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House on 3 May last, we have to advert to the fact that representatives of the Unionist tradition are not prepared to accept the Anglo-Irish Agreement, at this stage at any rate. Therefore, any dialogue with them will have to be outside the processes of the Agreement to which, of course, both Governments are committed.  The Government had talks with representatives of the SDLP on 9 September. We both reiterated our hope for a direct exchange of views with leaders of the Unionist community, without any preconditions and with full respect for the convictions of all the parties involved.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement by the Tánaiste that he is prepared to have talks outside the Anglo-Irish Agreement, in view also of his anxiety to have these talks and of the fact that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been presented by the Unionists with whom he wishes to have talks as an impediment to having talks, surely it makes commonsense that the impediment would be temporarily removed without necessarily being abrogated? The objective of the agreement was to procure reconciliation but if it is now being presented by those with whom we wish to be reconciled as an impediment, surely that impediment should be removed by an act of generosity on this side, albeit on a temporary basis to get the talks under way.</P>

      <P>I take it that Deputy Cooney in advancing that view is not <Col N="12" /> advancing the view of the Fine Gael Party.  That view as expressed by Deputy Dukes is entirely different.  Having said that and put it on record, I would like to emphasise that the best way forward in what we all know is a very complex situation is, first of all, to maintain the agreement and the conference.  That has been fully discussed with the SDLP who support us in that, and the British and Irish Governments are both determined to maintain that position.  That does not preclude or prejudice in any way the development of talks with Unionist representatives. That can continue on a parallel basis through a process while maintaining the conference, the secretariat and the Anglo-Irish process generally. That is our considered position. The Deputy is aware that the position in this area has to be considered in a very mature way at present as the three-yearly review provided for in the Agreement is starting.</P>

All we can do is hope that they work out.  We are preparing detailed papers in connection with the review, as are the British.  Apart from the review there is the process of dialogue which we want to see initiated between the Unionists and everybody else here in Ireland who is concerned about its future peaceful development.  That is the situation. It is a case of constructive movement in which no definite positive conclusions have emerged.  Constructive input into this process from anybody in this House or outside it will be welcomed by me, the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>

Is he aware that it is now almost three years since the Taoiseach, on 15 November 1985, met the British Prime Minister other than for brief ten or 15 minute periods on the margins of European councils to discuss Anglo-Irish affairs?  In view of the fact that the third anniversary of the agreement is imminent, does he not consider that it is a time when a meeting such as this would be particularly useful?  Does the Tánaiste agree that while the conference may be working at official level, it appears, in the last year in particular, to have lost political direction and drive and should be put back, by the leaders of the two countries, on the high road that it enjoyed in 1985?</P>

Would the Tánaiste agree that if something concrete does not happen within the next three or four weeks, there is every likelihood that that welcome flexibility which was shown on the part of many Unionists will come to an end and will be withdrawn and we will be back to the old sterile Unionist-Nationalist situation again?</P>

First of all, I am concerned at his first response which is merely a reiteration of what the Taoiseach said 12 months ago, that they are willing to enter talks with the Unionists.  If the Unionists maintain their present stance, which seems to indicate that there will be no progress, what action will the Government propose?

      <P>I am glad the Deputy used the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo;.  We are considering all possible options, taking action where it is required, not taking action where it might cause difficulties and seeking to arrive at a situation where, by mutual agreement, the Unionist parties, their representatives and their leaders will enter into dialogue, and I emphasise that that dialogue need not interfere with or prejudice in any way the <Col N="21" /> workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference. That is precisely where we stand.  All avenues are being pursued.  We in this House should not need to be told here or anywhere else that our duty is to pursue such avenues.  I would expect an alternative Government equally to pursue all the options towards achieving the objective of political dialogue in this way.  It would not be in our national interest to abandon our present position under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the workings of the Anglo-Irish Conference and the secretariat.  In any dialogue being entered into the two aspects can proceed in parallel. One does not in any way affect the other and we are seeking to achieve just that objective.</P>

We are in regular touch with the President of the Commission and everybody associated with the Commission and the institutions of the Community generally.  At present the President of the Commission is engaged on a basic reshaping of the next Commission and this will involve a reorganising of the existing Commission structure and a reallocation of responsibilities. We will be fully aware of that situation soon.  Naturally we will make our decisions on the proposals of President Delors having regard to his view as to what the responsibilities of the new Commissioner will be within the new Commission. We will be holding appropriate discussions with him on the matter.</P>

Would he not also agree &mdash; and recent history will also bear this out &mdash; that a person of considerable competence nominated six or seven months in advance, even as a new member of the Commission, would achieve a place of considerable importance?  Finally, would he not agree that past experience shows that if you nominate a person after the game is largely over late in the day, as happened in the case of the unfortunate Deputy O'Kennedy who was nominated at the very end of 1980 and ended up with what has been described as a laundry bag of a protfolio, which he was so displeased <Col N="25" /> with that he left the place just over a year after he went there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his intention to reconstitute Bord Scannán na hÉireann; and the plans he has for the future of the Irish film industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to reactivate Bord Scannán na hÉireann. The tax reliefs under section 35 of the 1987 Finance Act, the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and the business expansion scheme now provide for the first time an incentive for the development of a commercially successful film industry. An indication that this is happening is a Córas Tráchtála estimate that the export value of the film sector will amount to £20 million this year, a 60 per cent increase on 1987.</P>
      <P>I have already outlined, in response to Question No. 47 on Wednesday 14 October, 1987, the basis on which we plan the development of the Irish film industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste accept that the recent films made by an Bord Scannán na hÉireann, now defunct, were of exceptionally high quality and reflected very well on the Irish film industry as it was being nurtured by the board? Will the Tánaiste agree that now there is a danger that a lot of the expertise gathered under Bord Scannán na hÉireann may be dissipated under the newly announced system?  Will the Tánaiste give details of the co-ordinating body that will try to put together a distinctively Irish film industry in the absence of Bord Scannán na hÉireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As policy stands Bord Scannán has gone and we are seeking to encourage and stimulate small film makers to get into this business to a greater degree.  That is happening and it is estimated that the export value of such films will show an increase of 60 per cent on 1987 and will amount to £20 million. We do not want a bureaucratic structure to do this but certainly we will look at ways and means of encouraging people who are experienced in the business to get involved.  Our policy appears to have been successful so far and we will continue along that path.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a direct question, one put by Bord Scannán <Col N="31" /> na hÉireann.  My question is, what provision does the Tánaiste propose to make, and what institutional arrangements does he propose to introduce, for the provision of seed money for the writing of film scripts and the development of films?  Will the Tánaiste agree that his answer, in which he quoted section 35 of the 1987 Finance Act which deals with the business expansion scheme and so on, dealt with incentives for export earnings from finished films but did not address what Bord Scannán na hÉireann was doing well, the provision of seed money and money for script writing?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House previously, this matter has complex legal and practical implications which require very careful evaluation in advance of bringing proposals before the House.

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that early in the last session of the Dáil the Taoiseach promised that the legislation would be brought before the House before the end of that session?  Is the Tánaiste aware that the programme for <Col N="33" /> the coming session, announced in communications between the Whips, has no mention of this legislation?  In view of the importance of this matter and of preserving our heritage will the Tánaiste ensure that the Bill will be brought before the House without delay?

      <P>I will do what has been suggested by the Deputy and have a word with the Chief Whip with a view to inserting the Bill for the current session.  We are aware of the importance of such legislation and I should like to assure the Deputy that the delays in bringing it before the House were caused by the complex legal matters involved.  The Deputy will be aware that there has been litigation in regard to some finds but we have got over the legal and constitutional constraints.  We are confident that our legislation will be adequate and I will seek to have it before the House as soon as possible; in this session, I would hope.</P>

      <P>This Government have got their priorities right with regard to getting the country back on the economic rails and this is being done successfully, <Col N="34" /> but that job will not be successfully concluded until we have further investment development and further employment creation.  We have been concentrating on that aspect which is all important rather than on engaging in what I would call constitutional adventures which, in our humble opinion, took up far too much time in the last Government's occupancy. However, I do not want to start any rumpus over that.  We do not have any proposals at the moment for reform of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the concern being expressed in the insurance industry, regarding the large-scale cutting of premiums by the PMPA in the motor insurance and motor bus insurance areas; if he is satisfied with the present financial position of the company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, with the passing of the Courts Act, 1988 and the introduction of various other initiatives, the Government have created the environment for lower insurance premium rates.  The insurance industry has started to respond to these initiatives and rates in general have become more competitive.  I would expect that premium rates will reduce even further as the full impact of the Government's policy in this area takes effect.</P>
      <P>As far as the financial position of PMPA is concerned, the latest published results show that the administrator is making good progress towards clearing the deficit of PMPA.  The company is expected to show a further overall profit for the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer the question I asked.  We all agree that we want to see insurance premiums going down.  Surely the Minister is aware that in some instances premiums seem to be dropping at a rate of between 50 and 70 per cent and it seems to be possible to go to various insurance companies, to relate the latest quote from another insurance company and that quote can be bettered by other companies.  Has the Minister or his Department looked into this as there is a grave danger to the financial stability in general of PMPA and the insurance <Col N="36" /> market and this type of practice could put us in a serious problem in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department have no reason to question PMPA rates for motor car or bus insurance.  While the rates may be competitive, they are not underpriced.  The Deputy, like other Deputies in the House, would like to see competitive rates and not underpriced rates.  The Irish Insurance Federation have made a number of complaints about the rates quoted by PMPA and about the extent of its advertising since it was placed under the new administrator.  At the end of the day the responsibility for the administration of PMPA rests with the administrator and his rates are competitive but not underpriced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the grantgiving powers of any of the State agencies under his aegis will be in any way affected by the reform of the Structural Funds currently being undertaken by the European Community; if the reformed Structural Funds will allow individual enterprises in Ireland to apply directly to the Commission for funds, bypassing agencies here; and if he will outline the type of assistance that the Commission proposes to provide under its most recent proposals (details supplied) in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Commission's proposals for the co-ordinating and implementing regulations for the Structural Funds are currently under consideration by the Council of Ministers. Until such time as their discussions are completed it will not be possible to say precisely what new arrangements will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect that the reform of the Structural Funds will materially affect the grant-giving powers of the State agencies under my aegis.  As the Deputy will be aware, a much greater proportion of the <Col N="38" /> industry budget is now being directed towards areas of perceived weakness of Irish industry such as management development, marketing expertise and technological capability as well as the direct support of new job creation.  It is my intention that all of the main measures and programmes being undertaken by my Department and their State agencies will be included in the national plan which is being drawn up for submission for Structural Fund assistance.</P>
    <P>Normally assistance from the funds will come through the part financing of national aid schemes.  The Community may directly support enterprises which supply services to small and medium-sized enterprises and FEOGA projects. It is unlikely that the Community would wish to directly support an investment in industry which is not being supported by the State.  The present arrangement whereby all applications for support from the Structural Funds must be submitted through the national authority will continue.</P>
    <P>The Commission has proposed that Community funding would be available towards, <i>inter alia</i>, the following activities:</P>
    <P>From the Regional Development Fund:</P>
    <P>&mdash;investment in firms which leads to the creation or maintenance of permanent jobs;</P>
    <P>&mdash;infrastructural measures which contribute to economic development;</P>
    <P>&mdash;specialist measures to promote small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>From the Social Fund:</P>
    <P>&mdash;vocational training measures;</P>
    <P>&mdash;recruitment subsidies.</P>
    <P>From the FEOGA Guidance Fund:</P>
    <P>&mdash;measures to imporve the marketing and processing of agricultural, forestry and fishery products.</P>
    <P>Assistance from the funds towards measures undertaken in the less developed regions, which includes Ireland, may be as high as 75 per cent of public expenditure depending on the financial capacity of the member state and the seriousness of the regional or <Col N="39" /> social problems to be tackled.  It will be the Government's aim, because of our development needs, to achieve the highest rate of Community support.</P>

      <P>The Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, requires the enterprises involved in a proposed merger or takeover which comes within the scope of the Act, to notify me as soon as may be after a proposal is made.  Upon receipt of a notification and after examination of the proposal I can either approve it, without reference to the Fair Trade Commission, or refer it to the Commission for Investigation in relation to the scheduled criteria in the Act.</P>
      <P>To date the proposal involving the takeover of Master Meats has not been notified to me in accordance with the Act. However, on receipt of such notification I am entitled to require the full disclosure of the control of the enterprises involved and I am satisfied that I have the powers necessary to enable me to do so.</P>
      <P>Until I have had an opportunity to fully examine any notification made I could not comment on whether or not I would refer it to the Fair Trade Commission for investigation.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has had any discussion with his British counterpart to consider the possibility of better co-ordination between the job creation agencies in the North of Ireland and the Republic, with a view to ensuring that more investment is attracted to Ireland as a whole; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 10 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference shall be the framework for the promotion of co-operation between the two parts of Ireland concerning aspects of economic, social and cultural matters.  Both Governments are committed to improving co-operation in the economic and social sphere and in this context I have had a number of meetings with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with responsibility for Industry, Mr. Peter Viggers, M.P. At our last meeting, which was held at Stormont on 14 July, 1988, we recognised that there were many areas where North-South co-operation can be of great benefit and that a co-operative approach in practical initiatives to develop the economy of the whole island of Ireland, North and South, and thereby create jobs, is in everybody's interests.  The completion of the Internal European Market by 1992 presents common problems, as well as opportunities, and arrangements have been made for the staging of a working conference at Louvain next December at which senior representatives of industry and public sector agencies from both sides of the Border can consider areas where co-operation will yield maximum benefit all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential for closer co-operation in relation to regional development between the appropriate public and private sector agencies on both sides of the Border will also feature in the North-West study which both Governments have agreed to commission.  A decision <Col N="42" /> by the EC Commission on the funding of this study is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>A substantial degree of co-operation between job creation agencies on both sides of the Border has also been established at practical level in regard to the working of the International Fund for Ireland.  Already the equivalent of £86 million has been donated by the US, Canada and New Zealand to the fund. Most of this has already been allocated to employment-creating programmes on both sides of the Border.  Further substantial donations to the fund for these purposes are expected during 1989.</P>
    <P>As regards promotional efforts abroad, I would explain that competition for mobile industrial investment worldwide is extremely intense and each agency concerned seeks to distinguish itself from its competitors in the incentives it offers. The Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland are an integral part of the British investment drive co-ordinated by the Invest in Britain Bureau and as such directly compete with our Industrial Development Authority for overseas industrial investment.  It is therefore recognised on both sides that the scope for co-operation in the promotion of overseas industrial investment of this nature is limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the last paragraph, I welcome the general tenor of what the Minister has said.  Will he pursue his discussions with his counterparts in Northern Ireland and Britain with regard to seeking some co-ordination of the agencies working abroad?  Rather than having them in direct competition which can lead to problems, would he seek to ensure that they work in total co-ordination to attract industry to both parts of this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-operation, yes, but as regards getting too close to Invest in Britain, I am sure that the Deputy himself, as Minister of a former Government, who went abroad on industrial investment promotions, will fully appreciate that we have our business to look after in the international field.  The business is <Col N="43" /> not very plentiful for anybody and I am sure the Deputy would not suggest to me that we give a list, say, of targeted companies to our competitors in the market, to allow them to take the business from us.  Practical co-operation is on, certainly, but not to the degree that we would want to get into bed with them.</P>

      <P>I am informed that revisions of the code take place from time to time and, as the Deputy suggests, one has recently been completed.

I am not aware that any Irish entity participated in the last review.</P>
      <P>Preliminary discussions have been held recently between officials of my Department, the panel executive and representatives of the Irish Stock Exchange to discuss, <i>inter alia</i>, the future role of the panel in Ireland, including the extent of Irish representation in the workings of the panel.</P>

I asked the Taoiseach on 8 June when this legislation would come before the House and he could not help me at that point.  The Directive came into force on 31 July.</P>

It is in the final stages of drafting and I expect to introduce it in the current session.  I would remind the Deputy and the House that only three of the 12 member states have so far enacted that legislation: the UK, Italy and Greece.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important measure which, following detailed consideration and debate, was passed by the Seanad last June.  Its primary purpose is to strengthen and secure the position of policyholders in their dealings with insurance companies and intermediaries.  I am sure that the Bill will find broad acceptance on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill has three basic objectives: first to strengthen the Minister's legislative powers in relation to the supervision of insurers; second to regulate commissions paid to intermediaries, where policyholders' interests so require; and third to introduce for the first time in substantive insurance law a form of regulation for insurance intermediaries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a useful exercise, before setting out in detail the provisions of the Bill, to outline the role of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the insurance industry and also to refer to the range of actions taken to improve the overall environment affecting the Irish insurance market.  The first duty of the Minister in relation to insurance companies is the supervision of insurers to ensure that they are capable of meeting their liabilities and that they <Col N="247" /> are solvent and to take appropriate action to remedy the situation if they are not.</P>
    <P>It is not the function of the Minister to run insurance companies, to make commercial decisions for them or to exercise business acumen on their behalf.  The directors and officers of an insurer are responsible in the first instance for the direction of the insurer's affairs and for compliance with the law.  Others, such as auditors and actuaries, who are charged with specific statutory duties must also play their part.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, I am taking power to require that those appointed as directors or officers of an insurer are suitably qualified or experienced to handle the task. Of course, these powers do not of themselves guarantee the effectiveness of such persons in discharging their duties.  No amount of legislation could achieve that. They are nevertheless an important additional safeguard in the supervisory process.</P>
    <P>What preoccupies most people in relation to insurance are the issues of cost, availability and coverage, particularly in the motor and liability classes. There is widespread agreement that the cost of insurance in this country has been too high and for far too long.  It is also generally accepted that the high cost of insurance is directly related to the number and level of claims, the under-writing losses sustained by insurers and the enormous expenses which arise in the claims process, particularly when the courts are involved.</P>
    <P>The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> pointed out that Irish liability insurance rates place many Irish firms at a cost disadvantage, particularly in comparison with their United Kingdom competitors, and they under-took to move quickly to facilitate a reduction in insurance costs.  The Government over the past 18 months have tackled this area vigorously and with a sense of urgency.</P>
    <P>The most important commitment given by the Government was to abolish the use of civil juries in personal injury and fatal accident cases in the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> The Courts Act, 1988, came into force on 1 August 1988.  Jury trials in personal injury and fatal accident cases are no longer available to parties in litigation from that date.  The object of this change is to bring greater consistency and predictability into the awards of damages in these cases, and to enable a much greater proportion of cases to be settled at an earlier stage in legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry, supported by bodies such as the CII and FUE, have for long cited the availability of jury trial as a principal cause of the high cost of motor and liability insurance in this country. The Government have now delivered on their commitment to do away with the jury system.  There is, therefore, a clear onus on the insurance industry in Ireland to translate the benefits arising from that important change in the legal framework into lower insurance premiums for the general public and for industry.  I have already emphasised to the insurance industry the necessity for premium reductions to be passed on to the insuring public and I have asked my Department to monitor premium levels to ensure that they do so.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there are signs already of an improvement in this regard. It is apparent that premium levels in motor insurance have been reducing in recent months as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and in anticipation of the effect of the abolition of juries and of the other Government measures to improve the overall environment for insurance.  Indeed, the initial results of a survey on motor insurance premium levels carried out by my Department indicate that decreases of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent for third party motor rates have already occurred within the last 12 months or so.  Certain insurers have also introduced much more attractive premium ratings for young drivers.</P>
    <P>The cost reduction measures already taken will have a general beneficial effect on the downward pressure on insurance costs and will also apply to the other liability insurance classes, including employers' and public liability insurance. <Col N="249" /> My Department, with the co-operation of the CII and other relevant organisations, are currently monitoring developments in this area.</P>
    <P>The most recent CII survey indicates that, on average, employers' liability insurance rates have fallen from 2.78 per cent of payroll costs in 1986 to 1.85 per cent of payroll costs in 1988.  While the cost of employers' liability insurance may in some cases in the past have acted as a disincentive to employment, the latest encouraging trends are reducing its importance in this regard.  I will continue to press for across-the-board reductions resulting from an improved operating environment for insurers and not just reductions concentrated in the better risk areas.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has become linked with the jury issue is concern about high legal costs in insurance cases.  Until recently, virtually every personal injury case in the High Court &mdash; no matter how straightforward &mdash; involved at least eight lawyers, including three counsel on each side.  That was regarded, quite properly as a gross extravagance, and there is a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to reduce legal representation in Superior Court cases.  In line with that commitment, the Government decided to include a provision in the Courts Act, 1988, that empowers the Minister for Justice to regulate the number of counsel whose fees can be recovered by a successful plaintiff in a personal injury case.</P>
    <P>Independently of this statutory intervention &mdash; though some would say because of it &mdash; the Bar Council announced it would abandon the long-standing &ldquo;three counsel&rdquo; practice in personal injury cases when jury trials ceased. On the other hand, in response to my call for rationalisation of legal representation levels, spokesmen for the insurance industry have suggested that most personal injury cases could be pleaded before a judge by one counsel and, of course, this is the position in Britain where most personal injury cases are pleaded by one junior counsel. <Col N="250" /> I would expect that, as the largest consumer of legal services in the country, the insurance industry are in a strong position to influence the number of legal rep-resentatives that are briefed in these cases.  I am aware that discussions with representatives of the Bar Council are continuing and both I and the Minister for Justice will be monitoring developments. The Minister for Justice intends to wait until the position has settled after the abolition of civil juries in these cases, before considering the question of regulations under the new power vested in him by the Courts Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Arising from another commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the Government have asked the Minister for Justice to consider how best a Book of Quantum of Damages might be drawn up.  For people who may not be familiar with the concept, a Book of Quantum of Damages is a term used to describe a legal publication which contains information on the amounts of damages awarded by the courts in personal injury cases, classified by types of injury, together with statements of the law and practice in relation to the assessment of damages.  Such a Book of Quantum of Damages is published in Britain and used there as a guide for the insurance industry, the legal profession and the judiciary in settling and deciding cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has recently stressed that the production of a Book of Quantum of Damages geared to Irish circumstances is not primarily a matter for the State.  It would not, of course, prescribe a statutory tariff of damages. In his view, it is really a matter for private enterprise, as in Britain, and it is likely that as judges start deciding personal injury cases and issue reasoned judgments, interest will develop in law reporting in this area, leading eventually to publications similar to the Book of Quantum of Damages used in Britain.  Indeed, one such project enterprise has already been mooted.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the Minister for Justice has referred the question of a Book of Quantum to the Incorporated Council <Col N="251" /> of Law Reporting for Ireland for consideration by them.  The Minister for Justice is represented on the council, which includes members of the Judiciary and representatives of the legal profession. The council are currently considering this matter and expect to conclude their examination later this year.</P>
    <P>Another development in this area worth mentioning is a recent initiative by the Irish Insurance Federation in arranging that member companies will maintain a record of major categories of injury, will collate data on award settlements and circulate the results to members and to my Department.  Such data will complement data on court awards in injury cases and help to provide an overall view of the quantum of damages in personal injury cases.</P>
    <P>Another commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is the question of introducing a system of pretrial procedures in the High Court to enable subsidiary issues to be disposed of by agreement between the parties before a trial.  The aim would be to limit the issues going to court to those that remain in dispute between the parties.  Such a procedure would eliminate the need to call witnesses to prove various matters which are not in dispute between the parties, such as road maps, plans, photographs and certain evidence about injuries sustained in connection with an accident.</P>
    <P>As well as reducing legal and expert witnesses costs, such a facility could have a major influence on personal injury cases by providing new procedural machinery to advance the prospects of settlements in cases that go all the way to trial at present.  The Minister for Justice hopes to put proposals to the Government shortly in the context of a Court Officers Bill &mdash; which is at an advanced stage of preparation in his Department &mdash; to facilitate the introduction of a system of pre-trial procedures in the High Court.</P>
    <P>Also, the Minister for the Environment is proposing to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with <Col N="252" /> certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.  The measures proposed could include the impounding of motor vehicles to deal with uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour will be introducing legislation shortly to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work.  I also understand that ongoing discussions are taking place between the Department of Labour, the FUE and the Irish Insurance Federation on the question of the introduction of safety audit arrangements by insurance companies.  I have given my full support and encouragement to these developments which are in the interest of the whole community.</P>
    <P>I would hope for repaid progress on most, if not all, of the areas still outstanding so that we can maintain the momentum already created to tackle and get under control these component elements of insurance costs.  Already, the signs are encouraging but much remains to be done.  All these actions are proof positive of this Government's determination to overcome the problems which have built up over many years. Changes do not happen or take full effect overnight but I am confident that the decisive action being taken will in time prove instrumental in reducing insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>The reduction in insurance premium rates is also very much in the insurance industry's interest particularly in the context of the liberalisation of the insurance market within the European Community. It is critically important for our economic well-being that insurers here be able to compete on an equal footing with potential EC services insurers in both efficiency and price.  The programme of measures adopted by the Government is designed to assist insurers in this regard.  There is no doubt that, once the non-life insurance Freedom of Services Directive gets underway in the nineties, there will be much greater competition, particularly for the better quality large industrial and commercial risks. There will also be greater freedom of choice for consumers and some policyholders <Col N="253" /> will, undoubtedly, get cheaper insurance abroad.  It is quite clear, then, that the combined effects of the Government's cost reduction measures and the liberalisation of insurance services will be of benefit to insurers and policyholders alike.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the content of the Insurance Bill before the House and to describe briefly its main provisions. Part I contains the usual preliminary matters to be dealt with in any Bill. However, I would refer specifically to sections 3, 7 and 9.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for substantial penalties for offences under the Act and increases existing penalties for breaches of insurance law to meaningful modern day levels.  Stronger provisions are also being laid down in respect of penalties for the deliberate supply of false or misleading information.  This is an important deterrent since the authorisation and supervision of insurers depend upon true and accurate data being submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 7 confers fee-charging powers on the Minister.  Fees of this nature are now common in many other jurisdictions. Levels of fees have yet to be drawn up but I would emphasise that the intention is to charge for supervision of companies purely on a break-even basis.  My Department have in recent years built up a considerable body of expertise in dealing with insurance.  The calibre of staff is high.  We are a small administration, however, and we cannot afford the levels of staff resources employed in other countries.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am happy that the provisions in this Bill to allow for the charging of fees for supervision will ensure that the required level of staff resources and expertise will continue to be made available.  The computerisation of the insurance branch of the Department is now well established &mdash; in the case of non-life insurance supervision &mdash; and has been progressing satisfactorily in relation to life assurers.  This is contributing to the efficiency of the supervisory service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Section 9 of the Bill repeals some provisions of earlier insurance law, which are long spent.  These are non-contentious in nature.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with the supervision of insurance companies.  The core provisions of this Part relate to the keeping of records and submission of regular information by insurers, supplemented by specific requests for additional data or special examinations and to the specification by the Minister of the essential rules regarding the estimation of insurance liabilities and the nature, spread and valuation of assets to meet such liabilities.  This is, of course, the system we have been operating for several years past.  The annual returns of insurers are currently made pursuant to various regulations made between 1976 and 1986 under the European Communities Act, 1972.  The powers now being taken in sections 11 and 12 will, for the first time, enshrine these rules and requirements in substantive insurance law.</P>
    <P>Section 13 obliges an insurance company to keep records of its business in the State at its registered office or place of business here.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 life assurers must ensure that policyholders and shareholders funds are kept separate.</P>
    <P>In the interests of consumer protection, restrictions on the use to which the assets representing the combined life assurance fund may be put are set out in section 15.  These are prudential requirements in the supervisory process to protect policyholders.</P>
    <P>In Section 16 the Minister is being empowered to require information, both in relation to insurers themselves and in relation to defined categories of bodies which may be connected with insurers. Practical experience suggests that this extension of powers is necessary. Insurers, of their nature, will have many and diverse investments in, and relationships with, other commercial concerns. The fortunes of such connected bodies may be intimately bound up with those of the insurer.</P>
    <P>Section 17 entrusts formal powers of <Col N="255" /> investigations to the Minister and enjoins on insurers full co-operation in these exercises.  The practice of special examinations of insurers' affairs is not unusual. As a matter of routine, a number of insurers are selected each year by my Department for study by outside consultants, particularly in relation to any special aspects that have arisen from the examination of the insurers, annual returns.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill provides the Minister with the power to intervene in the running of the business of an insurer which has encountered financial difficulties and whose solvency is in doubt. The powers of intervention include directions to cease taking on new business, to dispose of investments, to limit premium income, or to localise assets in the State. The powers are also exercisable on a number of other grounds specified in the section.  While not directly related to solvency, these grounds are obviously of importance in a financial context &mdash; namely the power to intervene where unsatisfactory reinsurance is in force, or where the level and nature of business being written is radically different from the financial projections set out in the business plan submitted by the insurer when seeking authorisation.  Insurance supervision cannot guarantee an insurer's solvency.  It is important that the Minister should have the powers to take immediate action when problems come to light.</P>
    <P>With the indulgence of the House, I will pass over section 19 for the moment. Section 20 deals with the qualifications of directors and managers and is relevant in completing this overview of insurance supervision.  At present, under EC directives, insurers seeking authorisation are required to submit details of proposed directors and managers.  The Minister does not authorise the insurer if he has an objection to any such person proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 20 retains this system in that the Minister may decide not to grant an authorisation if he is unhappy with the suitability of any such person.  However, it also extends the Minister's powers of <Col N="256" /> requiring information to existing office-holders in insurers already authorised and to any new appointments to such offices.  The Minister may object to any person holding a position of responsibility with an insurer if it appears to him that the person is not suitable.  The Minister may require the insurer to take certain measures, along the lines set out in connection with section 18, for as long as the person in question holds the position with the insurer.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the Minister may veto the appointment of any director, chief executive or authorised agent, if the person to be appointed is not in the Minister's view a suitable person.  The powers in section 20 are new in an Irish context but they are a common feature of supervision abroad.  It is vitally important that those responsible for directing the affairs of an insurer should be open to the tests of suitability and competence which this Bill provides.  A very heavy duty falls on the shoulders of such persons.  The public should know that an independent mechanism exists to weed out those who are unsuitable or not qualified for the task.</P>
    <P>While my first role is the supervision of insurers from a solvency point of view, I have also a function to play in the supervision of the insurance market &mdash; in seeing how insurers operate and how they meet the demands put on them by those seeking insurance.  The provisions in sections 19 and 21 fall under this heading of market supervision.  Section 19 gives me the power to monitor the pricing practices of insurers and the contractual terms on which business is offered.</P>
    <P>I am also taking power to require insurers, by order, to display premium rates and to provide information to consumers on policy conditions and rates in specified classes of insurance.  The candidates for such orders are motor and household personal lines insurance.  I am sure the taking of these powers will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 21 deals with a different problem. The possession of an insurance authorisation means a responsibility to write business in the class of business authorised. Authorisations are valuable <Col N="257" /> peices of paper.  Unfortunately, isolated cases can arise where insurers make little or no use of the authorisation in specific classes or temporarily withdraw from underwriting.  There may be very good reasons for insurers doing so.  We cannot force insurers to write insurance but we should certainly be able to act to withdraw or suspend authorisations in classes where no business is being done or where the scale of business has been so reduced as to amount in effect to a cessation of business.</P>
    <P>The central focus of insurance supervision is on direct insurance, that is insurers who accept business from the public rather than from other insurance companies. Insurers themselves in taking on risks seek to minimise their risk exposure by reinsuring risks, or parts of risks, with other direct insurers and with specialist reinsurers.</P>
    <P>Reinsurance is an international and specialised form of insurance.  It is regulated in many countries abroad, but not here, except to the extent that it is engaged in by direct insurers authorised by the Minister.  To attempt purely local supervision of specialist reinsurance in an Irish context would be ineffective.</P>
    <P>However, there are measures we can take to regulate a limited aspect of reinsurance and to promote a degree of transparency in the operations of specialist reinsurers in the State.  This is the purpose of section 22.  First, on grounds of commercial prudence it prohibits direct insurers from accepting reinsurance except in a class for which they are authorised. Ancillary risks which form part of a reinsurance &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of risks, are, however, exempted from this prohibition so as not to cut across normal commercial practices in the market.  The second requirement of this section is for specialist reinsurers established in the State to identify themselves to the Minister and to publish accounts in such form as the Minister specifies on grounds of transparency.</P>
    <P>Section 23 of the Bill imposes a minimum paid-up share capital of £500,000 on insurers seeking authorisation and empowers the Minister to regulate the <Col N="258" /> form and value of the share capital.  This section incorporates into law present administrative practice and requirements in relation to the authorisation of insurers.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the attachment of conditions to authorisations and requires insurers to adhere to such conditions on penalty of suspension or revocation of authorisation.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill relates to industrial assurance, which originated under completely different social conditions in the last century and is paid for by weekly premiums which are collected door to door and where the individual sums assured tend to be low.  Over the last ten years this sector of the business has declined spectacularly while, at the same time, ordinary life assurance business has experienced substantial growth.  New industrial branch business now accounts for only 1 per cent of all new business written each year.</P>
    <P>The decline in this business can be attributed to changing social patterns, better social welfare provisioning, increased use of building society and bank accounts and the expansion of credit unions and post office savings.  In addition, the expenses related to this business use up so much of the premium that, after providing for death claims, there is little left for investment on behalf of the policyholder.  This is bad value for money and the Government, conscious of the position of the policyholder, feel that changes are required now in order to ensure that industrial assurance business continues to be written and that policyholders get a better return for their premiums.</P>
    <P>In order to enable the industrial assurance companies to continue to under-write this business, the current legal requirement which stipulates that industrial and ordinary life assurance funds are kept separate is being removed.  This will enable life assurers to write mixed business where the premium could be either collected at home or paid via a direct debit at the choice of the insured or in certain cases at the requirement of the insurer.  The amalgamation of these funds will now be permitted under section 25 (1) <Col N="259" /> and this does not have any solvency implications because, while the funds had to be kept separate, there was no requirement to keep the assets separate.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (2) will permit insurers to reduce the frequency of collection in areas where collection costs are too high although a frequency of not less than two months is still required.</P>
    <P>I should add that the changes are permissive rather than mandatory and insurers are not required either to amalgamate funds or revise collection periods unless they so wish.  We cannot allow this business to fade away and I feel that we have struck the right balance in the change without prejudicing the rights of policyholders in general.</P>
    <P>Section 25 (3) increases to more meaningful amounts &mdash; in current terms &mdash; the sums which can be assured under industrial assurance policies.</P>
    <P>As with industrial assurance, section 26 is rooted in the past.  Its purposed is to remove certain impediments to the writing of group policies of insurance contained in 18th and 19th century Insurance Acts.  These provisions are uncontroversial.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections in Part II of the Bill are a rather mixed bag.  Section 27 extends to the Industrial Credit Company and Fóir Teoranta certain facilities to conducted suretyship and guarantee business which were extended to licensed banks in the State by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1978.  The effect of the present section is to place the ICC and Fóir Teoranta on a similar footing. Licensed banks have also represented to me recently that there are certain problems remaining for them in this whole area and discussions are continuing with a view to resolving matters in this Bill if at all possible.  An amendment on Committee Stage can be brought forward as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 are technical in construction but straightforward in intent. They are designed to close off a possible loophole whereby, under present legislation, a friendly society could be formed to conduct commercial insurance activity <Col N="260" /> without being supervised under the Insurance Acts.  Section 28 will mean that the insurance activities permitted to be carried on by friendly societies, and in section 29 by trade unions, will be strictly mutual self-help activities &mdash; of the sort which one associates with the <i>raison d'être</i> of these organisations anyhow.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 and 31 deal with the unfortunate aspects of insurance resulting from the demise of an insurer.  Section 30 is merely a precautionary measure to ensure that no petition can be presenated for the winding-up of an insurer without the Minister being involved or heard. There are a number of courses open to the Minister which could, in particular situations, be preferable to a winding-up &mdash; for example, the promotion of a takeover by another insurer.  In any event, it is right that the Minister, as insurance supervisory authority, should at least be aware of any proposed moves in the area of winding-up.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in Section 31 to alter the applicability of the insurance compensation fund.  The fund will continue to be available to the two existing companies under administration but no future administrator of a non-life insurer will have access to the fund.  The appointment of any further administrator is not foreseen but the legislative framework, which is in the Insurance (No. 2) Act of 1983, will stand.</P>
    <P>At present, in addition to administrators the fund can be used to meet claims arising in the liquidation of a non-life insurer.  In future, in any such liquidation the fund would support only non-commercial personal claimants, and in their case a limit of £650,000 or 65 per cent of the claim, whichever is the lesser, will be applied.  Furthermore, only liabilities in respect of policies issued in the State to cover risks situated in the State will be provided for.  Refunds of premiums will not be covered.</P>
    <P>These changes represent a significant reduction in the present levels of protection offered by the compensation fund.  For that reason they are not lightly proposed.  The changes are, however, absolutely necessary because the present <Col N="261" /> arrangements are quite simply too generous, exposing the fund to a potentially unlimited liability.  Adequate arrangements have been made to cater for all foreseeable demands arising from the present administration of two companies but it would be completely untenable to continue to leave the fund so exposed to any further demands.</P>
    <P>The current statutory arrangement under which the Minister strikes a maximum levy of 2 per cent on non-life premium income each year is the most that could reasonably be demanded of or borne by policy holders to provide against insolvencies on the part of insurance companies. Because of the proposed restrictions on who can benefit from the fund, in the interests of equity and consistency the 2 per cent levy will now be payable only on policies issued in the State to cover risks situated in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides, in the event of the winding-up of an insurer, for the granting of priority to the insurers' policyholders over those assets which the insurer is obliged to maintain to cover its liabilities to policyholders.</P>
    <P>Section 33 is simply a declaratory statement to confirm that an administrator appointed under section 2 of the Insurance Act of 1983 has the power to sell all or part of a company under administration and to run off any remaining part of the business, including the settlement of liabilities.</P>
    <P>Important new requirements in relation to actuaries are contained in section 34.  In future all life insurers with head offices in the State will be required to appoint an actuary to the company, if they do not have one already.  In practice most, if not all, such life companies already have an appointed actuary and actuarial staff.  All new life insurers, upon authorisation, will be similarly required to appoint an actuary.  Section 34 further gives formal statutory recognition to the status of the actuary in the company.  The Minister is also empowered to specify the qualifications and experience of the appointed actuary, and in this way to add to the existing actuary qualification rules set out in regulations made in 1940.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> The purpose of section 35 is to ensure that auditors notify my Department when they become aware of any difficulties, or potential problems, facing a client insurer.  I should stress that we are referring here to problems or difficulties which are likely to materially affect either the company's obligations to policyholders or their financial requirements under the Insurance Acts.  In deciding on the final provisions of this section, account was taken of the views expressed during our discussions with the bodies representing both the insurance industry and the accountancy professions.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is concerned with commissions paid to insurance intermediaries. The provisions in this part are based on similar provisions in the Insurance Bill, 1982, which was not proceeded with at that time because insurers arrived at a self-regulatory agreement on life insurance commissions.</P>
    <P>The reason the State should have the power to legislate for arrangments on remuneration between insurers and insurance intermediaries is obvious.  It is the policyholder who ultimately pays for the commissions paid to intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Excessively high levels of commission entail higher premiums or reduced benefits. There is also the danger that excessive commission levels can cause policies to be sold to unsuspecting clients on the basis of the return to the intermediary rather than on their intrinsic merit or appropriateness to the very needs of the client.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of infractions of the Commissions' Agreements over the years, mainly arising from extra monetary and other inducements such as holidays in the sun offered to intermediaries by insurance companies, in order to increase market share.  If this had proliferated, the consumer's interest would have been seriously threatened. For that reason I intervened in the most recent breakdown of the agreement following which there was a very welcome response from the industry.  This resulted in a new commission agreement being drawn up with effect from 1 August 1987. This agreement has the support of all the <Col N="263" /> life offices operating in the marketplace. In the Government's view it is highly preferable that the insurance industry should regulate themselves and that regulation must be effective and must be seen to be so.  This is the philosophy which underlies Part III of this Bill, the provisions of which are enabling.  It is not the intention to invoke these provisions unless the industry fails to regulate itself properly, in which event the Minister can have recourse to a range of highly effective measures.  Given the extremely sensitive nature of commissions agreements and the difficulty of maintaining and enforcing them, the insurers concerned accept that the powers now proposed are an essential back-up to the maintenance of voluntary market self-regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 36 enables the Minister to require an insurer to reduce commission payments to intermediaries where he considers levels to be excessive.</P>
    <P>Under section 37 the Minister has the power, when he considers it necessary in the public interest, to prohibit the payment of commission in the form of benefits in kind and indemnity commissions. This is essentially a reserve power and is not intended to cut across normal business relationships between insurers and intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Convictions for offences under section 36 and 37 are grounds for the revocation of authorisation of an insurer under section 38.</P>
    <P>Under section 39, a conviction under section 36 or 37 will result in a prohibition on the convicted party advertising his business for as long as commission levels are excessive.</P>
    <P>Section 40 makes it an offence, subject to certain in-built defences, for an intermediary to accept from an insurer a commission payment which is in contravention of either section 36 or section 37.</P>
    <P>Section 41 allows a person to seek a refund of premiums on a life policy where an excessive or prohibited commission was paid.</P>
    <P>Section 42 enables the Minister to <Col N="264" /> require information on commission payments from authorised insurers.</P>
    <P>While the emphasis on Part III of the Bill is very much on self regulation in the whole area of insurance commissions, it will be perfectly clear from the foregoing that a wide range of measures is available if circumstances warrant ministerial intervention at any time in the future. The objective is to maintain order in this sensitive area, whether by voluntary market self-regulation or by statutory control in the public interest should this prove necessary.</P>
    <P>Now we turn to Part IV which is the innovative Part of the Bill.  At present there are no provisions in statute governing insurance intermediaries, a generic grouping which forms an important pivotal link in the insurance chain.  The general thrust of what we are out to achieve here is the development of a self-regulatory framework for intermediaries, with the aim of raising standards in this area and the enhancement of mainly financial safeguards for customers in their dealings with intermediaries.  Let me say from the outset that the vast majority of insurance intermediaries conduct their business in a capable and responsible fashion.  However, there have been many calls in recent years from some quarters for provisions in law to deal with the difficulties that arise very occasionally in customers' dealings with insurance agents or brokers.</P>
    <P>The raising of standards is an important issue which I am aware is being pursued vigorously by the two bodies representing the broking profession.  High standards of integrity and professional competence are very desirable from the consumer's viewpoint and accordingly the efforts of the broker bodies are most commendable. The crucially important safeguard for the consumer, however, is financial protection in the event of failure on the part of the intermediary to meet such standards.  This was the fundamental concern of the government in their consideration of how best to deal with the whole area of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The primary concern is to protect the <Col N="265" /> consumer as far as practicable.  I emphasise &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  Legislation cannot reasonably be expected to cosset the man in the street from every possible adverse circumstance.  While, theoretically, a scheme of regulation could be designed to cater for all possible hazards in this area, in practice the direct and indirect costs and inevitable rigidity in any such system would result in a disservice to the consumer.  By outweighing the benefits conferred, such a scheme would be open to as much objection as the features it sought to remove.  The House will be aware of the many criticisms of this nature which have been levelled against the Financial Services Act in the UK for example, on the grounds that it is too doctrinaire and that the compliance costs involved are too high.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill includes the following provisions of a financial or accounting nature: first, the maintenance of separate client accounts by all intermediaries other than tied agents; second, the bonding requirements on intermediaries; third, the provisions in regard to the scope of an insurer's responsibility for his agents; fourth, the treatment of premiums paid to intermediaries, and fifth, the professional indemnity insurance provisions for brokers.</P>
    <P>The intention is that Part IV of the Bill will for the first time establish minimum desirable criteria for persons wishing to act as intermediaries be they tied agents, agents or insurance brokers, so as to protect consumers.</P>
    <P>Turning to the individual sections of Part IV, section 43 sets out the basic qualifications necessary for those wishing to act as insurance brokers and provides for recognition by the Minister of broker bodies.  A broker will have to be in a position to arrange insurance with at least five life insurers to act in the life sector or with at least five non-life insurers to act as a general broker.  These requirements are important and I am sure the House will accept that it is imperative for a broker to be able to offer an effective choice to the public.  The minimum level of five agencies should ensure this.</P>
    <P>Under section 44 the Minister may <Col N="266" /> require brokers to have professional indemnity insurance.  Of course all reputable brokers are already carrying such cover on grounds of commercial prudence. It is not the intention to impose a mandatory requirement until at least two years after the enactment of this legislation which will allow the market time to adjust and gear up to the new régime.</P>
    <P>Section 45 requires insurance companies to check both before initial agency appointments are granted and on a continuing basis in respect of payment of commission, for compliance by an intermediary with the provisions of the Bill or for membership of a recognised broker body.</P>
    <P>Skipping section 46 momentarily, if I may, section 47 obliges all intermediaries other than tied agents to keep a separate client bank account in respect of both life and non-life business.  Intermediaries will be required to lodge premiums entrusted to them by the public to such client accounts.</P>
    <P>Returning to section 46 &mdash; this requires intermediaries, other than tied agents, to hold a bond.  The idea of the bond is that moneys from it can be drawn down as compensation to clients of the intermediary in the event of the intermediary's collapse.  This is an important &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; for consumers.  The way in which the bond will work is that all insurance brokers and agents with an annual &ldquo;defined&rdquo; turnover of £25,000 (i.e. where a minimum of £25,000 is handled directly by an intermediary and passes through the new obligatory separate client bank account), will be required to hold a bond.  The bond level has been set at £25,000 for non-life, and at £25,000 or 25 per cent of defined turnover for life and composite intermediaries. The bond levels reflect the differing risks to which client moneys are exposed.</P>
    <P>The necessary basic qualifications for agents (including tied agents) and the obligations on them to identify themselves clearly to clients are set out at section 48.  One of these stipulations is that in future an insurance agent may not hold, in the case of both life and non-life <Col N="267" /> insurance, more than four agencies in either category.  This limitation is one of the features of the Bill which serves to distinguish agents from brokers and high-lights the more limited scope of the service which agents will be able to offer the public following its enactment.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of a register of appointed intermediaries by insurance companies for the purposes of public inspection is the subject of section 49.</P>
    <P>Section 50 clarifies the scope of agency in the case of both an agent and tied agent.  An insurer is liable for his agent where the latter completes or assists a client in completing an insurance proposal. The terms of the section also make an insurance company entirely responsible for the insurance-related activities of its tied agents as if such tied agents were its employees.</P>
    <P>This high level of an insurer's responsibility is maintained on consumer protection grounds in section 51 where a premium paid to an intermediary in respect of an accepted proposal or a policy of renewal is deemed to have been paid to the insurance company.</P>
    <P>Section 52 places restrictions on an intermediary conviction of an offence arising out of his business activities while section 53 lists the circumstances which disqualify a person from acting as an intermediary.  These provisions, I believe, are quite reasonable and prudent and are aimed at those who have proven their past actions that they do not have the necessary standards of professionalism, integrity or competence to act in a position of trust as insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Under section 54 the Minister can lay down codes of conduct for brokers and agents for observance in their dealings with the public or with insurance companies. I am aware that the existing broker bodies already lay down codes of conduct for their members and they are to be congratulated for their efforts. However, the codes proposed under this section will be applicable to all intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Section 55 exempts from the scope of <Col N="268" /> Part IV reinsurance business and travel agents and tour operators in so far as they sell insurance as part of overseas travel packages.  This is to avoid a duplication of statutory supervision and bonding in respect of this type of business.</P>
    <P>That completes Part IV of the Bill. When enacted, it will put in place a very comprehensive and structured system of regulation for intermediaries.  It will also facilitate the differentiation by the public between independent brokers and more limited agents.</P>
    <P>Part V is comprised of miscellaneous provisions.  Section 56 sets out the procedures which will be followed in relation to suspension or revocation of an insurer's authorisation and provides for an appeal by insurers to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Sections 57 and 58 concern the appointment and powers of authorised officers who may be appointed in order to obtain information for use by the Minister in exercising his functions under the Insurance Act.  These powers are enabling only and I do not envisage that they will be called into use in any immediate context or on any widespread basis. The final section in the Bill sets a fee of £10 for inspection of the register of authorisations kept under section 21 of the Insurance Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest problem we have in this country at present is the problem of unemployment.  All policy areas should be examined to see if they can make a positive contribution to improving our national performance with regard to the creation of jobs.  Employer' liability insurance is a major area in which the cost of creating jobs can be reduced. Credit has been taken for the improvement in the motor insurance market, but from information I have obtained there has been no equivalent improvement in the cost of employers' liability insurance or for public liability insurance.  The level of premium charged for employers' or public liability insurance is a major disincentive to the creation of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister quoted figures which indicated that there had <Col N="269" /> been a reduction in the cost of employers' liability insurance.  The source of the figures is the Confederation of Irish Industry, whose integrity I would not wish to question at all, but I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Confederation of Irish Industry tends to represent the larger employers in terms of the number employed.  I believe that the experience of the smaller employers is far from being one of improvement as far as employers' liability insurance is concerned.</P>
    <P>Over the past few days I have been speaking to a number of brokers all of whom tell the tale of an improvement with regard to motor insurance but no equivalent improvement at all with regard to public liability insurance or employers' liability insurance.  The brokers take the view that the improvement that has occurred with regard to motor insurance is due not so much to the measures taken directly by the Government, although I am sure these are part of the picture, but to the entry of a new company into that market &mdash; a company that was not underwriting motor business before.  There has been no similar new entrant into the field of employers' liability and public liability insurance and the problem continues to be acute in that area.</P>
    <P>I am aware, for example, of one small contractor who previously ran a business in England.  He employed seven men and he paid an insurance premium for the seven men of £850.  He transferred his business to Ireland and is now employing only two people but he has to pay an employers' liability insurance premium for his two employees of £4,000.  He was paying only £850 for employers' liability insurance for seven people in Britain. Insurance premia like that which are directly related to employment actively discourage job creation.  These premia are also reflected in the cost of all sorts of goods which we, the consumers, buy from small firms who have to pay such high premia for employers' liability insurance.  There is a knock-on effect right throughout the economy.</P>
    <P>The position is, as I have said, <Col N="270" /> especially severe in this country for small employers.  Experience in the United States and elsewhere shows that the small businesses are the most dynamic in the creation of jobs yet it is the small businesses that face the highest relative insurance premia in Ireland.  I understand that the minimum premium that a person engaged in the building trade could expect to pay for employers' liability insurance for an employee would be £3,000 a year.  Unless we do something about this we will have great difficulty in solving our unemployment problem: which requires radical action.</P>
    <P>The level of premium is of course related to the level of awards.  If the courts give high awards this attracts more people to make claims.  If the awards were small, people might not bother to make claims.  Thus it is a vicious circle; the higher the awards the greater the number of claims, one factor reinforces the other.  The abolition of juries was supposed to have the effect of reducing the level of claims and awards.  There is some evidence that it may not have this effect at all.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things that can be done to reduce insurance premia and thereby assist in the creation of jobs.  I will refer to things further on that have already been done or are in the course of action.  I believe there is a strong case for changing substantially the provisions of section 2 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Under this section, in awarding damages a court shall not take any account of any other sum payable to the injured party in respect of the injury under, for example, a contract of insurance or any other gratuity that somebody may receive as a result of the injury.  This essentially provides for the possibility of double payment.  Surely this is not necessary and should be changed. Likewise, payments made under the social welfare code, to which the injured party is entitled, are disregarded entirely as if they were not being made in the settlement of the amount of the award for damages.</P>
    <P>The whole system of arriving at decisions and setting the level of damages <Col N="271" /> in regard to claims is extremely expensive and slow.  I would suggest that we introduce a tribunal similar to the Criminal Injuries Tribunal or the Stardust Tribunal for quickly setting awards for injuries in a non-adversarial fashion or at least in as non-adversarial a fashion as possible.  The tribunals I mentioned dealt with individual cases at about five times as fast a rate as does the High Court in the carrying out of normal business. A case was settled before one of those tribunals, to the satisfaction of all concerned, in half on hour before part time barristers who were sitting on these tribunals &mdash; I am talking about the Criminal Injuries Tribunal in this case.  Cases were settled in half an hour that would take a whole day to settle in the High Court.  If we could move over to such a system this would benefit everybody, claimants as well as insurers.  Claimants would not have to wait as long for their money and they would not have to pay as much to get the award because there would not be the same heavy level of representation, if any, as there is before the courts at present.  Insurers would also see matters settled more speedily and efficiently.  If we could move in that direction everybody would gain.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that difficulties would arise in a tribunal approach as long as the concept of fault is retained in determining whether or not damages are to be paid.  I would point out that a tribunal format can be used even in dealing with cases of fault.  In the case of the Criminal Injuries Tribunal, it was able to look at liability issues even where there was a fault involved because it had the responsibility, for example, of assessing, in the event of somebody suffering a criminal injury in an affray, the extent, if any, to which they had contributed to that situation.  If they started a fight and they were injured their responsibility in the matter &mdash; their fault relative to the fault of the person who injured them &mdash; is assessed by the Criminal Injuries Tribunal and an appropriate deduction is made.  The tribunal is able to look not <Col N="272" /> just at the quantum of damages but also at the contributory factors which might reduce it.  The retention of a fault-based insurance system is not in itself an obstacle to moving over to tribunals for the setting of awards in cases like this.</P>
    <P>There is substantial evidence that many cases are settled by insurance companies on the basis of claims that are put to them even though the insurance company is fairly convinced that the claim is unfounded.  Because it is a relatively small amount that is being claimed and they do not want the bother of having to go to court to prove that the claim is unfounded they settle the case.  The cost to the insurance company of going to court and the possible risk that they might lose are such that they pay on the basis of claims made even though those claims are not necessarily well founded.  That sort of thing would not happen if there was a tribunal because the tribunal would not be as expensive and there would be relatively less cost to both parties in dealing with claims for damages.  If people felt that there was not a genuine case there would be no great disincentive to them in having that settled by a tribunal which would be doing the business pretty quickly anyway.</P>
    <P>The problem with a tribunal of this kind is of course that it would not work if people had the right to appeal to the ordinary courts against any award from a tribunal with which they were not satisfied. To avoid this there would need to be a major change in the whole concept of civil liability.  Ideally one might wish to introduce such changes only for certain categories of injury &mdash; for example, if one wanted, as I believe one should, to reduce the cost of creating work one might wish to start off by saying that we will have a tribunal to settle employers' and employees' liability insurance cases rather than the courts system.  That would reduce the cost from every point of view. Constitutional difficulties might arise in doing that in the sense that it would be argued under the provisions of Article 40 of the Constitution that you could not treat one category of injury, just because it occurred in the workplace, differently <Col N="273" /> from the same injury which occurred outside the workplace, allowing people access to the courts for one and access only to a tribunal for the other even though the injury was similar in its effect.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that ought to be examined as a matter of priority by the Law Reform Commission to see if there are ways of introducing into the system a tribunal approach, possibly containing limitations on the amount of damages that can be awarded in respect of particular injuries in order to reduce the cost of employers' liability and thereby creating more jobs.  One suggestion is that in the case of employers' liability insurance tort damages might be done away with and a State-run system of scaled compensation introduced.  This would incorporate a tribunal.  Damages would no longer be a justifiable issue. This might be necessary in that one cannot limit judges as one could limit a tribunal in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another alternative would be to introduce schemes under the Arbitration Acts.  In other words, there would be an agreement to use arbitrators only rather than the courts to settle damages issues. Such schemes would of course have to be agreed between the employer and the employee in advance.  It could be part of normal contracts of employment that damages in respect of industrial injuries would be settled by arbitration rather than by recourse to the courts and both parties would agree to forego their other normal constitutional rights of access to the court in order to reach agreement on the creation of a particular employment. That is something that also needs to be considered by the Minister in conjunction with the trade union movement and the employer interests.</P>
    <P>Many people might claim that the trade union movement is interested only in its existing workforce and therefore anything that might reduce the possibility for them of obtaining substantial damages is something the trade union movement <i>per se</i> would not be prepared to go along with.  I would take a different view.  At the moment at least, the trade union movement is interested in getting the <Col N="274" /> maximum number of members.  The more people there are employed, the more potential trade unionists there are. If employers' liability insurance inhibits employment, it is adverse to the interests of trade unions because it results in a smaller pool of people who might be capable of becoming active trade union members.  I hope the trade union movement would support measures to improve the position in regard to employers' liability insurance and reduce the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that there are not a great deal of other matters that could be undertaken to improve the position, such as the rigorous enforcement of the law in regard to safety at work.  That is a matter which I do not think we need to refer to in this debate because, it is not a matter of controversy; it is simply a question of getting the legislation in place and there is common cause on that.</P>
    <P>One should, however, not rest at that. There are other things that could be done such as those I have outlined so far.  There is a lot to be said for awarding compensation to those who suffer injuries in the form of monthly or weekly annuities rather than in the form of a lump sum. An annuity would be more flexible.  It would not have the arbitrary character of a lump sum where a view has to be taken about potential lost earnings for the next 50 years and these incorporated into a sum of money that is given now.  It is possible that the annuity could be either increased or decreased depending on the circumstances of the injured party, and it would obviously have to be indexed linked.  It could take account, over time, of the evolving medical situation as related to the original injury.</P>
    <P>Obviously insurance companies might not be too happy with a system of annuities in substitution for lump sums.  Their auditors would have difficulty in saying exactly what liability they faced in respect of a particular annuity because they would not know how long the individual in question was going to live, whereas they would have certainty and finality in regard to a lump sum once it was paid. For this reason some have argued that <Col N="275" /> the State is the only body that could underwrite a system of annuities if we were to move over to annuities in place of lump sums as a basis for compensation for injury.  This is a matter that ought to be examined closely by the Law Reform Commission or by the Minister and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We must also relate this entire area of insurance &mdash; what we are broadly speaking about now, the issue of employers' liability insurance &mdash; and insurance generally to the creation of the Single European market in 1992.  If Irish employers' liability and public liability insurance costs are more expensive than those in competitor countries we will lose business on export markets and on our home market.  The legislation we have before us tightens up the supervision of insurance companies.  However, is there not a danger that if companies from other countries can sell insurance in Ireland &mdash; as they will be able to very soon in relation to mass risks, that is, very large risks &mdash; they will be able to cut prices relative to insurers here if the level of the supervisory requirement in their state is less severe than the one that applies in Ireland?  Is there not such a danger indeed in the entire financial area that competition in the single market will take place on the basis of what I would describe as competitive laxity of supervision? Perhaps, to use the old adage, bad money will drive out the good in the single market of 1992 in so far as financial services are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a problem because the EC proposes that the supervision of insurance companies, and indeed other financial institutions, will be the responsibility of the individual member state in which the company has its original home; there will be home country control.  This will apply even if the overwhelming bulk of its business is actually being written in other member states.  Will there be sufficiently rigorous standards of supervision applied uniformly throughout the EC and validated by somebody independent of the national supervisory authorities to ensure that there are no dangers <Col N="276" /> of competitive laxity of supervision?  Let us remember that the market will be an extremely competitive one.  Once they are not able to keep out people from other member states, supervisers in individual member states if they continue to be more rigorous in requirements as to the amount of money, solvency margins, the amount of information that must be required and all sorts of things like that than people in a neighbouring state who are writing business into this state, will be accused by the people they are supervising, whose home, if one likes, is in this state, of putting them at a relative disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> other people with whom they are competing on the high street and whose home country is more lenient.  Is there not, therefore, a real risk of competitive laxity of supervision?</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that this is not a concern that is confined to myself.  At a recent conference I attended the Italian Minister for Finance, Signor Colombo referred specifically to the problem of the possibility of competitive laxity of supervision &mdash; that was not the term he used but it was what he meant. It is something we need to look at very closely in regard to this Bill.  The Minister's speech is extremely deficient in that it does not give an outline of the relative safeguards and provisions in the insurance law of other member states in respect of each of the requirements that are being introduced in this Bill.  We should know, in respect of every one of those provisions that have been made, how they compare with the provisions in Britain and other states with which we are competing, because otherwise we do not know whether we are putting our insurers at a relative advantage or disadvantage by these requirements.</P>
    <P>Insurance is an area in which substantial jobs can be created if we can ensure that there is a genuinely level playing field and that Irish insurance companies operate in an efficient fashion. How will our insurance companies be able to compete against overseas competition in the light of the handicaps they have now?  Other countries do not impose <Col N="277" /> handicaps similar to the ones I am now about to advert to.  First, our companies suffer exchange control restrictions which require them to get consent to invest money overseas in order to maximise returns.  That delays them in obtaining the best possible return relative to competitors.  It is not that they do not get the consent, they have to apply for it. They lose time and thus money.</P>
    <P>Secondly, Irish insurers have to pay the ICI-PMPA levy, part of which goes to rescue a company which writes a lot of business overseas, to keep that company going so that, <i>inter alia,</i> overseas customers of the ICI do not lose business. Therefore, the Irish insurance market, the Irish consumer of insurance, is providing a service to all of those who were customers of the ICI in London.  Does that not raise a general problem of asking ourselves if, for instance, in the event of a company, based in Portugal developing a huge business in this country and then collapsing, the Portuguese authorities would stand behind that company and its Irish customers in order to keep it going and afloat in the same way as the Irish authorities did in the case of the ICI collapse?  If not, is there to be uncertainty? Should there not be a clear policy in Europe in regard to this matter?  The policy should either be that all companies which go bust shall go bust and no one shall pay anything or if there is to be genuine intermingling of business between one country and another, there should be a common system of compensation or maintenance in operation. It does not seem feasible to think that a small country in which a huge business is developed would have the resources to keep that business afloat in the event of it collapsing.  That is something we need to look at.  What would be the future of levies of the kind we mention &mdash; I mentioned the ICI-PMPA levy &mdash; in a Europe where there was freedom to provide services right across all boundaries?</P>
    <P>Thirdly, Irish insurance companies have to pay corporation tax at a rate which is eight points higher than the equivalent British rate, yet they are supposed to compete with them.  Fourthly, they <Col N="278" /> have to pay a 1 per cent levy on insurance premia which is designed to raise money for that most reputable person, the Minister for Finance.  Fifthly, and this probably applies in other countries also, there is a requirement to localise reserves, in other words, to keep some of the money in the home country.  That is not a great problem at present because quite good returns can be earned by keeping one's money in Ireland and depositing it with the Minister for Finance but, arguably, there are better returns to be earned in London where interest rates are higher. Therefore, the returns on the investment income of an insurance company based in Britain, if it can obtain the returns on the London market in respect of its reserves, are better than the returns on the investment income of a company located in Dublin because it is confined in respect of its reserves to the Dublin market where interest rates are lower. Assuming there is no exchange risk, that creates a possible disadvantage in regard to the optimisation of returns, in regard to investment income, which in turn puts the company at a disadvantage in respect of writing insurance business.</P>
    <P>Those are five areas on which in an open market it could be argued that our companies are liable to be at a disadvantage. The Minister might indicate in his response how he sees these being overcome and how he sees the Irish insurance industry developing as an export earner between now and the end of the century.  That should be the perspective within which the Minister should be looking at the insurance industry at present.  My strongest criticism of the Government in regard to their campaign in respect of 1992, and this is a criticism I would direct particularly at the Department of Industry and Commerce, is that it is manufacturing obsessed at present. There is a roadshow going around which consists mainly of agencies which are concerned with helping manufacturing industry, yet there is no similar campaign as regards how the insurance industry or the service sector can develop, respond to or face difficulties from the open market.  It is all geared towards manufacturing, yet <Col N="279" /> the bigger difficulties and opportunities are not in manufacturing at all but in the service sector.  Nineteen ninety-two arrived for the manufacturing sector in 1966 when the Free Trade Agreement was signed.  I do not think 1992 is going to make that much difference to manufacturing, yet that is what the campaign is all about.  It should be about how industries such as the insurance industry can develop in the period up to and following 1992.</P>
    <P>It seems that insurance is an area in which Ireland should be aiming to gain market share in Europe.  Insurance does not suffer from the infrastructural disadvantages of remoteness from the market, cost of transport and so forth, which affect manufacturing.  Insurance can be written over the phone from any one place to another, unlike manufactured goods.  It should be a big development area for employment in Ireland.  Unfortunately, I fear it will not be.  The Irish insurance industry has a protectionist outlook.  They have the same attitudes of mind which manufacturers had in the fifties.  They want protection from outside competition and the Department of Industry and Commerce go along with this, unfortunately. I know from experience that there is always a tendency to want to get exceptions from EC directives when we should be taking the view, and responsibility for this lies ultimately with the Minister, that it was a mistake in retrospect not to have said from the beginning that we would accept full freedom of services in the insurance area instead of trying to protect ourselves.  We have not protected anything in the long run, we have simply reinforced our conservative attitude of mind in the insurance industry when we should have had an expansionist attitude of mind.  We should see insurance as a major job growth area.  The Government need to get together with the industry to ask how the opportunities of 1992 will be exploited for job creation.</P>
    <P>The recent EC deal whereby big companies seeking insurance can shop around in Europe for cover, the so-called mass <Col N="280" /> risks, whereas small companies are confined to the home market &mdash; they must deal with the companies established here &mdash; is not one which is good for small firms relative to large firms.  I question whether it is good for a country like Ireland which has a small insurance market and a proportionately large amount of small firms to have a system whereby small firms in big countries have access to the big companies whereas small firms in this country only have access to the few companies which are established here.  This deal is putting small companies in small countries at a relative disadvantage to small companies in large countries and to larger companies in small countries.  I ask whether it is in the national interest that we should have taken that position.  Of course it is not too late to change.  The fact that it has been agreed to and we have obtained the exemption does not require us to use it.  I think that this is something the Minister might discuss with his colleagues to see whether the firms he is trying to promote in the science and technology area would be better served by being able to shop around more widely for insurance than they have to do at present as a result of the agreement reached in regard to the lack of competition for smaller risks.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to introduce fees for insurance company supervision.  I note that this would only cover the cost of supervision.  I would be interested to know how those fees will be differentiated. Will they be differentiated by individual companies?  In other words, will a company that is giving a lot of trouble have to pay a larger fee than a company that does not have to answer any questions because its accounts are always perfect or will it be the same fee for all?  If it will be the same fee for all, then a good company will be subsidising a bad one.  Are such fees charged in other member states and, if not, are we not putting our companies at a relative disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other states?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the reasonable thing to do would be to have a Europeanwide scale of fees for supervisory services, the same fee in all member states. <Col N="281" /> We should have this matter regulated so that no country will be able to give artificial subsidies to its insurance industry competing in the European market by not charging a fee for supervision while other countries charge a fee.  The unilateral introduction of fees, it seems to me, has potential for putting those paying them, and the countries charging them, at a relative disadvantage in the market. In itself it will not make that much difference but when added to the other disadvantages I mentioned it could make a difference.</P>
    <P>Obviously, as the Minister pointed out, the insurance industry is the biggest customer of our legal system.  Without the insurance industry our legal eagles would, perhaps, be somewhat less employed than they are.  It is no harm to look at our court system in the context of 1992, as was pointed out recently.  I quote from a paper presented by Commissioner Peter Sutherland to a seminar in Dublin on the legal implications of 1992, sponsored by the Irish Centre for European Law.  Commissioner Sutherland said:</P>
    <P>Finally let me develop a further general consideration.  If, as I have argued, the law will become increasingly international, then there will inevitably develop forum shopping.</P>
    <P>In other words, people will choose whether to have their dispute settled in an Irish court, in an Italian court or a French court because many contracts will now involve parties in each of those countries, and maybe more.  Commissioner Sutherland went on to ask:</P>
    <P>How does the Irish legal system compare, as a system for the provision of rapid, efficient and authoritative judgments with other legal systems? How do Irish legal costs compare? What is to prevent the Irish legal system from becoming a centre of excellence within the European framework?</P>
    <P>To illustrate the likely opportunites for this type of issue to be relevant, where people would decide what court to do their business in, I quote from another <Col N="282" /> paper presented at the same seminar by John Temple Lang who stated:</P>
    <P>If a manufacturer is liable, under the EC Directive on liability for defective products, for a serious defect in widely sold goods, [perhaps sold in five or six member states] it may be sued in at least 12 different jurisdictions (there are more jurisdictions in the Community than there are member states).</P>
    <P>If that is the case there will be increased pressure for the harmonisation both of substantive law and of procedure in member states.  Many people will rightly regard it as absurd that the amount of damages recovered for the same injury caused by the same product produced by the same firm might be five times as much as if the case was heard in an Irish court as it would be if the case was heard in a British court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  The factor I have just referred to needs to be looked at.  In looking for improvements in the court system, which the Minister is doing in order to improve the cost of insurance, he might also consider putting to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to the judges and the lawyers, that in the <Col N="283" /> Europe of 1992 they will be competing for business in international contracts with court systems in other countries.  There is no reason why our court system should not potentially be an earner of foreign exchange just as our insurance or manufacturing sectors are.  That is something the Minister should consider.  In this context I should like to ask why the Minister for Justice has been so slow in introducing improved provisions for pre-trial procedures. About 18 months ago we were told that legislation was being prepared. I understand that this will be dealt with in a court officers Bill but I should like to know when it will be introduced.</P>
      <P>Section 20 deals with the qualifications of directors and managers.  In other EC directives insurers seeking authorisation are required to submit details of proposed directors and managers and the Minister does not authorise the insurer if he has an objection to any such person proposed. The Minister may decide not to grant an authorisation if he is unhappy with the suitability of such a person.  I should like to know how this will work. Will the Minister say he does not like a person because he has a fast manner or that he does not look like the type of person that should be dealing with insurance?  Will he decide on the basis that the suit of the individual has not been pressed or on his casual attitude to life? Will the Minister say that because a person does not have a degree he could not possibly be an insurer.  Will he say that if a person is not a barrister or have some other degree he could not be an insurer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably there will have to be some criteria but what will they be when deciding whether an individual is suitable or not?  It seems to me that there are all types of possibilities for extremely subjective judgments to be made and those judgments will not be open to question by anybody.  It may be said that Deputy Enright was suitable to conduct insurance but that Deputy Cullen was not.  Will Deputy Cullen be ruled out because he may have had a string of debts?  If that is the case it will be too late.  If we wait for <Col N="284" /> a person to run up debts before we say he or she is not suitable we are slamming the door after the horse has bolted.  Presuming that this section is intended as a preventive measure what criteria will be used?  If the Minister cannot answer that, can he indicate what criteria are used in the other member states where such a provision exists?</P>
    <P>There is another provision in this Bill with regard to the display of the level of premium that is being charged.  We have a tendency in this house to make laws which we subsequently do not enforce. We are great law makers but not great law enforcers.  Who will enforce this? Will it be the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the insurance section of his Department?  There are not any people in the insurance section of the Department who regularly travel around the country.  They are all too busy with their quill pens and candles, reading the accounts submitted to them, that they have not the time.  I will not say they do not have the inclination because that would be a slur, but they do not travel around and inspect insurance offices in Kenmare or Cahir and so on.  If they are not going to enforce this, who is?  If the Director of Consumer Affairs is to do it, will the Minister get in extra staff to deal with the extra responsibility?  At the moment other price display provisions are not well enforced.  I am not criticising the Minister as I know he has not the staff.  There are display orders with regard to drink prices which are more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  I hope these provisions will be properly enforced.</P>
    <P>The speech delivered here today has a remarkable resemblence to the Second Stage speech in the Seanad debate of 8 October 1987.  Some of the good lines have even been reproduced from the previous speech.  The script writer has not changed.  One could almost believe that a word processor had been used.  However, one section in the last speech was dropped in this speech and that was the statement made at column 262 of the Seanad debate of 8 October 1987 which said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The Minister for the Environment plans to introduce new legislation to strengthen the road traffic code and to deal more effectively with certain aspects of uninsured driving and other offences.</P>
    <P>What has happened to that legislation? Why has that reference been dropped from the speech?  Has the Minister given up?  Is the Minister for the Environment so busy coping with other problems, perhaps deciding whether a sports hall in Westport is more deserving than one in Castlebar, that he has no time to devote to road traffic legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing now with a Bill which is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised that that section is still in the speech. What is the status of that legislation?  We now have compulsory product liability insurance.  I understand from discussions with some brokers that it is difficult enough to get employers' liability insurance, that some companies are prepared to give employers' liability insurance but they will not write product liability.  Given that this is a new scene, will the Minister outline the availability of product liability insurance and will he give an indication of the relative cost of the product liability insurance that is being offered here for certain products as against product liability insurance being offered for the same products in other member states?  Is there a danger that this will be a further disadvantage, costwise, to Irish industry?  I also understand that there are problems with regard to certain categories of insurance.  I am told, for instance, that wood working insurance is impossible to obtain here and that the only place a woodworker will get insurance is from Lloyds of London.  I also understand that difficulties have arisen with regard to the insurance of sports and community halls and so on. One company was operating block insurance for this sort of business but that <Col N="286" /> company is not in the market anymore and that type of business is now more selective.  Will the Minister report on the availability of insurance in that area in his reply?</P>
      <P>I would also raise questions with regard to the relative burdens imposed on brokers as against agents under the provisions of this Bill.  If a person selling insurance operates for fewer than four life insurance companies and four non-life insurance companies, he can qualify as an agent for whom the requirements are less onerous, whereas if he operates for more than four of each, he must fulfil the more onerous requirements that apply to brokers.  It has been represented to me that many people will opt to become agents.  Brokers will shed one or two companies and will thereby get themselves below the relevant limit.  A distortion of that kind is something that must be avoided.  Has the Minister considered having some sort of sliding scale of requirements whereby there would not be a point at which it would be advantageous to artifically shed one or two companies in order to qualify for substantially less onerous requirements in regard to bonding and so forth?</P>
      <P>This is very important and useful legislation. It is non-contentious but it affords an opportunity to raise a number of issues of a more general relevance.  The Insurance Act of 1978 contains a provision with regard to guarantees.  The reference here is essentially to export credit guarantees which the Minister may grant.  The Minister may stand behind certain guarantees.  Do I understand that as a result of 1992 the Minister will have to offer the facilities of the 1978 Act to insurers operating or coming from any part of the EC?  I may have misunderstood but I understand that at the moment under the provisions of the present Act the Minister only grants such insurance guarantees in respect of insurers resident here.  Will the Minister clarify that?  If there is a requirement to change our law in that regard to comply with EC requirements, it would be desirable to do it in this Bill rather than in a new Bill later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="287" />
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the introduction of this Bill.  This is very important primary legislation. The Bill will have a direct impact on the insurance industry and on those who seek insurance.  For a long number of years we have been aware of the high cost of insurance.  This has been referred to already in the House today, as have the damaging effects on individuals and on industries.  Recent legislation that has gone through this House has begun the process of seriously restructuring many of the areas that led to the high cost, most notably in the motor insurance sector.</P>
      <P>There are some very important changes occurring in this area and there are some points that I would like to make. There is no doubt that we all welcome the lowering of premiums in the motor insurance area which is long overdue. There are at the moment legitimate concerns that in some instances premiums may be dropping and halving too fast.  I fully appreciate that it is not the Minister's position, nor should it be, to interfere with legitimate and fair competition in the marketplace.  We would all agree that this would be a healthy and necessary objective.  Competition for the sake of competition, without due regard to the specific type of business can be dangerous and could ultimately lead to serious problems once again in the motor insurance sector.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that the recent legislative changes will have an impact on the insurance industry &mdash; the Minister referred earlier today to the Courts Bill and the abolition of the use of civil juries in personal injury and fatal accident cases will indeed have an impact, as the motor insurance industry has been telling us for a long number of years, on the high costs of court awards.  However, this is only very recent legislation and whilst one might expect a move to begin in the area of lower premiums, a stampede is occurring in certain areas in the need for new business, perhaps not paying sufficient attention to where the industry is going and what costs are being incurred by certain insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> I question whether the large overnight reductions that we are witnessing in some instances are based more on hope than what might really be happening in the marketplace.  People are too soon anticipating the possible benefits that may accrue in the time ahead and this is very dangerous.  I am not saying that this is occurring throughout the insurance industry but it is something which is occurring in certain areas and in certain companies.  The Department should look very closely into this matter.  The type of legislative changes that have occurred should have a more long term effect. They are not designed nor, were they expected to have, immediate dramatic reduction such as we are seeing at present.  I want the Minister to examine this area and ensure that proper financial stability is maintained at all levels.  I believe that the reduction in premiums should be a more staged and planned operation, occurring over a longer period of time, based on what exactly is occurring in the marketplace rather than what one might want to occur.  It is of vital importance that the insurance industry remain on a solid footing and that none of the debacles of the past be allowed to repeat themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister will agree that in the present state of change very close monitoring by his Department is necessary.  I am concerned, for instance, at some insurance companies operating who seem to be totally unconcerned about the track record of their newer clients.  This begs the question, is it business at any price?  The consequences of this kind of attitude getting out of control are all too obvious and all the solid legislation being introduced in many areas would be for nought.</P>
    <P>One of the great problem areas here today &mdash; this has also been referred to &mdash; is the cost of public liability insurance.  I have no doubt that this cost factor has greatly inhibited many new young and fledgling businesses from getting off the ground.  I believe that it has even dissuaded many new and young entrepreneurs from starting up businesses.  We all agree that the greatest single probem <Col N="289" /> here is the question of unemployment and job creation.  Any area that could possibly hamper job creation must be tackled vigorously.  The Minister has mentioned the drop in payroll costs with regard to public liability insurance, but is this sufficient?  The whole question of the hindrances that are in place in the marketplace against job creation must be tackled individually.  Any sector that is seen to impact on this area must be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>It is a fair comment to make that public liability insurance costs are not dropping as one would expect and that the type of competition that will be available in the near future will be substantial.  I do not understand how in certain countries public liability insurance can be at a fraction of the costs here today.  This is having a serious effect on businesses.  One could highlight many areas where public liability insurance is practically unobtainable, or if you can get a quotation for public liability insurance the cost is so prohibitive as not to warrant going into that business at all.  I have examples, as I am sure others have.  Shipping, for instance, is a very good example having regard to the difficulties of getting a stevedoring company to operate in this country.  One simply cannot get public liability insurance and this is impingeing on certain ports which have gone through tough times in the last number of years, not least the port in my own constituency of Waterford, in their attempts to get back on their feet.  This is a serious factor with regard to the creation of much needed employment in this area.  I shall not highlight example after example, but the examples are there.  This is a fundamental issue that must be tackled when looking at the whole question of insurance.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that in recent years the standards of safety on the factory floor have greatly improved but much more can be achieved.  There is no doubt that many industrial accidents could be avoided by adopting much higher safety practices. This should be one of the main priorities of any union operating here. Unions are primarily about gaining work and protecting the existing work of their <Col N="290" /> members.  Surely it is in their interests to strive for the best possible safe in-work practices.  That is a prerequisite for creating jobs.  I have heard very little comment on this matter from the unions when they begin to discuss and negotiate and seek to improve standards.  There is very little emphasis on the area of safety within companies.</P>
    <P>Because of the introduction of many multinational companies into this country in recent years, standards have improved and many Irish companies have sought also to improve their standards.  One could imagine, if the highest possible standards were attained in this area, the dramatic effect that this would have on insurance costs.  What is often neglected or overlooked is the fact that it is preventative measures that can have the largest impact on reducing premiums.</P>
    <P>The other factor, as we are all too aware, is the people who do not pay insurance at all.  This has been a huge concern over the last number of years and has been the greatest contributory factor in the raising of premiums in the motor insurance business here today. Driving without motor insurance is simply unacceptable and cannot be tolerated at any level.  Efforts have been made in the past seriously to tackle this problem and the introduction of the insurance type tax disc is a step in the right direction.  A high profile by the Garda Síochána is always welcome here. I have noticed in the recent past that, given all the strains on their resources, they seem to be paying much attention to this question in recent weeks, having been stopped on a number of different roads throughout the country in the last fortnight.  This is to be commended and certainly helps in catching those who are not paying insurance.</P>
    <P>Those who are obeying the law and paying insurance premiums are subsidising all those who flout the law and pay no attention to public safety and standards. These expect everybody else to carry the can for them.  They must be rooted out of the system and the penalties to the full letter of the law implemented. <Col N="291" /> There should be a mandatory jail sentence for anybody here who drives without insurance.  Any excuses that I have heard over the last number of years, from people coming to me seeking help, have been unsatisfactory.  There is no satisfactory answer.  If you want to drive on our roads, you pay your insurance.  In my opinion there is no other debate or argument that would suffice.</P>
    <P>The ceasing of this practice will be the greatest single factor in helping to reduce insurance premiums.  Carelessness and an uncaring attitude in the workplace must also be rooted out.  Improvements in this area and better standards would ultimately lead to better productivity, better company atmosphere, better products and better profits and more employees.  These things are part of the added value of industrial success that is continually talked about nowadays.  It is no longer true that the cheapest product equates to the best value.  In the changing world there are many more factors which now equate for value for money and this is as relevant to the insurance industry as to any other industry in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also referred in his speech to the regulation on the number of counsel.  This is obviously a step in the right direction and I hope the Bar will see fit to completely regulate itself in this area and that no further action will be necessary.  This can only enhance the cost of insurance and the cost of claims and what the public have to face.  One of the important matters which has been referred to today is the book of quantum of damages.  This is an urgent requirement in this country.  In my lifetime in the Dáil &mdash; which is not very long &mdash; it has been talked about and I am sure it has been talked about in the preceding years.  It is obvious that without a proper book of quantum of damages it is virtually impossible to get some kind of a regualtory measure into what levels of insurance payments, in terms of findings in the courts, should be paid out.  This system operates in many other countries and is very satisfactory.  In one sense it <Col N="292" /> may not be the total answer but it goes along way down the road to speeding up the claims where serious delays are involved.  This system is operated in the UK.  There is an onus on those involved in the Bar and in the Incorporated Law Society to produce a book of quantum of damages.  I agree with the Minister firmly that it is not up to the State to go ahead in this area.  This has been done in many other countries by the professions themselves. In dealing with this Bill today the message should go out that this is urgently required and that we would expect action in this area as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The system of pre-trial procedures has been referred to.  I do not see anything happening in that regard though it has been mentioned constantly.  It is an obvious factor that could be dealt with before a case comes to trial.  The enormous amount of time and delays involved could be avoided and the costs involved would be substantially reduced.  Consequently, insurance premium costs would in turn be substantially reduced.  These seem the more logical factors.  It is a question now of moving into the real phase of actually acting in these areas.  I think we will get fed up of coming back into the Dáil if we are to continually repeat these requests and refer to them as if something is happening. We want to see action in these areas and the action can be brought about by the people involved in the business but pressure from the Government could also help to speed up these matters.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with the point mentioned earlier by Deputy Bruton regarding the payment of claims by annuity.  It would be a discriminating way of paying insurance claims.  After all high insurance claims indicate that somebody has been very severely injured and is incapable of earning a living to their full potential&mdash; as they were before the accident &mdash; and in many cases have to spend large sums of money in either refurbishing their home or buying a mode of transport which they may have to operate if they are to be effective within society.  It would be very difficult to put in place a structure as to who should get what, as to where they should get it and when they should <Col N="293" /> get it.  I can see the point which is being driven at here, the certain advantages that could occur in that area, but there would need to be serious exploration as to how this would be structured if it was to be successful.  Otherwise, it could lead to very serious problems.  One must not forget that the change in the financial and insurance world in the last number of years has led to a huge impact in the type and range of facilities available to people in insurance, financing and so on.</P>
    <P>Most people who receive large sums of money by way of settlement nowadays do not fritter needlessly the windfall, if that is what one would call it.  Nowadays, people take sound advice and the moneys are properly invested to provide for their future as was originally intended for the funds in the first place.</P>
    <P>This Bill has seen many changes since it was introduced and there will probably be many more amendments before it is passed by this House.  Section 3 is an important provision.  It lays down the deterrents which will make it unattractive for an individual or a company to seek to play outside the rules.  I wonder if the penalties and the criteria are sufficient but that is something we will deal with on Committee Stage.  It is only right that any individual working within a company who knowingly breaks the law should be brought to account.  It is also important that the Minister and his Department should be rigorous in ensuring that no false declarations or reports are made and that if such have been committed, the Minister is single-minded in regard to employing the full letter of the law.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is the key to the question of whether an insurance company is running its business efficiently or is running into major problems.  There is another area that could be covered in this section which relates to what losses the company are forecasting in underwriting in the immediate years ahead.  Are the figures realistic?  Are they based on what is happening in the marketplace at present and are they based on the realities of what is happening within the framework of that company?</P>
    <P>At Question Time today I sought to <Col N="294" /> question the Minister and to highlight what I believe is an individual case where serious questions can be raised concerning the long term planning and financial stability of some sectors of the insurance business.  I think I have said enough on this area and I hope there will be a response when the Minister replies to this debate.</P>
    <P>It is of crucial importance that premiums must cover the predicted losses at any given time as a central part of planning and operating any insurance company. Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill which deal with the separation of assets and liabilities attributable to life assurance business is a very important step.  It makes for a much cleaner and sounder business if the funds are representing the life assurance aspect of the business and, indeed, if the liabilities can be seen and that this fund must be maintained separately and not used for other purposes. The next number of sections dealing with the Minister's power to intervene and receive information are especially important. Section 18 deals with the Minister's power to intervene in cases of doubtful solvency.  This is a section from which no Minister will take any joy in having to implement and the vigilance of his Department at an earlier stage will have a major impact on whether the Minister has to take some of the other steps laid out in this section.  It is important, if such action is necessary, that the Minister acts to utilise the powers given to him in this area.  It is also important that the Minister and the Department should be fully briefed of what is happening in the individual companies.  It is preferable to act before a company goes into insolvency. If the Department are vigilant and active, jobs can be saved, the company could be rescued or sold as a going concern or, perhaps, taken over by another company.</P>
    <P>These are factors which put an onus on the Department of Industry and Commerce to ensure that at all times they are fully briefed on what is happening.  If they suspect that something is wrong they should not be afraid, in the interest of jobs, in the interests of the public and in the interests of the insurance industry, <Col N="295" /> to take action where necessary.  I have no doubt that they would always have the full support of the House in acting in that manner.</P>
    <P>Section 20 is important from the point of view that many of the problems which ultimately arise in the insurance business could be avoided if due care is taken in the appointment of directors and managers. I do not believe that the definition of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; is sufficient to ensure that the best possible people are appointed.  I would query the criteria in this area.  Who decides what level of qualifications an individual should have? Does he have to be a member of one of the insurance associations?  Must he have some degree &mdash; an accountancy qualification or a legal qualification &mdash; or would the Minister look at his track record in business, or where he has been active before and what business he had been involved in.  I suggest that the latter is at least a clear method of helping to define whether a person is suitable.  If it is shown that the person in previous activities, either as a director of another company or in a different business has failed to meet all the criteria demanded of him in that area, then he should automatically be disqualified from getting into insurance business.  The Minister must clarify this situation, for his own sake as much as for the sake of the rest of us in this House, so that there will not be conflict in this area.  As I said, prevention, in all businesses and not just in the insurance business, is better than cure.</P>
    <P>The question of reinsurance is difficult to deal with legislatively but some attempt has been made to do so in this legislation.  Of course, a greater proportion of underwriting reinsurance is carried out by international firms but we have to give more attention to this aspect of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The incorporation into legislation of a minimum paid up share capital of £500,000 will further help to regulate the insurance industry and put it on a firmer and sounder financial footing.</P>
    <P>In section 25 the Minister is trying to revamp an area of insurance, that is, <Col N="296" /> industrial assurance business, which has largely been overtaken in the market place.  Modern awareness of the different types of insurance available, which are now heavily advertised in the mass media, has brought about important and worthwhile changes in emphasis in insurance for the individual.  This type of insurance, as it is constituted, will probably continue to decline and may well fade out in its present form during the coming years.  I am not saying that this is a bad insurance or that there is something wrong with it but I think that the style of this insurance is probably outdated and it is within the insurance industry's brief to see how this type of insurance could best operate in the future.  The Minister has introduced some legislative measures which will help the industry to make changes in this area but these may only be cosmetic in many ways and may not deal fully with an area of insurance which is perhaps out of date when compared to the other types of insurance available at present.</P>
    <P>The primary concern of any individual when taking up insurance is, of course, to get the best possible return when the policy reaches its maturity.  Both the collection and management of this type of insurance are difficult and outdated.  The move by the Minister to put the Industrial Credit Corporation and Fóir Teoranta on a similar footing is a worthwhile step, as is the section dealing with friendly societies and closing off possible abuse of their position under existing legislation. Limiting the amount to be paid from the insurance compensation fund to 65 per cent or £650,000 is, of course, welcome and puts a limitation on the exposure to the fund.  I will deal further with this section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The payment of commissions by insurers which is dealt with in Part III of the Bill is an area in which the insurance industry have failed in many ways to take enough regulatory action.  All the incentives, whether on a commission basis or by some other benefit, are of course, ultimately borne by the insured person and the desire for increased business at any price in some instances has certainly <Col N="297" /> left this area open to abuse.  This Part has been dealt with by other speakers and it puts down a fair market to the insurance industry that very definite criteria must be adhered to in this area and that standards should not be allowed to fall.  After all, in some cases the investment individuals make in this area is the largest and most important they will make in securing their future.  While it is desirable to have competition and for people to want to succeed in their chosen areas they must bear in mind that they are dealing with the lives and futures of people and they should not be allowed to run riot with the gimmicks that may be used to attract business.  This part of the Bill gives a clear indication to the insurance industry that their card is being well marked as to the type of response that is necessary from them.  The less Government interference there is in all areas the better and it is my sincere wish that the Minister will not have to take action in the future to bring this situation under control.  It could be easily handled by the industry. Therefore, there is no doubt that it is in the industry's interests that they handle their business in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill which deals with the regulation of insurance intermediaries is an important step forward and while the vast majority of people who operate in this area of business do so in a very professional and proper manner it is only right to point out that there are some who have left an awful lot to be desired in the standards they set for themselves.  In many cases these are not the only people that individuals seeking insurance may come in contact with and it is how most of their knowledge of the insurance business and of the type of business they are seeking is gained.  The insurance industry recognise the need for the raising of standards in this area and I think it would be of great benefit to both the industry and to the public if there was one official recognised body who could speak with one voice for the insurance brokers.  I am not attempting here this evening to tell the insurance brokers how to run their business but it is a fair comment, and applies to all service industries, that it is <Col N="298" /> a much better system when one can speak with one voice through one authority or organisation.  I believe this would be of benefit primarily to the insurance industry and would have an knock-on effect for everybody else.  Many provisions were introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad and the intent of many of these provisions are obvious and are a step in the right direction.  However, this part of the Bill will have to be dealt with in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome this Bill because legislation in this area has been badly needed.  I believe that the insurance industry in general will be a constant feature of the Department of Industry and Commerce during the next few years. However, now is the time for all possible steps to be taken by the insurance industry to ensure that they are in a position to deal with all of the competition they may face in the future and to ensure that they operate according to the highest possible standards.  Of course, the effects of 1992 are of great concern and there is no doubt that there will be serious consequences for the insurance industry as well as for many other sectors.  I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Bruton that 1992 will have little impact on manufacturing industry.  I think it will and it is right that the Department of Industry and Commerce are making efforts to bring this message to manufacturing industry throughout the country. However, he is right that there is &mdash; and this has been pointed out to me by a number of people &mdash; a lack of effort on behalf of the Department in the service industry sector area.  It has been constantly stated in this House that the area of greatest job creation potential is probably the service industry sector; yet we are not bringing home to this area the prospect of what will happen in 1992.  I believe that at this stage legal firms in this country should be seeking to form linkages with many legal companies throughout Europe.  This makes a lot of sense because there is going to have to be a level of regulation above that which pertains in individual countries.  There is no way one could operate in this market <Col N="299" /> if regulations operating in individual countries are the ones that will apply. This simply would not work.  One may have a single unified market in name but in practice one certainly will not.  I do not see how the insurance industry could operate without an overall body being responsible and answerable for setting the regulations &mdash; whether it is the European Parliament, the Commission or whoever.  Certainly regulations must apply fairly and equally across the board. Of course, Ireland will be more exposed than most of the larger countries to competition from abroad.  If these major companies are allowed into the country and they run into trouble we would be more exposed to the losses that may be incurred by them than other countries would be if the same happened to an Irish company operating in their market. There would be a serious, unfair situation operating in the market if overall regulatory legislation was not laid down at EC level.</P>
    <P>The uptake of what I see happening in the EC with regard to the impact of insurance on all businesses is very slow. I do not believe this reality is coming across fast enough.  There is an onus on the industry, and on all the industries in this area, not to wait for the Minister or somebody else to give them the green light.  They should be active in the marketplace. That will be the key to success. The Government and everyone in this House will be creating the environment to help them do these things but it is essential that the business people, and the Department in particular, reassess their activities in the service sector and take note of the message which is being brought home from Europe which is relevant to the insurance industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other speakers in commending the Minister for bringing forward what Deputy Bruton described as important and useful legislation.  I would like to comment on some of the points raised by previous speakers.  Deputy Bruton made a lot of play about the suggestion to set up a <Col N="300" /> tribunal.  He made it sound very simple and logical to take such a step.  I am sure the Minister will deal with the specifics of that suggestion, but as a newcomer to this House I want to ask a very simple question &mdash; maybe I am naive to ask it &mdash; if this move was so simple and logical, why did Deputy Bruton not take it when he had the opportunity?  I do not want to be negative, but in my view that is a legitimate question.</P>
      <P>There was a little carping criticism about the similarities between the Seanad speech and today's presentation.  Since both speeches are dealing with the same topic, I would expect there to be similarities. I do not think it is legitimate to continue to ask childish stupid questions about what the Minister for the Environment might be doing in different towns in Mayo.  That is not helping to get legislation through the House.  That kind of codology should have been stopped long ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen made a number of points which were important.  In the past one of them came up very often, that a mandatory jail sentence be imposed on non-insured drivers.  At first glance that seems like a very good thing to do because this is a very serious anti-social crime.  Bearing in mind the fact that there is changed thinking in that area and that efforts are being made to keep people out of jail but having them do community work instead, the Minister's suggestion, that cars being driven without insurance would be impounded is a more practical answer to this problem.  This would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  This, I am sure, would meet with public agreement.  I accept that, when a person is very badly injured in an accident and when the driver was not insured, the first reaction is to say that the driver should be put in jail, but I would prefer if we were to impound the car.  Serious action is called for in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cullen said the Minister should ensure that there is proper financial stability in the insurance area.  Surely that is what this Bill is trying to do.  Deputy Bruton spoke about things that might <Col N="301" /> have been done, but this Minister has made more progress in this area in the last 12 or 14 months than has been accomplished in the past 14 years.</P>
    <P>I admit that a number of the issues raised, such as the abolition of juries, has taken a long time to be covered by legislation and that many things are happening now which should have happened a long time ago.  There are aspects of insurance which are highly technical and I have no intention of going into them. In the Seanad there were a number of professionals in this area and they raised many technical points and made suggestions. I was glad the Minister was willing to take their suggestions on board and I am sure he will listen very carefully to any suggestions made in this House.  I admit many points will be raised in this House which will not be covered in the Bill and I ask the insurance industry to listen very carefully to our comments because if they do not regulate their business it will be done for them through legislation.  The reform of this area from a legal point of view is being looked at and co-ordination of the industry is called for.  I agree that there should be a body to oversee the implementation of rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties and problems getting insurance cover which probably will be raised, and most of us will be taking the side of the consumer.  I am more expert in that side.  We will have to look at many areas, including delayed litigation, particularly in medical cases where it is impossible to assess the kind of premiums which should be paid, what type of funds should be kept for paying claims and so on.  I know a number of companies are meeting serious problems in this area.  These are questions which, in fairness to the insurance industry, will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are non-technical aspects covered in the Bill.  So many of them are so logical, practical and sensible that it is amazing it has taken so long for them to be introduced.  The system of dealing with industrial insurance was archaic and I am glad the Minister has moved on that area. The approach where a person who <Col N="302" /> receives money for insurance cover has to lodge it in the bank is very basic but this practice was not followed and it led to difficulties.  The system where a person who pays a premium to an insurance agent and is deemed to have given the money to the insurer created great difficulties in the past.  It was a very simple point to deal with, but it meant legislation had to be introduced.  These are steps I welcome wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>There are other issues which I am sure will be raised and which the Minister will have to spell out for the public.  The public are not <i>au fait</i> with financial institutions and related areas.  It was said in the Seanad &mdash; and I am sure it will be repeated here &mdash; that there is a blurring of the boundaries in this area.  There is a need for the State to spell out the needs and the exact meaning of each term used. A classic example is the difference between an agent and a broker.  We owe it to the public to clearly explain the difference because I am sure there are many who do not understand.  Such explanation would afford the public an opportunity of deciding where they should give their business.</P>
    <P>I asked a specific question with regard to the prohibition on payment of commission to any broker or agent who did not comply with the provisions of the Bill.  The question posed was whether such prohibition would exclude all others from receiving commission, such as people who might act as intermediaries. The Minister might answer that question because I am sure it will be repeated by others.</P>
    <P>I agree fully with the proposal to change the bonding system from a flat sum of £100,000 to a percentage related figure which will be fairer and will not discriminate against the smaller broker.</P>
    <P>While I may not understand all of the technicalities involved I am totally familiar with the end results of problems being encountered by people seeking insurance cover.  I am thinking of the non-availability of insurance cover and so on. I might draw the attention of insurers to the logical conclusion that there will be diminishing returns if premiums are too <Col N="303" /> high or incur extra loading, when people will tend to drive without insurance cover.  This is a danger particularly in the under-25 year old driver category.  I ask insurers to examine that aspect carefully. Prohibitive premiums will deter people from arranging cover and insurers will be at the loss of such premiums.  Additionally there is the cost of the implications of uninsured driving for the Motor Insurers' Bureau which I believe amounted to £50 million last year.  Insurers must have occasioned much of this loss themselves by seeking excessive premiums.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will contend that he cannot fully protect the consumer when it comes to insurance cover. However, there is a balance to be struck in these matters.  There is a greater onus on the State to play a more positive role in the insurance field than in other commercial areas.  The reason I say so is that insurance cover is mandatory in so many areas &mdash; industry, transport and indeed, now the protection of mortgages. However, that in turn imposes the requirement of legislation to provide adequate insurance cover at reasonable cost.  There is a very fine balance between the Minister's regulations and the State requirement of insurance cover.  We still have quite a way to go before striking that balance.</P>
    <P>I realise that a number of Ministers will be involved, the Minister present and the Ministers for Justice and the Environment. I am certain that the interdepartmental group established will advance additional positive suggestions and that the Minister is heading in the right direction.  He has always taken a positive view where industry is concerned. I was disappointed that an experienced spokesman like Deputy John Bruton should offer negative criticism about what he called a roadshow <i>vis-à-vis</i> industry and commerce.  As one who has worked all my life in industry, it is my belief that people need to be educated on the likely outcome of the implementation of the internal market in 1992. Such an exercise should not prevent anybody from dealing with the services area. <Col N="304" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has set an example of which some of his predecessors might be somewhat jealous. I am convinced he is doing the right thing and I should like to see him continue along that road.</P>
    <P>My prime interest in the provisions of the Bill is as a consumer.  The many issues that will arise will relate to cost, availability or lack of availability of insurance cover, the knock-on effect when insurance cover has not been arranged, which will have implications of innocent third parties.  There are also the restrictive clauses imposed on occasion, all of which issues are affected by many different factors only some of which will be touched on today.  For example, there are the steps being taken to correct problems encountered, such as the Courts Bill and the Companies Bill whose provisions will help to improve the position generally. Indeed they constitute the first serious attempts to improve the overall position. The insurance industry &mdash; a major one &mdash; must be given the protection that would be sought by any other commercial grouping and which will be subject to enormous pressure in 1992.  However, they have indicated that they are willing to work and prepare themselves for this eventuality.  I know they have welcomed the provisions of this Bill.  I know that one of the parent bodies was somewhat concerned about the establishment of a monitoring group.  However, given time all of these problems can be resolved.</P>
    <P>My most direct involvement with insurance problems is in the area of community development.  I was chairman of a community council for five years.  I am deeply involved in community development and voluntary effort in Cork city. It has been my experience that insurance problems are tearing at the very fabric of community development.  These are encountered when carnivals are arranged, on the establishment of children's play groups, facilities for the elderly, a whole range of activities in respect of which people are fearful of the implications of lack of insurance cover or are spending most of their time endeavouring to raise money to pay for it.  Therefore, <Col N="305" /> it will be readily seen that there will be tremendous damage done to community and voluntary effort if such problems are not teased out.  It is unfortunate that, on the one hand, State aid is given to voluntary groups to encourage them to undertake such work while, on the other hand, they are being stymied by the non-availability or lack of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there are grave dangers involved.  Only when an accident occurs do people fully realise what can happen.  It is my belief that community development or voluntary effort will have to be examined separately from commercial enterprises, industries and so on. It is totally unfair that people should be afraid of such involvement because of the cost of insurance cover.  I recall the infamous case in Tipperary some 12 or 14 years ago when there was much damage occasioned by a fire, when a national organisation found themselves responsible. That scare has been resurrected in the past three or four years.  I should like to see examined the possibility of some kind of State cover in respect of community activities.  I know it falls under a broad heading and that there will be many problems to be encountered but there is a need for its examination whether by way of separate brokerage, the imposition of levies or the allocation of extra funding.  I do not know what is the answer but this problem must be addressed separately from all other aspects of insurance cover.  People's real fear is that, at the end of the day, they could find themselves responsible, possibly losing their home or an enormous amount of money because of their involvement in voluntary work.  I should like the Minister to take note of that aspect and offer any advice he may have to proffer in that respect.</P>
    <P>The report of the interdepartmental committee which operated under the Minister's guidance should be brought forward as speedily as possible.  As a newcomer to the House I am worried about the length of time it takes for a Bill to be brought forward.  I do not know if the problem is the back-up service but it takes <Col N="306" /> a very long time from the first thought to fruition in regard to Bills.</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Bill in relation to juries, the reduction in numbers on the legal team, the possible publication of a book of quantum of damages, the introduction of a pre-trial procedures system and the introduction of legislation to bring into effect the recommendations of the Barrington Committee on Safety, Health and Welfare at the workplace will all help enormously to lower costs.  However, this should not take years; it must be implemented as quickly as possible to allow our local industry to prepare for the onslaught from Europe after 1992.</P>
    <P>I am <i>au fait</i> with safety in the workplace, as I acted as an industrial safety officer.  Attitudes in the workplace must change.  Some companies are very good on the shop floor and the same applies to many insurance companies.  The work done by the National Industrial Safety Organisation cannot be measured in this regard.  They get support but they need more and the insurance companies must realise that one way of saving costs is to educate the workforce on how to avoid accidents.  It is no use complaining about massive costs if someone has been injured so badly that he will never work again or indeed if an employee is killed.  It is vital to explain the issues to the workforce. The public attitude will also have to change because all the legislation in the world will not be effective if that is not the case.  In regard to insurance in general, the public seem to think that some kind of a mystical body will pay the money awarded when a case is brought. It is a question of &ldquo;them&rdquo; paying.  We all know that a different approach is taken in regard to damage to a car or fire in a building when it is an insurance job, as it is known.</P>
    <P>Costs escalate and the whole attitude is that &ldquo;they&rdquo; will pay for it.  In the past, the public attitude to general expenditure was the same.  &ldquo;They&rdquo;&mdash; the State &mdash; would pay for everything.  However, the public now realise that they pay for everything.  &ldquo;They&rdquo;, in the context of the insurance business, are the consumers who pay the premiums.  The consumers <Col N="307" /> and the public generally must realise that claims, especially frivolous ones, push up charges.  There are many other areas not covered in the Bill, which contribute to insurance costs.  I mentioned dodgers who do not take out insurance, which means that those who have insurance pay more.  Drunken drivers, speed merchants, careless workers and employers who cut corners in regard to safety also push up costs.  They gamble with the health and lives of employees.</P>
    <P>I have also been involved in health boards and the costs of professional witnesses are astronomical.  It is a matter for concern that professionals must be absent from their place of work.  This applies particularly to medical people, as their job is to care for sick people but often they have to give evidence in court cases. I appreciate that this is a highly complex area and that there may be cross-examination of witnesses but, in many cases, a simple affidavit should be sufficient. Something is wrong when a person awaiting medical treatment cannot get it because a doctor is in court giving evidence. Maybe if the fees for attentance were controlled it might help.</P>
    <P>Hidden damage is being caused because of people in the black economy who will not take out insurance, while the legitimate trader is penalised and very often goes to the wall because of unfair competition.  Controls should be implemented in that area.  All these matters need to be addressed.  This Bill and the Minister's general approach are a step in the right direction, and I appeal to other Ministers involved to take action in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious aspect which no one has mentioned in relation to some judicial decisions, not so much in making awards but in relation to the inter-pretation of legislation.  In a number of cases the wishes of the Oireachtas have been overturned.  It is a serious issue which must be examined in due course.</P>
    <P>The problems in regard to insurance have built up over many years.  They have been largely ignored although in the recent past the Minister has taken action <Col N="308" /> to provide cover for certain motorists who had been refused it.  The Motor Insurance Bureau has been set up but there is still a long way to go.  There are technical points in the Bill which will be dealt with by people who know more about them than I do but I should like to emphasise that it is as a representative of the consumer and as one myself that I make these points.  I look forward to the Minister's replies to the various points raised because this is one of the most important debates we will have in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Dennehy's speech, in which he had a common-sense approach</P>
      <P>I hope that a Bill of this nature will get the publicity in the national media to which it is entitled.  I have been concerned of late that some important Bills have not been given the coverage they deserve.  A Bill of this nature affects so many people in so many walks of life and such items deserve to be reported in our main national media.  The Courts Bill went through the House in the last session and we had the changes in the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle as Ceann Comhairle and as a Deputy has had many inquiries from, say, publicans in regarding the changes in the intoxicating liquor legislation but it had scant coverage in our national media. Similarly, nobody knew at what progress was being made on the Courts Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are commencing a new Dáil session and I appeal to the editors of our national media to ensure that coverage is given to the workings of this House.  If papers want to have social columns about what happens here I am happy if that is reported.  For instance, a little internal rivalry within a party or a bit of gossip can be reported but much more important is reportage of the day-to-day workings of whatever nature.  In fairness, RTE, particularly on radio, do very good coverage with &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; and reports in the mornings.  <i>The Irish Times</i> do that also, but the other papers should do so as well.  They are facing competition from British papers and they feel that <Col N="309" /> much of what happens here may not be all that newsworthy or good for their sales.  Be that as it may, this Bill before us is of importance to so many people in so many walks of life.  At the start of this session I appeal that our national papers give our national Parliament the dignified treatment it deserves in covering our debates adequately.</P>
    <P>I am not making that criticism in respect of the Press Gallery, who I am sure, tonight as always in regard to this and all Bills, will present their reports and copy.  However, editorial decisions obviously have been taken to reduce the amount of coverage.  A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for allowing me to make those comments.  You were very generous in allowing me to make them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt I should make those remarks at the commencement of this session.  This is an important Bill which deserves support and I am certain our party are fully supportive of it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a number of aspects of the Bill.  The Minister is going to have far greater power now in regard to his whole role in his powers to regulate, supervise and deal with insurance companies. That is as it should be.  He can do two more things.  He can regulate the commission and he will have power to regulate the insurance intermediaries.  At the very commencement I want to stress to the Minister and his Department of Industry and Commerce officials that throughout Ireland people in ordinary insurance and assurance are appointed as agents to collect premiums.  They are paid on a commission basis.  As far as I am aware many of them at least get no basic salary.  Because of that on occasions many of those agents are tempted to avail for temporary periods and so on of the funds they collect.  For one reason or another the returns are not made as rapidly as they should be and on other occasions because of financial difficulties some moneys are not returned at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="310" /> When you go to the insurance company, assurance company, or investment company to explain your problem with regard to some individuals you are told that the person was an agent not employed directly by the company.  The point I want to make before I report progress is that any company, be it for car insurance, fire or life insurance, who authorise and allow a person to collect premiums for them should be liable for any default that takes place in that regard.  I think it only common sense that that be adhered to.  A bond can be taken out on that person working for the company or some such measure could be taken, but this legislation should provide that any person employed by an insurance company to act as their agent is fully covered and a person paying over money to that agent will not be at the loss of that money.</P>
    <P>Let me say in fairness that in any problems that have arisen in the past the insurance companies have, generously on occasions, paid out the moneys to people who would otherwise have been at a loss after paying their premiums but it should not depend just on the goodwill of the insurance company or the firm involved. The provision for the protection of the individual should be statutory.  People sometimes decide to invest large sums of money in life assurance or such items and part with their money and sometimes suffer great stress wondering what has happened to their investments.  It is essential that this be regularised in legislation. A person handing over moneys to an official in a bank or anywhere else knows that the bank is responsible for that money and a similar provision should apply in regard to insurance companies.</P>
    <P>An item of great concern has been the cost of insurance for employers.  I must say I am pleased that, according to a survey by the CII, employers' liability insurance rates have fallen from 2.78 per cent of payroll costs in 1986 to 1.85 per cent of payroll costs in 1988.  That is significant because the cost of insurance for many firms has been prohibitive.  May I say to employers, to the Confederation <Col N="311" /> of Irish Industry and to people in any walk of life who employ others that it is essential that their employees be protected. I have seen in the past so many young men mutilated by the loss of a leg, an arm or an eye.  No amount of money, be it £10,000 or £100,000, will compensate for such loss.  It is of paramount importance that employers take great care in ensuring safety at their workplace. The most important thing that employers can do is educate their staff about safety. I think that is of the utmost importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a traditional industry in Enniscorthy for very many decades of killing and processing pigs. Buttles &ldquo;barley fed&rdquo; bacon company <Col N="312" /> have a long tradition in Enniscorthy town of providing high quality employment over a long number of years.  It is symptomatic of the tradition of pig producing in County Wexford, of the pig co-operatives and the large number of pig producers in the area.  In recent years this company changed hands and were taken over by another experienced business family, the Wilsons.  The number of killings went up very substantially, with, on average, some 1,200 pigs per week being killed.  These pigs were being slaughtered, cured and fully processed in Enniscorthy.</P>
      <P>From the IDA's experience of trying to compete with imports of Danish and Dutch pigmeat a centralised slaughtering policy was developed.  For many years the Oireachtas Members for County Wexford have been trying to seek some commitment from the IDA that they would successfully try to ensure that the maximum number of pig processing jobs would be retained at Enniscorthy.  Unfortunately, the centralised pig slaughtering unit was located in Waterford.  Buttles was part of a greater conglomerate so this summer when the slaughtering unit was relocated 27 jobs were lost.  The feeling locally was that it was State policy which engineered the jobs out of Enniscorthy. There was a great deal of resentment among those who lost their jobs and in the town generally.  Unfortunately, now we are faced with the fatal confirmation that the remaining jobs are to be lost to the town, and may I briefly quote from a company statement this week:</P>
      <P>Due to the non-viability of the current operation the Company is unable to formulate plans to ensure the long term future of the business.  As a result the company is forced to cease operations on 31st December 1988.</P>
      <P>This is another very heavy body blow to the town of Enniscorthy.  This area was recognised back in the late seventies in a south-eastern regional development organisation report as a black spot of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be great sadness this week <Col N="313" /> in Enniscorthy that the skills and dedication of this workforce and the whole tradition of pig producing and processing is going to be lost to the area.  It would cost anybody else a great deal of money to train and develop those skills in another area.  As is always the case in these instances, the local TDs are blamed for a lack of clout and effectiveness in securing a replacement industry or in ensuring the protection of jobs.  Deputy Brown and I are not in any way trying to score political points.  The issue is simply too serious in Enniscorthy town.  The decimation of employment in the town has been so great that we met senior executives of the IDA earlier this year to try to get some commitment to develop a processing unit.  At present the carcases of the slaughtered animals are being brought from Waterford to Enniscorthy. We were unable to get any commitment for that or for a replacement industry.</P>
    <P>I must say that there is the depth of disappointment in the Enniscorthy area and at public representative level at the way the IDA have blatantly ignored the needs of Enniscorthy.  This is a source of great regret because they are charged with the job of developing industries and have responsibility for creating jobs. Unfortunately they have neglected that. I have to say publicly tonight that I have the feeling that when the IDA speak about Wexford county they really speak about Wexford town because what New Ross, Gorey and Enniscorthy have got over recent years is negligible.  We really must have a major industry.  We have had a great deal of discussion about a site at Edermine for a pharmaceutical plant.  We have had a brochure allegedly promoted worldwide but we have nothing to show for any of these efforts.  We have had designation but we have nothing to show for it.  There has been an overall national reduction in the rate of IDA grant-aid.</P>
    <P>In addition to this body blow I have heard in recent hours that another traditional industry, a mill, is threatening to lay off more people.  I was not aware of this and I must say it comes as a personal shock because I had been informed of a merger with a larger milling enterprise, <Col N="314" /> with three companies merging into one to protect the jobs.  We will have to take that up later.</P>
    <P>The people of Enniscorthy are looking to the Oireachtas Members for some answer to this situation.  Recently there was a deputation to Deputy Joe Walsh and there is another planned to Deputy Albert Reynolds.  There have been successive deputations to successive Ministers and there has been very little to show for it all.  I ask for commitment here tonight from the Government that the IDA would see it as a priority area and get some new project for the area, or at least an advance factory.</P>
    <P>There are a few specific points which I will refer to briefly.  It has been alleged that the reason for the closure of this plant was that veterinary staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food said that it was not up to EC standards. It has been the case for some years that the Department have had reservations. I do not think it is fair to blame the Department solely for this, for the simple reason that they have been willing, with the back-up of grants and other aids, to sit down and look at conversion, replacement of equipment or to look at a greenfield site to see what way the enterprise could be assisted.  We were given commitments by the IDA at Oireachtas level that if the management did come forward with a plan there would be a future.</P>
    <P>I make an appeal here tonight to the management to continue operations in Enniscorthy and to use this as an opportunity to develop a new greenfield plant. I believe if there was such a willingness by management that would be reciprocated by a willingness in the Department to accommodate them with whatever EC licence was required.</P>
    <P>Basically, there is a need for goodwill on both sides to try to resolve this problem. I would like the Minister to state whether there have been meetings between the Department and management to try to see if there is any way the EC technical problems could be resolved.</P>
    <P>In conclusion &mdash; I do not wish to labour <Col N="315" /> the point &mdash; there is desolation in Enniscorthy at the successive body blows to employment.  Barna Buildings have been closed.  There have been major job losses in Buttles, not only now but previously, and also in Davis's Flour Mills.  There are only a couple of major employers in Enniscorthy &mdash; one on the service side, Donohoe's , and Wexal.  There are some smaller factories like Wexspeed and the post-Janelle factory, Wennas.  There is very little employment in the area.  There is nothing facing the young people of Enniscorthy, not to speak of the people in their forties and fifties who are losing their jobs, only emigration.  That is very sad for a small town that is beside the gateway to Europe &mdash; Rosslare &mdash; and that has some of the best infrastructural facilities.  We feel at the end of the day that we have been neglected.  I would call on the Minister to use whatever powers he has in Government and to use the resources of all the different Government agencies to come to the rescue of Enniscorthy and give it priority status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates for allocating some of his time to me tonight. The threatened closure of Buttles bacon factory in Enniscorthy, as Deputy Yates has pointed out, has caused consternation and a lack of faith in the Government's ability to do anything about the unemployment problem there.  The local paper this week stated: &ldquo;Government Regulations have finally brought the decision to close Enniscorthy's century-old bacon factory.&rdquo;  Last week a deputation from Enniscorthy urban council visited the Minister with responsibility for food, Deputy Joe Walsh, who told us that there was an unlimited amount of money available for the development of Buttles factory in Enniscorthy.  Yet one week later we hear that it is to be closed because of Government regulations.  That position should be clarified here tonight.  What are the Government regulations that are closing down this factory?  They should be spelled out loud and clear so that the public will know the real reasons for the closure of the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="316" /> This factory is one of the major traditional industries in Enniscorthy.  At one stage there was well over 100 people employed there.  As a result of the opening of the centralised slaughtering plant in Waterford over 30 jobs were lost in July.  It seems ironic that we would grant-aid a slaughtering plant in Waterford which would result in the loss of jobs in Enniscorthy.  It was bad enough to lose that many jobs but we were assured at that time that the processing end of the industry in Enniscorthy would be developed and that there would be the possibility of creating extra jobs.  All sorts of promises were made.  We find now, two or three months later, that the factory is to be closed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates about the IDA.  We had meetings in Dublin with the IDA following the opening of the centralised slaughtering unit in Waterford. They had no answers and made no commitment.  They had a total lack of interest in Enniscorthy town and the surrounding area which employs over 2,000 people.  It is 4 percentage points above the national average for unemployment. There is a total lack of job opportunities in the Enniscorthy area.  The only thing that is facing the young people there is the emigrant ship.  There are hundreds of young people from Enniscorthy town in England, Europe and America because of the lack of job opportunities and the lack of decision-making by the IDA, by previous Governments and, unfortunately, by the Ministers in this Government in charge of industry and food development.  There does not seem to be any interest whatsoever in the Enniscorthy area.</P>
    <P>Enniscorthy town was traditionally a strong agricultural marketing town and shopping area.  It depended mainly on the large agricultural hinterland for its development.  Unfortunately, the recession in agriculture has seriously affected the commercial life of the town. It is not good enough to say that this company is closing down and to just walk away from it.  It is important that the Government Ministers wake up to the <Col N="317" /> fact that Wexford, and particularly Enniscorthy, is entitled to its fair share of grant-aid out of the millions of pounds that are available at present for food processing, particularly for bacon and meat processing.</P>
    <P>With Clover Meats and Buttles, Wexford was regarded as the home of the bacon industry.  Today that is in a shambles and there have been severe job losses.  It is a scandal that Wexford which produces the raw material has no food processing plant.  The food is processed in other counties where there is tremendous job potential.  The jobs should be retained in our own county, particularly in the Enniscorthy area.  I would ask the Minister here tonight &mdash; I know he is standing in for the Minister with responsibility for food who is away on other business &mdash; to bring home the message to the Minister that we cannot afford to lose Buttles factory in Enniscorthy because it will cause serious unemployment.  Every avenue should be explored to encourage Harry Wilson and his brothers, the owners, to keep the factory open in Enniscorthy. I will quote from another section of the paper which states: &ldquo;Harry Wilson and his brothers did everything possible to &lsquo;keep the ship afloat&rsquo; but they were frustrated in every move they made&rdquo;.  If there are ways that the ship can be kept afloat it is important that the IDA and the State agencies intervene immediately to save the jobs of the people who remain there.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that when the centralised slaughtering unit opened in Waterford the Wilson brothers would be able to develop the processing industry in Enniscorthy and possibly build a new factory on a green field site.  They seem to be steering away from that at present.  It is time that, through pressure from State agencies and from Ministers, we got the Wilson brothers to rethink their decision. We should make available whatever financial sweeteners are necessary to encourage them to stay in Enniscorthy and to create further jobs for our people. We cannot afford to lose any more jobs in Enniscorthy.  We cannot afford to let our highly skilled and highly educated <Col N="318" /> young people emigrate to other countries where their skills will be put to use.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister again to intervene tomorrow morning to ensure that the State agencies concerned rescue the company so that jobs will not be lost.  In the days ahead we should discuss with Mr. Wilson the possibility of keeping the factory open because we cannot afford to lose any more jobs.  We need new industries for the Enniscorthy area and it is time that the IDA gave some priority to Enniscorthy town and district.  The local authority, both urban and county council, have provided the infrastructures there and it is up to the IDA and the Minister to see that we get our fair share of the national cake in Enniscorthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to acknowledge the contributions of Deputy Ivan Yates and Deputy John Brown in speaking on the loss of jobs at Buttles bacon factory in Enniscorthy.  As the Deputies know a major rationalisation and modernisation programme is under way in the pigmeat sector.  The programme involves total investment of £140 million over the five years to 1992 and it has an ambitious job creation target of close to 1,500 new jobs. Investments under the programme qualify for generous IDA support as well as for EC FEOGA aid at the rate of 50 per cent of cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to create a modern and efficient pig slaughtering and processing industry capable of competing on equal terms with the best on offer in the Community as a whole and one which meets the most stringent EC and USDA hygienic and veterinary standards. The programme envisages the establishment of about eight slaughtering plants, capable of handling a minimum of 6,000 pigs per week.  These centralised slaughtering units would also be the source of carcase supplies for a number of specialised processing plants located throughout the country.  A number of major investments have already been completed under the programme; work <Col N="319" /> on other projects is well under way while some others are at an advanced planning stage.  The success of the programme to date can be gauged from the fact that since June 1987 over £10 million in FEOGA aid and £11 million in national funds have been allocated for pigmeat projects.  A further allocation of EC funding is expected in December.</P>
    <P>As part of this rationalisation and modernisation programme slaughtering of pigs will cease at a number of the smaller plants and transfer to more modern units where efficiencies and economies of scale will lead to reduced slaughtering costs. In the case of Buttles bacon factory, slaughtering ceased in August last and Buttles processing requirements are now sourced from the newly opened Queally plant at Grannagh, County Kilkenny. The job losses at Buttles have occurred at the slaughter end only; processing is continuing at the plant with up to 30 people now employed there.</P>
    <P>The future prosperity of the Irish pigmeat industry is very much dependent on the creation of an efficient and modern slaughtering and processing sector.  It has been recognised by Governments over a number of years that the creation of efficient and modern facilities depend on the adoption of a major programme of rationalisation and modernisation.  Of its nature it is inevitable that such a programme will involve some relocation of employment.  While this has happened in the case of slaughtering at Buttles, curing and processing is continuing at Enniscorthy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> Continued participation in the pigmeat industry of the future requires facilities which are of the highest standard.  This becomes more and more important as we move closer to 1992 and the single market.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to a number of points which the two Deputies made.  The Department have been very understanding with Buttles.  They have been in contact with management with a view to improving facilites in Enniscorthy, but unfortunately there was no response to those overtures and the Department have refrained from renewing approval for continued processing at Buttles in the hope that the situation would improve there.  It is obviously a commercial decision to close and the decision is very much in the hands of those who are involved with the plant there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to the deputation which came to meet my colleague, Minister Joe Walsh.  IDA representatives were present when the delegation were told that if management came forward with suitable proposals for investment they would be fully considered.</P>
    <P>Generous State and EC FEOGA assistance is available for those who draw up suitable investment proposals.  It is imperative that all serious participants should now come forward with their plans if they are not to miss the opportunities of 1992.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 20 October 1988.</P>

      <P>A direct consequence of the removal of existing barriers to the free movement of goods, persons and capital within the Community will be the disappearance and the progressive dilution of some current administrative sources for these statistics.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of surveys conducted by the IDA and Shannon Development the number of new jobs in manufacturing (including international services) in 1986, 1987 and to end September 1988 were as follows: 1986, 17,662; 1987, 16,364; to end September (nine months) 1988, 14,500.</P>
      <P>These figures indicate that we are on target to achieve the overall annual industrial job target of 20,000 set under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary results of the CSO Labour Force Survey published last week show that in the year to mid-April 1988 employment in the economy increased by 6,000, the first significant employment increase since 1980.  In the three years to <Col N="50" /> mid-April 1988 employment in manufacturing increased by a net 3,000 while employment in services increased by 24,000.  In part, this reflects the increasing tendency by industry to buy in services rather than provide them in-house.</P>
    <P>The Government statement of 7 October 1988 gave full details of developments in job creation under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in major sectors of the economy.  It shows that the Government's drive for economic reconstruction is working and that we are meeting the targets set out in the programme.</P>

      <P>As part of the Government's national awareness and information campaign launched by the Taoiseach on 4 July, I have initiated a detailed awareness and information campaign for the business sector in consultation with the social partners including ICTU, CII, FUE and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  As part of that compaign I have, together with my colleagues, Séamus Brennan, Minister for Trade and Marketing and Seán McCarthy, Minister for Science and Technology, held 14 seminars in locations throughout the country.</P>
      <P>An information pack has been made available to seminar participants which sets out in simple terms the changes which the completion of the Internal Market will bring for Irish business and the key proposals across a wide range of areas as set out in the Commission's 1985 White Paper &ldquo;Completing the Internal Market&rdquo;.  The information pack includes a special booklet on the opportunities and challenges for business which is available free of charge and to date 5,000 copies of this booklet have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At these seminars I have been accompanied by experts from my Department, the IDA, the Irish Goods Council, CTT, EOLAS and, in the mid-west region, SFADCo.  The experts from the various bodies have made detailed presentations on the implications of the completion of the Internal Market from the perspective of their areas of operations and responsibilities and a number also organised special information stands in <Col N="52" /> conjuction with the seminars.  To date 2,500 people have attended the seminars which have attracted a very high degree of interest from business people throughout the country.  Participants at the seminars have also been given the opportunity of follow-up consultations with Government Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>I am continuing, with my Department and agencies under my responsibility, to participate in a range of seminars, workshops and conferences arranged by various business associations and other interests on the Internal Market.  In addition, a special video on the implications of the completion of the internal market for the manufacturing sector has been finalised and will be available for distribution shortly.</P>

      <P>In 1987 I ordered a review of the incentive package for small industry.  Following this review a new two-tier system of grant assistance was put in place at the beginning of this year and I am satisfied that the system is operating satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The new system simplifies grant procedures for very small firms at an early stage of development and thereby encourages increased growth in the sector.  The basic level of assistance is in the form of employment grants up to £5,000 for each new job created in worth-while projects in viable small firms employing up to 15 people.  A more extensive range of incentives, including capital grants, is available to firms that demonstrate strong or exceptional growth potential.</P>

      <P>The production process in this case did not require my Department's approval, but did obtain clearance from the appropriate EOLAS committee prior to receiving IDA support.</P>
      <P>The procedures for vetting genetic engineering projects in Ireland are that the Recombinant DNA Committee of EOLAS reviews the use of genetic engineering techniques to modify any organism and the further use of a genetically modified organism in any industrial process. The committee uses American National Institute of Health Guidelines in its evaluation.  The recommendations of the Recombinant DNA Committee are used by the relevant planning authority.  If there are any special considerations, such as containment or other safety procedures, these are built into the planning conditions.  In the case of the organism to be used by Nordisk Gentofte, the Recombinant DNA Committee found it to be exempt from any special requirements.</P>

    <P>There will not be any genetic engineering carried out at the Cork plant.  The genetic engineering as such has already been done in laboratories outside Ireland.

The modified organisms will require no further genetic engineering and will be <Col N="57" /> grown in a fermentation process similar to a brewery; instead of producing alcohol the organism will produce human insulin.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in the light of recent disputes between Britain and France, the European Commission is making proposals in regard to local EC content rules for industrial products, <Col N="58" /> which, if not complied with, would prevent exports from one member state to another member state without the payment of a levy equivalent to the common external tariff; if these Community proposals would have any adverse implications for any existing Irish industries; and the work that the Government is doing on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the Commission has no proposals concerning the origin rules for local content which would involve the payment of duty on industrial products traded between member states.</P>
      <P>There is a Commission proposal for a change in the rules of origin as they affect integrated circuits but the proposed change does not involve a local content requirement.  At present assembly of the integrated circuit confers origin.  The Commission proposes to change the rule to the diffusion of the integrated circuit, which is an earlier stage in its manufacture. This change will not result in preventing exports from one member state to another nor will the payment of preventing exports from one member state to another nor will the payment of duties be involved.  The companies involved in the assembly of integrated circuits in Ireland have indicated that they do not foresee any significant adverse effects on their operations arising.</P>
      <P>There are other Commission proposals for 45 per cent local content requirement in order for video recorders and photo-copiers to qualify for Community origin. These proposed amendments of rules of origin would not permit that products made in the Community but not fulfilling those origin requirements, be subject to common customs tariff on export from one member state to another member state of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally in the anti-dumping area the relevant Community legislation, as amended in 1987, now provides that where an anti-dumping duty has been imposed on a particular product, an anti-dumping duty may also be imposed on the like product assembled in the Community if, <i>inter alia</i>, 60 per cent or more <Col N="59" /> of the parts (by value) used in the assembly come from the original dumping country.  The duty is levied prior to the product being released onto the Community market and the product can then circulate freely throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>No goods assembled or produced in Ireland are subject to anti-dumping duties levied on the Community assembled product, to date.  The common external tariff is already paid on third country imports at the point of entry into the Community.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the concept of free circulation of goods without the imposition of customs tariffs is of paramount importance to the Community.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 66 and 69 together.  A sum of £14.96 million has been allocated to date to my Departments from the proceeds of the national lottery for arts and culture and Irish Language related projects &mdash; £3.147 million for 1987 and £11.813 million for 1988.</P>
      <P>Details of the projects assisted through the Department of the Taoiseach, including the amounts actually paid to date and the anticipated profile, are set out in Appendix 1 which is being circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The list of countries from which the approved applications were received is in Appendix 2 which is also being circulated with the Official Report, with the cultural agencies/projects of a national dimension being indicated separately.</P>
      <P>Details regarding grants from Roinn na Gaeltachta are listed in Appendices 3 and 4.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, on 7 October 1988, the Government announced a series of measures designed specifically to give an additional impetus to growth in output and employment in certain key sectors of the economy. These measures will finance projects and provide the basis for further activity in areas already identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> including industry, tourism, forestry and fisheries. In addition, this package of measures will have a positive, though carefully limited, effect on consumer demand in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>Collectively, the measures announced are intended to bring forward the employment potential of favourable trends in economic performance which have become increasingly evident in recent months.  The strong growth in real GNP in 1987 and further positive growth this year is soundly based on a sustainable recovery in personal consumption, a broad expansion of industrial output and continued buoyancy in merchandise exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is normal in an economic recovery phase, employment has been the last major indicator to show clear signs of an upturn.  Accordingly, the preliminary results of the 1988 Labour Force Survey published last week, which confirmed the first significant increase in employment <Col N="74" /> this decade, are particularly encouraging. Underlying these favourable developments is the substantial progress made towards achieving the programme's objectives in relation to the public finances. The end-September Exchequer returns indicate that for the second year in succession the Exchequer borrowing requirement should emerge lower than the budget target, without taking account of the additional tax revenues resulting from the special incentive.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1989, published yesterday, show the Government's determination to achieve stabilisation of the national debt/GNP ratio during the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The public expenditure profile set out in the 1989 Estimates will consolidate the benefits of sound public finances, in terms of lower interest rates and investor confidence, which is the essential requirement for sustainable growth in output and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The saving on the estimate for Ireland's <Col N="77" /> gross EC Budget contribution arises partly from changes in the composition of the revenue of the European Communities made at the European Council last February and partly because the total revenue demand arising from the EC Budget adopted for 1988 was less than expected at the time the EC Budget contribution estimate was fixed.</P>
      <P>At the European Council last February, the overall level of revenue available to the European Communities was increased and the composition of this revenue was changed.  Under the system in operation up to then the EC Budget contribution of each member state comprised customs duties, agricultural levies and a percentage of the VAT base.  The new system is made up of customs duties, agricultural levies and 1.4 per cent of the VAT base, with the balance of revenue divided by reference to the share of a member state in Community GNP.  The VAT base to be used will be limited to 55 per cent of GNP.  Thus Ireland will be charged 1.4 per cent on a base of 55 per cent GNP rather than on the higher full VAT base.  There is a saving of about £20 million as a result of the budget contribution being calculated under the new system as compared with the situation if the old system had remained in place.  As regards the balance of the saving of £15 million, the 1988 EC Budget was not adopted until 1 June 1988 and it was further amended in July 1988 and the level of expenditure and revenue required in that Budget and thus the Irish contribution share were not finalised until then.  The final amount proved to be less than anticipated when drawing up the 1988 estimate for the Irish contribution.</P>
      <P>It is also estimated that there will be additional refunds of about £7.5 million arising from adjustments to the VAT element of Ireland's contribution for previous years and from the 10 per cent refund for collection costs of traditional own resources.  This will increase non-tax revenue in 1988 by £7.5 million compared with what it would otherwise have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the budget contribution for future years will be calculated on the new system <Col N="78" /> of contribution, the saving arising from this change will be maintained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The powers exercisable by the Minister in relation to the grant of permissions under the following provisions of the Exchange Control Act, 1954: Subsection (1) and paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of Section 4 &mdash; in respect of dealings in foreign currency; Section 5 &mdash; in respect of restrictions on payments to persons resident outside the Scheduled Territories; Section 6 &mdash; in respect of <Col N="81" /> restrictions on payments to persons resident in the Scheduled Territories; Section 8 &mdash; in respect of the issue of securities; Section 9 &mdash; in respect of the transfer of securities, annuities and policies of assurance; Section 11 &mdash; in respect of the substitution of securities and certificates outside the Scheduled Territories; Section 12 &mdash; in respect of the payment of capital moneys outside the Scheduled Territories; Section 13 &mdash; in respect of the duties of persons keeping registers; Paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) and sub-section (2) of Section 16 &mdash; in respect of restrictions on exports; Sub-section (1) of Section 17 &mdash; in respect of payment for exports; Section 23 &mdash; in respect of collection of debts; Section 24 &mdash; in respect of restrictions on certain loans.</P>

    <P>*Provisional &mdash; subject to revision.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Notes</P>
    <P>Column (a)</P>
    <P>(i)  Income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well <Col N="84" /> at tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1983 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1983-84.</P>
    <P>Column (b)</P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calender year ends e.g. the 1983 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1983-84, irrespective of whether or not the assessed tax was actually payable.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The reduction in the average tax payments made by farmers over the years in question is mainly due to the introduction of additional numbers of farmers to tax records since 1983-84 consequent on the abolition of the rateable valuation threshold. It follows that the new cases, in general, had much smaller holdings and consequently had, on average, lower taxable incomes.  Another factor affecting the level of tax per case was the effects of reduced profit levels resulting from disadvantageous weather conditions in 1985 and 1986.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished.  Accordingly the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>Column (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax from other self-employed tax units in each calendar year by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>Columns (a), (b) and (c)</P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who have elected or have been deemed to have elected to have <Col N="85" /> the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>

      <P>The bulk of the State shareholdings in exploration companies were sold in recent months.  The shares in question had been acquired free of charge in the administration of the exploration licensing scheme.  The Government decided in the 1988 budgetary context that it was appropriate to dispose of the shares on the grounds that, like certain items of physical property also being sold off this year by State bodies and agencies, they constituted assets surplus to requirements. I am satisfied that the disposal of the shares was conducted in a fully professional manner.</P>

    <P>Prior to 1983 records were not kept in such a way as would enable me to provide figures for the number of persons deported from the State.  The persons listed above were deported because I deemed it to be conducive to the public good to do so.</P>
    <P>Records are not kept by my Department in such a way as would enable me to provide figures for persons ordered to leave the State other than by ministerial order referred to above.  To do so would <Col N="97" /> involve an examination of the records and the allocation of an amount of staff resources which could not be justified in present circumstances.  Such persons are ordered to leave the State because of breaches of the conditions on which they have permission to be in the State or because they do not have permission to be in the State or for other breaches of the law.</P>

      <P>The Law Centre operated by the Legal Aid Board at Athlone is one of four full-time Law Centres opened in the period 1985 to 1987 under a provision for civil legal aid in the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984. The Law Centre in Mullingar is a parttime centre, which is serviced from the Athlone Centre on the second Wednesday of each month.</P>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board have informed me that the current waiting period to see a solicitor at the Athlone Centre is three weeks.  There is no waiting period at the Mullingar Centre.  I do not think that this represents an inadequate level of service at these centres.</P>

The local gardaí maintain close contact with the business community in the neighbourhood and the concerns expressed by local chemists have been brought to the attention of members on patrol in the area.</P>

      <P>Sheepmeat is bound in the GATT at a duty of 20%.  However, with a view to limiting imports, the Community has since 1980 operated a Voluntary Restraint Agreement with each of the principal supplying countries, including New Zealand.  Under the agreement with New Zealand, that country limits its exports to the Community to a maximum quantity of 245,500 tonnes annually.  The agreement also requires New Zealand to respect the sensitive nature of certain Community markets such as Ireland and France.  In return for New Zealand's cooperation regarding volume and sensitive zone status the duty payable on imports of lamb from New Zealand has been reduced to 10%.</P>
      <P>The impending review of the EC sheepmeat regime will involve both external and internal arrangements.  The Commission has just presented a proposal to the EC Council on the internal regime and negotiations with third countries on import arrangements are proceeding.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Restraint Agreement between New Zealand and the Community recognises Ireland as a sensitive zone which has a zero import quota. Nevertheless, there are occasional reports of illegal importations of New Zealand lamb into Ireland and these are investigated by Customs and Excise. However, there has been no concrete evidence of any illegal importation in the past two years.</P>

      <P>Section 12 (4) of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 provides that where one of a married couple is entitled to certain social welfare benefits or pensions (including old age pension) and the other spouse is entitled to unemployment assistance, the total amount payable to them by way of benefit or pension and assistance shall not exceed the total amount which would be payable to them if the spouse in receipt of benefit or pension were receiving an increase in respect of the other spouse as an adult dependant. The section provides that where this <Col N="118" /> limit is exceeded, the rate of unemployment assistance is to be reduced accordingly.</P>
      <P>The wife of the person concerned is in receipt of an old age pension of £48.50 weekly.  The flat rate amount to which she would be entitled if she were in receipt of an adult dependant allowance for her husband is £72.90.  Therefore, the maximum weekly amount of unemployment assistance payable to her husband is £24.40, being the difference between £72.90 and £48.50.</P>
      <P>On the introduction of the equal treatment measures the person concerned was granted a special transitional payment of £20 per week to alleviate the loss of the allowance previously received in respect of his wife as an adult dependant.  This allowance was due to end in November 1987 but the present Government decided that it should be phased out over a period rather than ended abruptly. Accordingly this transitional allowance was reduced to £18 per week from 20 July 1988 in accordance with the legislative provisions governing this year's budgetary changes which reduced allowances generally for couples in this category by £2.00 per week.  As the budgetary increase in his unemployment assistance payment (£0.70) was less than the reduction in his transitional payment (£2.00) his total pre budget social welfare payment (£43.70) was reduced by £1.30 per week.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a social welfare payment of £42.40 per week comprised of the basic (reduced) unemployment assistance rate of £24.40 and the transitional payment of £18.00.  Although the total social welfare payment to the person concerned was reduced by £1.30 per week, this reduction was more than offset by the increase of £1.40 per week in the non-contributory old age pension payable to his wife leaving a slight increase in the overall household income.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that a comprehensive social assistance scheme should be introduced to replace all existing assistance schemes and that one parent families, regardless of sex, should be catered for under that scheme.  This would be a major change in the present arrangements where special schemes exist for particular categories of one-parent families.</P>
      <P>At European level the question of extending equal treatment to social security schemes other than those covered by the previous EC Directive is also under consideration.</P>
      <P>The future of the existing schemes for one-parent families will be considered in the light of the proposals which emerge from the present discussions.  I cannot say at this stage what changes in the present arrangements will be possible nor is it possible to evaluate their cost implications and whether such arrangements would be introduced on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 was signed by the US President on 23 August 1988. Copies of the signed text are not yet <Col N="127" /> available from the US. Until the complete text of the signed Bill is available it is not possible to provide a complete analysis of its provisions and the implications for Ireland.  However, on the basis of previous drafts of the Trade Bill the main provisions which have emerged are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;greater powers to the US Administration to retaliate against perceived unfair trade practices by foreign governments,</P>
      <P>&mdash;renewal of authority for the US Administration to negotiate trade agreements and authorisation of &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; procedures for Congressional approval of future trade agreements.</P>
      <P>Ireland has joined with her EC colleagues in expressing concern and disappointment at the Bill's protectionist potential.  The Council of Ministers has made a number of Declarations warning the US of the consequences of unilateral measures which would breach GATT commitments.  The most recent Declaration was on 26 September 1988.</P>
      <P>Representations were made by Ireland and the European Community at various stages concerning individual provisions of the various drafts before the final version of the Trade Bill was signed by the President.

These reports are made twice yearly and I understand that the report covering the period from January to June 1988 will be presented shortly.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a mid-term ministerial review of the negotiations will take place in December, at which Ireland will of course be represented.  I have already indicated my intention to report to the House on progress at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are only mid-way through the Uruguay Round negotiations it would be premature to predict major changes in trade policy affecting Ireland.  There is at present, considerable divergence between the positions of major parties. This is particularly true in relation to agricultural trade, where the US and Cairns Group (including Australia and New Zealand) have put forward policies of subsidy elimination, while the EC supports a policy of supply management with the aim of eliminating surpluses by gradual reduction of subsidies.  This makes it a difficult task to predict the outcome of negotiations.  In some areas, such as agriculture and textiles, we must be mindful of the need to protect our interests.  It is clear that the liberalisation <Col N="129" /> of market access in other areas should greatly benefit Irish exporters.</P>

    <P>*Estimated, as final figures are not yet available.</P>
    <P>It is not at this stage possible to predict with certainty the number of wells which will be drilled in the Irish offshore in 1989 <Col N="133" /> and 1990.  The Deputy will, however, wish to note that under the agreement with Marathon announced on 22 July 1988, up to ten exploration wells are to be drilled by the company up to and including 1991.  The documentation necessary to give detailed effect to this agreement is being finalised.</P>
    <P>Since I revised the licensing terms in September 1987 my Department received three applications for exclusive offshore exploration licences.  Licences were issued in respect of these covering a total of nine blocks.  Two wells have been drilled under these licences.  A third well (which was a comitment well) under an earlier licence was also drilled.  These wells represented the 1988 drilling programme. It has been expected that a fourth well would materialise in 1988 but this does not now appear to be likely.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the increased competition for exploration funds in the present depressed oil price climate together with the disappointing results of drilling in our offshore, I consider that the level of drilling in 1988 was reasonably satisfactory with two deep water wells drilled in the Porcupine and one in the Irish Sea.  I believe that there would have been little activity in the offshore this year had it not been for the alteration in the licensing terms.</P>

      <P>In view of the confidentiality provisions of the licensing terms I am not at liberty to release details of the results of wells drilled in 1987 and 1988.  However, I can summarise for the Deputy information on the results as announced previously by the operators.  The three wells drilled in 1987 were plugged and abandoned. The Total operated well in block 57/2 had minor hydrocarbon shows as also had the BP well on block 50/6.  The BP well on block 49/9 (49/9-4) flowed 1,930 barrels of oil per day.  All three wells drilled in <Col N="134" /> 1988 have also been plugged and abandoned.</P>

      <P>The claim in question was not received in time to be included in the original scheme but I agreed to make a special effort on behalf of the fish farmer to see if assistance can be provided under the circumstances.

    <P>1.  The figures shown for 1987 and 1988 are the rate support grant allocations notified to local authorities.</P>
    <P>2.  The allocations for 1988 include the adjustments made as a consequence of the enactment of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987 which reflect the writing off of amounts of loan charges on capital loans principally for Sanitary, Fire and Library Services normally met from local authorities own resources together with adjustments for credit and debit balance owing to or due by local authorities in respect of housing subsidy.</P>
    <P>3.  The individual rate support grant allocations notified to local authorities for 1989 include an increase for the incorporation of the Contribution in Lieu of Rates on State Property as part of the rate support grant for the first time.  Excluding this adjustment and discounting the effects of the adjustments in respect of balances of housing subsidy made in 1988 and referred to at 2 above, the comparison in percentage terms between the 1988 and 1989 allocations indicates a reduction in 1989 of 10.5 per cent in the case of Dublin Corporation, 11.4 per cent in the case of Dublin County Council and a reduction of approximately 5.15 per cent in the case of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>4.  Payments on foot of the 1989 allocations will fall to be adjusted in individual cases later in line with rates which are expected to be levied on ESB directly for the first time in 1989 in respect of its generation and distribution network.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 254 and 265 together.</P>
      <P>A total of £9.53 million has been allocated to my Department from the national lottery surplus for amenity projects, the public library service, and projects associated with the Dublin Millennium.  Payments by my Department for eligible projects amounted to £2,395, 108 at 30 September 1988 leaving a balance of £7,134,892 which it is anticipated will be spent by the end of the year</P>
      <P>The conditions relating to the payment of the community amenity project grants scheme are set out in the Minister for Finance's reply to Question No. 4 of 18 May 1988.  In the case of the public library service, payments are made by my Department in arrears on foot of approved expenditure by local authorities on the provision and leasing of libraries and associated loan charges.  The conditions applying to these payments are broadly similar to those applying to other capital and current service provided by local authorities and funded from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>In the case of projects associated with the Dublin Millennium, the grant from the lottery surplus has been allocated by the Department to the Dublin Millennium Company (Dublin Promotions Organisation Ltd.) in accordance with the following conditions:</P>
      <P>Details of the projects for which an allocation is sought must be submitted to the Department by the company for general approval prior to any issue of funds.  Issues to the Millennium Company are restricted to costs associated with the specific projects approved by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the start of each quarter a certificate must be forwarded to the Department showing the amount of <Col N="164" /> expenditure the Millennium Company expects will be incurred in that quarter on approved projects.  The company must submit a written request to the Department specifying the projects and purposes for which the money is required.  Evidence of board approval for expenditure is required.</P>
    <P>The grant is paid on a phased basis as required to the Millennium Company who are responsible for the subsequent expenditure, including the duty of ensuring adequate control and accountability by the recipients.</P>
    <P>Separate accounts must be maintained and audited separately for the expenditure of the £700,000 grant by the company.  A copy of the audited accounts must be submitted to the Department as soon as possible in 1989 and in any event before 31st March, 1989.</P>
    <P>The accounts of the Millennium Company must be made available, if required, for examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>All publicity in connection with the individual projects is to display an acknowledgement that the project has been assisted by the national lottery. The National Lottery Company must be consulted about the form of such acknowledgements.</P>

      <P>All contributions by Government Departments towards the Dublin Millennium are detailed in the table beneath. There is no practical way of quantifying <Col N="165" /> the benefits involved but the large amount of parallel private sector investment and the numbers of visitors <Col N="166" /> attracted to the city during the Millennium appear in broad terms to justify the value of the overall project.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment whether he proposes to include sufficient funds in the 1989 Estimates to ensure that Kildare County Council will be in a position to proceed with the road and bridge alignments at Newtown, Maynooth, County Kildare; the present position in relation to this project; if he foresees the commencement of work in 1989; if he will indicate when the project is likely to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the proposed scheme for the realignment of the road and bridge at Bond Bridge, Maynooth.</P>
      <P>Bond Bridge is located on a regional road.  Primary responsibility for improvement works on such roads rests with the local authority and the funding is normally provided from local resources supplemented by the block grant for roads.</P>
      <P>The local authority has applied for a special grant in this case and in this regard have submitted a preliminary report and cost estimate for the proposed scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1988, I allocated a special road grant of £40,000 to the local authority as a contribution towards the cost of site investigation and the preparation of preliminary reports for the Bond Bridge scheme and for the improvement of Shaw Bridge, which is also on a regional road.</P>
      <P>The question of a grant to meet an appropriate share of any costs arising on the Bond Bridge scheme next year is being considered in the context of the availability of funds for 1989.  I expect to be in a position to determine the 1989 road grant allocations within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>On 17 June 1988, I made an order approving Kildare County Council's motorway scheme for the proposed Kilcock/Maynooth/Leixlip by-pass.  It is now a matter for the local authority to proceed with the preparation of detailed plans and contract documents for the project. The timing of construction work is being considered in the context of the preparation of the Blueprint for Road Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Improvements to the national road at Laraghbryan are being carried out in two phases.  Phase I has been completed at a cost of £804,000.  A revised design for the second phase, costing an estimated £500,000, has been approved by the Department.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to allocate a grant for 1988 for the second phase because of competing demands for other important road improvement schemes.  The question of a grant will be reconsidered when the road grant allocations for 1989 are being determined.</P>
      <P>The question of land acquisition is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authority and the landowners involved. It is understood that the local authority consider that it may be necessary to make a compulsory purchase order in respect of some of the property involved.</P>

    <P>My policy in relation to the issue or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that employment opportunities arising here are reserved for Irish <Col N="179" /> and EC nationals.  The issue of a work permit is not considered unless an employer can show that despite all reasonable efforts, no suitably qualified Irish or European Community nationals are available for the position in question or that there are special circumstances (e.g. the prospective employee is married to an Irish national; the prospective employee is an officially recognised refugee; the prospective employee is a key worker and that a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish/EC nationals will arise as a result; or the person is coming as part of a recognised exchange programme).  In addition, workers in respect of whom work permits are issued must satisfy immigration regulations.</P>

      <P>A wide range of measures to combat AIDS have been established for some time and are developed on an on-going basis to meet the changing circumstances of the AIDS problem.  Such measures include voluntary and confidential testing and monitoring systems for AIDS cases and HIV infection levels; screening of blood donations and of blood products for haemophiliacs; seminars and training for health care staff; and the provision of information for the public at national and local level through advertising, an AIDS booklet and a confidential telephone service.</P>
      <P>The epidemiological pattern of AIDS to date in this country has shown the problem to be greatest among IV drug abusers.  In view of this, efforts so far this year in regard to combating AIDS have concentrated largely on this group.  A special allocation obtained from the national lottery is now funding an AIDS prevention and intervention programme aimed primarily at IV drug abusers.  The major project involved is an Eastern Health Board Outreach Programme which involves statutory and non-statutory agencies.  In addition, the recent opening of two new sexually transmissible disease clinics at Limerick and Waterford represents an important step in the Government's strategy to control AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special effort is also being made in the educational area this year.  A longterm AIDS programme for secondary <Col N="183" /> schools is under preparation.  In the meantime, the health board directors of community care/medical officers of health are co-operating with local school managements in providing AIDS education to ensure that students leaving school are aware of the basic facts of AIDS.</P>

        <i>Limerick West):</i> The person referred to was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts in 1976 in respect of disablement due to injury.  He subsequently received a lump sum payment for the same injury in settlement of a civil claim.  The Army Pensions Acts provide that, where compensation is received after the award of a disability pension, the award may be reviewed and, having regard to the amount of the compensation, the pension may be either terminated or reduced.  As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an actuarial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pensions Acts, payment of pension was withheld from July 1982 to April 1987, inclusive.  Due to increases in disability pensions the annual rate of disability pension in this case has exceeded the annuity value of the compensation since 1 May 1987.  Payment of the difference for the period from 1 May 1987 to 31 July 1988, was made to the person concerned in August 1988.  Further payments will continue to issue monthly in arrears. <Col N="190" /> This case is under review in my Department at present and I will advise the Deputy of the outcome in due course.</P>

    <P>Details of the grants are attached.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am delighted to announce the continuation of the grants this year&rdquo;.  Mary O'Rourke said &ldquo;Since the scheme was inagurated in 1985 forty-five women have already been assisted in this way. All the recipients have shown great determination in furthering their education and indeed made sacrifices to achieve their goals.  I know from speaking with a number of them that these grants have been of great benefit and have been warmly welcomed by all concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Up to 10 grants will be awarded in respect of course expenses, payable to a maximum of £1,000, to mature women students in respect of the academic year 1988-89.  Each applicant must comply, <i>inter alia,</i> with the following conditions:</P>
    <P>&mdash;be aged 25 years or over;</P>
    <P>&mdash;be unwaged or on a low income;</P>
    <P>&mdash;have completed successfully at least one year of an approved undergraduate degree, diploma or certificate course;</P>
    <P>&mdash;have re-enrolled for the 1988-89 academic year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;not be in receipt of a grant, scholarship or funding from any other source;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide information on the financial circumstances of the household/individual.</P>
    <P>Preference will be given to those pursuing courses specifically geared towards industry, business, science and technology or any area where women may have been traditionally underrepresented.</P>
    <P>Full details of the scheme, together with application forms are available, on request, from the Department of <Col N="194" /> Education, 3rd Floor, Hawkins House, Hawkins Street, Dublin 2 (Telephone: 734700, Ext. 2560/2561).

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299, 300, 301 and 304 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the post-primary school at Confey <Col N="196" /> is a community college the responsibility for providing the necessary accommodation for the pupils of the school rests in the first instance with County Kildare Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>The necessary approval to provide temporary accommodation for the current school session was given to the vocational education committee by my Department on 1 July 1988.  Provision for future years has already been the subject of discussion between the school authorities and my Department.  I wish to assure the Deputy that approval to provide such accommodation will be given to the VEC in ample time to allow the school to cater for the expected increased enrolment.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the permanent structure is that I have authorised the VEC to proceed on the basis of providing a permanent school building to cater for 600 pupils in the long term.  The relevant schedule of accommodation has been prepared by my Department and has recently been forwarded to County Kildare VEC for their agreement.  A site report has also been requested.  As soon as the schedule has been agreed and the site report furnished by the VEC's design team, my Department will arrange a briefing meeting with the design team with a view to proceeding with the architectural planning of the project.</P>
    <P>The following are the stages of the planning process:&mdash;Stage 1: Site Report; Stage 2: Outline Sketch Scheme; Stage 3: Developed Sketch Scheme; Stage 4: Working Drawings; Stage 5: Bills of Quantities; Stage 6: Seeking of Tenders; Stage 7: Placing of Contract.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to indicate at this time when the various planning stages will be finalised or when construction will commence and be completed as the timescale depends mainly on factors outside the control of my Department.  The rate of progress will also depend on the availability of capital resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently examined the position of this project in the context of the second-level capital programme for 1988 and I have decided that the architectural planning will be further advanced during the course of this year.  The project is currently at stage 4 &mdash; working drawings&mdash;and, as soon as the examination of this is completed, processing of stage 5 &mdash; bills of quantities &mdash; will commence.</P>
      <P>The following stages of planning have already been processed: 1. Site Report; 2. Outline Sketch Scheme; 3. Developed Sketch Scheme.</P>
      <P>The other stages of architectural planning are: 4. Working Drawings; 5. Bills of Quantities; 6. Seeking of Tenders; 7. Placing of Contract.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate at this time the precise date when construction work will be completed.  The rate of progress, as in the case of all other second level building projects, is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>It is long-standing practice, and in keeping with general policy, for my Department to consider the centralisation of small schools.</P>
      <P>One of the elements in the agreement recently reached in discussions under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> on savings to be achieved in the primary sector was that the programme of rationalisation of schools would be intensified. In view of the recent retirement of the principal teacher of Kilshanroe National School, the possibility of effecting a general re-organisation of educational facilities in the area is being investigated. Pending a decision, a temporary replacement teacher has been sanctioned, which is the normal arrangement in such cases.</P>

      <P>My Department have approved the provision of a major extension to Edenderry Vocational School at an estimated cost of £1.35 million.  Architectural planning is at the bills of quantities stage.  The next stage is the seeking of tenders for the project.  Due to my Department's other commitments and priorities, it has not been possible to provide the necessary funds to advance the project in the current year.  However, this project will be reviewed in the context of the capital resources available for second level building projects in 1989.  In the meantime, my Department have recently sanctioned funding for necessary upgrading works and prefabricated classroom replacements for the school.</P>

      <P>For the purpose of servicing the courses conducted by Vocational Education Committees my Department authorises an allocation of teaching posts each year.  This allocation is made on a Committee-wide basis and not in respect of individual schools.</P>
      <P>Following my Department's notification to the Co. Kildare VEC of its authorised allocation of teaching posts for the 1988-89 session that VEC lodged an appeal for an increased allocation. My Department has now issued a revised staffing allocation to the VEC.</P>

      <P>The allocation for inservice courses for primary teachers for both 1987 and 1988 was £143,000, an average of £6.74 for each teacher employed.  This figure excludes the salaries and expenses of members of my Department's inspectorate who are involved in the organising and running of such courses, and the cost of financing the network of teacher centres which caters for both primary and post-primary teachers.  One of the functions of a teacher centre is to organise courses on various aspects of curriculum development.</P>
      <P>The provision for inservice courses in Subhead J. of the Vote for Second Level and Further Education in 1988 was £298,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in 1987 was £293,000. This subhead provides for the cost of organising the courses for all post-primary teachers and for the travel and subsistence costs of secondary teachers attending them.  The travel and subsistence costs for vocational and community/comprehensive school teachers attending inservice courses are met by the VECs and the community/ comprehensive schools out of their own budgets.  Excluding the travel and subsistence costs of teachers from <Col N="209" /> vocational, community and comprehensive schools, the average provision per second level teacher employed was approximately £15.</P>

      <P>Having examined the circumstances of the case I am satisfied that there are no grounds for the appointment of an extra teacher in this school.</P>
      <P>Enrolment on 30 September 1987 was 244, which warrants a staff of Principal and six Assistants (plus of course the shared remedial post which is not affected by schedules or enrolments).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there has been a small increase in this year's enrolment it is not sufficient to warrant an additional <Col N="218" /> teacher.  Under the agreement which was reached with the Government and the unions under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the scheduled figure for the appointment of a 7th assistant is 252 but, in order to allow a departure from the normal staffing arrangements, the school would have to be in a developing situation, i.e. with a minimum 36 pupils over last year's figures.  The Department is satisfied that the present enrolment can be catered for by the authorised staff and that there should not be any difficulty in organising classes.</P>

    <P>(v)  Construction of Project: The project must be put out to tender and if it is proposed to pass over the lowest or any tender the Department must be notified before any other tender is accepted.  Failure to accept the lowest suitable tender may result in reduction or cancellation of grant aid.</P>

It will also be necessary to provide an undertaking protecting the Department's financial interest in the facility and guaranteeing the repayment of grants should it cease to operate or should a change of usage occur.</P>
    <P>(ix)  Insurance: The grantee will be required to arrange for the provision of adequate insurance cover for the completed facility, against fire and all other insurable risks, with an approved insurance company and to pay all necessary premiums.  The insurance will be for such amount as will provide cover for the full re-instatement value of the facility, together with a sum for professional fees.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the grantee to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc.</P>
    <P>3.
