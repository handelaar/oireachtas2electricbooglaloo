      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House learned with regret of the recent death of Seán MacBride.  May he rest in peace.</P>
      <P>In a long and distinguished career, spanning more than 60 years, he gave unselfishly of his time and energy in the service of the nation.  Inspired by a strong sense of patriotism he was an active participant in the struggle for independence, a Member of this House from 1947 to 1957, and Minister for External Affairs between 1948 and 1951.  He did much to foster economic and social progress in this country at an important stage in its development, and his contributions to international economic co-operation were numerous and distinguished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was an important influence in the creation of the Council of Europe and also served as Vice-President of the Organisation for European Economic Co-Operation.  He helped to draft the European Convention on Human Rights. He was co-founder of Amnesty International and first chairman of its international executive from 1961 to 1974 and afterwards remained as president of the Irish section.  From 1963 to 1971 he served as Secretary General of the International Commission on Justice.  His passionate commitment to humanitarian <Col N="440" /> causes and to human rights was again shown when he served as Assistant Secretary General to the United Nations with particular responsibility for the affairs of Southern Africa.  As UN Commissioner for Namibia he sought to advance the right to self-determination of the Namibian people, and their leaders have acknowledged his important contribution. His international experience made him particularly suitable to identify and highlight the serious defects in the system of administration of justice and the discrimination that exists in employment in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>He has the unique distinction of being the only person ever to have been awarded both the Nobel and Lenin Peace Prizes.  A keen advocate of nuclear disarmament, he served with great distinction on many international bodies whose aim is to foster world peace, and he did much to highten awareness in Ireland of the nuclear menace.</P>
    <P>He was a statesman of the highest standing, a renowned constitutional lawyer, a patriot and humanitarian.  He was listened to with respect among the nations and he will be remembered with high regard not only here in Ireland but all over the world.  I personally will remember him for his friendship and advice and for his kind and generous spirit.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ort, a Cheann Comhairle, comhbhrón Comhaltaí an Tí seo a chur in iúl dá mhuintir.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Taoiseach in conveying the sympathy of this House to the family of the late Seán MacBride.  There are very few of us who can look back over a lifetime that contained three separate identifiable careers.  I think that it is mostly for his career as a former Member of this House and Minister and for his later career as an international jurist of wide repute that we would remember Seán MacBride.  He had, as the Taoiseach has said, the unique distinction of being the holder of both the Lenin Peace Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize.  I know that it was one of Seán <Col N="441" /> MacBride's many ambitions that that particular ability to span East and West which he most wanted other people to emulate, and which indeed was a big part of the work he did, should be remembered. That distinction in itself was a very eloquent expression of the respect in which he was held throughout the world and, indeed, a very telling testimonial to the work which he did for human rights and the defence of civil liberties.</P>
      <P>There was another aspect to his career which is probably less well known.  This was a more recent development.  It is the very strong interest he took in later years in the development of our national resources.  A number of those who were involved either officially or personally in efforts to develop our natural resources have cause to be grateful for the good advice and wisdom Seán MacBride had to offer them.  He was a man who was involved in many controversies during his lifetime.  On many issues there are many of us who are here today who disagreed very strongly with him but all of us would recognise that, in our personal dealings with him, we always found him &mdash; whether he agreed with us or not &mdash; to be a man of very considerable personal charm and warmth.  His passing marks in many ways the end of a particular era in Irish politics.  We hope he has achieved at this stage, not on earth, the kind of peace he worked so strongly and so long for on this earth.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes being paid today to the late Seán MacBride.  It is appropriate that this morning we should pay these tributes to him and extend our condolences to his family.  It is also proper that we should pay a special tribute to a unique human being who, during his active and intensely committed life, became recognised as an international symbol of compassion and concern for the protection of human rights both at home and abroad.  His untiring work for those who are the marginalised and often forgotten in our world is the most enduring <Col N="442" /> legacy in respect of which we all owe a debt of gratitude.</P>
      <P>On a personal level I have always found his work to be inspirational.  I had the privilege and pleasure on one occasion to work on an informal commission of inquiry into the penal service with him and I found his serenity in the midst of discussion and debate and his capacity to be able to somehow embrace a much broader view than is the norm in our political environment uniquely impressive and inspirational.  His passing is a loss to the international community and to those of us who care deeply about the development of human rights policies here.  Our condolences to his family and may he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Seán MacBride was a man of many parts.  At one time he appeared to be on the verge of engineering a fundamental change in the development of the Irish political system but ultimately it was on the world stage that he made his greatest contribution.  That contribution was recognised by the granting of many honours and by the esteem in which he was held by world leaders.  Throughout his career he was a man in search of change for the better, as he saw it.  In his later years I, together with many others in the House, found myself on the opposite side to Seán MacBride on a number of important social issues.  I did not agree with the position he adopted and he was not always an easy man to disagree with but I respect the sincerity with which he held and maintained his views.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to sum up a career as varied as his in the few moments available to us.  Perhaps, in the fullness of time he will be remembered at home for things that are not so obvious now.  He may be remembered, for instance, for his commitment to the development of our natural resources or he may be remembered as one who believed passionately that there was room on this island for every one of its young people and that we had an economy that could provide for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most likely that he will be remembered <Col N="443" /> as a man who bought his very considerable talents to bear on the cause of peace and freedom from oppression in many parts of the world where that was an unenviable task.  There are thousands of political prisoners, thousands of young black people, who have reason to remember Seán MacBride with gratitude.  Their remembrance is probably more powerful than any monument we can erect to him. On behalf of the Labour Party, I should like, therefore, to add my voice to the tributes paid here.  I would like, above all, to extend our sympathy to his family and friends who will miss him greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás MacGiolla Tomás MacGiolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás MacGiolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I wish to be associated with this tribute to Seán MacBride and I extend our sympathy to his family.  Seán MacBride was a major political figure in Ireland and internationally for more than 50 years.  He was regarded as a controversial figure on domestic issues but few Irish people have made a greater contribution to world affairs than Seán MacBride.  It is for that that he will be remembered most.</P>
      <P>He was a fearless opponent of racism as his term of office as UN Commissioner for Namibia showed.  He also played a very significant role for human rights, in the international campaign for peace and against nuclear weapons.  I am sure it was a great comfort to him that he lived to see the signing of the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union for the elimination of intermediate range nuclear weapons which he worked so hard for and which we must all hope was just the first step in the process towards total nuclear disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that he was the only person ever to have been awarded both the Nobel and Lenin Peace Prizes was a unique tribute to his international work, to his neutrality and his support for Irish neutrality.  The most effective way we can commemorate him is by continuing and, indeed, by intensifying the struggle for <Col N="444" /> world peace and the protection of Irish neutrality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 17.  It is also proposed that in the debate of Financial Resolution No. 4 in the name of the Minister for Finance, the following arrangements shall apply:</P>
      <P>(1)  The speech of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups, as defined in Standing Order 89 (1) (a), shall not exceed one and a quarter hours;</P>
      <P>(2)  The speech of each other Member called on shall not exceed 45 minutes.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that statements will be made at 3.45 p.m. under Standing Order 41 on the Stalker-Sampson report and each statement shall not exceed 15 minutes and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>

      <P>In respect of Financial Resolution No. 4, is the time limit applying to spokespersons nominated by each group agreed?  Agreed.  Is the time limit of 45 minutes in respect of Members agreed?  Agreed.  Is the recommendation in respect of statements agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would be agreeable, subject to the agreement of the House and if warranted, to extend the scope of that series of statements to embody comment on the judgment of the appeal by the Birmingham Six which is to be announced today?  Will it be possible to facilitate reference to that in the context of the statements on the Stalker-Sampson report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I always want to facilitate the House on these matters but what the Deputy has suggested would hardly be appropriate.  The Stalker-Sampson <Col N="445" /> affair is a very separate and distinctive issue and our statements on this occasion should be confined to that.  I am sure we can find some other way of dealing with any other announcements that may be made today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>May I simply ask, as both matters are germane to relations between these two countries, if the Taoiseach considers it appropriate to permit comment today or will he facilitate statements being made early next week?</P>

      <P>On 22 December, after the House had adjourned, the Government issued a statement explaining that the Taoiseach had taken his own personal initiative in inviting the INTO to meet him and embark on a review of the primary school system.  The Dáil was in recess at that time and I tabled a question to the Taoiseach for yesterday's Order Paper to explore that initiative and delve into the background to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to observe to the Taoiseach that, while it may be true that so far no Minister of this Government has closed the Celtic Sea, the way they are going now it would not be surprising if they got there in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The budget statement that we heard yesterday represents, without any doubt, a very substantial missed opportunity. The Government have failed to capitalise on a very substantial consensus that exists in this House in relation to fiscal, budgetary and economic policy.  The fact is, as the Government should know, that, in my party, as well as among Members of the Progressive Democrats and indeed among some Members of the Labour Party, there is a very strong belief in the kinds of measures required to be taken to get our debt problem under control.</P>
      <P>The Government missed an opportunity last year but it is more worthy of criticism that that should have been the case again this year.  Last year I suppose the Government could have been forgiven for not availing of that opportunity. After all, they were only a very short time in office last year when they produced a budget.  The Fine Gael position had been made very clear and the position of the Progressive Democrats seemed to have been very clear at that time.  Those were the days before some Members of that party had had time to be seduced by the charms of opportunism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> I suppose last year, in the particular circumstances of that time, it was understandable that the Government might not fully realise the extent of the consensus that had emerged, particularly since, on the whole, they themselves were very recent converts to that line of thinking. But there is no excuse for that timidity this year.  There is no excuse for having missed the opportunity this year because it has been clear throughout the year that, on the issue of mastering our debt problem, there is a very clear majority in this House and among the political parties in favour of the kind of action required.</P>
    <P>Instead of having a budget that started off from the base of that consensus we have had a budget this year which almost claims to have built that consensus.  It is almost exclusively concerned with dealing with the debt problem; it is almost exclusively concerned with financial problems.  It is quite rightly concerned with all of those but it is not right that it should be concerned with those issues to the exclusion of almost everything else.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that it is important to bring the Exchequer borrowing requirement for this year to 8.2 per cent of GNP down from 10.3 per cent of GNP in 1987; it is important to bring the current budget deficit to 6.3 per cent of GNP this year down from 8.6 per cent in 1987. But it is going too far to say that those developments, important as they are, are the measure of success, as the Minister for Finance claimed yesterday.  They are no such thing.  In view of the consensus they are no more and they should be no more than the normal backdrop against which the really fundamental decisions have to be made.</P>
    <P>Those fundamental decisions concern, in the main, issues which are not addressed by the budget or issues which are only very lightly touched on by the measures the Minister for Finance brought before us yesterday.  The real issues have to do with growth, growth in employment, growth in economic activity, growth in the ability of our economic and social system to serve the needs of our people. <Col N="453" /> So in looking at this year's budget our main concern must be to identify what, if anything, it does for growth, and the only conclusion I can draw is that it does not do much for growth.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in a radio interview not so long ago, majored on the fact that, being an optimistic person, he expected growth of around 1 per cent during the course of this year.  The budget figures, however, are built on zero growth and the Minister for Finance indicated this yesterday.  While it may be welcome that the Taoiseach appears to have lost his propensity for rash optimism which we saw in October 1982, for example, when he assumed growth, it is discouraging nevertheless to find that not only do the Government expect there to be no growth in 1988 but it seems that they spent none of their time in designing budget measures in a way that would make a difference to that situation, because there is nothing in the measures set out in this budget to encourage growth.</P>
    <P>Now, it may be that the financial targets in the budget would prevent domestic interest rates from rising.  It may even be that the fiscal stance taken by the Government, the targets in relation to borrowing and the current deficit, will actually bring domestic interest rates down.  If they do so we will all be very happy to see that; it is a development we all want to encourage.  That in itself is not a stimulus to growth.  But if domestic interest rates are stabilised or brought down what will be happening in fact will be that we will be moving on a path that brings our real interest rates a little closer into line with real interest rates elsewhere. We will not be achieving a positive advantage for production in this country. We will be reducing a disadvantage under which production and economic activity labour at the moment.  Even there the effect which the Government expect to see from that is not great and, in the words of the Minister for Finance himself, it will take time to have effect.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget measures here to reduce costs, to reduce costs of production, to improve the competitiveness <Col N="454" /> of our economy apart, perhaps, from one aspect of the measure that imposes VAT on electricity.  That measure in itself would be neutral for VAT registered industrial users of electricity because of course they can claim back any VAT that is charged.  There will be some advantage if there is a guarantee that the ESB will actually reduce the pre-VAT price of electricity and the Minister for Finance partly justified the measure yesterday by saying he expected that there was a reduction in ESB prices in the pipeline.  Of course we must all hope that that will come about.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear what measures, if any, the Government are taking to make sure that the pre-VAT price of electricity from 1 March is reduced by 5 per cent, or whatever the margin is so that we actually get a net benefit from that development.  Otherwise the domestic consumer will bear the net cost of the application of VAT to electricity.  There will be a number of people in the commercial field whose businesses are too small to be registered who fall below the VAT registration limit who equally would have to bear any extra burden that VAT on electricity would cause.  As I have said, without a clear measure, without a guarantee that the pre-VAT price of electricity is going to be reduced, there is no benefit whatever to be got from the measure proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I must say that the rest of what the Government are proposing in relation to the ESB seems extraordinary.  If I read the Minister for Finance correctly yesterday, what he was saying was that, instead of getting £2.3 million from the ESB this year in terms of the repayment of advances made by the Exchequer over the years, the Government are going to take £31.3 million this year.  In other words the Government are going to take from the ESB this year the payment of advances that would seem to be due over a period of up to 15 years, whatever that period is.  The Government are certainly raking into 1988 revenue that should normally <Col N="455" /> accrue over a substantial period of years into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are getting income of one kind or another that should normally be coming in over a substantial period of years.  There is bound to be a cost to the ESB in making all of those repayments in 1988 rather than making them over a period of years and, of course, that immediately prompts the question: if the ESB are in a position to hand over to the Government this year £29 million more than they otherwise would have, what could they have done if the Government were not grabbing that £29 million?  What cost reducing action could the ESB take if they now have the leeway to produce £29 million for the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the real Michael Noonan, last night raised a few questions in this connection.  I can only re-echo his surprise that a semi-State company who, at the beginning of last year, appeared to have the gravest difficulty in meeting a commitment to make a contribution in lieu of rates of around half of the amount we are talking about here, now find they can hand over £31 million to the Government this year in repayment of advances made to them previously.  But the question still stands.  If the Government were not raking in this extra £29 million this year what other measures would have been open to the ESB, what other benefit might consumers of electricity not have had if the ESB had been allowed to use funds in their own way?  Would it not have been a vital option for the ESB to decide to use whatever leeway they have to reduce the cost of electricity to industrial consumers thereby increasing competiveness, ensuring the continuation of production in a number of units that might otherwise have some difficulty, and <Col N="456" /> increasing employment or underwriting existing employment?  That issue has not been addressed in the budget statement but it is one of the areas which has to do with competitiveness of our economy on which we need more details from the Government.</P>
    <P>Of course, with the application of value-added tax electricity, the domestic consumer must absorb this extra charge. It is particularly with the domestic consumer in mind that I must again ask that we be given a guarantee that the pre-VAT price of electricity will be reduced so that this particular budgetary measure does not result in a net extra cost to the domestic consumer.</P>
    <P>The Government have made some very timid moves on corporation profits tax.  We need a good deal more than this.  As the Minister himself indicated yesterday, perhaps the measures will not even have the effect they might appear to have on the surface because it will take time for the full effects of the application of advance corporation tax to work their way through the system.  The move being made in relation to corporation profits tax takes the form of a phased reduction in accelerated capital allowances accompanied by a phased reduction in the rates of corporation profits tax.  That is obviously a sensible way to go, but I think we are entitled to ask if that kind of gradual approach to this type of reform will actually bring about any results in the short term.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Government have failed to add to the measures taken what should be logically the next step.  What the Government should be thinking of doing is reducing the capital allowances in the profits tax system and using a part of the revenue derived from that to reduce the rates of tax but also using a part of the revenue to act on those cost factors which are most in the way of employment and output expansion.</P>
    <P>When we look at the structure of our system of corporation tax it becomes more and more obvious that we need to direct our attention to the cost factors. A reduction in the rate of corporation profits tax is important to companies that <Col N="457" /> are making profits.  A reduction in the rate of capital allowances is of importance to companies that are now using those allowances, and basically that means companies which are either in the process of carrying out new investment or have carried out new investment in the fairly recent past.  A reduction in the capital allowances has no ill effects on a company which has not recently carried out capital investment, and that is the majority of companies in our economy. A reduction in the rate of corporation tax has no effect on companies in the 10 per cent bracket and for the other companies a reduction in the rate of corporation tax will be important only if they have a significant amount of profits on which this tax is being paid.  For companies with low profit levels, or companies which are just breaking even, this tax measure gives no benefit.  Those same companies would certainly benefit from a move that used the extra revenue that would come from a reduction in capital allowances to act directly on cost factors in business.</P>
    <P>The line we should take there is to make the changes that appear to be possible and feasible in capital allowances and use the extra tax revenue that would come from that to reduce cost factors such as the duty on fuel oil used in industry, and in electricity generation so that we will bring down electricity costs to industry and reduce the duty on fuel oil used in road transport so that we can begin to reduce the cost disadvantage to Irish industry that is inherent in our higher transport costs.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of objective we should have in mind when we go about reforming our company tax system because that is the only way we will get manufacturing production and service activity onto anything like an equal footing with our competitors in other countries.  That is the kind of orientation that tax reform measures should take in a budget.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget to assist growth in agriculture.  The Government have again this year taken this very easy way out of a short term revenue problem by reducing the flat rate VAT refund for farmers.  The effect of that will be <Col N="458" /> negative as far as any growth in agricultural output is concerned.  Again we have seen what I believe to be a very unwise and shortsighted move here.  I think this is dangerous.</P>
    <P>Are the Government indicating that if they found, for example, in any other sector of activity that there were arrears of tax or that there were difficulties in collecting tax, they would change the VAT system for industrial producers? Are the Government saying that if, in the service sector, they found there were problems collecting tax from some people they would change the basis on which they are entitled to offset the VAT they pay against the VAT they collect and remit to the Revenue Commissioners?  I hope they are not, but if they are not saying that, they should not be doing this in the agricultural sector either.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any justice in pleading, as the Government do, that because there are difficulties in collecting health contributions we should interfere with the VAT mechanism in this way because interference in the VAT mechanism affects everybody.  It affects those who pay their health contributions as well as those who do not; it affects those who are in the income tax net as well as those who are not; and it affects those who are in the income tax net and pay their bills as much as it does those who are not. This is not the kind of instrument that should be used to make up for deficiencies in the system for collecting income tax or levies of any kind.</P>
    <P>The young farmer installation grant is a measure which can be pointed to with some justice as being a development measure in this budget.  I am glad to see it there.  It should never have been taken away in 1987.  What, after all, has been achieved?  All that was achieved was that a good number of young people who had farms transferred to them and who wanted to modernise their farms were made to wait.  Substantial numbers of applicants had been approved shortly before the decision was made in last year's budget to abolish this scheme. They complied with all the criteria, had all the necessary qualifications and had <Col N="459" /> made arrangements for all the necessary transfer papers to be put together.  They were suddenly told that the scheme had ended, that they had not been approved, stamped, signed, sealed and delivered in time to get the installation aid.</P>
    <P>Now the scheme is once more in operation. I do not know what the effective date is.  I do not know whether I can assume that the scheme is effective from midnight last night or at some date in the near future.  The Government will have to look at how effect is given to the scheme.  For example, will the people whose applications were cut off by the gate shutting on them last year be considered in this scheme?  Can we take it that those who had conformed to all the criteria last year, before the scheme was abolished, will come into the scheme this year?  That is not clear from what the Minister said yesterday.  However, the Minister should be aware that, if he takes the view that those who qualified last year remain in limbo and do not qualify this year, he will be doing himself a great disservice and, even more important, he will be doing a very serious disservice to those who had geared themselves last year to participate in this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget that shows any concern with expansion or growth in the food sector.  God knows, over the past 15 months, we have heard more than enough from the Government about their attachment to the food sector, programmes for its development, initiatives and new research.  Granted, we have a Minister of State for the food sector &mdash; God bless him &mdash; institutes, research programmes and strategies, but there is no growth in the food sector.  No opportunity has been taken in the budget to alter the cost environment in any way that would help the food sector &mdash; or any other sector &mdash; to develop further.</P>
    <P>Fishing and aquaculture were mentioned in the Minister's budget speech and this is another sector where we were to expect measures which would lead to a large number of extra jobs.  In this area we have another strategy, another institute but no growth.  I can see no pearl <Col N="460" /> in this oyster and we will wait a long time for one to appear.  Indeed, it is even worse than that in that sector of activity because, in the last few days, my colleague, Deputy Avril Doyle, found that there does not seem to be any pressure from the Government on the European Commission to ensure that we get the kind of assistance from FEOGA that we should get.  It appears now that a smaller proportion of our applications for assistance from FEOGA succeeded than was the case in any other country.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if we have fully explored the reasons for that.  Is part of the reason the fact that the Government are not prepared to show that they will put in the funds required from national sources in order to get these projects going?  If that is the case, is it because the Government do not believe that these projects are worth supporting, or have they taken the view that some other forms of activity are more worthy of support in the context of the FEOGA schemes?  A great many people around the country would like to know the answers because they have projects &mdash; not just on the drawing boards but even further advanced &mdash; for the development of aquaculture activities. Indeed, many people are in a position to supply all the equipment requirements of that industry and who now find themselves in difficulty because there has been almost a complete moratorium on any real development in that sector.  There is nothing in the budget which will alter the cost environment in any way to promote the development of that area of activity.</P>
    <P>Looking at the measures in relation to personal taxation, the only conclusion we can draw is that there is no stimulus to growth.  The Minister for Finance was very optimistic when he said yesterday that consumer spending in 1988 could show a small increase.  Mind you, he was very circumspect in putting it that way, that it could show a small increase. However, the Taoiseach, ten days earlier, was confident that we would see an increase.  I doubt it because pre-tax incomes will show little change in 1988 compared to 1987.  If we examine the budget table at the back of the Minister's <Col N="461" /> speech, we see that most of the £91 million in personal tax relief to which the Minister referred yesterday is financed by tax increases which will fall mainly on personal expenditure.  The £91 million tax relief will be financed by a series of other taxation measures.  The withholding tax on medical fees &mdash; £6 million if memory serves me well &mdash; will come out of personal consumption expenditure because that is a straight amputation off the top of income of the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Excise duties will produce £26 million in tax relief but those duties, for the most part, will come directly off ordinary consumer expenditure.  Some parts will fall on industrial costs but by far the greater part of the £26 million extra revenue from excise duty is an extra charge on consumer expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction in the flat rate addition to farm prices under the VAT scheme which is to bring in £7 million. Anybody here who represents a rural constituency knows that sum will come straight off the ordinary day to day consumer expenditure on farms.  The £10 million extra excise VAT revenue from electricity will all come from the domestic consumer.  That all comes off ordinary consumer expenditure.  Domestic consumers all over the country will now have to pay that £10 million to the ESB which means they will not have that money to spend on clothes, food or on any other items that go to make up the volume of personal consumption expenditure.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty on bank cards is not like most other duties.  It is a charge levied on everyone who has a pass card.  If you have to pay £10 per annum for your pass card it is money that you will not have to spend on shoe polish, shoe laces, toys or tinned salmon.  It comes straight off your ability to finance personal consumption expenditure.</P>
    <P>The taxation of pension funds will raise £15 million this year.  That money comes out of people's pensions and if they do not receive it, it will not turn up as consumer expenditure.  We were also told that £24 million will be collected in tax arrears.  I do not know how much of that the Minister <Col N="462" /> expects to collect from corporate taxpayers or from partnerships but inevitably, some part of it will come off personal incomes.  When we look at all of that we can find little reason to believe that there is any prospect for an increase in consumer spending this year.  We see something else also which is that the £90 million in tax relief for the hard pressed taxpayer is nothing more than a snare and a delusion because the same taxpayer is providing the revenue that makes that possible from another pocket.  We do not have a net relief in taxation in this budget. All of the areas I have mentioned as being the source of revenue from which this tax relief would be provided will have, directly or indirectly, effects on the people who are paraded before us as being the beneficiaries of these tax reductions.</P>
    <P>There is precious little indication of any scope for growth in this connection. The real way to go for growth &mdash; which is what we need to do &mdash; is to look at the kinds of reforms in the tax system that will give us the means of changing the cost environment in the economy.  That has not been addressed.  Before I leave the subject of consumption expenditure I have to acknowledge that the social welfare increases are useful.  They will help to maintain the volume of consumer spending but there is little real addition to the overall volume of consumer demand on foot of those increases.</P>
    <P>We now turn to what needs to be done in order to promote growth.  As I said earlier what we need to do in the corporate sector is to change the burden of taxation, to use the effect of some of the reliefs &mdash; or even a large part of the reliefs which are now in place &mdash; to alter the cost environment and use the extra revenue to drive down the costs that are making it difficult for firms to operate, expand and change the balance because it would have the effect of changing the balance between the incentive to new investment and the continuation and the working of existing investment.  That is something to which we should pay particular attention.</P>
    <P>If we look at personal taxation we need to have the same kind of thing in mind. <Col N="463" /> I am sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that Members on the other side of the House do not need any guidance from me on what the disincentive effects of high levels of personal taxation are.  They were eloquent about it in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986.  They went on and on about it, hour after hour, in the House in budget debates and in Finance Bills.  I will do them the honour of assuming that their memories are good enough to remember what they said.  I will also do them the honour of assuming that they actually believed some of what they said on those occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need to spend a lot of time convincing them that there are these disincentive effects but what we need to look at is how do we take them away.  How do we remove these disincentive effects?  I want to put a suggestion to the Government and to the House. The real problem that most of us perceive &mdash; the real problem that most people perceive &mdash; is the amount that is taken out of our pay packet before we get it. They are not all that worried about the things that go out of their income that are matters under their own control.  Of course, nobody likes to pay out more than they have to on a mortgage, a term loan or whatever else it is.  They are essentially things that people undertake for themselves.  They are not expenditures that are forced on them or levies that are extracted from them without a decision on their part.  If we want to reduce the disincentive effects of taxation we need to spend more of our time looking at the direct effect of taxation on their incomes rather than at the role that tax plays in determining how they spend their incomes.  Let the Government consider this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would we be far better off, would people be happier, would they have more control over their incomes and would they feel a greater sense of incentive if all the reliefs that apply to taxation were at the point directly between the <Col N="464" /> employer and the employee &mdash; the difference between gross pay and net pay &mdash; and let people worry about how they use the income that remains to fund a mortgage, a pension scheme, a term loan or whatever else it may be.  That is the kind of thinking which needs to be brought in here.  My colleague, Deputy Noonan, quite rightly pointed out yesterday that there are two ways of going about tax reform: one is to do it gradually and the other is to do it as part of a package.  There is always a question as to how quickly a package can be brought in. As my colleague, Deputy Noonan, said, the record of recent years is that successful tax reforms were carried out in a package.  Those that did not succeed were those which were done in little bits and piece by piece.  That is something we should look at in this House.  It is something which we have time to look at before we come to this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>On the subject of taxation the Government produced last evening, by way of explanation of items contained in the budget speech, two documents, one called <i>Incentive To Bring Tax Affairs Up to Date</i> and the other <i>New Arrangements for Tax Returns and Assessment</i>.  I think that the Minister for Finance should not content himself with providing these documents just to Members of this House.  He would be doing his policy, such as it is, a favour if he were to send bundles of these documents to every accountancy practice in the country.  I find that there is already a very brisk demand for them but there is also a demand for an interpretation of these documents.  Listening to the Minister yesterday one got a very general impression of the kind of thing he has in mind.  Looking through these two documents last night the impression became a bit more specific but they still do not explain everything. I think it would be worth while spending some time examining in detail the scope of these measures and what their effect will be.  I know that in many cases it would come down to the conclusion that for a specific case you cannot say what the result will be until the people <Col N="465" /> in question have had the interviews with the Revenue Commissioners which are provided for here.  We all know that there are people, who for one reason or another, feel a certain reluctance about having interviews with the Revenue Commissioners.  If these measures are to have any effect in speeding up the collection of taxes they need to be explained with more clarity and in more detail than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to some of these specific measures that are dealt with in the budget some of which are not mentioned in the budget speech but which come out on a reading of the Principal Features, always a document worth mining in.  One of the most interesting things included in the Principal Features, which was not mentioned in the Minister's speech, was a provision of an extra £3.8 million for school transport compared to the Estimates as published last October.  I do not know why the Minister for Finance felt that he should not say anything about this in his budget speech because he talked about some other things that are a good deal less important than school transport.  Is it perhaps because even the Minister for Education with her well known determination of character and hardness of neck could not bring herself to say what this saving would have meant and that she is so relieved to get the money back that in the words of the old song &ldquo;she just took the money and ran&rdquo;.  This is another case, because there are several of them, where the Government last October and since have caused a lot of worry and a lot of concern to parents and, I know, a lot of worry and concern to members of the Government and members of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers some of whom have been treated with less than proper dignity in parts of Clare, if I hear correctly.  They have caused unnecessary chaos, unnecessary suffering, unnecessary aggravation and now they come back and say: &ldquo;We really did not need to do it after all because we have found out that the money is really there&rdquo;.</P>

Why in God's name would a sane Government which found that they could make this type of provision in 1988 take it out of the Estimates in the first case and then put it back in?  The way it was said yesterday, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it was not even that the Government were trying to pull a fast one and do the old Aunt Sally trick, take the money out of the Estimates, let everybody get calmed down over Christmas and then claim credit for putting it back in.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other points in the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget</i> which deserve more than a passing mention. There is, of course, the substantial enterprise, the change in the local loans fund arrangements which have been clearly <Col N="467" /> explained by the Minister for Finance. I have not heard the Minister for the Environment on the issue but I suppose he is probably relieved that the measure is in place, and of course it is something which, I must remind the Government, must be borne in mind this year and in all future years when making comparisons with the past.  I hope it will be the standard footnote in all budget and expenditure tables.</P>
    <P>We find under the heading of post primary education a reduction, compared to the Estimates, in the secondary teachers' incremental salary grants, subhead A 1 in the Vote for Post Primary Education which is being reduced by £3.5 million and subhead A.2, Annual Grants to VECs, again teachers pay, is being reduced by £1.5 million.  Those all come under the heading: &ldquo;Estimating adjustments to the provisions contained in the Abridged Estimates Volume for Votes 29 and 31 (not involving any policy change) following a re-estimation of 1988 requirements in the light of the 1987 provisional outturn.&rdquo;  This means that the Government think they got it wrong when they put the Estimates together and now they are mending their hand.  It also means that in the allocations they made in publishing the Estimates last October, the Government actually had the resources to do more in relation to secondary education than they thought.  Now they are taking that back out.  I think we deserve an explanation in the House as to why that is actually being done.  Is this being done in order to provide the funds for some of the £91 million in tax reliefs?  If that is the case, let us know about it.  It deserves more explanation than a simple entry in this table on page 4 of the <i>Principal Features of 1988 Budget.</i></P>
    <P>We have on the same page a new subhead for tourism and transport.  When are we going to have an explanation of this tourism package and what kind of measures are involved?  What is the £4 million going to do and how is it going to be used to promote tourism here?  On page 5 of the principal features we have a very mysterious item in Vote 44, Social <Col N="468" /> Welfare.  On page 6 we find various subheads &mdash; adjustments in the light of the 1987 provisional outturn, minus £15,400,000.  There is an awful lot of &ldquo;various&rdquo; in £15,400,000 and again I think we are entitled to ask the Government to explain exactly what is involved here.  Why are the Government taking £15,400,000 out of the Social Welfare Vote for 1988 and what are these various sub-heads?</P>
    <P>In the Health Vote we have a provision of £2.8 million for a scheme of mobility assistance for the physically disabled.  The original suggestion for 1988 was that the cost of the scheme as it is now would be £3.3 million.  It appears from remarks made yesterday that £2.8 million is the provision that would be appropriate for the remainder of the year.  In other words, it seems that already in the first four weeks of January, £0.5 million has been spent on that scheme.  That may very well be the case because the scheme as it operates at present is composed on the expenditure side, to a fairly substantial extent, of the excise and VAT rebate on new cars bought by persons who have various physical handicaps and, of course, people tend to change their cars at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and this has not been explained at all, why the Government believe there is need for a change in this scheme?  Because, certain other things have been happening it is not enough for the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health to come along and blandly announce to us that the scheme needs changing and that they will discuss it with the organisations affected. We need to know why it needs changing. Up to now a handicapped person buying a car especially adapted for use got a refund of the excise duty and the VAT on the car.  Indeed, if you were specially adapting a vehicle for handicapped persons you would get a refund of the VAT on the conversion work.  In addition, handicapped persons who qualify in that way get a rebate of excise duty on the first 600 gallons of petrol they use in a year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> We have all heard over the past few weeks of people who bought cars under that scheme on three or four occasions who now find that it is much more difficult to get an application form, to get the application form accepted and in many cases now they are being told that they must fill in a much longer and more detailed application form.  Why?  We have not been told why.  I would like to know how the Minister for Health thinks the health boards are going to operate this scheme more effectively and efficiently than the Revenue Commissioners. It will take a lot of persuasion to get me to believe that eight separate health boards are going to operate this scheme in an even handed way in the eight different health board areas and in any way better than the Revenue Commissioners. I would like to see brought into the House very quickly a full explanation as to why it is believed that this scheme should be changed and of the changes that are being proposed.  Let us debate it here and see whether we agree with that before the Minister puts all these organisations who have plenty of other work to do to all the trouble of going through this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates provision we have the restoration of the drugs refund and long term illness scheme, another example of pure rashness and folly on the part of the Government where the Government are now mending their hand.  I congratulate the Government on having the good sense to mend their hand on this issue but we must ask the question again; why in God's name did they have to create all this aggravation and worry in the first place?  This needs a bit more planning and attention to management, and with that we could avoid all the worry that has been caused to people over a number of weeks.  People who are not particularly well off were wondering if they would be facing drug bills during the course of 1988 which they could not afford with the refund gone from them.</P>
    <P>Then we have the provisions in relation to the public service pay agreement and <Col N="470" /> the early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.  All has been said that needs to be said about that public service pay agreement.  Mind you, the equivalence is not quite working out.  The logic of the scheme agreed with the social partners was that an extra £70 million would be paid out on the pay side and £70 million would be saved through the operation of the redundancy scheme.  Then we had the <i>deus ex machina,</i> the bright idea, the rabbit out of the hat from the Central Bank.  The Government this year are spending four years' non-tax revenue from the Central Bank.  They are doing it in another area also.  As I said, they seem to be taking 15 years' repayments from the ESB altogether in this year.  I hope the Government do not become addicted to that way of acting because if they do we will end up in years to come spending future years' tax income and finding when we arrive at those future years that we have no base at all for expenditure.  This approach must be adopted very selectively and carefully, if at all.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in these various adjustments to the Estimates that need more teasing out, and this budget debate is the place to do that, but I ask that the Government take this debate a little more seriously than they took it last year.  In this House we should be able to get answers and explanations, and I hope that we are going to get those in the course of the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I repeat what I said at the beginning.  This year this Government have missed an opportunity to build on a consensus that exists in this House on fiscal policy and to move forward from a proper concern with the debt into a more creative policy development phase.  They must go hand in hand.  It has taken us far too long to bring about that consensus on the essential need to deal with the debt problem.  It has taken the Government party far too long to realise that that is an essential component of any sane economic strategy, but now it is there I urge the Government not to be mesmerised by it.  In looking at the kind of reform and approaches to reform that I <Col N="471" /> have set out, we in this House can add on something valuable to that consensus that we have built, and that something valuable will be our own contribution to removing the obstacles to growth that plague our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister presented his budget yesterday facts are beginning to emerge to show the thinking behind the proposals in relation to PRSI. It is timely at this stage to set a few markers in relation to that debate, ask a few questions and draw a few tentative conclusions about what is intended here.</P>
      <P>First, it is as well to recall that the impetus for extending social insurance to the self employed is not of recent origin. In 1977 the work was done in a Green Paper on extending social insurance to the self employed.  The Green Paper was first published in 1978 and remained effectively on the shelf in the intervening period.  Active consideration of extension of social insurance to the self employed once again re-emerged on the agenda in the context of the negotiations between the social partners, leading to the public sector wage deal which has been referred to as the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> In that context there was added interest and renewed enthusiasm for the concept of extending social insurance to the self employed.  The avowed justification for such an extension was stated to be that the PAYE sector, subject as they are to the PRSI burden, were shouldering an unfairly heavy proportion of the total welfare bill, and it was suggested that correspondingly the self employed and farmers were getting away with shouldering an unduly light section of the tax burden in so far as they pay for social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take a few points into account in relation to this proposal.  First, on 10 June 1987 the Minister for Social Welfare approached the National Pensions Board as a matter of urgency to examine the issue of extending social insurance to the self employed.  The National Pensions Board had been established, it is fair to say, with an entirely different mandate. <Col N="472" /> They were to deal with the question of transferability of pensions and the general question of the pensions industry with particular reference to corporate and private pension funds.  Certainly the terms of reference of the National Pensions Board as framed did not encompass a role as adviser to the Government in relation to the social insurance system, but for whatever reason the Minister for Social Welfare decided that the NPB would be the appropriate forum in which to tease out the implications of extending social insurance to the self employed.</P>
    <P>On 29 July 1987, six weeks after he had asked the NPB to examine the issue, the Minister for Social Welfare announced a decision that in principle the Government had decided to extend social insurance cover to self employed people, including farmers, to come into effect in 1988.  He indicated then that all self employed persons were to be brought into social insurance from 1988; they were to be insured for retirement, invalidity and widow's and orphan's pensions and contributions would be income related and collected via the tax system.  He stated at the time that the Government's proposal would reduce the cost of paying social assistance to the self employed significantly over a number of years and at the same time provide contributory pensions to the self employed as a group.</P>
    <P>It is notable that by mid-January 1988 the NPB said they were obliged, in view of the Minister's request and subsequent announcement by the Government, to submit an interim report on the matter. It is fair to say, and as a courtesy I should say, to the people involved in the NPB that the gun was put to their head.  They were not asked to comment on the merits of the proposal but merely on its mechanics, in circumstances which effectively pre-empted some of the outcomes of their considerations.  In any event, the NPB brought in a report of the issue, and it is of some significance that already there seems to be a flight from the terms and implications of the NPB's thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>The interim proposals of the NPB <Col N="473" /> were, first, to defer a decision on retirement pensions for the self employed on the basis that many self employed people can continue to be economically active after 65.  The NPB costed the scheme on the basis of contributory old age pension, in other words that there was no retirement prerequisite.  Secondly, they proposed that the whole question of invalidity pensions would be dealt with later, so it is now taken off the agenda. Thirdly, they proposed that the widow's and orphan's pensions in addition to the old age contributory pension should be extended to the self employed.  Fourthly, they proposed that that was to be done on a contribution rate recommended by the board of 6.6 per cent on reckonable income.  It is important to stress that the NPB specifically recommended that if the costs of the recommended level of coverage were not acceptable it might be necessary to reduce the benefits provided either in amount or extent of coverage. That is at paragraph 2.4 of page 6 of their report.</P>
    <P>It was suggested yesterday in some of the comments which accompanied the budget proposals, and it has been repeated this morning on the radio, that in some sense the scheme which is being brought into effect will be self financing on the basis of a 4½ per cent contribution by the self employed.  That simply is not true and it is a myth which must be nipped in the bud before it gains currency.  What the National Pensions Board said was that the difference between social assistance and contributory pensions would be financed by a 4½ per cent levy on the self employed and farmers if that was fully paid and if their estimate of the income base from which it was to be derived was correct.  In other words, there had to be full compliance and a reasonably generous view of the income base on which this 4½ per cent levy would be charged.</P>
    <P>This scheme is a very different proposition from that which was advanced yesterday because it does not become <Col N="474" /> self-financing on the basis of a 4½ per cent contribution: it is the difference between social insurance rates of pension and social assistance rates of pension which would be financed by that amount. Therefore, if the moneys collected by the levy on the self-employed in the form of PRSI only amount to 4½ per cent there will be no redistributive element at all. The entire cost of providing social assistance to the self-employed, which is the subject matter of some controversy now, will not in any sense be subsidised out of payments made by the self-employed and farmers.  If the 4½ per cent levy pays for the additional costs only, then all the rhetoric and the justification based on defraying the cost of the present outlay for the self-employed and farmers is hot air.  Inevitably it means that the same costs which now exist will continue to be borne out of the taxpayers' pockets and in general terms that means &mdash; because of the structure of our taxation system &mdash; that the majority of the cost will be borne by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>It is important to go back to the justification for extending PRSI to the self-employed and farmers as a group &mdash; that it was unwarranted for them as a group to enjoy social assistance as of right without making any contribution towards it&mdash; and to compare that with the mathematical justification now being advanced on this issue.  If the only effect of extending PRSI to the self-employed at the rate of 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent is to pay the costs involved, then there is no interest in the issue so far as the trade unions are concerned because they have gained nothing.  There is no interest in the matter so far as the PAYE sector of the economy are concerned because they have gained nothing either. They continue to have to shoulder the vast majority of the outlay on these social insurance pensions which will become payable in the fullness of time.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for this House to proceed on the basis of misinformation.  This proposal is not self-financing at the rate of 4½ per cent in the sense that it is not the case that the self-employed and farmers <Col N="475" /> will pay for their pensions fully on the basis of a 4½ per cent outlay.  The figures are very dramatically different.  It would cost 16 per cent by way of PRSI on the self-employed and farmers to actually pay the full costs of their insured pensions and widows and orphans entitlements as proposed under the scheme.  It would cost 16 per cent, and not 6 per cent, 4 per cent or anything like it.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by commentators who are not biased in the interests of the self-employed or the farmers as a group &mdash; such as the article by Mr. O Moráin which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days ago &mdash; that no matter what happens, the Exchequer is going to take up most of the tab for these additional expenditures.  The estimates of what it will cost the Exchequer in the fullness of time vary between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of the total outlay.  In those circumstances, I suggest that a fundamental rethink on this issue is needed.  The justification, based on tax equity and getting the self-employed and the farmers to pay their fair share and to pay their way in society, is completely set at nought if, in effect, what the Government are proposing to do is offer social insurance levels of pensions to those groups for a 4½ per cent PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>The figures of this proposal do not add up.  The trade unions feel &mdash; and I presume they were the social partners with the greatest interest in extending the PRSI net &mdash; that in some sense the PAYE and farming sectors are contributing to the general level of taxation and shouldering the general burden in a manner which is more fair than that which obtained heretofore.  But, in fact, all we are now seeing is that an extra layer of social insurance benefits is being made available to these groups and will be only partly financed by the contribution which they will make.  It is also of some significance that the mathematics of the 4½ per cent contribution are based on a full compliance assumption.  If one looks at the figures, in relation to compliance they show that it is illusory to hope that there <Col N="476" /> will be full compliance in paying the levies which are imposed on the self-employed and farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House of what we were told on 20 October 1987 by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Mac-Sharry. We were told that the Revenue Commissioners had been informed that on 31 May 1987 farmers owed £27 million in health contributions, youth employment levy and income levies and other self-employed people owed £97 million. We were told that, on the basis of previous experience, these amounts would be subject to downward revision on closer examination on appeal and for other reasons would change accordingly.  The Revenue Commissioners estimated that as a result of these factors it would be likely that the amounts finally to be collected would be £3 million from farmers and £12 million from the self-employed; in other words, one-sixth and one-ninth respectively of the estimated sums.</P>
    <P>Even today it is quite clear that a 3 per cent levy on the self-employed and farmers on the basis of full compliance would yield a figure in the region of £36 million.  We are now faced on this occasion with the situation that the estimated yield from the 3 per cent levy is already discounted to a level of £12 million.  That shows that there is no faith in the capacity of the system to collect these sums from the self-employed and the farmers and that any assumptions on funding the final payments of social insurance benefits to these groups, which are based either wholly or in part on the idea that there will be full compliance, are misguided and naive to an extraordinary extent and, in consequence, the mathematics concerned and the justification for this measure must be taken subject to a grave degree of scientific scepticism.</P>
    <P>It is also worthwhile to look to a number of other features which should sound a warning in this Chamber.  The age profile of our population is changing and the recently published Davy Kelleher McCarthy report on Irish demographics suggests that due to various economic <Col N="477" /> and social factors and emigration, we will have an increasingly old population over the next ten to 40 years.  That means that to extrapolate from present figures and proportions of the population and to make assumptions on the costings of these schemes is dangerous as a political and economic calculation.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that 15,500 farmers who at the moment get smallholders unemployment assistance will receive social insurance without making any contribution at all.  If we select a group in society who are at the moment receiving what is colloquially referred to as farmers dole and tell them that when they reach retirement age they will, in substitution for the dole, get the equivalent of a funded pension, we are selecting on an arbitrary basis a section of society to be treated in a special way.  We should remember the urban poor or the poor living in small towns and villages who have spent their whole lives on assistance of one kind or another, because they have been marginalised.  They do not qualify for insurance level pensions.  What is the justification for this proposal?  I query the social justice of giving small farmers a higher level of pension in their later years than urban people or rural people who have spent their whole lives on social welfare assistance.  This is wrong in principle and it is indefensible as a matter of social justice.  What is the sense of saying to somebody in a tower block in Ballymun who has spent his whole life on assistance that he is to get a non-contributory old age pension at a lesser rate than somebody who has been a smallholder all his life and has received assistance on top of his meagre income from his small holding, and of saying to the smallholder that he will get a contributory pension with no outlay on his part.  There is no social justice about that.  This is not an urban bias on my part because people living in the towns and villages will also be discriminated against on the basis that they do not have a smallholding.  There is no valid basis for distinguishing between these groups and for giving one an unasked for leg-up in terms of social welfare <Col N="478" /> status.  There has not been a clamour for this from the smallholders.  Naturally they will take it but they have not demanded it as of right.  They accepted that between one thing and another, to get assistance while a smallholder and to get a non-contributory pension in their declining years was their lot.  To identify them as a special group and give them this preference is unjustified.  Some member of the Government should try to show that it is fair to give any extra resources we may have to that group rather than to the urban poor or those living in rural villages.  There is no justification for it.  As time goes by and this House reflects on the unfairness of that proposition, we will arrive at the view that it should be rejected.</P>
    <P>Social insurance, conceptually is where people pay into a group fund and from that fund, against known risks, moneys are paid back out.  What we have as a social insurance system is not social insurance because it is not actuarially based and costed.  Both Deputy Noonan and Deputy Dukes have been asking for actuarial justification for what is being proposed.  Since we organised our social insurance on the basis of, &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo;, to start bringing calipers and micrometers and actuaries to bear on this proposal to extend the system has no justification or political reality.  It is not really fair to hide behind the absence of actuarial evidence by itself to justify withholding some preliminary judgment on the issue.  At the moment in relation to social welfare schemes the Exchequer pays 62 per cent, employers pay 25 per cent and employees pay nearly 12 per cent.  The social insurance fund is not even paying for itself because if we take it out of those global figures, employers pay 46 per cent of the social insurance fund, employees pay 22.3 per cent and the Exchequer pays 31.2 per cent.  If the contribution rate of 6.6 per cent recommendation by the National Pensions Board had been applied, the long term costs would have roughly broken down as follows: self-employed would pay 40 per cent and the Exchequer would pay 60 per cent.  That is accepted by the National <Col N="479" /> Pensions Board at paragraph 5.11 on page 30 of their report.  Those are the figures on the basis of full compliance and as I said earlier the indications are that full compliance will be illusory in this case.  If the IFA's proposal to pay 2.4 per cent of income as a contribution towards the cost were applied, it would suggest that only 14 per cent of the long term cost of these benefits would be borne by the recipients, leaving the remaining 86 per cent to be borne by the State.  If 6.6 per cent had been levied the State would still have been paying 60 per cent of the long term costs of the proposals.  It might be suggested that that is better than paying 100 per cent of the cost of social assistance, but there are problems with that. First, the Minister is arguing that the 1988 Estimates provided £330 million to pay for long term social assistance schemes and that £286 million was for old aged pensions, £44 million for widows and orphans or people on social assistance and that no contribution was made towards that.  It is important to remember that the new scheme will give benefits as of right and do away with means testing. It is significant that 25 per cent of applicants for assistance, as estimated by the Department of Social Welfare, are refused and another 25 per cent get less than the maximum rate.  Those two cohorts of potential recipients will be swept into the new system as of right.  That is a very important consideration.  We are not dealing simply with the same number of recipients but with a greater number.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the short term the Exchequer will gain, because we are told that there is a 10 year lead-in period for recipients of old age pensions before they become entitled to their pensions.  In the intervening period it can be argued that the net contributions to that extra expenditure are, in effect, in the black rather than the red.  I suggest that that must be examined carefully.  Now we hear that it will not be 6.6 per cent over those ten years.  The National Pensions Board proposed that the moneys be set aside and invested against the contingency of paying out to all the potential recipients. <Col N="480" /> It is quite clear from the figures in the budgetary system that no separate investment fund will be established and that these moneys will be thrown into the maw, if I may use the expression, of general social insurance moneys used to finance the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; measures as things now stand.</P>
    <P>The question is, in the long term will the Exchequer gain?  That depends on a number of factors.  It depends upon how the excess of income under the scheme in the early years has been invested or dealt with.  There may clearly be indications now that it will not be invested or accumulated.  Secondly, it depends on the excess costs of benefits versus assistance. Thirdly, it depends upon how many more will be entitled to claim in future over those now making claims on the assistance pensions.  How much more expensive are benefits over assistance?  There have been a number of figures worked out, but it is interesting to note that in 1986 there was 74,000 people with 19,000 dependants receiving £251 million in contributory old age pensions. that, per recipient, averaged at £3,393.  Also in 1986 there were 125,000 people with 10,000 dependants, that is a lower rate of dependancy, receiving £284 million in non-contributory old age pensions.  They averaged £2,273 per recipient.  That means that there is a gap of approximately £1,100 between the average benefit to a social insurance pensioner and a socially assisted pensioner.  That is a 49 per cent difference.  It is suggested that there is a one-third difference between what is received by somebody claiming assistance and somebody claiming a pension as of right, taking one thing with another.  That is a very significant difference.</P>
    <P>Much more important perhaps is, how many more people will come into the scheme who are not in it at the moment? There, the figures are again open to huge query.  At the moment there are 125,000 people getting non-contributory old age pensions and 17,000 getting non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions and that costs £330 million.  It is that sum of money, that as the Minister said, <Col N="481" /> should be contributed towards by the self-employed and farmers.  It is that £330 million that he says is an unwarranted sum of money to be paid for out of the general tax funds since he says that it is being paid for in the main by the PAYE sector and enjoyed by the non-PAYE sector.  Let us be clear about one thing. The £330 million in question is not involved in the pensions board's calculation of 4½ per cent self-financing level.  It is assumed as an outgoing on top of which the 4½ per cent was to finance the extra entitlement of the self-employed and farmers.  There will be no progress made on this proposal towards what was the stated aim of this whole scheme, which is, making those £330 million come to a larger extent than at present from the pockets of the self-employed and farmers.</P>
    <P>The standard estimate is that 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the recipients of those assisted pensions are self-employed people.  That suggests there are 87,000 to 94,000 non-contributory old age pensioners who were self-employed.  It is fair enough to base our arguments and suppositions on 90,000 as an average figure.  Nationally, there are 356,000 people in the population who are 66 years of age or older: that is based on the 1986 census.  If 90,000 of these are self-employed they account for 25 per cent of the population aged over 66 years, yet the self-employed today account for only 7 per cent of the national population.  Ten per cent of the national population are over 66 years of age.  The ratio between the self-employed and non-contributory pensioners is 90,000: 250,000, i.e., 36 per cent.  The Department of Social Welfare have no record of claimants on social assistance, so that the 70 per cent to 75 per cent figure is only a guesstimate.</P>
    <P>Because the present system of assistance is means tested, we do know that 28 per cent of people do not qualify for the maximum rate, that 25 per cent apply and are rejected and that some percentage, obviously, do not apply for any non-contributory pension at all.  There are about 200,000 private sector pensioners, some of whom never claim or would wish to <Col N="482" /> claim State pensions.  Forty seven per cent of the employed labour force, we are told, are covered by occupational pension schemes and that is about 520,000 people.  Given that 310,000 of those are public sector employees, it means that the balance of 210,000 people are composed of private sector people who are privately insured, who are making provision for their pensions through pension schemes.  All those figures mean that of the 356,000 people who are aged 66 years and over, 125,000 get non-contributory old age pensions and 74,000 get contributory old age pensions, that is 199,000.  One can add 37,000 who are on retirement pensions to that.  That leaves a balance of 120,000 people who are unaccounted for.  That includes 50,000 people who are receiving State pensions and are not entitled to claim benefit, or assistance, or old age pensions.  In the last analysis, at bottom line, will be 70,000 people over the age of 66 years who are either means tested out of the system, or have made private arrangements, or live in destitution or poverty completely known to the authorities.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a proposition that was motivated by a desire for social equity but as it is coming out in the wash will, because of our ageing population and because of inadequate funding, involve a liability on the general taxpayers in ten years time.  We can never with absolute accuracy estimate the precise extent of that liability.  Ten years is not a long time in politics or in the life of the public finances.  In ten years time it will be generally felt that the self-employed and farmers have brought a huge extra liability on the State and on the social insurance fund which it will be incapable of meeting.</P>
    <P>Sixty per cent of the outgoings from the social insurance fund at the moment is funded from general taxation.  There is no reason to suppose that these proposals coming forward will improve the ratio. Indeed, because of the demographic factor to which I referred earlier there is good reason to suspect that the proportion of liability on the State will increase and the social insurance fund <Col N="483" /> will require more and more topping-up in proportionate terms by the general fund of taxation.  If that is the case, if the cost of welfare needs to be subsidised to that extent and needs to be subsidised from the tax base, then it will, in effect, in the long term be a transfer from the general taxpayer to the self-employed. To justify paying a series of pensions and making an increased entitlement to pensions ten years hence on the basis of an interim flow of moneys is very similar in concept to borrowing from the self employed.  We are now taking moneys from the self employed at 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent, strike what rate you may, and in exchange for that we are giving a promise to make extra pension payments in ten years time.  If, as appears to be the case, the social insurance fund will not be adequate in ten years time to fund that extra liability, the inexorable conclusion is that it will require more and more of taxpayers' money to keep the social insurance fund afloat.</P>
    <P>It will also have a peculiar result and that is that by greatly increasing the number of people in society who will be entitled to contributory old age pensions the cost of any marginal increases, indexation or genuine real increases in the level of that assistance will be increased.  It will have the effect of making it extremely unlikely that Governments will be able to use the contributory old age pension as a means of redistributing the wealth of society in favour of those who are in need of support, those who have spent their lives working in society and who are then dependent on a pension.  They are a weak group and to greatly increase their numbers does not make them stronger.  To greatly increase the number of people entitled to a benefit does not increase the moral force behind that benefit.  Children's allowance is a prime example. Very few people stand up in this Chamber and say they want the children's allowance doubled for the reason that a significant number of the recipients are people who do not need the children's allowance and who are not justifiable recipients of it in terms of social justice. It is because it is an unfocused benefit <Col N="484" /> that that is the case.  Therefore, the same logic will apply to the contributory old age pension because many people who do not need it and who are demonstrably capable of having their own resources far in excess of their pension income will receive it.  There will be a downward pressure on the contributory old age pension. There will be a reason for not increasing it.  Therefore, we have this curious paradox that by increasing the numbers entitled to receive the contributory old age pension we will weaken the case for paying it out at all, we will increase the political pressure to minimise any increase in its real value and there will be a vast political deadweight involved in trying to increase the level of social insurance pensions for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>That is a matter we should take on board now because once you give the farmers and the self-employed the &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; to a contributory pension I cannot see the political will ever being built up to take it back from them.  I do not believe anybody in this House, no matter how radical, is going to stand up and say that those people's contributions account for nothing and that we have decided, for instance, to reintroduce instead a system of means tested pensions. It should be done and doubtless when the money for the social insurance fund runs out there will be some who will say it ought to be done but there will be a huge constituency of people who claim a moral and legal entitlement to those extra moneys.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make in relation to extending social insurance to self-employed and farmers is that, no matter what way you look at it, because it is unfunded it involves a redistribution of resources to a group who are not necessarily the have-nots in Irish society.  It involves making payments to those who are not being assessed for receipt of those payments on the basis of need.  For the Progressive Democrats that represents a fundamental compounding of many errors that have been made in this country. Subsidising the haves can only be done on the basis of very high taxation. <Col N="485" /> This is something which has been the bane of social policy in this country, that the haves in society constantly receive entitlements and benefits when they are capable in many cases of providing the same benefits out of their own resources. This represents one further turn of the screw in unfocused redistribution towards the haves and have-nots equally without regard to need, and we regard it as a step in the wrong direction in terms of social justice.</P>
    <P>I cannot see, as a self-employed person &mdash; I do not like arguing <i>ad hominem</i>&mdash; that asking or requiring me to contribute 6.6 per cent, 5 per cent, 3 per cent or whatever percentage of my income from self-employment to a fund, the benefits from which will be subsidised to the extent of 30 per cent or 40 per cent by the taxpayer, is in the interest of social justice.  That 40 per cent subsidy to my pension should be allocated on the basis of need.  The extra incurred liabilities which this proposed extension of PRSI will inevitably bring in its stream and that 40 per cent liability would be far better focused on the basis of need.  We should articulate a completely different philosophy of redistribution of wealth, focus on those who need it and take from those who have it.  This proposal files in the face of that precept of social justice.</P>
    <P>When the Social Welfare Bill is discussed in this House it must be discussed at length and the Minister must be able to justify what he is doing not merely in terms of his agreement with the social partners but to the next generation, to those who are on unemployment assistance and to the man in Ballymun who has spent his whole life on social assistance. The Minister must be able to justify a system whereby such people will not be getting contributory pensions while smallholders in some far flung place will be getting them.  He must be able to justify all those things and most of all he must show, which I think he cannot by definition show, that the requirements of social justice would permit a State subsidy of 40 per cent to back up pensions to the self-employed and farmers when <Col N="486" /> many of the recipients will not be entitled on the basis of need to receive them.</P>
    <P>These are fundamental issues where problems arise with this proposal.  The proposal was conceived out of a well-grounded desire to refocus the burden of taxation but because it carries with it a mortagage of the future, a series of benefits payable in ten years time which are going to be unjust socially in their effect and in the liabilities they will create, it is a step in the wrong direction.  We await eagerly the justification proposed by the Government for it.  As far as we are concerned there is no justification.  We will oppose this measure and we will oppose the principle of further extending benefits without any regard to need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain difficulty in speaking on yesterday's budget, or endeavouring to speak strictly on the budget.  We had a far more important feature of th budget many months ago when the Estimates were published. While there is a certain degree of acceptability or logic in publishing the Estimates early for consideration, also given the drastic nature of the Estimates published last October, a conscious decision was taken by the Minister for Finance and the Government to distance the Estimates from the budget because the impact of both is one which the Government might not have survived.</P>
      <P>Many people who will have watched the news coverage last evening and who will be following the commentaries today, in great detail in some of the newspapers, will have to be reminded of the events of October last, of the enormous cutbacks effected in public expenditure in order to realise that yesterday brought about some tinkering with the system, some minor concessions, very minor concessions in certain tax areas, some attempts to change other systems which will be introduced in the course of the Social Welfare Bill and which I believe will prove to be enormously difficult for the Government, as the previous speaker said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Minister's remarks of yesterday, in the context of <Col N="487" /> the commentaries by various experts, economists and gurus around this city on the airwaves in the last 24 hours, while many people may have forgotten about the Estimates for expenditure and the cuts in those Estimates of October last I will remind them, if they need reminding &mdash; and certainly they will be reminded as the year progresses &mdash; that all those cuts will make themselves felt in every area of public expenditure for the next 11 months.  We will still experience enormous difficulties, in health, education, in local authorities irrespective of what the budget provisions announced yesterday promised to do, or the Minister for Finance in delivering that budget.</P>
    <P>One has to pick out features of yesterday's budget.  The presentation of that budget left a lot to be desired.  The Minister for Finance attempted to put a gloss on his contribution.  But quite extraordinarily &mdash; and I followed the Minister's remarks very carefully &mdash; I was amazed that it was not until the last page of that speech &mdash; which is in effect the Minister's economic speech to the country for a 12 month period &mdash; that there was any mention of employment.  There were two references on that last page, one to employment and another to unemployment. How any Minister for Finance, any Government could set out to outline to this House the economic course which the Government will follow for the next 12 months without tackling what must be the most fundamental problem of crisis dimension facing us is beyond me.  It means that the Minister for Finance is running away from his responsibility.  The Government are running away from their collective responsibility to outline what they intend doing.  Have they already forgotten even the projections &mdash; which were very difficult to accept or believe &mdash; in the so called national agreement of last year?  There were glowing reports of thousands of glossy jobs to be created in the different sectors but there has been absolutely no follow through.  If those jobs were going to be created then I should have thought that yesterday would have been the appropriate occasion for the Minister for Finance to outline where <Col N="488" /> they would be created, how they would be created and say whether any progress had been made to date in that respect.</P>
    <P>When the commentators, analysts and experts have had time to examine the underlying facts of yeterday's budget &mdash; those revealed in the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>&mdash; they will see things differently.  If they accepted yesterday's budget as a reasonable one, then they were conned into that acceptance and will see their acceptance as too hasty.</P>
    <P>The most obvious example, perhaps the one which will effect most people in the coming weeks and months, is in the PAYE area.  In the course of his contribution the Minister gave a number of examples of the effect of the changes in the PAYE system and their impact. Those examples were very carefully selected.  Of course, at the time the document, <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> was not available to any Member of the House, when, there appeared a certain satisfaction on the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to those examples.  That satisfaction could not have lasted very long if those Members took the trouble of looking at the true picture revealed in the document, the <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>.  I would go further and say it must have been of considerable disappointment to Fianna Fáil back benchers.  They will have discovered that to the great majority of PAYE earners these budgetary concessions range from £1 &mdash; if single &mdash; to £1.35, if married.  We should remember all the ballyhoo in recent weeks, with some benign commentators and newspapers contending there was to be a great giveaway to the PAYE sector.  A figure of £75 million was mentioned.  Anybody familiar with the budgetary process would know that £75 million would go nowhere towards giving any visible relief to the PAYE sector.  In his wisdom the Minister for Finance did attempt to go further than the £75 million, going to £91 million.  He informed us that the switch will entail a figure of £152 million in a full year.  The Minister might clarify whether that now means that £152 million of the £225 million &mdash; said in the so-called <Col N="489" /> national agreement to be given in tax relief over three years &mdash; has already been allocated for tax relief.  The relief was meant to be cumulative.  One can only assume that the Minister has now given well over half the tax relief promised over a three year period, and that he will have something in the region of £35 million to give in each of the next two budgets by way of income tax relief which will not even be visible to any PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>If the public have not yet had an opportunity to establish the extent of the trick perpetrated yesterday they will realise it at the beginning of April.  The truth will become known fully when they receive their pay packets at the beginning of April.  If they felt from the commentaries of yesterday that there was even an attempt to bring about justice in relation to the PAYE sector, that feeling will be thoroughly dispelled when they see the impact on their pay packets, an impact which will be totally negatived by the 8p increase in the price of a gallon of petrol. Certainly, on a weekly basis, it will cost them more than the relief claimed to be given them.</P>
    <P>The <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> reveals a remarkable series of facts which were not disclosed yesterday.  I am not contending that the Minister would have been in a position to disclose all of the facts but, in terms of the selective nature of his remarks, many facts were not disclosed. It was only on seeing the document entitled <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i>&mdash; which many people may never see; I am not sure if all of the details of that document will be made available to the public &mdash; that one realised that the contents of that document represent a much different economic picture than that given in the course of the Minister's remarks yesterday over one and a half hours.  The <i>Principal Features of the Budget</i> add up to a very different picture of our economic position.</P>
    <P>The people will have to realise that the combined effect of yesterday's budget and the Estimates of last October will be severely deflationary.  In the time preceding <Col N="490" /> the election and for some short time after the election the Taoiseach spoke about his national agreement and how they would be stimulating economic growth of 3 to 4 per cent on average per annum in what must have been one of the softest interviews ever given to any politician by RTE.  The Taoiseach settled for about 1 per cent economic growth but every other economic commentator &mdash; and there are enough of them about &mdash; spoke about sharply rising unemployment and zero or negative growth.  I tried to get the Taoiseach to come into the House to explain his prediction, but the question has been passed down to some other Minister.  This House should have a system whereby when the Taoiseach makes such a public statement he should have the responsibility to explain it under less benign circumstances in this House than was the case with the interview in RTE.</P>
    <P>On examination of yesterday's budget, one finds that the Government have revised the unemployment figures for next year downwards from 256,000 people to 253,000 and in so doing have written in a saving of £8 million on that account.  That is disquieting to say the least.  How do the Government propose to actually bring down the unemployment figures?  They have not introduced one measure to secure additional jobs, quite the contrary.  Are there going to be new policies to encourage emigration?  This seems to be acceptable to certain Ministers in the Government.  Are the Government perhaps toying with creating schemes like the one aired on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; the other night to pay people to actually leave the country? There is a responsibility on the Government to tell us how they are going to reduce the unemployment figures, particularly when independent commentators are putting the figure at between 270,000 and 275,000 people unemployed in 1988.</P>
    <P>There are other disquieting figures in the Social Welfare Vote.  There is a reduction of over £15 million accounted for by the description &ldquo;various subheads&rdquo;.  This needs a great deal of elaboration.  I can only assume that &ldquo;various <Col N="491" /> subheads&rdquo; means that 15 people sitting around a table could not agree or tie down where this £15 million was coming from and agreed to discuss it at a later date.  Obviously the problem will be one for the Minister for Social Welfare as the year goes on to come up with the £15 million which he, no doubt, agreed with his Cabinet Ministers he would find from the various subheads in his Vote.  In recent times we have heard about a number of ministerial directives aimed at removing by stealth some well-established rights in the whole social welfare area.  We are at present assembling information about these developments.  It is time the Minister for Social Welfare made a full statement when he gets the opportunity in this debate, outlining in detail each and every change he has made in the social welfare code in recent months &mdash; and there have been many, so many that the people who will be affected by them will only realise it when they go to claim their entitlements.</P>
    <P>There is the question of the Education Vote, not mentioned by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  He did not mention the further cut in education spending of more than £5 million.  He did not outline the impact which this will have especially on second level education.  One can only conclude that since the Minister for Finance did not want to explain what most people would consider to be bad news we will have to drag the information from the Minister for Education inch by inch in this House, and we will have a repetition of what happened before Christmas when the Minister for Education and the Government were rocking and reeling in relation to what was being done about Circular 20/87 in regard to the primary school sector.</P>
    <P>It would be far more responsible of the Ministers for Education and Finance and better for everybody if they came into this House and told the House that £5 million more was being taken from the education Vote and from where in that vote.  What is now going to happen is that within the next 10 or 12 days circulars will be sent out to the education authorities <Col N="492" /> telling them there is a further cutback in education and where it will be implemented.  We will start all over again looking for clarification.  We will try to get it in the House where it will not be available.  In the course of time, pressure will mount up in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, and the Minister will start trying to solve problems in a fire brigade manner on a constituency-by-constituency basis.  It would be far better if everybody knew from day one why the cut is being made and where it is being implemented.</P>
    <P>The idea of having any further cut in education is totally unacceptable to me as Leader of the Labour Party.  Unfortunately the party which claimed so much for the progress of the so-called free education system 20 years ago are now in the process of dismantling the education system as we know it.  The issue in relation to primary education is now over because of the political and other opposition mounted against the Government but we will see now in the secondary and vocational sectors the impact of these new cuts.  The fact that the Government can consider any further cuts in the vocational sector is unacceptable because of all the sectors in education the vocational sector is the one that provides the greatest access to education for members of lower income families.  This will put even greater pressure on a sector that is already under-funded.  The under-funding means a 10 per cent cut in the allocation for community and comprehensive schools, that is, a cut of £10,000 in services per school, a 20 per cent cut in adult education services, a 10 per cent cut in services by the RTCs and a 4.8 per cent cut in the 1986 provision for second level VEC schools.</P>
    <P>The serious under-funding which was compounded yesterday amounts to a serious undermining of public sector education and the more we continue to attack public sector and public funded education the more we will create a two-tier system of education similar to what is happening in the health area.  The question to be asked in relation to education, as in health, is &ldquo;do you have the money to pay <Col N="493" /> for it?&rdquo;  That was never the intention of previous Governments in setting up these services.  I do not believe Fianna Fáil will be able to stand over this if they persist in what they are doing in education.  The inevitable result will be a move towards private education and I do not believe that is a step which Members of this House would agree to.  The Government should certainly stop this before it goes too far, if it has not done so already.  It is regressive in terms of social policy and will compound and expand the divisions and inequalities which already exist in our society and which have been further compounded by the monetarist economic policies of the Government.</P>
    <P>Some Members have spoken of the opportunities missed yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  The leader of the main Opposition party suggested that there are many members of the Labour Party who agree with his approach.  I have to confess that this is news to me.  Perhaps he would give me some more information. I agree that yesterday's budget was a missed opportunity but my reasons would be radically different from those outlined by Deputy Dukes this morning.</P>
    <P>Our greatest social problem is unemployment and this Government must come to realise that it will not be solved by irrational swipes at public expenditure. It will not be solved by an economic policy the only purpose of which, we are reminded constantly, is to bring down interest rates.  It will not be solved by bromides about improving the climate for enterprise.  There are some people in this House &mdash; in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; who seem to think that if they can create a climate for enterprise and investment then all our problems will be solved.  If we learned anything over the last 50 years we must realise that this reliance on the private sector is not a panacea for the serious problems facing us.  Down the years the private sector have failed to produce the goods.  In my view this is an empty and sterile approach.  We have thrown grants at them; we have perhaps suffocated them with industrial grants but <Col N="494" /> we have not solved the problem.</P>
    <P>In my pre-budget submission I called for extra resources to be invested in the public capital programme, and I listened to the Minister yesterday with a mounting sense of dismay.  I kept hoping that sooner or later he would turn to the subject of unemployment and that I would hear a range of positive measures being outlined to boost the efforts of the community in the field of job creation, but the Minister did not mention the word until he came to the last page of his speech.  As far as the Minister was concerned, the 250,000 people on the live register ceased to exist.  Not only will this budget do nothing to increase employment but its effects, and particularly the effects of the real budget, will drive unemployment figures up.  I said yesterday the figure would reach 270,000 before the end of the year and from what I have read of the budget and the Principal Features, I see no reason to change that prediction.  I believe this will be a fitting testament to the fiscal rectitude which is being peddled by the Government at present.</P>
    <P>We had the real budget last October and its effects will become more obvious as the months pass and the PAYE workers who benefited to the tune of £1 or £1.25 yesterday will then discover the price they are being asked to pay.  There will be sharply reduced health services, major cutbacks in essential local services and chaos in our education system.  Yesterday's budget takes no account whatever of the extra burdens and impositions being put on PAYE workers and other members of the community who, at local level, are faced with increased rents and increases in other charges which will amount to far more than the relief offered yesterday by the Minister for Finance. The PAYE workers who live in areas where local charges were introduced or increased to prevent lay-offs and further cutbacks in services will know only too well how far £50 in PAYE relief will go.  Unemployment is not our only social problem.  The process of managing our affairs at the expense of the weakest and most defenceless members of the community <Col N="495" /> has led to an increasingly divided and complacent society.  Perhaps we are shielded from that in here.</P>
    <P>Commentators and experts talk about the public sector borrowing requirements and the current budget deficit as if they were the Holy Grail, but in my view these people are far removed from the impact which these decisions will have on the people living in or close to real poverty. Many of these people are living in Dublin and in small rural communities.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago the OECD issued their report on the economy.  Having read that report I wrote inviting the Secretary General of that organisation to send another team here.  I did not ask him to come and see the Department of Finance but I asked him to come and see how the real level of poverty has risen in Ireland, how people were struggling to survive and how workers were carrying the whole burden of the national debt while huge sectors got off scot-free.  I got a long letter in reply outlining the process they had employed and reiterating most of the conclusion they had reached.  He chose not to respond to my invitation to come and see how ordinary people live here. As far as I am concerned that is a tragedy so far as the OECD's study of this country is concerned, but it is a bigger tragedy that the majority of Deputies are so blinded by ideology that they are unable to see how people are suffering.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House will come across, if not daily then weekly, people living in dire poverty.  We come across these people most often in the area of health services.  I heard with relief the Minister for Finance announce yesterday that he was putting back £11 million into the Health Estimate, a sum which should never have been taken out in the first place.  When I highlighted the consequence of taking this money out of the Health budget two months ago the Minister for Health accused me of being an alarmist and of scaremongering.  The reality is that there are many people dependent on the refund of drugs scheme.  I was glad the Minister for Finance allowed his better judgment to hold <Col N="496" /> sway rather than the mandarins in Finance who wanted those cuts, no matter what happened on the ground.  Those people in Finance would never have the experience of dealing with people who are, and who will continue to be dependent on the refund of drugs scheme.</P>
    <P>The extent of the deprivation which will persist in the health area, despite the Minister assuring the House that no further cuts will take place, is plain to see.  This year about 800 acute hospital beds will be closed, 1,000 long-stay beds, catering mainly for the elderly, will be closed and upwards of 200 to 300 psychiatric beds will be closed.  We know there will be massive reductions in staff and closures of units which provide critical medical services.</P>
    <P>At this stage one has almost given up hope on public health services being made available to school children.  I am sure the position is worse in Dublin, but the list for dental treatment for school children in County Kerry is so long that local dentists can only deal with critical cases.  This is especially so in the Southern Health Board area.  Some schools in County Kerry have not had a visit from a public school dentist for the last six months, and it appears the Minister for Health can do nothing about it.  The Minister for Health would appear to have no responsibility for what is happening in the Southern Health Board area.  For the past four years the Minister for Health, for good or for bad, at least came into this House and explained what was happening at local health board level, but now he has chosen not to respond to Deputies' queries about what is happening at local level.  I wonder if Ministers realise the stress and strain being put on families because of what is being implemented at local health board level under Government directives.  For example, the transport service has been 99 per cent wiped out.  One is always reluctant to cite an individual case but I will give one example with which I dealt. It relates to a 13 year old schoolgirl who has to travel from County Kerry to the Regional Hospital, Cork, on a six weeks basis for chemotherapy.  She lives with <Col N="497" /> her family in a small village, her father is on long term unemployment benefit and her mother has health problems.  They have one other child who also has difficulties. The parents of the child needing treatment were informed that she would have to make her own way to Cork for the treatment she obviously needs very badly.  I spent 24 hours dealing with the local health board and eventually the Minister for Health intervened and accepted that there was no possible way in which this family could provide transport for their child.  Indeed, they were not able to provide transport for the intervening period of two or three months when the service has stopped and the local community stepped into the breach. However, they could not continue this indefinitely because their resources were minimal.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples of what is happening in relation to the lack of provision of health care.  I am sure that if that family were listening to the proceedings in this House yesterday in relation to creating the climate for investment and jobs they were wondering if anyone here was worried about their lot or if anyone would offer them relief.  They are at the bottom of the heap and are looking for very little, just to allow their child to travel to Cork for badly needed treatment.  There are sad &mdash; indeed desperate &mdash; cases but they are the reality. It is all very fine to talk about macroeconomics but this is how it breaks down in relation to the population.  The family to whom I referred are well below the poverty trap and will never see the other side of it.</P>
    <P>I get annoyed when I hear the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach saying on radio and television that there is no hardship in the implementation of the Government's policies.  There is unbelievable hardship at local level and I am sure the Taoiseach would not have to travel outside his own constituency to find it.  If he was doing constituency work he would know that but I do not think he does such work any more.  Other Deputies mentioned the risk to lives and there is always a danger that someone will say <Col N="498" /> we are looking for headlines and trying to scare people.  However, the reduction in the health services means that people are being put in danger.  Pressure is put on consultants to perform operations but the back-up is not available.  If a consultant takes a holiday, which he is perfectly entitled to do, a locum is not appointed and yet operations are expected to continue.  The Department do not seem to realise that people are at risk.  The Minister for Health refuses to accept responsibility in the administrative sense.  If they persist in this attitude the end results will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>I had hoped, before yesterday's budget, that some attempt would be made to redress the draconian cuts in health, education and local authority services which will unfold over the next 12 months.  Those hopes have been dashed and there will be increasing chaos in essential public services throughout the year.</P>

      <P>The only growth we will see over the next 12 months will be in inequality and disadvantage.  The Government have been in office for one year and I am sure they have lived to regret posters which were all over the country before the election about their caring nature.  Fianna Fáil Deputies will be haunted by those posters when the health cuts are fully implemented.  I know lifelong members of that party, who believed in it, and who do not understand what Fianna Fáil are doing to people at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has not tackled the fundamental problems.  He merely tinkered with the system.  He admitted as much last night in relation to the <i>raison d'être</i> behind the budget.  On a light note, it is an each way bet, it is a budget that will do if they are in office for 12 months or if they have to go to the country in six weeks time.  Unfortunately, it is a massive failure by any criteria which the Government claim to have set for themselves over the last number of years. <Col N="499" /> The poor, the sick, the unemployed and students from lower income groups looking for opportunities will pay the price for the failure of yesterday's budget.  The Labour Party voted against it last night and we will continue to vote against it because it is not in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Spring on the monitor before I came down saying that there was quite an amount of satisfied expressions on the faces of Fianna Fáil backbenchers as the speech of the Minister for Finance unfolded. There was a very good reason for that. There was also a very clear degree of political satisfaction on the faces of the vast majority of the Opposition Deputies. When the Minister's speech concluded, I detected a growing sense of frustration because I knew they would find it extremely difficult to put up a realistic, reasoned case against the variety of measures the Minister took in this budget.</P>
      <P>This is a creative, commonsense and caring budget.  It is creative in that it introduces major efficiencies in the tax system, extends the tax base, provides generous tax reliefs, recognises economic realities, reverses the tax bias from capital investment to labour and provides for new initiatives to help construction, tourism and fishing.  The budget recognises the financial constraints and the need to build on the climate of confidence that this Government created during 1987.  It is a caring budget in that it makes provision for the less well off and is part and parcel of the fundamental philosophy which this party, in and out of Government, have always advocated.  It provides for social welfare increases in excess of the expected inflation rate while giving special recognition to the most deprived, the homeless and the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic climate and outlook are a great deal brighter now than they were when we introduced the 1987 budget. There is a renewed sense of optimism and confidence in the economy, largely as a <Col N="500" /> result of the measures taken in that budget.  It is this restoration of confidence, this new spring in our step, the conviction that we are on the right path that gives us the strength to press ahead. Twelve months ago, who would have believed that a minority Government could have effectively tackled the serious economic problems that confronted us? Who would have believed that we would so quickly have achieved success in bringing order into the public finance and restoring business and investment confidence? Let me list some of our achievements. The outflow funds from the State ceased and indeed were reversed.  As a result, interest rates have dropped by 5 per cent.  Compared with an almost total lack of growth in recent years investment by manufacturing industry in 1987 increased by around 5 per cent.  Manufacturing output increased by between 8 and 10 per cent which was three times the rate of growth in output in the previous two years.  Industrial exports experienced dramatic growth, increasing by 15 per cent in real terms compared with 1986, giving rise to total exports of £10.7 billion for 1987 and an historic trade surplus of around £1.5 billion.  Despite a very slow start to the year with few projects in the pipeline the number of new projects negotiated by the industrial development agencies improved significantly during the course of 1987. Eleven thousand new jobs on the ground were created in 1987 with assistance from the IDA.  One hundred and eighty overseas investment projects with a job potential of 12,500 were negotiated by the IDA.  Shannon Development approved 20 projects for the Shannon free zone with a job potential of over 800.</P>
    <P>Our budget for 1987 was based on the realisation that confidence in the economy and real economic growth depended on a clear demonstration of Government determination to manage the public finances properly.  Public spending was too high and has been too high for far too long.  The inevitable consequences of this had been high taxation, high borrowing and large outflows of capital from the economy with intolerably high interest <Col N="501" /> rates.  All of this had been a serious deterrent to productive investment and employment generation.  One of the problems that had hindered economic recovery in the past had been the lack of resolute action by previous Governments. Tentative half-hearted steps had merely depressed demand and ruined confidence without tackling the real underlying problems.  In tackling this problem you had to make it quite clear at home and throughout the world at large that you really meant business.  That is what we did and what we will continue to do.  The strategy initiated in 1987 is being continued in the budget of 1988.</P>
    <P>The targets for 1988 set in this budget are for a current budget deficit of £1,125 million representing 6.3 per cent of GNP and an Exchequer borrowing requirement of £1,457 million representing 8.2 per cent of GNP.  To set matters in context I should say that the current budget deficit as a percentage of GNP will be the lowest since 1980 and the Exchequer borrowing requirement, as a percentage of GNP, will be the lowest since 1973-74. In 1987 the Government exceeded the targets they set for both the current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  The outturn for the Exchequer borrowing requirement was 10.4 per cent, the lowest level since 1977 compared with a target of 10.7 per cent which compared with an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 13.2 per cent incurred by the previous Government in 1986; what a dramatic turnaround.  Resolute action on the part of the Government ensured that our targets for 1987 were met and there should be no doubt that similar resolution will be maintained in keeping to the targets set for 1988.  We are now well on the way to achieving the 1990 target we have set ourselves of stabilising the national debt to GNP ratio and when the Exchequer borrowing requirement can be reduced to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>Every sincere politician knows full well that you have to get the Government finances right and borrowings reduced before you can get the pay back in extra jobs.  That is the reality.  In the contradictions <Col N="502" /> expressed here by speakers for Fine Gael, and the Progressive Democrats, too, they are ignoring their own policy and their own philosophy which they have perpetrated and sold to the Irish people for four and a half years, that the first key to economic recovery was to get the nation's finances in order. The serious situation existing in this country calls for better and more progressive thinking and, indeed, more realistic speeches by the people who know what the real position is.</P>
    <P>The restoration of confidence which has followed the clear demonstration of the Government's determination to manage the public finances properly has already led to a significant improvement in the environment for industry and enterprise.  Interest rates are now 5 percentage points lower than they were 12 months ago.  The annual inflation rate is reduced to an average of about 3 per cent and the estimate for 1988 is approximately 2½ per cent.  There was no increase in electricity, postal or telecommunications charges in 1987.  The effect of the 5 per cent reduction in electricity charges for industrial consumers announced by the Minister for Finance will further reduce balances between Irish charges and those of our competitors abroad.  The groceries sector will see fairer trade with practices such as below cost selling and &ldquo;hello-money&rdquo; which caused particular problems for Irish suppliers being outlawed.  The Fair Trade Commission will be producing reports on the engineering and legal professions following the one on the accountancy profession which was published recently.</P>
    <P>This budget is designed to bring about durable economic recovery over the next few years.  This year it may be felt that growth prospects may be limited but the conditions for sustained high growth in future years are now being created.  Last year the growth forecast on which the budget for 1987 was based was 1 per cent.  We heard what all the economic commentators said but the economy grew by 3½ per cent.  With inflation set to decline further, coupled with the <Col N="503" /> improvements in disposable incomes arising from both the personal tax reliefs and the drop in mortgage rates, personal consumer spending should increase and I confidently expect that it will.  Capital investment is also on the increase and we will once again confound our forecasters as we did in 1987 because we look forward to increased consumer spending and to growth in the economy during 1988.  We also recognise that one of our greatest markets for most of our indigenous Irish industries is across the water in the British market.  We recognise the bouyancy and strength of that market, the very strong consumer demand and we expect that to reflect in our exports from indigenous Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dukes this morning make considerable play on what he believed would be a no increase in consumer spending this year.  He was using as the basis for his argument the budget table.  I disagree with him.  When one takes the PAYE reliefs into account and when one adds to that &mdash; or indeed does not take out but substract from &mdash; the taxation measures that have been levied such as on the banking system, would anybody sensibly argue in this House that taxing banks will reduce consumer spending? Would anybody sensibly argue in this House that taxing pension funds, on a once off basis, would reduce consumer spending; no, it will not.  Taking a realistic appraisal of where the taxation measures are being levied and allowing for those that will impact on consumer spending I confidently expect from this budget that there will be, at least, 1 per cent increase in consumer demand.  That is my view. Deputy Dukes is entitled to his view but if you want to do a realistic assessment the evidence is there.  When you add to that the additional money by way of reducing mortgage repayments that has been put into the pockets of ordinary people who have mortgages, and we know of the hundreds of thousands who have, another boost has been added.  We were proved right in 1987 when we confounded the forecasters and we confidently expect to confound the <Col N="504" /> forecasters again in 1988.  As Mr. Seán Lemass once remarked, &ldquo;from the experts may the good Lord deliver us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This budget is creative by way of introducing new radical measures into our taxation system.  Many people talked about this for years, many commentators wrote about it, people on the far side of the House talked about it.  We have never forgotten the £9.60 that was to be put in every housewife's pocket in order that she could stay at home.  We have heard about the tax credits systems, the creative and innovative measures that were promised when Fine Gael with their Coalition partners, Labour, came into Government but at the end of four years it was all sweet talk but no action.  This Minister for Finance has grasped the nettle and grasped it in a realistic and commonsense way.  He realised that if he went to turn the whole taxation system upside down in the one year, the system could not cope with it.  He took the measures that were realistic and commonsense because he knows from the chair in which he sits that those measures are indeed possible to effect and that is what is sensible about his approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many complaints have been made in the past about the unfairness of the income tax system.  The PAYE taxpayer feels he is carrying an undue share of the burden.  Businesses may feel that the assessment methods are unduly complicated, that they are blamed for the defaults of a minority and that there is a continuing problem of massive tax arrears whether based on estimated assessments or agreed liability on the Schedule D side.  The fundamental changes in the tax assessment and collection system announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, probably the most radical since the introduction of PAYE some 25 years ago, will attack these problems. Under the self-assessment system a greater responsibility will be placed on the individual taxpayer to meet his tax obligations.  Estimated assessments will be on a more realistic basis and tax liability will be settled faster.  Hand in hand with these arrangements will come a much stiffer collection regime and a <Col N="505" /> speedy cost effective response to default. These arrangements should be welcomed by both the PAYE taxpayer and businessmen alike.  Businessmen who pay their tax on time can feel just as aggrieved about the tax default by other businesses and the activities of the black economy, particularly when they are in direct competition with them.  The measures proposed will help level the playing field for them.</P>
    <P>The proposal to offer on a once off basis an opportunity to settle outstanding tax liabilities without payment of certain interest or penalties is particularly to be welcomed.  The reality is that the collection machine had become clogged up and this offer which could gain up to £30 million, and I believe even more extra money for the Exchequer will provide the breathing space to ease the introduction of the new tax collection procedures.  I would hope that during the course of this debate many Deputies in this House, both urban and rural, will come in and say quite clearly and honestly that one of the major problems they have been encountering in their constituency over the past six months or so has been that when the tax collection people set about their business seriously one of the major problems that ordinary people, those with small and medium sized business, had was trying to meet the interest that had accumulated over the years.  I will not go into the details but every Deputy in this House knows that this type of initiative had to be taken.  With this creative type of initiative the system will gain, the Exchequer will gain and the people will feel they have got a fair chance and an incentive to put their house in order.  I know the people will respond to it.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of corporation profit tax at 50 per cent is too high in comparison with other countries.  However, our system is very complex and there is too much room for loopholes and tax avoidance.  Rationalisation was overdue. Many non-manufacturing companies on the 50 per cent tax rate have large work-forces and the existing tax incentives were weighted too heavily in favour of <Col N="506" /> plant and machinery <i>vis-àvis</i> the employees.  Those reliefs also gave much room for abuse.  The reduction in the standard rate to 43 per cent coupled with the phasing down of the accelerated depreciation allowances will lead to a fairer deal all round and bring us more into line with other countries.  The reduction in capital allowances will not apply to qualifying service companies in the international financial services centre or the Shannon Free Airport Development Company customers or to the special building incentives in the designated areas for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>While the reductions in the first year's capital allowances may not be welcomed by some manufacturing industry, I believe that on balance it will be acknowledged and already has been acknowledged that such changes are sensible as the old arrangements tended to encourage the substitution of capital for labour. I know that some will only be too well aware of the avoidance that existed, where, for example in a group company situation a subsidiary operating in the UK could make profits, take them back here and set them off against accelerated capital allowances.  The Irish Exchequer should not have to bear that type of expense.  This is the reality of life.  Some people may not know it but some people know it only too well.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the changes in the corporate tax structure are in line with recent trends in other countries.  The changes reflect the reorientation of industrial policy which involves a shift in support from fixed assets to marketing and management development.  There will be reasonable transitional arrangements to the new system so that current investment decisions will not be adversely affected.  We expect that the combination of the changes in industrial policy and corporate taxation will have a positive impact on employment generally.  Projects under negotiation will not be affected by the change in the accelerated depreciation allowance as expenditure under contracts already signed will be eligible for the existing allowance as will expenditure on projects which have been <Col N="507" /> negotiated with the industrial development agencies and approved for grant assistance before the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>The construction industry has gone through a very difficult period.  I have heard remarks in that regard today.  I will leave it to my colleague Deputy Flynn, the Minister for the Environment, to elaborate on what the incentives introduced in this budget package will do for the building and construction industry and I will not say any more about it, but they are positive, creative and recognise the reality that while we may have too many houses and an over-supply of commercial property there are niches in the construction market which can be addressed. Both the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance have clearly recognised those and addressed them.  The Minister will give full details in his contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>The very substantial personal tax reliefs provided for in the budget which are far and above those to which we committed ourselves in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will contribute substantially to an increase in disposable income.  The tax savings from the budget will range form £327 annually for a single person on PAYE to £596 for a married couple.  I have heard some Deputies throw cold water on the proposals, but I would point out that a single person on £9,000 to £10,000 will get approximately £200 extra in his pay, which is £4 per week.  Indeed if we take the case of a young married couple where both are working and have a joint income of £25,000, which is fairly normal, their tax relief will be £650 per annum or £13 a week.  I have heard Opposition speakers say already both outside and in this House that the concessions were miserly and were not what they were put out to be.  However, the tables are there for everybody to see.  I can only describe such reactions from Opposition speakers as ostrichlike in that they fail to recognise the reality of what is here, but naturally from their viewpoint they would like to reduce the impact on them substantially.</P>
    <P>People who are paying tax will know <Col N="508" /> full well what exactly their own personal reliefs will be.  Substantial progress has also been made in achieving the Government's target of getting two-thirds of taxpayers back down to the standard rate of tax at 35 per cent and as a result of this budget we have gone more than half way with 93,000 taxpayers moving from the marginal rate of 48 per cent to 35 per cent.  Another 55,000 will move out of the 58 per cent rate back to the 48 per cent rate.  The increase in exemption levels will take another 16,000 out of the tax net while a further 5,000 will become entitled to marginal relief.  The reliefs are there to be seen.  I have heard people express surprise that in the difficult times in which we found ourselves we were able to recognise the heavy burden on the PAYE sector and to produce such generous reliefs.</P>
    <P>On social welfare, here again, despite the difficult financial situation, the Government have produced a caring budget, recognising the realities we have to face.  While keeping to budgetary targets, the Government decided to provide a real increase in the level of social welfare payments to the less well off sections of our society.  The particularly difficult situation of the long term unemployed has been recognised in the decision to increase the weekly allowance of a single person living in an urban area from £37.80 to £42 and a married couple from £65 to £70.  The Minister for Finance would dearly like to have done better, but he recognised they needed something extra and gave them what the situation could afford.  In the case of the long term unemployed living in rural areas the increase is from £36.60 to £40.70 and £63.20 to £68.10 respectively.  The special plight of the homeless has been addressed by the provision of £3 million over the next three years to finance accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary housing organisations beginning with £1 million in this year's budget. There is clear recognition of a caring philosophy that has always been and always will exist within the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Our strategy is not based solely, as <Col N="509" /> people would like others to believe, on principles of financial rectitude.  We realise that an appropriate budget strategy must also involve developmental measures which attack the weaknesses in Irish industry in order to reduce the high rate of unemployment we have suffered in recent years.  The Government's strategy for industrial development is set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> That programme is now agreed by our social partners.  The strategy has been developed on a sectoral basis, concentrating primarily on areas such as the marine, food, tourism, horticulture and forestry, where we can create real and sustainable jobs based on our own natural resources, our own strengths and identified opportunities.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance gave details of a new initiative to develop the potential of the fishing and aquaculture industries in the provision of £4 million for a special package of measures for tourism in 1988.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> sets out a strategy for the creation of industrial jobs.  The target is to create 20,000 extra jobs each year.  The IDA and SFADCo are positioning themselves to meet the industrial objectives set out in that programme.</P>
    <P>The following job opportunities were identified in that plan, and, indeed, need repeating here today.  In the food industry in the beef sector 1,000 jobs over five years; pig processing, 1,000 over five years; sheepmeat, 200 jobs over five years; other manufacturing areas: toolmaking, 1,000 jobs over five to eight years; automotive components 3,000 jobs, electronics 4,500 jobs over five years; clothing 3,500 jobs; craft products, 1,000 jobs; &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; growth sector in the UK and continental Europe, 300 jobs.  It is hoped to create in horticulture 1,500 to 2,000 jobs; in forestry, 750 to 1,000 jobs over the next eight to ten years; the marine, 2,000 full time jobs and 2,000 part time jobs in general fishing and 1,500 jobs in inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The sectors I have mentioned represent those which have been identified and set down in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as areas with substantial <Col N="510" /> potential.  It does not end there. The programme is quite clear in that there is further scope.  The task I am now engaged in is to develop strategies for those other areas and to proceed swiftly towards their implementation.  The budget involves reductions in the levels of State support for industry which have already been outlined in the Book of Estimates.  What has developed in this country over the years was an over-interventionist approach involving the State agencies and various schemes and programmes. This inevitably led to overlap and duplication and all that was beginning to have a stifling effect on enterprise and initiative.  Enterprises were becoming more concerned about getting the grants they could get and qualifying for schemes and programmes rather than getting on with their business and going out there fighting for markets.  For that reason I make no apologies for the cuts being applied within my Department's areas of responsibility.  These cuts amount to close to 10 per cent in 1988 without taking inflation into account. Apart from the contribution this is making in improving the national economy and the positive impact on the business environment, these reductions will force us to have a more critical look at how and where we are spending our resources.  They give a more meaningful effect to our stated industrial policy objectives and will ensure better value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The key objective of our industrial policy was to develop strong internationally trading, home grown risk companies which will generate new wealth and create new jobs.  The job the Government and my Department have to do is make this objective a reality by appropriate policy measures.  I do not favour the State itself becoming involved in what has been loosely described as &ldquo;picking winners&rdquo;.  Industry has a job to do for itself.  The markets are there.  We live in a real world of competitiveness and, as I have often remarked, there is no second prize for industry competing in world markets today.  We cannot rely on gaining a silver medal.  You must go for gold. <Col N="511" /> You cannot be second best.  You have to be the best.  Quality is what the new game is all about, and this small economy, this small industrial base of ours, will gear itself to quality and to doing the job just that little bit better than our competitors.</P>
    <P>The Financial Services Centre is another new concept which was only a concept in our election programme.  In the very short time since then it has been transferred into reality with the high level committee set up under the Taoiseach's Department.  They have brushed aside all the unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles that can come in the way.  The idea was to bring all the people and Departments concerned around the table and, instead of writing reports to one another, all the problems were put on the table and teased out and decisions were taken.  This is a headline as to how concepts can be transferred into realistic projects within a short time.  This is part of the philosophy expressed by the Taoiseach on many occasions, that his new Fianna Fáil Government would approach the whole difficult situation as economic managers. There are many instances to show how that philosophy has succeeded.</P>
    <P>The IDA are responsible for marketing the centre and already some 18 projects have been sent to the Minister for Finance for certification as eligible under the tax rates.  In addition the IDA are currently in active negotiations with a significant number of other companies and they except many of these to be translated into important projects for the centre.  The recent crash of the stock markets on Black Monday in October has had no impact on the enthusiasm and interest being shown world wide in this new concept of the international Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The year 1987 saw reorientation of industrial policy and this continues in 1988.  Significant changes are taking place in State agency structures to bring a more coherent approach to policy performance. The IDA and SFADCo have recently announced changes in structures, personnel and priorities to position <Col N="512" /> themselves to meet the industrial objectives in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  SFADCo are ready to commence their integrated, economic development role in the mid-west, a new approach to integrated regional development where the industrial and tourism functions and the functions of the county development teams were all merged under one company.  It will be interesting to see how the mid-west will benefit over the years to come.</P>
    <P>The reorientation of industrial policy of which I have spoken is designed mainly to achieve the increased job targets at lesser cost to the Exchequer.  These include a greater degree of selectivity in the type of projects assisted and the grant package on offer, the strict implementation of performance conditions relating grant assistance to jobs actually created rather than grant assistance to jobs approved, increasing emphasis on jobs created rather than jobs approved, and greater use of repayable forms of that assistance.</P>
    <P>On exports, a consequence of yesterday's budget proposals will be an enhancement of the positive economic climate enjoyed by our exports during 1987.  The buoyancy of the British market and the confidence and optimism expressed by manufacturers during the later part of 1987 should expand and translate into increased export sales during 1988.</P>
    <P>The impact of lower tax payments for the majority of taxpayers and the mortgage interest relief that people are now enjoying from the very significant drop in interest rates will stimulate an increased demand on the home market.  Consumers will have higher levels of disposable incomes which will boost local sales opportunites, particularly for our indigenous firms.  The proposals now contained in the budget will supplement the range of new initiatives already introduced by the Government to stimulate export growth and mome market penetration. The potential for further development has already been clearly identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Attention has been focused by <Col N="513" /> the Government on improving Ireland's marketing and trading prospects.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Minister with specific responsibility for trade and marketing has succeeded in highlighting the importance of getting our manufacturers to adopt a market-led approach.  Many reports and studies in the past have identified a lack of marketing as a major deficiency in Irish firms.  Through the efforts of the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing and the work of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish Goods Council, Irish firms are now developing their marketing expertise as is evidenced by the successful trade figures for 1987.  We will continue to build on these achievements.</P>
    <P>The Government established the National Marketing Group last week with a specific mandate to bring forward hard-nosed business proposals to identify how Irish firms can be supported in securing increased market shares on home and overseas markets.  I expect that the group which is under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, will bring early and valuable proposals to the Government.  That Minister is also engaged in the preparation of a national marketing plan which will provide a strategy for improving the marketing performance of Irish firms.  It is intended that the work of the National Marketing Group will provide an input into this strategy.  The Government have also agreed to my proposals to give Irish firms a fair crack of the whip in competing for public sector contracts.  The level of public sector purchasing is and will continue to be substantial.  The public sector is the biggest single purchaser in Ireland. This business offers great opportunities for Irish firms.  However, in the past the level of involvement by Irish firms in this area of business has been disappointing. There may be some reasons for this: the relatively small size of many of our firms; our reluctance to become involved in what may be perceived as excessive bureaucratic requirements or a perception that the State is in some way unreceptive to local products.  Each of these factors may have played a part. <Col N="514" /> However, I am satisfied that Irish firms have the capacity to make a much greater contribution to supplying the needs of the public sector on a competitive basis. Consistent with our international obligations, I now intend to see that Irish companies are given their fair chance in this area.  The sooner we recognise the purchasing habits of our consumers and buyers in our major areas of industry, the sooner we will realise that the only way they can make their contribution to a revived Irish economy is for them to source all their supplies as far as possible at home.  We can no longer afford to export money out of the country to purchase many of the goods we could manufacture at home; exporting money is exporting jobs which we badly need at home.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government have agreed to my recommendations on the subject of counter-trade.  The public sector is a substantial purchaser on the international markets.  In the past we have failed to capitalise on the strength this gives us.  We have been shy to follow the example of other trading nations. Happily the situation has now changed and public sector purchasers will be looking for counter-trade arrangements in the case of all substantial overseas Irish contracts.</P>
    <P>The combined results of all of these initiatives will be to develop greater opportunities for Irish firms at home and abroad.  Increased sales will generate increased employment opportunities and wealth and allow firms to become more internationally competitive.  Government policies are providing the right economic climate and support for firms. On the basis of their performance in 1987, firms are responding to these policies and are creating the growth needed to get our economy growing.</P>
    <P>The improvement during the past year in the business environment is reflected in the increasing importance which the venture capital industry is playing as a major provider of funds to industry.  It has been estimated that the Irish venture capital pool of invested or available funds now amounts to £180 million.  As a proportion <Col N="515" /> of GNP, we are estimated to be ahead of many other countries with a larger established venture capital industry.</P>

      <P>This growth in the availability of venture capital funding has important implications for the State's direct financial support for industry.  In the past, industry relied excessively on the State to provide in a large part the finance needed for capital investment, with much of the balance made up by loan finance.  Indeed it could be said that the State, through an over generous grants regime, contributed much to this over reliance.  One of the major weaknesses identified in the financial make up and structure of Irish companies was that they were over reliant on loan capital and because of very high interest rates during the past few years many of them failed to make it and, went under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a combination of factors, including the recognition of companies of the advantages of outside equity capital investment and the inability of the State to continue to blanket support industry has done much to redress this balance. We now have a considerably healthier situation in that innovative companies are able to obtain a mixture of private and public support.  They have the opportunity to accelerate growth through judicious and selective State support and <Col N="516" /> the advantage of the stability and added expertise which is offered by outside equity investment.</P>
    <P>The private investor, as well as the venture capital companies, is a barometer of confidence in the correctness of Government policies.  Private funds invested through the business expansion scheme amounted to over £8 million in 80 plus companies since last April.  I expect that the level of investment will exceed £10 million by the end of the financial year.  This will almost double the level of BES investment in 1986-87 and demonstrates that investment in industry is now accepted as a productive and prudent use of funds.  The tide has at last turned.</P>
    <P>The Government have continually emphasised and have geared their policies towards reducing the many costs which beset industry.  It would be remiss of me to encourage greater equity participation in industry without at the same time addressing the need to reduce costs for companies taking the ultimate step of seeking such a Stock Market quotation. To this end, I recently requested the Stock Exchange to examine ways and means of reducing the many varied costs, particularly to small companies, of obtaining a quotation.  One possibility I have put to the Stock Exchange is the establishment of a panel of legal and accounting firms who would be willing to manage floatations for a predetermined price.  There should also be room for a reduction in stockbrokers' quotation costs but the final choice of selection will always remain with individual companies. I have already taken the initiative of bringing the Stock Exchange and the IDA together to heighten awareness of the advantages to companies of a public quotation.  This approach will in time enable a reduction in the level of State expenditure on grants while creating a sound financial springboard for companies with growth ambitions.</P>

      <P>In the time remaining I will not be able to go through all of the other aspects I had in mind.  There is a further restructuring of agencies in the coming together of the NBST and the IIRS.  It will be their remit to identify the areas of science and technology, and indeed to bring Irish industry into the modern world of technology.  One of the major weaknesses in industry relates to technology.  They will also have a major input in devising policy with the Office of Science and Technology in my Department for approving and directing where funds should be spent.  They have already embarked on a very enlightened programme in bio-technology development in 1987 and that programme will continue in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time in which we have been in Government we have tackled the fundamental problems.  Everybody knows there are not quick solutions, that <Col N="518" /> one cannot get payback in jobs overnight. What is fundamental is the course we are on and that out of this House goes a clear message that the consensus that exists outside this House is continuing to be reflected here.  We are on the only road to success.  The paybacks will not be immediate but most politicians in this House, especially in Fine Gael and in the Progressive Democrats, know that what we are doing is right.  They have to do their thing politically but the country needs stability to continue on the road to success on which the Government have embarked.  Already, we have seen some of the fruits of the sacrifices that have been made.  Sacrifices are necessary in the short term for the rebuilding of our economy in the medium to long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is a major disappointment. It has not taken advantage of the consensus that exists in relation to Irish politics.  It has failed to relate to the ordinary people in enterprise, in employment and out of employment and it has failed to address their problems seriously. In so far as the budget deals with the financial problems facing the State it continues on a path charted by the previous Government, which is currently being underpinned by the fiscal policy of Fine Gael.  This Government are only as strong in this House as Fine Gael will allow them to be.  There is no ambiguity in the determination of Fine Gael to ensure that the public debt is brought under control. We have no future unless it is brought under control.  Interest rates, taxation rates, unemployment rates and our emigration rates all stem from the vicious cycle of debt in which we are held. The budget yesterday failed to deal with the central problem of tax reform, to improve the disincentive problems where by those with large families would be better off not working and it failed to provide any stimulus for growth in the economy.  Unfortunately this Government suffer from some of the problems from which the previous Government suffered, one being a paralysis in dealing with the public finances in isolation to <Col N="519" /> such an extent that productive sectors are not being developed as they should be.</P>
      <P>The Government missed a major opportunity to deal with Irish Life and its potential for the taxpayer.  I have no doubt from the point of view of the Exchequer that it could benefit by £300 million from the sale of the shares of the Minister for Finance in Irish Life.  It is in the interests of the staff and the policyholders and all connected with Irish Life that it be taken out of public ownership. I am aware that already there have been consultations with the staff and that they support such a change.  The dilemma is that the type of international expansion that Irish Life requires in the US market as well as in Europe and in the UK is stunted by lack of available capital.  It could be easily organised through the courts to set up a proper structure to get a capital equity value on each of the shares of Irish Life plc which unlike other State companies already has minority shareholding outside of the hands of the Minister for Finance.  A multitude of opportunities could be seized with both hands by Irish Life if the Government took this courageous decision.  When we were in Government the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, appointed a review group in the Department of Finance to consult with Irish Life to pursue this issue.  Their report is gathering dust in the Department of Finance although it requires urgent Government decision.  I admit that money from the sale of those shares amounting to £300 million would not be available every year but this money could provide an engine for growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem is that we have a two-tier economy in relation to manufacturing industry.  On the one hand we have glowing trade statistics which show that in 1987 there was a trade surplus of £1.5 billion.  That conceals the real state of native Irish industry.  Native industry cannot repatriate profits abroad, it can only repatriate the profits at home. Therefore, the type of problems from which native industry suffers will not be reversed until we tackle their urgent <Col N="520" /> needs.  Let us face it, a lot of the multinationals here are only involved in transfer pricing when it comes to export sales and they are maximising their sales and profits to avail of the minimum corporation tax rates.  A front page headline in a recent newspaper referred to a major boost to Government budget strategy by the trade figures.  Unfortunately those trade figures bear no relation to the economic well-being of this country or to the net well-being of the economy.</P>
    <P>We need to help native industry urgently.  We must realise that less than 1 per cent of GDP at present is spent on research and technology.  The life of any industrial product now is put at less than five years.  The products on the shelves today will be different in five years, time. They will be made in a different way because of technology and because we are investing less in technology than the rest of the western world we will lag behing in new product development.  Any expert on marketing, setting up an export trading house, will say that he is looking for a product based on new technology. We must get a proper technology programme going and supported through the new amalgamated State organisation to build up a proper infrastructure and once we have that we must follow the Japanese example.  They have provided to the world an economic miracle in terms of industrial growth, jobs, trade surplus and success.  They have done that by borrowing and copying other countries' technology and by investing more in technology than any other country in the world.  They have also pioneered share ownership by employees, something this Government have done nothing to advance in this budget, in terms of further tax concessions, building on what Deputy John Bruton did in a previous Administration.</P>
    <P>We must establish a cohesive and effective marketing organisation.  In Japan, Mitsubishi, Toshiba and other large companies are now exporting everything from cameras to cars, from televisions to videos, a whole complexity of products, and they are now getting into fish development.  This is because they are <Col N="521" /> very well resourced marketing corporations. In this country 80 per cent of small manufacturing companies, 5,000 in number, do not export at all, not even to Northern Ireland.  We must radically address this problem.  I am very disappointed the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not bring forward one new proposal to advance the cause of new employment and industrial growth in that sector.</P>
    <P>Another area in our economy which is extremely significant is agriculture.  This Government's record on agriculture, it must be said, is abysmal.  It amounts to nothing more than economic withdrawal. First, they were not satisfied with dismantling everything put in place by the Coalition Government for young farmers, their additional grant aid, stamp duty concessions and installation aid, which decision has now been acknowledged by many as a botched job, leaving the Government's credibility in tatters.  They have savaged the farm improvement programme, restricting the grants by half. They have butchered An Foras Talúntais and ACOT with a proposal to reduce the staff by 1,100.  When it comes to a reduction of staff, it is always the frontline services the Government go for, whether nurses in hospitals, agricultural advisers at the farm gate, or teachers in classrooms, instead of the administrators and fat cats in centrally heated south city offices.  Agriculture requires an injection of research and development, like any other sector.  While I am in favour of the Cashman report and of amalgamation, I regret what is happening.  In my own constituency, the research institute at Johnstown Castle and Clonroche Horticultural Research Station will, I hope, be fully preserved and kept operating.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken money from farmers for two consecutive years by reducing the VAT refunds.  This is totally unfair because it has no regard for farmers who have paid taxes and those who have not, those who have not a tax liability and those who have, those who farm ten acres of land and those with 1,000 acres.  The VAT refund scheme was introduced to compensate for VAT rates <Col N="522" /> on agricultural contractors, on buildings and a whole series of areas in which farmers had to purchase goods and services liable to VAT payments.  This was to compensate the farmers because they were not registered.  The whole intricate system that was built up has now been virtually scrapped.  More money has been brought in under VAT than would have been brought in under the total land tax for the past two years.  The Government have hit the self-employed and the farming community at a time when the Minister was negotiating a 7 per cent reduction in the income of cereal farmers.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the proposal of the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce PRSI for the self-employed.  One of the reasons for our public finances being in such imbalance is the extent to which we have a welfare state which we cannot afford.  I am not saying that individual widows or pensioners, sick or unemployed people are being paid too much, but we have a welfare state mentality that at a certain stage it does not pay people to work. There is a total dependence on the State which is affecting the whole ethos and is causing demoralisation.  To extend the welfare state further strikes me as a move in the wrong direction and I would be opposed to it.</P>
    <P>It is folly that the State should try to intervene in an area where people have been happy to provide for their own pensions. It is particularly unfortunate that there have been different leaks about different rates from different sources over the past two months.  It started with the double-dealing by the Taoiseach in terms of saying one thing to Mr. Joe Rea and another to Mr. Cassells.  That was followed by the National Pensions Board setting out in some independent way a true rate of what would be required to service pensions.  We have not been given a proper actuarial assessment.  I call on the Minister to ensure that this House gets the full information to which it is entitled, so that future Governments in the nineties and at the turn of the century will not inherit another legacy of <Col N="523" /> unnecessary increased social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I would hope that people would be entitled to opt out of the scheme if they did not want to draw a pension, that they would be entitled to provide for themselves.  These are people who have never asked the State for anything and are quite happy to get on with earning their living without interference. Enforcement of collection of previous health contributions, youth employment and tax levies was not satisfactory.  Now the Government propose putting another layer on top and a profile form has gone to many farmers of whose income there is no idea.  There is no systematic way of estimating how much the proposal will yield.  The people will end up in a couple of years receiving letters from the Revenue solicitors, in an attempt to draw in a very small amount of money.  What will happen if these people are entitled to medical cards and find that they are exempt?  Will there be such exemption? All these points need to be clarified, so that the Exchequer does not inherit another liability and so that there is some real progress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement of £4 million for tourism.  Tourism in 1987 was worth about £800 million.  It is a Cinderella industry about which the State has never got its act together.  The private sector has been moving in so many disparate ways that industry has not been able to sell a cohesive, singular product which foreigners want to buy.  We have cabin cruisers on the Shannon, restaurateurs in Dublin, particular type holidays in Killarney, hoteliers, CIE, all promoting different products.  There has been no attempt at integrating policy. This £4 million should not go to Bord Fáilte.  That organisation have not served the State well.  They have been ineffective in direct proportion to the way in which the IDA have been effective, although I have some criticism of the latter body. The IDA at least get action.  The Office of Public Works deal with monuments and different tourist attractions.  Forestry deal with wildlife walks, local authorities <Col N="524" /> deal with signposting, harbour authorities and transport bodies deal with different aspects of access transport &mdash; so many different bodies.  There are 12 different departments and Bord Fáilte are not able to knock heads together and come up with an integrated tourist policy. They have singularly failed to get a uniform tourism policy across the country.</P>
    <P>I hope this £4 million goes to specific projects.  I will name a few that are worthy of special consideration and that will give a direct return.  We need a national tourist discount card, say to the extent of £50, which would entitle the tourist to discount on CIE public transport, on theatre tickets, in restaurants and hotels.  We must ensure that every tourist invests more money here.  Cheapskate tourists, while welcome, are not contributing to the national economy. We must go for the middle end of the market and maximise tourist spending.</P>
    <P>We must extend the tourist season.  No tourists visit here in the months of April, May and June.  The tourist season is shrunk into the last two weeks of July and the first two weeks of August.  Similarly, the September-October period sees very few tourists.  There is no reason for the shoulder end of tourism not being developed.  Bord Fáilte, or some other organisation dealing with tourism interests and the private sector should get together in the workplace &mdash; in Waterford Crystal, in the public sector &mdash; to produce a discount package, similar to the VHI group scheme.  There should be group rates in the workplace, and factories for cheaper holidays, and this £4 million should help specific market-related projects like that.  That would give a direct corresponding increase in tourism revenue and, naturally, if more people spent their holidays at home the position would further improve.  Figures in recent times show that those taking their holidays abroad were only slightly larger in number than those holidaying at home.  A special effort needs to be made to give cheaper holidays in the offpeak periods and that can be done by offering more package holidays.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the ESB in this <Col N="525" /> budget is most intriguing.  In the past I have said that the ESB were a very arrogant, and in some respects a very inefficient, State organisation.  In the late seventies, due to no fault of their own, they increased their electricity capacity to a point which was unforgivable.  They sank the Irish electricity consumer into debt to pay for Moneypoint and for different projects, based on a forecast increase in electricity consumption of 8 per cent per annum.  That has not been achieved in any country in Europe except Germany in the immediate post-war period.  The ESB took on 2,000 extra staff with the result that staffing went up by 9 per cent and output went down by 1 per cent between 1979 and 1981.  Grave decisions were made.  I have had rows with their public affairs spokesman, saying that their pricing was out of line with the rest of Europe and that this was a factor which had resulted in the exporting sector of the economy suffering loss of market share and increased unemployment.</P>
    <P>The ESB argued defiantly all along that they were doing a good job, that they were as lean and as trim an organisation as they could be and that they were moving in various different directions, they were cutting out much of their wasteful and inefficient shops, they were cutting down on staff and they were going ahead with voluntary redundancy but there was no scope for a reduction in the cost of electricity.  When they were quizzed specifically in relation to the international price of a barrel of oil <i>visá-vis</i> the dollar and the glut of oil on the market due to the breakdown of the OPEC agreement they said there was still no scope for a reduction in the price of electricity.  Now, at the stroke of the pen of this Minister for Finance they can come up with not their £2.3 million capital repayments but with 15 years capital repayments one year in advance.  They can say that there was going to be a 5 per cent reduction in electricity prices which the Government have swiped.  I have my doubts about that.</P>
    <P>I know the ESB are well capable of <Col N="526" /> double depreciation in their accounting system.  They were well capable of moaning and groaning with previous Governments when it came to meeting rate demands.  I would like to hear from the ESB some public statements about how they can now come forward with this package and reconcile it with statements they made in the latter half of 1987.  Their credibility is at an all-time low.  It is most unfortunate that Irish consumers of electricity will still have to pay more than any other country in Europe.  It is unfair and wrong to hit households in this way.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest disincentives in the economy at present is for anyone crazy enough to employ people.  Recently I spoke to a person who has just taken on three people, one of whom is a married man with four children.  He had been receiving £112 per week on social welfare assistance.  To many business that is a lot of money to have to pay a person in a non-managerial position and there was no way the employer could compete with it.  However, he wanted the person and decided to take him on.  He also took on a girl and decided, as they were both unemployed, to avail of the employment incentive scheme which gives a subsidy of £30 a week if the employer keeps the person in employment for six months. He told his accountant that he could not expect those people to work for less than they were getting on social welfare and decided to give them £2 more than they had been getting.  However, when PRSI was taken into account he found he had to pay an additional £49 a week.  Neither employee was going to be subject to any PAYE but they were subject to this form of PRSI.  That is a direct tax on jobs.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that it pays employees and employers to do a nixer?  The cost of employment is great, not by what goes into the employees' hands but by what must go to the State.  Whatever priorities we have in tax reform, surely we should not penalise employers and employment in this way.  As the Commission on Taxation rightly said, there should be an immediate policy decision to get rid of employers' PRSI, not because employers should not have an obligation to their <Col N="527" /> staff but simply because it means that those people who are most labour intensive are faced with the highest tax bill. Those who can get rid of people and replace them with machines have every incentive in so doing by virtue of the fact that the State will penalise them for taking on people and they will give them a grant for the machine to replace them. That is totally anomalous.</P>
    <P>There is a family income supplement scheme in operation to which the Minister made no reference yesterday.  It is the best scheme in operation to help bridge the poverty gap for those at work and it greatly needs revamping and improving, even at the expense of the social welfare code.  There was no mention whatsoever in the Minister's speech of employers' PRSI.  I call on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to address that problem.  The issues of a proper industrial policy to develop native industry, a proper commitment to agriculture and in both areas to have proper research and technology and proper marketing corporations is the way to create jobs. The marketing-type package that I put forward for tourism will also directly create jobs and tax revenue.  There is no doubt that even though the employment in tourism in other countries such as Spain and Portugal is seasonal, you can see what a significant input it makes in their economy.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to some of the budget submissions that were made to this Government to which they have given scant disregard.  Drink consumption since 1981 is down by about 28 per cent.  That has obvious implications for employment, both in public houses and in the sector itself.  If it were not for the fact that there has been substantial growth in exports, drink manufacturers would be facing problems.  There was a request from the vintners association not to reduce the amount of tax that the public pay on drink but to change the system so that VAT levels would be reduced and excise duty would be increased.  Many vintners are in severe difficulties with the Revenue sheriff at present.  It was argued <Col N="528" /> that a reduced VAT rate and an increased excise duty rate would reduce the arrears on the two-monthly returns.  It would also deal with the anomalies that currently exist between off-licences and public houses.  There would have been a cashflow benefit to the State because the Government would have got their money sooner.  I ask the Minister for Finance to give more detailed consideration to this matter in the Finance Bill.  As we all know, publicans have gone through a very difficult time and are deserving of further consideration.</P>
    <P>Another area of deep concern is that of smuggling.  There is no doubt that the economic border has moved to a line from Dublin to Galway as opposed to the Six Counties Border that existed in the seventies.  It strikes me that the case put forward by those in the brown goods sector was responded to by the Minister last year.  He did take on board a reduction in excise duties.  Examining the returns released on Friday last for the year's end, particularly in relation to brown goods, I believe that experiment was successful.  So far as I am concerned it resulted in an increase of television sales in the South from 67,000 to 103,000. In my view that was a positive return on a positive decision.  At present there are illegal imports of 12,000 colour televisions and 7,000 videos.  It is a disgraceful situation.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated recently, with regard to the relay of satellite channels, it is a matter for cable companies to decide which, if any, services they wish to relay bearing in mind the channel capacity limitations of their systems.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that he should be making every effort to facilitate and encourage a system under which people who want to learn a continental language be afforded maximum opportunity of doing so?  Furthermore, would he not agree that television would be the more appropriate medium through which this could be done?  Is he aware that the cabling company in Cork are utilising the satellite language service programmes in the Cork area but that people in Dublin &mdash; served by the Cablelink company &mdash; are not afforded that opportunity?  I personally regret that that service is not being made available to them.  The Minister said there was a limited demand for it.  Is he aware that there were over 3,000 signatories representing the lobby seeking transmission, particularly of TV5, the French language service station?  Would he say what market research was conducted and what evidence he has available to him to underpin the decision taken to retain all the other stations that Cablelink transmit and intend continuing to transmit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Deputy's viewpoint in relation to the <Col N="530" /> maximum availability of the language stations. However, there is a limitation in relation to channel capacity.  The cable companies made their choices in relation to which stations they would carry.  I have available to me market research in relation to the various stations.  However, it is the wish of the companies that details of this market research be kept confidential for commercial reasons and I accept that point.  I assure the Deputy that I share his view that, for example, as far as possible, we should have TV5 in the Dublin region.  It is not available at present but one would hope circumstances might change and allow it to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a question of capacity I should say that at present the Cablelink company are transmitting something like ten general entertainment programmes through the channels they are putting out through cable.  It is reasonable to suggest that perhaps one of those could have been dropped in the interests of transmitting the language service programmes with an educational content.  Would the Minister agree that it would be very worthwhile that such facilities be made available to people who want to improve their proficiency in continental languages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with the viewpoint expressed by the Deputy.  There might be scope for even a sharing of a particular channel, so that they could have, for example, one station of an entertainment content transmitted for some hours of the day and, say, TV5 for others.  There could be a share-out, which is what happened when they were experimenting.  I fully accept the Deputy's point in relation to the desirability of greater availability and usage of foreign languages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of which channels are being transmitted for nothing to the cable companies because, if they have to start paying for them, they will have to pass on those charges to their customers.  It is quite obvious that customers are not anxious to pay for the satellite stations.  It is a question, therefore, of which services are coming free, <i>gratis</i> and for nothing.  They are the ones that have been given the permit to allow them continue in the future.  There will be a discretionary charge, for example, for film channels that are available &mdash; Premier is one.  It is a matter for the individual consumer to decide whether he or she wants to pay the companies for that service.  I have not really gone into the details suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had any discussion with the cable industry on the specific question of charging for satellite channels although companies were undoubtedly aware from my public statements in the matter and in particular from my reply to a question on this issue on 15 October last (see Dáil Report of same date, columns 427-429) of my view that any additional charges that might be levied for these services should be levied on the basis that only those who wish to receive them would be required to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cable companies who were relaying satellite services on an experimental basis for the most of 1987 were invited to submit proposals relating to the permanent relay of these services.  Cablelink <Col N="536" /> put forward proposals to continue for the time being to relay at no extra charge a number of services &mdash; Sky Channel, Super Channel and MTV &mdash; which they get free and that they would enter into negotiations with a number of other channels who normally require a payment for access to their services, with a view to continuing to relay those services on the same &ldquo;no extra-charge&rdquo; basis.  They also indicated their intention to explore the possibility of introducing a film channel on a subscription basis.</P>
    <P>The Cork cable company proposed to relay Sky, Super, TV5 (French Channel) and RAI (Italian channel) at no extra charge and that it would be developing a package comprising various other satellite services which it would offer on a discretionary basis to subscribers at an extra charge.</P>

The size of our local market in telecommunications equipment is too small to sustain a sizeable industry and we believe that there are opportunities out there for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 25, and 26 together.  The Deputies are aware that when I announced new licensing terms for the Irish offshore in September 1987 with the purpose of increasing the level of exploration and thereby ensuring that whatever commercial deposits of oil or gas exist in our offshore would be found as quickly as possible, I informed the House that there could be no guarantee that the new terms would immediately produce a dramatic increase in drilling activity.  Nonetheless, I am now pleased to be in a position to inform the Deputies that the new terms have in fact achieved positive results already.  As a direct result of these new terms, licensing agreements have <Col N="539" /> been concluded with two oil companies both of which involve drilling commitments. The first well under these licences will, in fact, be drilled in the Porcupine in 1988.  I am also happy to say that negotiations are at an advanced stage with a consortium of three other companies to license other blocks in the Porcupine basin.  This, agreement, which I expect will be concluded shortly, also involves drilling commitments and it is possible that a first well under the licence will be drilled in 1988.</P>
      <P>With regard to the overall 1988 drilling programme, it is not possible to be definite at this stage as to the final number of wells which will be drilled this year. As of now, however, I expect at least four wells to be drilled while the drilling of other wells are a possibility.  These depend, <i>inter alia</i>, on the results of predrilling evaluation by companies of the prospects involved and, in some cases, on negotiations currently in progress with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that it is four months now since these new favourable terms were announced, is the Minister satisfied generally with the level of response and in particular with the level of commitment.?  From the Minister's reply I am not clear whether there is a firm commitment for any well.  Perhaps he would clarify that.  I would like him to comment also on the contacts that have been made with his Department since these terms were introduced and as to the likely prospects of the number of wells to which a commitment would be made in the course of this year.  Perhaps the Minister would give more factual information on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to get into estimates because the Deputy would come back in a couple of months time and ask what happened to the estimates. I have met representatives of more than 20 companies from around the world &mdash; some were operating here before, some were here and left and others were never in Irish waters.  No Minister would be happy with the level of take-up.  I would <Col N="540" /> like to see 20 or 30 wells this year but, being realistic, I am happy that the aim of the new terms is being met and that there is increased interest.  For example, there has been a take-up in the sale of copies of the Porcupine report published last year &mdash; each report costs about £8,000.  There has been tremendous interest in these waters.  As well as my own contacts with these oil companies, there have been a considerable number of contacts between officials of my Department and representatives of other companies.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley I feel the Minister's response was not very explicit.  I took him to say there were two companies with definite commitments in the Porcupine in 1988.  Are they new companies to Irish exploration or were they here already?  Will the Minister clarify if there are any existing commitments or new commitments arising from his September 1987 announcement in relation to the Celtic Sea?  I can appreciate the Minister not wanting to be tied to specific numbers because obviously one has to wait until commitments are made and even then circumstances can change in 12 months, but will he give us some indication of what he considers is the situation in the Porcupine?  Obviously the publication of the report last year enhanced the prospects of the Porcupine by providing all available information. Will he tell us what information the report showed which was not previously available?  What are the prospects for the Porcupine Basin?  Does he now expect the concentration of exploration to be in the Porcupine Basin as opposed to the Celtic Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the interest will be in both areas.  What the Porcupine report did was to bring together all the technical information available.  There was a large bank of knowledge available to the Department and it was thought desirable to bring it together in one report.  This report is not giving new information but is making information <Col N="541" /> available to companies which they otherwise would not have.</P>
      <P>As far as companies are concerned, BP have a commitment in the South Porcupine. There is a consortium of three companies involved in a well in the northern area and it will be up to them to make an announcement.  I hope the well will be drilled in 1988 and that we will soon finish negotiations.  There has been another commitment as a result of the terms I announced for the Celtic Sea and there are other negotiations going on for new commitments in the Celtic Sea.  These are all in addition to interests which were already in existence.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is a sufficient level of interest in exploration specifically geared towards gas resources?  Has he considered gas prices as an obstacle to interest in gas exploration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I want to find either oil or gas but, as far as gas is concerned, price is not the problem.  Offtake is the problem.  It is also a question of the capacity of the Irish market.  That was one of the reasons the Government confirmed the decision of the previous Administration to extend the pipeline to Dundalk.  The Deputy will be aware that we recently got sanction for £12 million EC aid for that pipeline and that is going ahead this year.  The bigger the market available the greater the possibility of there being more gas exploration.  I have also had discussions with the British Energy Secretary about the possibility of selling some of our gas to the United Kingdom.  That is under discussion at the moment by the two Governments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider the low cost of oil is one of the factors why there has not yet been a greater commitment to a drilling programme, or does he think the oil companies take a long term view; in other words, the fact that oil prices are low would not inhibit them from carrying out a drilling programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In case there is any misunderstanding about this, I am very happy with the level of interest and the response from the companies to the terms.  Obviously I would be happier if the companies committed themselves to 20 or 30 wells but that is not the way business is conducted.  The terms were announced four months ago and I am very happy with the response to date. Obviously the price of oil has an influence on the drilling programme because the companies have to take into account the funds available to them and they have to decide how much of those funds will be put into their drilling programmes, and where.  As our results last year were not as good as we had hoped, they have had an effect on our drilling programme. However, I believe the companies are in for the long haul and we have very special attractions for them.  We are a stable democracy in the European Community and that alone is a considerable attraction because they can explore in our waters in the hope of making a find which they can bring onstream immediately or in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the renewed interest in the Porcupine Basin, an interest which had not been there since 1978, how does the Minister perceive the level of technological development in relation to extracting oil from the Porcupine Basin which is 1,400 ft. or 1,500 ft deep.  To my knowledge there did not seem to be development in this area in the last number of years and there was a reluctance to actually explore there, unless it was in the long term.  Have there been any new discoveries by the oil companies as to the possibility of extracting oil from this deep and dangerous sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a problem in the past but, as the Deputy is aware, the companies are continually developing technology and, because oil and gas are becoming scarcer commodities the companies have to go into areas which ten years ago would have been unthinkable. <Col N="543" /> The companies have developed the technology to go as deep as 3,000 ft., as in the case of the BP well.  They are going down about 1,000 metres and even a further 1,500 or 2,000 metres into the earth's crust.  This is very advanced technology and BP are leaders in the field, we are very fortunate to have them exploring in Irish waters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the well being drilled in 1988.  I can assure the Deputy he will be the first to hear about it, as well as the rest of Ireland; if there is a commercial find it will not be kept secret.  We will then have a number of stepping wells and we will decide on the full commercial find.  The are convinced that the technology will be available to them because they continue to develop as they drill.</P>

Whitegate is also being looked at and there was an indication of interest from another group representing Acua-dorian interests.

Will the Minister comment on the fact that in the past the Nigerian Government have been known not to honour commitments into which they entered?  Does that concern him and, if so, will he comment on it?  To my knowledge, there are many refineries for sale in western Europe and, presumably, the Nigerian interest is to gain easier access to the markets in Europe.  From their point of view, would it not be appropriate to go for one of those refineries?  What carrot are we holding out to attract them here?

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from his own experience in the Department of Energy of the complications in the cross-Border markets. Because of British Government decisions the market in the North is quite small, they have run down their gas industry to practically nothing.  In relation to possible sales in the Dublin Airport, Swords area there would be about 11 million therms, Drogheda would have about 14 million, <Col N="552" /> Dundalk about 4 million and Dunleer about 500,000.  Those are roughly the figures.</P>

      <P>I have not got the breakdown available before me but I will get it and send it to the Deputy.  The main attraction from the point of view of the pipeline is that its direction is from Finglas to Ballough in North County Dublin and then past Drogheda.  It brings it close to the horticulture industry which fits in with the Government's policy of horticultural development as was evidenced by the establishment of An Bord Glas. We are attempting to do everything we can to encourage greater support for our horticultural industry.  They have for many years been faced with unfair competition from the Dutch who had natural gas available to them.  It is Government thinking that the availability of natural gas will make our horticultural industry far more viable and far more able to compete.</P>

      <P>A decision to amend the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation so as to permit INPC to play a limited role in hydrocarbon exploration <Col N="553" /> and/or development was taken by the previous Government in February 1986 and effect has been given to this amendment.</P>
      <P>The amendment was specifically designed at the time to allow INPC to take up a limited number of minor carried interests in exploration licences.  Its possible role in this respect was modified to some degree by the changes in licensing terms in September 1986 which abolished the concept of equity participation by the State in any oil development projects. INPC has since submitted certain proposals to me which are being examined in my Department.  The Government also will shortly be reviewing the general role of INPC in this and in other areas.</P>

      <P>I have, since I came into office, made numerous representations to the UK authorities regarding Irish concerns about the UK nuclear industry.  In April 1987, I wrote to the then UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Peter Walker, protesting on behalf of the Irish Government at plans to construct new nuclear plants.  In September 1987, following the CEGB's announcement of their proposal to build a pressurised water reactor at Hinkley Point, I had a meeting with Mr. Cecil Parkinson, Mr. Walker's successor, and I expressed Ireland's complete opposition to any expansion of the UK nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>On 22 December last I wrote to Mr. Parkinson reiterating the major fears and concerns of the Government and the Irish people about the UK nuclear industry, and urging that the utmost consideration be given to the objections to the proposed new plant at Hinkley Point.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of what it is like dealing with the British authorities on this issue, as in many others.  I have received a response from the Secretary of State for Energy in response to my letter of 22 December 1987.  He, of course, reiterates that safety is of paramount importance in the operation of all their nuclear installations in the UK and this remains and will continue to remain their position.  In addition, they are having a public inquiry, and that was announced on 17 December, into the CEGB's application to construct a pressurised water reactor in Somerset.  He informs me that he will then reach his decision on the application in due course in the light of the inquiry inspector's report and all other relevant matters.  I would say that I am not satisfied with the response I have been getting from the British on the legitimate fears we have as a nation to the activities of the CEGB, to the reprocessing units they have in Sellafield and to their proposals for experiments at Trawsfynydd and Wilfa. We are not happy with that and we have used every diplomatic channel available to us in the UK and we are considering the situation of going a step further and taking legal action because we feel that you can only depend on the diplomatic process for so long and after that it is a question of the legal road.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Hinkley Point station, given that the Minister has made representations on numerous occasions and that he has no reason to believe they are not going to proceed with the construction of that plant, if they do continue, is the Minister suggesting that he would initiate legal action against the British authorities to prevent them constructing the plant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Euratom Treaty they are bound by certain rules and regulations with regard to the plants that they bring onstream and the safety <Col N="556" /> considerations of neighbouring countries. For example, we have joined with Luxembourg and the State of Saarland against the French in a court case they are taking against the French in the construction of a plant which the French have put right up on their border.  We see no reason why at this stage we should not proceed along the legal road because we are not satisfied that sufficient care and attention are being paid to our representations and to the legitimate concerns and fears of the Irish people in relation to the activities of the British nuclear industry.  If we had any doubts about their transparency in this matter they were well and truly removed when, under the 30 year rule, the Cabinet papers of the Windscale incident were published and it was shown that the British Government were involved in a cover-up of that particular accident.  We are very concerned.  We are chasing the British through the EC Commission because we believe there is need for an independent inspectorate at Community level; that is one item which I will be discussing with the European Commission. The Deputies can be assured that the Government share their concern. This is one issue that unites the whole nation.  They can be assured that the Government are pursuing the matter as vigorously as possible and I am open to any suggestion from any side of the House as to any other actions and steps I might take.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 19, and 64 together.  I share the concerns of Deputies about the CEGB proposal to carry out tests at the Trawsfynydd plant. Taking into account that the plant is now operating well beyond its original life span, the long-standing concerns about the safety of the ageing Magnox type reactors which have no secondary containment and which are known to be suffering from internal weakening of vital components, as well as the history of incidents at Trawsfynydd, the Government are completely opposed to the carrying out of experiments on this plant.</P>
      <P>I have written to the UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. Parkinson, expressing the Irish Government's total opposition to the experiment at Trawsfynydd, and requesting an early meeting to discuss the matter.  The Irish Government were not notified in advance about this experiment or similar experiments carried out in the past.</P>
      <P>The failure of the British authorities to take account of the concerns of the Irish people on a matter of such relevance to us is very disturbing and I hope to take this up with Mr. Parkinson at the meeting with him which I have requested.</P>
      <P>I also contacted the EC Commissioner, Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, who told me that he has written directly to Mr. Parkinson to remind the UK Government of the provisions of Article 34 of the Euratom Treaty.  Article 34 provides that where a member state proposes to carry out particularly dangerous experiments it shall first obtain the opinion of the Commission and where it might affect the territory of another member state it shall require the assent of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are reviewing the legal possibilities open to them to stop the experiment in the event that the authorities involved permit the experiment to <Col N="559" /> proceed.  It would not be appropriate to comment further at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Irish people should not be exposed to any doses of radiation from the operation of nuclear installations in the UK and elsewhere.  We derive no benefit from such operations and this Government will do everything they can to protect our people from such hazards.  It is unacceptable that our marine environment is deliberately contaminated daily by discharges of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea from UK nuclear installations, and that we should be threatened by the risk of a nuclear accident from Sellafield's reprocessing activities and the continued operations of old Magnox nuclear reactors which could have long term irreparable implications for the health, economy, and environment of this country. This is why the Government have been calling for the closure of Sellafield and the old Magnox power stations.  This is also the reason why the Government are opposed to any further expansion of the nuclear industry in the UK and elsewhere which might threaten our health and safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the European Treaties the Commission has a duty and a responsibility to protect the people in the Community in so far as possible from the hazards of radiation.  I am glad to note that the European Commission recently decided to commence inspections of the monitoring facilities established in member states in order to check the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil and ensure compliance with basic health and safety standards.  While these inspections are to be welcomed, I have informed the Commission that this does not prejudice Ireland's long-standing <Col N="563" /> request for the establishment of an independent European inspection force which would have no axe to grind and which would examine whether the most modern safety standards are being applied at all nuclear installations within the Community.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of the UK's nuclear plants, the Government will go on exerting maximum pressure through all channels open to them including international organisations to achieve our legitimate demands that ageing and unsafe installations are closed down and that there is no further expansion of the nuclear industry which might affect our health and safety.  The Government consider that this is the best approach towards the general question of safety in present circumstances, but where circumstances arise in which legal action may be effective, consideration will be given to following such a course.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister inform the House, first, if he feels he will get any support from his European counterparts, other than the British Minister and perhaps the French and the Germans who are rather hung up on nuclear power? Has he had discussions with his other counterparts in other European countries, perhaps smaller countries?  The support we received from Commissioner Clinton Davis is to be welcomed.  I remember having many discussions with the Commissioner in this country and he is very aware of the difficulties and fears we have in relation to the British nuclear industry.  Perhaps the Minister would outline to us whether he feels he will get support from his counterparts, the Ministers in other European countries, for the establishment of an independent nuclear inspectorate, which I recall calling for on many occasions and which the then spokesperson for the Fianna Fáil Party felt would not be adequate; in fact, the present Taoiseach felt it would not be adequate.  If we succeed in establishing it I believe it would be the root we should put down.  What prospect does the Minister see at this stage of support for its <Col N="564" /> establishment and what is the likelihood of its being established as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The European inspectorate is not adequate as such.  The only solution is the closure of the plants within the UK.  That is the final solution as far as the protection of the health and safety of the Irish people are concerned. However, as a step to removing the native inspectorate forces from their own industries we believe the European inspectorate is a step in the right direction. I have put on record the help I have received from Commissioner Clinton Davis.  He has been very helpful in this area, but again he has to deal with a difficult environment.  He is dealing with the British and French in particular who, as has been said, are very pro-nuclear.  I have met my colleagues from the remaining countries in the EC.  I met them in Copenhagen in September-October last and discussed this at great length with them.  I raised it at the informal meeting there.  I have also had discussions with the representatives from Norway, Sweden and Iceland because I am seeking support on this issue from all sources, not just within the Community, to try to ensure the closure of these plants within the UK.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply referred to the Euratom Treaty. Under Articles 37 and 38 of that Treaty the Commission can issue directives concerned with levels of radioactivity that emanate from such plants.  If these Directives are ignored by member states there is under Article 38 a provision whereby the offending member states can be brought before the European Court.  To my knowledge we have never approached this very difficult area in that way.  Apart from giving consideration to it, may I ask the Minister if, in view of the ineffectiveness of the measures he has taken to date, it is now time to proceed along the lines I have outlined?  Surely he would agree that it is likely to be more effective than the action he has taken already. Apart from confining ourselves to the <Col N="565" /> European Court may I ask the Minister if he has considered bringing this matter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague where Ireland could initiate a case based on international precedent whereby one State is not entitled to cause damage to another State by virtue of any action it carried out in its own jurisdiction?</P>

      <P>In response to the point about the action taken to date by the Government in relation to the British nuclear industry, I believe that through diplomatic pressure and lobbying by ministerial colleagues, both within and outside the European Community, the Government have raised the level of awareness of the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry and that this can only be of benefit to the people of Ireland.  I reject totally the suggestion that the efforts to date have been in some way less than successful. Because we have not received the support and recognition we would like from the British Government of the legitimate concerns of the Irish people, we are at this stage considering the legal road and all legal avenues, including the various sections of the Euratom Treaty, are being looked at with a view to taking legal action against the British, either in Europe or in Britain.</P>

      <P>The preparation by an interdepartmental committee of an emergency plan to deal with the effects of a nuclear accident has been completed and the plan has been submitted to me for consideration.  In such an important matter as this, it was considered advisable to allow the committee time to finalise the plan taking into account all relevant matters.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as the success of the plan will depend on the availability of funds for the purchase of additional equipment identified by the committee as essential to the plan, I sought and obtained Government approval for the inclusion of £250,000 in this year's Estimates for the first phase of expenditure on this equipment.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a previous question from the Deputy, some important elements of the plan have been put into place already such as extra office and laboratory resources for the Nuclear Energy Board, monitoring equipment for the Civil Defence, communications links with the International Atomic Energy Agency and arrangements for the urgent calling together of key personnel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, it would normally fall to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister and as Joint Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to make this statement to the House.  However, in his absence and in view of the importance and urgency of the matter and the serious concern of the Irish people, the Members of the Oireachtas and the Government about recent developments, I have thought it appropriate to make this statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Monday, 25 January, the British Attorney General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in the course of a statement in the House <Col N="601" /> of Commons in relation to the Stalker-Sampson report, announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland had concluded that the evidence did not warrant any further prosecutions in respect of shootings which occurred in Armagh on 11 November 1982 and 12 December 1982 and did not warrant any prosecutions in respect of either the fatal shooting of Michael Tighe or the wounding of Martin McCauley which occurred in Armagh on 24 November 1982.</P>
    <P>The British Attorney General also announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions had concluded that there was evidence of the commission of offences of perverting, or attempting or conspiring to pervert, the course of justice, or of obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty, and that this evidence was sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions were required in the public interest.  The Attorney General stated that he had taken steps to acquaint himself with all relevant circumstances, including matters concerning the public interest and, in particular, considerations of national security which he felt might properly affect the decision or not to institute proceedings. He said that he had informed the director fully with regard to his consultations as to the public interest, and in the light of all the facts and information brought to his notice, the director had concluded, with the Attorney General's full agreement, that it would not be proper to initiate any criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The language used by the British Attorney General was of an elaborate and complex construction but in essence amounted to a blunt admission that while prosecutions were warranted they were not going to be taken for reasons of national security.  It was also stated that the report would not be published.</P>
    <P>My Government immediately indicated that they were deeply dismayed by the decision of the British authorities not to proceed with prosecutions in respect of those matters which were the subject <Col N="602" /> of the inquiry initiated by Mr. Stalker and completed by Mr. Sampson concerning allegations of a &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy by the security forces in Northern Ireland in 1982 and allegations of a subsequent perversion of the course of justice.  The Government further stated that they would be seeking urgent clarification of the announcement by the British Attorney General and of those other matters addressed by the inquiry &mdash; specifically, questions relating to the management and structure of the RUC, to Constable Robinson's statement on an incursion on the night of 12 December 1982 and to the question of the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be further aware that on Tuesday, 26 January the Government decided that, because of the serious implications of the British Attorney General's statement for public confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and for cross-Border security co-operation, they would seek an immediate special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of clarifying the issues involved.  A meeting which had been arranged between officials and members of both the Garda and the RUC on policing matters was deferred in view of the call for a special meeting of the conference.  I can inform the House that the special meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference sought under Article 3 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will take place in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Let me say immediately that the Government were neither consulted nor informed under the procedures of the Agreement, or in any other manner, about any aspect of the statement made by Sir Patrick Mayhew to the House of Commons on Monday.  It is a point to which I will return.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline for the Dáil the sequence of events and the principal happenings in this long-drawn out affair. Allegations of a deliberate &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy on the part of the RUC first arose following the deaths of six people in three separate incidents in County Armagh in the period November-December 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> The three incidents concerned were as follows:</P>
    <P>(i) On 11 November, three men, Eugene Toman, Gervaise McKerr and Sean Burns, were shot dead by the RUC at a road block near Lurgan;</P>
    <P>(ii)  On 24 November, a 17 year old youth, Michael Tighe, was shot dead, and a companion, Martin McCauley, was injured, by the RUC in a hay shed near Lurgan; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  On 12 December, two men, Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll, were shot dead by the RUC on the outskirts of Armagh.</P>
    <P>The court trials which followed incidents lent credence to allegations of a deliberate &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy and a co-ordinated attempt by members of the RUC to cover this up:</P>
    <P>&mdash;During the trial of Constable John Robinson, charged with the murder of Seamus Grew, Constable Robinson stated that he and other members of the RUC had been involved in a &ldquo;cover up&rdquo; of the existence of a special anti-terrorist group in Northern Ireland and also of the fact that members of the RUC Special Branch had operated outside the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland.  An incursion by the Northern Ireland security forces on 12 December 1982 was subsequently admitted by the British Government. It was shown, furthermore, in the trial, that several of the shots which had killed Seamus Grew had been fired from a distance of only 30-36 inches.  It was also shown that Constable Robinson had emptied his weapon, reloaded and continued to fire.</P>
    <P>&mdash;During the trial of Martin McCauley (Michael Tighe's companion) who was charged with possession of arms in suspicious circumstances, it was revealed that RUC officers had lied in statements about the incident. The officers claimed that this <Col N="604" /> had been on the orders of senior RUC officers who wanted to conceal the part played in the operation by the Special Branch and by an informer.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The conduct of two of the trials (the Robinson trial and the trial of three RUC officers charged with the murder of Eugene Toman), was itself a source of concern on a number of counts.  Mr. Justice McDermott's decision to acquit Robinson was widely criticised, for example, on the grounds that Constable Robinson's decision to reload and continue to fire into the car at unarmed men did not appear to be consistent with the judgment of the Court that he was firing in self-defence.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Furthermore, Mr. Justice McDermott did not refer the evidence of a cover-up to the DPP.  A number of Mr. Justice McDermott's comments, notably his praise of Constable Robinson's marksmanship, were also a cause of deep concern. In the case arising from the murder of Eugene Toman, the late Lord Justice Gibson's acquittal of the three RUC defendants and his remarks on the occasion were also deeply disturbing.</P>
    <P>An investigation into the question of the appearance of a cover-up was instigated by the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions.  The results of this investigation, however, did not satisfy the DPP who exercised his statutory power to require full information with regard to the circumstances in which false or misleading evidence was provided by the RUC.  Consequently, on 24 May 1984, Deputy Chief Constable John Stalker of the Greater Manchester police was appointed by the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon, to the investigation. Mr. Stalker's initial inquiry took 15 months and in September 1985 he submitted an interim report to the RUC Chief Constable.  There have been persistent suggestions that this report was <Col N="605" /> highly critical of the RUC and that it recommended the prosecution of a number of RUC officers.  It was submitted by the Chief Constable to the DPP in February 1986, and the DPP requested additional information before deciding whether or not to press charges.</P>
    <P>Mr. Stalker was continuing his work on the inquiry when, on 29 May 1986, he was suspended on leave pending the investigation of certain charges against him.  Following his suspension as Deputy Chief Constable, he was removed from the RUC inquiry and Mr. Colin Sampson, the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire, who had been appointed to carry out the investigation into allegations of misconduct against Mr. Stalker, was asked by the Chief Constable of the RUC to take charge of the RUC investigation also.  Mr. Stalker was cleared of all charges of misconduct and was reinstated as Deputy Chief Constable in August 1986. He was not, however, returned to the RUC investigation.  On 19 December 1986, he announced his decision &mdash; for &ldquo;personal and family reasons&rdquo;&mdash; to take early retirement from the Manchester police force.  That is the background to this affair.</P>
    <P>There are four main elements which cause particular concern.  First, in the circumstances in which six people were killed and one injured in what have been called &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents in Armagh in 1982.  These incidents have been a cause of continuing deep anxiety to the Government, to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and to human rights organisations in these islands and elsewhere.  Second, is the question of a covert operation by the Northern Ireland security forces in this jurisdiction on 12 December 1982 which was revealed in court by Constable Robinson in 1984.  Third, is the falsification of evidence, instructions to commit perjury and other actions designed to pervert the course of justice which were alleged against the RUC in the aftermath of the &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents and which the British Attorney General has now confirmed there is evidence <Col N="606" /> to support.  Fourth, is the question of the response of the British authorities to the many questions raised by this whole affair.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of the most serious and grave concern to the Government:</P>
    <P>&mdash; that it has taken over five years to decide on the question of further prosecutions; that it has taken four years for the British authorities to reach a conclusion on the claims of perversion of the course of justice made by Constable Robinson under oath in 1984;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland failed to obtain the necessary co-operation from the RUC, and indeed was misled by the RUC, in regard to the &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents and the RUC investigation of them;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the subsequent formal police inquiry itself has taken almost four years, and is still not complete in that general recommendations of Mr. Sampson are being considered further by another senior police officer;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that the original leader of the inquiry, Deputy Chief Constable Stalker, was removed from the inquiry in circumstances which caused widespread unease;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that no action or statement of intention has yet been undertaken by the British Government in regard to the structures, organisation and management of the RUC arising from the Stalker-Sampson inquiry other than the decision to refer the recommendations in the report to a senior police officer, for further consideration;</P>
    <P>&mdash; that no prosecution has been taken in regard to the killing of Michael Tighe and the injuring of Martin McCauley on 24 November 1982; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; that after five years of consideration by the prosecuting authorities, by the Northern Ireland courts and again by the prosecuting authorities, no member of the security forces appears <Col N="607" /> to have been held to account for the alleged &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents or for the attempt to pervert the course of justice.</P>
    <P>This is a most extraordinary series of events which has done the gravest damage to confidence in the ability and intention of the authorities to uphold the rule of law and to administer justice fairly.</P>
    <P>In his statement in the House of Commons, the British Attorney General has indicated that it was, apparently, not in the public interest to prosecute for a perversion of the course of justice in the police investigation of the &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; incidents.  The Government are not aware of the basis for this decision.  Let me say that I recognise that the security forces in Northern Ireland are required to operate in a turbulent situation but this can never remove their solemn obligation always to uphold the law.  In our view it is most clearly in the public interest and in the interest of our Government who commit so much of their resources to security in this island that there should be confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and that there should be good relations between the community and the security forces.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is essential that there should be such confidence if we are to make progress towards the achievement of peace in Northern Ireland.  Public confidence in the administration of justice is a matter which cannot be divorced from the public interest.  In the Government's view, it should be possible for the British Government to provide a great deal more information than has so far been provided, by way of publication of the Stalker-Sampson report or otherwise, in order to answer the widespread unease which this affair has caused.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that the Intergovernmental Conference shall consider security policy in Article 7, relations between the security forces and the community in Article 7, issues of concern to both countries relating to the enforcement of the criminal law and the <Col N="608" /> importance of public confidence in the administration of justice, Article 8.  The Agreement also provides that with a view to enhancing cross-Border co-operation in security matters, the conference shall set in hand a programme of work to be undertaken by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief Constable of the RUC and, where appropriate, groups of officials.  Although it is clear that under the Agreement the Conference has no operational responsibilities, it is also clear from the provisions and practices established under the Agreement that consultation and the provision of information are the very least that should be expected of both Governments under the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The British Attorney General has stated to the House of Commons that he has taken steps to acquaint himself with all relevant circumstances in the matter of the Stalker-Sampson report, including matters concerning the public interest and in particular considerations of national security which might have properly affected the decision whether or not to institute proceedings.  It will be part of the purpose of the Government at the forthcoming special Intergovernmental Conference to establish what was the basis of the Attorney General's consideration of the public interest.  At this point I can only say that at no stage did the British Government seek the views of the Irish Government on any of the issues dealt with in the agreement which it seems to us should have been taken into account in any consideration of the public interest.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that the Government have attached the greatest importance to the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and have kept constantly in touch with developments.  As the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has told the House on three occasions, in his Estimates statement on 28 May, 1987, in response to a parliamentary question on 16 June, 1987 and in response to a further parliamentary question on 4 November 1987, the Government have been concerned about the whole range of issues <Col N="609" /> surrounding the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and believed that it was essential from all points of view that the matter be cleared up and the necessary follow-up action taken, as quickly as possible.  The Tánaiste indicated to the Dáil that he has been using the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to convey his concerns on this matter to the British Government.  The British Government have been left in no doubt through repeated references and inquiries at the Conference, in the Secretariat and through other means, right up to the present, of the Government's great concern and interest and of our wish to be informed.</P>
    <P>It must be clear to any reasonable observer that the only persons likely to benefit from what has now happened are the paramilitaries.  I would have thought that a decision to prosecute would be in the best interests of the RUC and that they would have welcomed action by the British authorities to uphold the principle that in a democratic society the use of lethal force by the police must be the very last resort; that perjury, misleading statements to the authorities and other actions designed to pervert the course of justice should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I believe it is clear also that the British Attorney General's statement and any other decisions which may be taken on foot of the Stalker-Sampson report have serious implications for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and the relations between the security forces and the community.  A further improvement in those relations which might have been hoped for will be seriously affected by these recent events. We have also indicated in our public statement our concern that it may have serious implications for cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>Co-operation and cross-Border security had been steadily developed in the face of the continued campaign of violence and attempts to import large quantities of arms for subversive use.  But such security co-operation can only be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust between the two police forces on the basis <Col N="610" /> that the two Governments are firmly committed to political progress by peaceful constitutional means.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference exists as a forum in which Northern Ireland issues of mutual concern to the two Governments can be dealt with.  The Government will at the forthcoming special meeting of that Conference put forward their views on the serious crux which has arisen.  They will emphasise the importance of confidence in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and will seek an appropriate course of action by means of which the deep and widespread doubts and anxieties which have been aroused by the British Attorney General's statement can be removed.  Matters cannot be left as they are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already put on public record my views on the issues arising here.  I intend to repeat them for the House and to add some further considerations this afternoon.  Nothing that has been said and nothing that has happened since the British Attorney General's statement last Monday throws any further light on this extraordinary affair. The United Kingdom Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is making a statement at around this time and I have just been informed that he has said that while there will not be prosecutions, there will be disciplinary action within the RUC. To my mind that does not respond to the concerns that have been expressed in this House and elsewhere, nor does it respond in any way to the concerns that are properly ours in view of the history of this whole affair.</P>

    <P>The three specific incidents in November and December of 1982 which gave rise to the allegation that there was a &ldquo;shoot-to-kill&rdquo; policy in operation by the RUC were very much a part of the situation which inspired the concern which underlies Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreementaly are indeed, paragraph 8 of the joint communiqué that was issued after the signing of the agreement at Hillsborough in November of 1985.  Since the agreement was signed, the Governments <Col N="611" /> in London and here have frequently reiterated their commitment to it and their determination to move as energetically and as rapidly as possible along the path it maps out.  I think we must accept and recognise that a good deal of progress has been made, although each Government have at different times expressed a wish that progress in one area or another were greater.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning of the process initiated by the Anglo-Irish Conference, it was made clear beyond any possibility of misunderstanding that the three incidents in question, the underlying concern about the existence then of a &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policy and the investigation being carried out by Mr. Stalker were matters of the highest concern for the Government in Dublin and for the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  This concern was expressed repeatedly at conference meetings and during the course of ongoing contacts and relations between the two Governments and between the administrations.  I can say without the slightest exaggeration and without any fear of contradiction that up to the beginning of March 1987 there could be no doubt whatever as to the position of the Irish Government on the matter.  The Taoiseach in the course of his remarks this afternoon has spoken about the subsequent period and we must take the Taoiseach's remarks as they are set before us.</P>
    <P>One question I would ask and one which has not yet been answered is, if it is the case, why was it decided last July to take the question of the Stalker-Sampson report off the agenda of the Anglo-Irish Conference and to pursue it bilaterally between the two Governments?  That is reported to be the case; if it is not the case, I should be happy to be assured of that.  It was clear from the beginning of that process that the Government here wanted the whole affair to be thoroughly and properly investigated, with whatever consequences might result from it.  Our concern was to ensure, in accordance with the terms of Article 7 of the Agreement, <Col N="612" /> an improvement in relations between the security forces in Northern Ireland and the community, with the object, in particular, of making the security forces more readily accepted by the Nationalist community.  We put a great deal of thought and effort into that and, indeed, ran a certain political risk in so doing.  I have no doubt but that that was the correct course of action to adopt and it is widely agreed and perceived that progress was made.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that, the statement by the UK Attorney General last Monday can only be described as astounding, particularly in view of the fact that certainly up to March of 1987 there was a very clear anxiety expressed from the British side that the matter be thoroughly investigated and that the appropriate conclusions be drawn.  It is true that the replacement of Mr. Stalker by Mr. Sampson has never been satisfactorily explained although we may see some of the explanation of that in the near future.  Notwithstanding all that, there did appear to be an anxiety on the UK side that the inquiry be pursued and concluded.  The statement made last Monday by the UK Attorney General, as indeed I pointed out earlier in the week and as the Taoiseach has pointed out this afternoon, is in many ways a fairly transparent code.  He says &mdash; and I am quoting from the statement:</P>
    <P>The Director has however concluded that there is evidence of the commission of offences of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert, the course of justice or of obstructing a Constable in the execution of his duty and that this evidence is sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions are required in the public interest; and he has consulted me accordingly.</P>
    <P>I have therefore taken steps to acquaint myself with all relevant circumstances, including matters concerning the public interest and in particular considerations of national security which might properly affect the decision whether or not to institute <Col N="613" /> proceedings.  I have informed the Director fully with regard to my consultations as to the public interest, and in the light of all the facts and information brought to his notice the Director has concluded, with my full agreement, that it would not be proper to initiate any criminal proceedings. He has given directions accordingly.</P>
    <P>That to me, when rendered into English, means that were it not for these unspecified considerations of the public interest and national security there would be prosecutions.  That is the only way that statement can be read and that is the issue that must now be answered by the British Government.</P>
    <P>That statement is all the more difficult to accept because, as I pointed out earlier this week, by late 1986 we had reason to believe, from high political British sources, that a number of senior RUC officers would be charged.  Taking that together with the only possible clear reading of the Attorney General's statement I am forced to the conclusion, as I have said, that had it not been for these unspecified considerations of public interest and national security, prosecutions would have taken place.  That is where we must have the greatest concern.  I do not accept, nor I think should we in this House accept, that considerations of that kind can be brought forward to justify a failure or a refusal to bring prosecutions where the law has been broken.  We cannot accept that considerations of that kind in our time can be used to justify police conduct that is outside the law or to shelter the operations of a police force, wherever it may be, from the full provisions of the law.  Surely one of the things that we must all want to bring about in Northern Ireland just as everywhere else, but especially in Northern Ireland, is a respect for the rule of law, a respect for the rule of law that requires the same level of integrity from everybody in the community.  That is one of the central issues that now faces us in this affair.</P>
    <P>This development &mdash; if that is the right word for it &mdash; this extraordinary affair, is all the more to be deplored in the light <Col N="614" /> of the fact that as a result of the work that was done in the Anglo-Irish Conference and of a good deal of effort deployed by the British authorities, by the authorities in Northern Ireland and by ourselves, there has been objectively a change for the better in the relations between the RUC and large sections of the population in Northern Ireland.  I think it only right to say that a good deal of the effort and the moral capital involved in that process was invested by the members of the RUC itself.  This statement by the British Attorney General runs a grave risk of setting that at nought and perhaps indeed of going back to an even more difficult situation than had existed in 1982, 1984 or 1985.</P>
    <P>The question we must now face is what can be done from here.  I am glad to note that the Government have reacted strongly and that arrangements have been made to bring forward the date of the next Anglo-Irish Conference.  The Government must now insist on having sight of all parts of the report in question, the Stalker-Sampson report, and must insist on having a briefing as to the full meaning of the findings of that report.  In the normal course of events one would press for the publication of a report of this kind but perhaps that is not appropriate in this case.  If the report indicates that proceedings should be taken against particular members of the RUC then of course it would be inappropriate to publish the report in advance of those proceedings. That is a matter that the Government will have to judge when they have sight and knowledge of the full contents of the report.  The Government must insist that they have sight of the report, that they have full information of the findings and that members of the Government be fully briefed as to what all the implications of the report are.  That will be a very material consideration as to how we go about the future management of the process set out in the Anglo-Irish only are need paragraph.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves that since the agreement was signed two different Governments here and two different Governments in London have repeatedly <Col N="615" /> reaffirmed their commitment to the process set out in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The full resolution of this Stalker-Sampson affair must be part of the process of that agreement and the agreement must be used in order to bring this to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite very strong feelings and an understandable sense of outrage on the part of all who are concerned with the operation of the rule of law, it is important that the Dáil approaches consideration of the British Government's decision in relation to the Stalker-Sampson inquiry in a calm and reflective manner.  In particular it is vital that the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which is the most important step forward in Anglo-Irish relarions, should not become a causalty of an intensive flurry of recrimination between both Governments, however strong and justifiable those feelings of outrage are in Ireland. This is all the more vital given the undoubted desire of people in many quarters to see the Anglo-Irish Agreement killed off or at least to see it wither away.</P>
      <P>The most alarming implication of the Stalker-Sampson inquiry is that it leaves in place within the RUC force in the North a cadre of police officers who are known to have perverted the course of justice and to have organised perjury and misinformation on a massive scale to that end.  That is totally unacceptable and the continuance of such a group within any police force can only act as a major blight on the overall reputation of that force. Mere disciplinary action, of the kind that we now hear is going to be taken internally within the RUC, in a situation such as this is completely inadequate in face of an organised effort to subvert the administration of justice generally, as was the case in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still deep uncertainty as to the extent of the responsibility for this particular conspiracy within the RUC.  It is a matter of concern that it has not yet been fully determined how far up in the ranks of the RUC that conspiracy spreads or whether indeed it reaches beyond that <Col N="616" /> police force into the administration in Northern Ireland.  Given the seriousness of the implications for the reputaion of any police force faced with this depressing reality, how much more devastating are those implications for a police force like the RUC faced with the difficult task of policing a deeply divided community in which much of one sector has yet to be weaned from a deep-seated hostility and an understandable lack of confidence in the overall impartiality of the police.  It is also important to take a deeper look at the articular explanation given on behalf of the British Government by their Attorney General, Seir Partick Mayhew, in the House of Commons on Monday last as to the British Government's desire to suppress the Stalker-Sampson report and pursue no further the matter of investigating RUC wrong-doing in the matter of a possible shoot-to-kill policy in 1982.</P>
    <P>It is not unknown for countries to hide behind the cloak of national security as a reason for not investigating completely events which are embarrassing and controversial either in domestic or international politics.  In such circumstances it is normally the case that there is little that any other sovereign nation can do where such matters arise.  That is most certainly not the case in this instance precisely because of the existence of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  That agreement is a solemn international treaty and gives the Irish Government a formal right, under Articles 7 and 8, as quoted by the Taoiseach, to consider jointly with the British Government matters such as &mdash; and here I quote Article 7 (a) (ii):</P>
    <P>relations between the security forces and the community.</P>
    <P>Article 7 (c) states:</P>
    <P>The two Governments agree that there is a need for a programme of special measures in Northern Ireland to improve relations between the security forces and the community, with the object in particular of making the security forces more readily accepted by the nationalist community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> Those two provisions alone highlight the right and indeed the duty of the Irish Government, on behalf of the Irish people, to have the British decision relating to the Stalker-Sampson inquiry fully investigated.  It seems to me that they also establish the right of the Irish Government to be consulted about these matters.  Therefore, I am disturbed to hear from the Taoiseach this afternoon that there was no consultation of any kind with the Government on this matter before this decision was announced. There is nothing that could be more central to making the security forces in the North more acceptable to the Nationalist community than the tackling of an issue like this.  Sadly, it flies totally in the face of that commitment.</P>
    <P>I also believe that it is in the vital interests of the RUC themselves that the issues underpinning the Stalker-Sampson inquiry are more fairly and comprehensively dealt with than they were in the rather insensitive British Government response of Monday last.  That police force in Northern Ireland has suffered terrible tragedies over the past 20 years.  To their great credit, particularly since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed in 1985, they have made considerable efforts, often at great sacrifice to individual members of the force, to improve their standing with the Nationalist community and to convince all right-thinking people that they are committed to the impartial and even-handed application of the law in Northern Ireland. Therefore, the entire force becomes tainted by the unresolved issues raised, tainted indelibly by the unresolved issues raised in the Stalker-Sampson inquiry. The continued presence of a group of officers within that force under such circumstances as those admitted by the British Government can only damage the reputation of the RUC.</P>
    <P>The whole affair cannot be left to rest in the state of limbo accorded it by the British Attorney General on Monday last.  It is absolutely misguided to believe that brushing the matter of a police conspiracy to pervert the course of justice under the carpet can do anything but <Col N="618" /> severely impede the improvement of community relations within Northern Ireland.  It makes more difficult the further development of Anglo-Irish relations on a civilised basis, based on mutual respect for the rights and sensitivities of both people and of both Governments.  That is why the Irish Government must press very strongly at the forthcoming Anglo-Irish Conference to have the Stalker-Sampson report and its implications resolved in a satisfactory manner.  We cannot keep quiet simply because of the superior interest of maintaining the Anglo-Irish Agreement which is, of course, of such vital importance in the view of the Progressive Democrats and other parties in this State.</P>
    <P>I would end with an appeal to British public opinion also.  Already three of the leading papers in Britain are critical of what has been done by their Government. People in Britain are rightly and justifiably angered and concerned at unlawful police tactics whether in South Africa or Israel.  They share the genuine concern of other democratic nations to denounce security force cover-ups and conspiracies to overthrow the rule of law. But the British public must also realise that the Stalker-Sampson inquiry and their Government's response to it belongs to the same category.  It is ironic but, I believe, true that there would be much more concern and outrage in Britain if the kind of decision announced in Westminster this week had emerged from Pretoria.</P>
    <P>There was one point only in what the Taoiseach said on which I would specifically like to make an observation because I agree with virtually everything he did say.  That is when he said:</P>
    <P>We have also indicated in our public statement our concern that it may have serious implications for cross-Border security co-operation.</P>
    <P>It can have if people want it to have.  My suggestion is that perhaps it should not have.  I can understand why there was a postponement this week of a meeting between the head of the Garda Síochána and the head of the RUC but they and <Col N="619" /> their various officers should continue to meet on a professional police basis.  The necessary security co-operation on this island should not be affected by how the political winds blow, whether warm or cool, at any particular time.  All of us on this island have a common interest in overcoming the challenge to democracy, and indeed often to our very lives, posed by these gunmen.  These two police forces, whatever problems may arise from time to time, are those who stand in the front line on our behalf.  Certainly, at a professional level, they should continue their co-operation in the closest way in all our interests, and not allow these unfortunate and very important affairs&mdash; which naturally concern us all&mdash;to affect their professional activity.</P>
    <P>So far as the publication of the report is concerned&mdash;which the Taoiseach suggested might now take place&mdash;it is only right to point out that on 4 November last and earlier, on 16 June, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said here, in reply to parlimentary questions that it is his understanding that police reports of this kind are not normally published.  That may have been the case at the time but the circumstances perhaps are somewhat different now.  If it is found not possible to publish this report to the public at large, it does seem to me to be a document that should be submitted to the Anglo-Irish Conference.  It certainly would be within the spirit of the Anglo-Irish Agreement if that were done.  It is something that the Government should press in the context of the conference and at least seek publication there if not full publication to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would lodge a brief protest in relation to the manner in which we are conducting this business.  The motivation for this discussion, so far as I can tell, was the Special Notice Question I put down to the Taoiseach the day before yesterday. I am satisfied that that would have been an infinitely better way to deal with this issue.  I did not raise this on the Order of Business yesterday because of the <Col N="620" /> urgency of the budget, but I believe it would have been a better way; we would have got information from the Government and an opportunity of teasing out the attitude of the Taoiseach and the Government, and there would have been an opportunity for the Taoiseach to respond to points made from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The procedure being followed, for those reasons, is entirely unsatisfactory. We are not here simply to let off steam. As Members of this House, we are entitled to seek and to demand answers to questions.  And we are entitled to put propositions before the House on issues of major concern, and to seek Government action where that is necessary.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued on Monday last on this subject, I said:</P>
      <P>The situation which is now developing in Anglo-Irish relations is perhaps the most serious since the early seventies. It is rapidly reaching a point where it transcends the ordinary Anglo-Irish process.  The apparent willingness of the British Government to sanction the perversion of justice displays an arrogance which is unworthy of any democratic state, and which must raise concern in Britain itself as well as here.  It will, unfortunately, be seen by many as a sign of the increasing authoritarianism of the British establishment.</P>
      <P>I believe there is now a need for this country to declare that as a sovereign equal State we refuse to be treated in this way.  Far from seeking meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference, we should give serious consideration to refusing to meet, at this or any other level, until the British Government understands that this country has a right to be treated as an equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we regard this incident as yet another example of British insensitivity, of the kind with which we have become familiar, we would be making a very serious mistake.  The more one examines the facts surrounding and behind the case, the more one has to become convinced <Col N="621" /> that this incident may mark a turning point in our relations with Britain.</P>
    <P>Let us consider some of the salient facts.  A number of men have been killed, shot in cold blood.  These men have been described as &ldquo;suspected terrorists&rdquo;&mdash;not terrorists, but suspected terrorists.  No inquest has ever taken place into any of these deaths.  No individual has been held to account for these deaths.  Two trials have taken place.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions in the North, after an examination of the facts that emerged at these trials, came to the conclusion that lies had been told. So, clearly, did other authorities, and the result was the appointment of Mr. Stalker to investigate the whole unsavoury and vicious mess.</P>
    <P>Of course we know now that just as Mr. Stalker appeared to be on the point of finalising his investigation, he was removed, and subjected to a witch-hunt on what turned out to be totally spurious grounds.  Nevertheless, the investigation was completed, and the results presented to the same Director of Public Prosecutions who had decided some years earlier that he was being told lies.  It is clear that left to his own devices he would have initiated prosecutions.  He had a case, and was evidently willing to pursue it.</P>
    <P>He was prevented from doing so as a result of a political decision.  The British Attorney General apparently decided that the national interest was not compatible in this instance with the pursuit of one of the most fundamental principles of English law &mdash; namely the principle that justice must be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>There have been many murky and sinister elements in this case.  The Freemasons have been mentioned; M15 and M16 have both been implicated; there has been mention of missing tape-recordings.</P>
    <P>But no element of the case is more sinister than this latest development.  The first question I have to ask here is why was the whole business allowed to drag on so long if the findings were not going to be compatible with the national interest?  It is impossible to avoid the <Col N="622" /> conclusion that somebody in authority, either in Britain or in the North, was content to let the investigation continue only as long as it failed to establish the truth.  Once it began to appear as if the truth would emerge, that person or persons in authority took a different view.</P>
    <P>What is the truth that they are so afraid of.  If the result of this investigation clearly showed that there was no shoot-to-kill policy, the details would be splashed over every newspaper in this country and in the UK.  Every reputable journalist working in this country knows that there is no body more adept at leaking information that is in their interest than the security forces operating in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if the investigation had established that a shoot-to-kill policy was being operated at their own initiative by a small number of maverick policemen, with no authority from above, I have no doubt that this information would have been made public.</P>
    <P>In short, if the result of the investigation had exonerated everyone in authority, and if there was no danger of any dark secret being revealed in court, I do not believe that the view would have been taken that prosecution was incompatible with the national interest.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, the only conclusion possible is that the Stalker-Sampson investigation did reveal two main things.  First, it must have revealed that there was in fact a shoot-to-kill policy. Second, it must have revealed that that policy had the clear sanction of someone in authority.</P>
    <P>And that process of reasoning leads inevitably to one final conclusion.  The reason for suppressing the report, and for not proceeding with prosecutions, is to protect the identity of those in authority who sanctioned this policy.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know &mdash; and the British people are entitled to know &mdash; who sanctioned such a policy.  Where would this have stopped if the report had been published?  Would the finger of suspicion have led to the Chief Constable of the RUC or to the Secretary of State <Col N="623" /> for Northern Ireland or into Downing Street itself?</P>
    <P>The other thing we are entitled to know is what steps our Government are to take in relation to this whole issue.  We have heard within the last few days that an urgent meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference is being sought to get clarification of the issues involved.  We need to ask if this is really the appropriate way to proceed.  And we need to think carefully about the answer.  If the meeting will proceed as we now are led to believe, I would ask the Taoiseach to insist that the British Attorney General be at that meeting to explain in detail the reasoning behind his decision to the Irish Attorney General.  If there are to be further reports or investigations, could we not insist that they would report to the conference rather than reporting individually to the British Government?  Perhaps this is a line which the Taoiseach and his Ministers could pursue.</P>
    <P>Suppose, for the sake of argument, the shoe was on the other foot.  Suppose the British authorities had reason to believe that we were suppressing information of vital interest to them.  Suppose they believed that we were refusing to proceed with prosecutions in which they were vitally interested.  Is it likely that their response would be the relatively mild one of seeking a meeting to clarify the issues involved?  I think not.</P>
    <P>We have a reasonably recent example of similar circumstances that I believe we should look at.  When the <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> outrage was committed by French Secret Service agents in New Zealand, the Prime Minister of that country did not mince his words.  In the court of world opinion, he made it clear that he was holding the French Government directly responsible.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that that is precisely the approach that the British Prime Minister would take if she were the aggrieved party in this case.  I would therefore argue that it is time we put our foot down.  Far from seeking meetings with the British authorities, we should be <Col N="624" /> giving serious consideration to what steps we can take to embarrass and shame the British Government.</P>
    <P>What we cannot forget, or allow them to forget, is the fundamental principle that has been tainted by the actions of the British Government.  The rule of law can only survive for as long as justice is seen to be done.  That is a fundamental tenet of democracy which the British gave to the world.  We should not let them forget it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the British Government not to publish the report and not to initiate proceedings is both inexcusable and inexplicable.  An acceptable police force in which the majority of the public can have confidence is an essential prerequisite for political progress in Northern Ireland. This decision by the British Government has done much to undermine the considerable progress that had been made in recent years towards achieving an acceptable police force.  It is worth remembering that the major objective of the civil rights campaign people who took to the streets just 20 years ago in Northern Ireland was to secure reform and the disarming of the RUC.  These demands were in fact largely conceded by the British Government in 1969 but the progress made was literally blown away by the Provisionals when they launched their campaign of violence in the early seventies.</P>
      <P>The RUC have had a chequered career since then.  There were certain events in the seventies in which their conduct was totally unacceptable.  There is little doubt that in recent years significant progress was made in reforming the RUC.  In the past couple of years especially, it had become increasingly accepted by the majority of people across the sectarian divide, that more and more people in Nationalist areas were seeing them as a normal police force and were prepared to call them in to deal with normal petty crimes &mdash; housebreaking, car stealing and so on &mdash; which have become such an unfortunate feature of urban life both North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of our constant campaign for <Col N="625" /> a bill of rights in Northern Ireland, The Workers' Party have always called for the reform of the RUC, in particular for an independent complaints procedure and for civilian control.</P>
    <P>The killing of six people by the RUC in dubious circumstances within a period of a few weeks in 1982 quite rightly shocked many people in Britain and Ireland.  The decision to hold a full inquiry into the 1982 shootings was a welcome development but unfortunately the handling of it since then has been a disaster, and the only people to benefit are the paramilitary groups.</P>
    <P>Circumstances in which the Deputy Chief Constable of Manchester, Mr. John Stalker, was removed from the investigations was a grave cause for concern, but the decision not to publish the findings of the inquiry or to take action against those involved was a blunder of enormous proportions which will undermine the efforts of those many people who are involved in the difficult task of building democracy and civil rights and defeating terrorism in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Britain's Attorney General in his statement to the House of Commons said quite clearly that there were grounds for proceeding against persons alleged to have conspired to pervert the course of justice.  The decision not to do so on the grounds of security is quite unacceptable and simply illustrates the deplorable double standards that have become the hallmark of the Thatcher Administration. Mrs. Thatcher's obsession with protecting her security forces is legendary, but on this occasion she has shown an unprecedented contempt for legality.  One must suspect that the real reason for her wanting to put the lid on this affair was that publication of the report would, as the Belfast <i>Newsletter</i> put it in its editorial yesterday, point to a trail leading to Downing Street.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the inquiry.  People in the Republic have suffered, and will continue to suffer, from the spillover of the campaign of violence in Northern Ireland.  We have a vested interest in peace in Northern Ireland. <Col N="626" /> Anything that will make the establishment of peace and democracy there more difficult must be of concern to us. There is no doubt that the decision of the Thatcher Government on this matter will have that effect.  Our national interests are also affected here.  It is in our national interest to ensure that the Stalker-Sampson report is published and that those guilty of offences, no matter how high a position they hold in the RUC or the British Administration, are prosecuted and dealt with in the normal way. The Irish Government must exert all possible pressure on the Thatcher Administration to reverse their decision, and they will have our full support.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that nothing is done to worsen the already difficult situation in Northern Ireland or in any way to give aid or comfort to the Provisionals.  While the RUC have quite correctly been criticised for their shoot-to-kill policy in 1982, the Provisionals have been pursuing a far more vicious and deadly shoot-to-kill policy for the past 20 years and have been responsible for the vast majority of the 2,500 deaths there.  They claimed their latest murder victim only last week, Constable Colin Gilmore a young man who left a widow and a baby.</P>
    <P>The State and all its institutions must be bound by the rule of law.  To depart from that principle is not only to demean the State and its servants, but it is to place the State on the same plane as the terrorists.  Unfortunately statements are made by some politicians in the North and Britain which carry the message that it is regrettable that the security forces and the police service are bound by the rule of law.  This would be a negation of civil rights and democracy and the hallmark of a totalitarian state.  Human rights and civil liberties must be upheld whatever one's religion or nationality.</P>
    <P>In the last few months of 1987 the terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland, and particularly the Provisional IRA, were more isolated and demoralised than at any time.  The vast majority of people North and South demonstrated their abhorrence of terrorism in the aftermath <Col N="627" /> of the Enniskillen Remembrance Day massacre.  This development, together with the devastating news I have just received from the Old Bailey in London &mdash;&ldquo;All Birmingham Six case convictions upheld.  All appeals thrown out&rdquo;, &mdash; have thrown a lifeline to the Provisionals.  Mrs. Thatcher, who rejoiced at the sinking of the <i>Belgrano</i> cannot be expected to have much regard either for Irish lives or for Irish liberty.</P>

In terms of the national Parliament this might be considered a parochial issue, but it is very near and dear to the hearts of the people in my constituency, particularly in the Prosperous area.</P>
      <P>This matter has been ongoing for a considerable time, almost ten years.  Two schools side by side, both VEC type schools, one in Clane and the other in Prosperous, require urgent extension and the provision of extra facilities. Agreement was reached with regard to the step by step process which should be followed in regard to the extension to the Prosperous school.  While the Clane school was allowed to go ahead, some minor alterations had to be made to the design, etc, which caused delays in the preparations of the plan for the Prosperous school.  It was always agreed that both schools should proceed simultaneously and that the catchment area should also be provided for.</P>

    <P>However, the Clane school was completed in 1983 and is providing a very good service, but the Prosperous school is essentially in the same condition as it was then.  The parents, teachers and students are obviously getting very impatient with the delays in providing extra facilities.  I visited the school on a number of occasions, as did a number of politicians in the constituency and we <Col N="628" /> were all horrified that students are in prefabricated accommodation which does not have sanitary facilities.  This is obviously very unhealthy and parents are extremely concerned about the health of their children.</P>
    <P>I know quite well that there are financial constraints within which the Minister must operate and that applies to all Governments.  Nonetheless, this school, its parents, children and teachers have a long standing problem which, as has been agreed in principle, must be dealt with. I am sure that the Minister has in her Department repeated representations numbering well into the thousands from the various interest groups and politicians in County Kildare regarding this matter.</P>
    <P>In more recent times, the situation has become particularly worrying in the sense that the Eastern Health Board reported on conditions there on 3 November 1987. Kildare Vocational Education Committee were informed of the result.</P>
    <P>The report stated:</P>
    <P>There are approximately 260 pupils attending the above school which consists of one school building and a number of prefab units.  The main school building consists of 9 classrooms, general office, headmaster's office and male and female sanitary accommodation.  This building is in satisfactory condition.  However, hot water and soap are not provided at either the boys or girls sanitary accommodation. One towel is provided at the boys and girls toilets.  This towel is only changed on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>Prefab accommodation consists of one triple prefab unit, 2 double prefab units, 4 single prefab units, one of which contains sanitary accommodation... the triple prefab unit is 2 years old, the remaining prefab units are 1970, are generally in a dilapidated state, with evidence of holed floors, broken window frames, rodent infestation. These units are unsuitable for use as classrooms and should be replaced without delay.  All sanitary accommodation should be provided <Col N="629" /> with running hot and cold water, soap and suitable means of drying...</P>
    <P>There has been countless parliamentary questions, letters and acknowledgments, for which I am very grateful, but no final and fruitful reply.  I hope to get the final and fruitful reply this evening which we so earnestly desire.</P>
    <P>There is also another problem which needs to be borne in mind.  When, as is the case here, two schools are developing side by side in adjoining catchment areas, where one school is newly equipped, well developed with all modern facilities and the other, although a good school, has none of these things, the logical progression is that one school will die.  The fear is locally that the school in Prosperous, by virtue of failure to take action in relation to the extra accommodation, will literally die.  Long before that happens, the morale of the teachers and students will be affected to such an extent that parents will not want to send their children there because, apart from the health reasons and the hazards of having their sons and daughters in unfit and unsanitary accommodation the morale of the staff will degenerate to such an extent that it would not be wise to send children to such a school.  I am not saying it will happen in this case but that is the logical progression of what happens in these situations.</P>
    <P>Maybe, in the light of yesterday's announcement, the Minister might have at her disposal a little more latitude whereby it might be possible for her to proceed with this project which runs to about £1.3 million.</P>

      <P>In all fairness, given the background to this case and the situation in regard to the patience shown by the parents and the teachers, but more especially and importantly the very poor standard of the accommodation that the children, parents and teachers have to put up with, a special effort should be <Col N="630" /> made to do something about this school in the very near future.  If this is not done the scenario will develop as I have outlined which would be extremely unfortunate for an area that has given a very high standard of VEC education to a rural area over a long number of years. If anything should happen to interfere with that, by way of further delay in regard to the provision of the facilities required, I am afraid that all politicians will have to take the blame.</P>

      <P>Well, I should have said indications.  I would not like to pre-empt anything which the Minister might say but I am trying to encourage her to go down the road in a positive fashion and to make a response to this issue.</P>
      <P>I also wish to quote from a letter from the Eastern Health Board to the outgoing chief executive officer of Kildare Vocational Office which was attached to the letter from which I previously quoted. It states:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Cummins,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attached is the environmental Health Officers report on Prosperous Vocational School.  The pre-fab structures are now totally unsuitable for use as classrooms; their continuing use is likely to have an adverse effect on the health of both pupils and staff.  This temporary accommodation needs to be urgently replaced by a proper extension <Col N="631" /> to the main building &mdash; an extension providing adequate and proper classroom facilities and adequate toilet accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is probably the strongest language I have yet seen coming from one statutory body to another &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; in the sense that the health board are obviously concerned about the health of the students attending that school and about the staff.  Having said all that, I am fully aware of the fact that the Minister has read the file on this case and must know the degree of feeling there is in relation to the matter locally.  I know there are other compelling areas of responsibility and issues on which the Minister will be called upon to provide money but she has an opportunity at this time of the year to give some indication as to what is likely to happen in Prosperous.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity at this time of the year to give some indication as to what is likely to happen in the Prosperous case.  In fairness to the parents and to the teachers it behoves us all to tackle that problem and face it now and let the parents know that something is going to be done about it either next month, or in the next six months or at some time in the reasonably near future.  We need to identify the time involved.  I will quote from a letter written by the chairperson of the parents association on 3 July 1987. It states as follows:</P>
    <P>For almost a decade we have waited with the utmost patience for the extension to our school to materialise and no one felt offended so now we feel that no one can take offence if we show our impatience.</P>
    <P>We have watched and waited while stages normally taking weeks took months, some stages, took almost a year and still we have no building.  Successive Ministers wrote to us as far, back as 1981 promising to build our school on a &ldquo;step by step, brick by brick&rdquo; basis with the Community School in Clane.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> That is the school I referred to earlier:</P>
    <P>That building was completed in '83 &mdash; ours has not started.  We have had promises from all concerned that our school would not be allowed to suffer because of the delay but since a large and important part of the school is its pupils, our children, at least that part has been allowed to suffer &mdash; cold, wet, dismal surroundings, lack of necessary equipment, now standard in all new schools, are just a few of the problems and we call for an end to such unfair treatment of our children.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to deal with a recent meeting which took place.  I know that that is true because I have seen the replies from the Minister and from previous Ministers.</P>

The Deputy said he did not wish me to refer to it but I cannot possibly be like a fairy godmother who comes at the end of four years of inactivity on this particular project and then produce the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It may suit the Deputy to forget what happened in the four years from 1983 to 1987 but I would like to point out that very little happened with regard to Prosperous school.  There were various stages of planning but as the chairperson of the parents' committee said, each stage of planning which should have taken weeks took months.  That is pointed out in the letter which the Deputy read out so movingly here this afternoon. With regard to Prosperous vocational school the Deputy is aware that as part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we decided to cut back on capital projects.  The second level capital projects provision, were it all to be realised, would mean an expenditure of £325 million, that is if one were to spend the money on all the stages of second-level projects which are at various stages of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter in context Deputy <Col N="634" /> Durkan mentioned that the Minister for Finance yesterday announced a small increase in the capital allocation which would mean approximately £2.5 million for second-level schools and Prosperous accounts for one half of that.  There are over 400 such schools throughout the country of which about 40 to 50 would be in very bad circumstances.  I am putting the matter in context because the Deputy is one of about 166 people who think that £2.6 million will go all over the country. I appreciate very much the serious situation regarding Prosperous and anything I have said heretofore does not take from it.  I have read the file.  I have read particular letters from the parents.  I was not available one day to meet a deputation which came here but I had arrangements made that they were met, their literature was received and their case was heard very clearly.  I am aware that there is a need for a new school in Prosperous. The Deputy has told me of the condition of the present prefabs.  I am aware that over the years from 1981 to 1983 and through to 1987 and 1988 they have deteriorated as is the way of prefabs.  The Deputy is aware that the estimated cost of designing, building, furnishing and equipping will be £1.3 million.  The school envisages nine general classrooms, a drawingroom, science and laboratory room, metalwork room, library, physical education room and ancillary accommodation. The project has now reached the stage where the preliminary tender report has been received and has been examined in my Department.  The next step would be, in the normal course of events, the final tender report.  There are other projects in a similar position.</P>
    <P>The small bonus which we got yesterday would build two very modest schools throughout the country out of a total of more than 400.  I should like to say to Deputy Durkan and to Deputy Power, who is chairperson of Kildare VEC, and my other colleague, Deputy McCreevy that they have made Trojan efforts in bringing this school to my attention since I came to office.  I intend to keep in touch with the Deputy and with my other two colleagues as the case <Col N="635" /> develops.  I am not in a position to say anything more at present.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputy has on the tenth occasion managed, as he said this morning, to raise the matter in the Dáil.  I, for <Col N="636" /> my part, undertake to keep in touch with the Deputy regarding developments.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 February 1988.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 18 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>The general consensus reached by the interdepartmental committee which was set up in 1977 to examine and assess possible uses for Bord na Móna's cutaway bogs and which concluded its work in 1986 was that forestry was the optimum solution for up to 60 per cent of the lands in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a statement issued by my colleague, the Minister of State for Forestry on 25 September 1987, it was pointed out that with a view to ensuring an expanding programme of forestry development, the Government have decided that the Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which are suitable for forestry will be transferred to the Forestry Service of the Department of Energy.  This decision applied to the cutaway lands which are at present available for planting and also to those areas which will become available in the future as Bord na Móna bogs are exhausted for turf production purposes.  It was also indicated that in their consideration of this matter, the Government were conscious of the fact that the peat potential of these bogs is a wasting asset and that this has serious employment implications for the midlands and other areas in which Bord <Col N="569" /> na Móna operates.  The Government decision will ensure that replacement employment in forestry activities will now become available as peat production in the individual bogs approaches exhaustion. As would be expected, the management of Bord na Móna have accepted the Government's decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>Two thousand four hundred and seventy-two acres of cutaway for the 1988 planting season are now in the hands of the Forestry Service and arrangements have been made for the identification of additional lands to be transferred in future years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware that this matter, which was one of concern both to myself and to my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food who had the main responsibility for the negotiations, has now been resolved.  On the 22 December last, member states agreed to the extension of the existing post-Chernobyl limits of radiation in food for a further two years.  These limits are 370 becquerels per litre for milk and 600 becquerels for other foodstuffs.  Agreement was also reached on a regulation which will come into effect in the event of a nuclear accident or other radiological emergency.  The levels agreed on in this regulation are 1,000 becquerels for milk and 1,250 becquerels for other foodstuffs. Although the levels in the accident-related regulation are not as restrictive as we would have liked, the Irish Government supported the proposal <Col N="570" /> so as to ensure agreement on common standards in the Community.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under the PAYE regulations the onus is on an employer to supply a P45 (cessation certificate) to an employee on cessation of employment. In the present case a P45 was not supplied by the employer company which has ceased trading and in respect of which records are not available.  The company has been successfully prosecuted for failure to make returns.</P>
      <P>In the absence of records it is not possible to determine whether or not a refund of income tax is due to the taxpayer.  If she can supply any documentary evidence to the inspector that she was employed by the company in question and that tax was deducted from her emoluments the matter will be given further consideration. The Deputy has been fully informed of the position in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the VAT Anti-Evasion Branch.  The value of revenue collected by the VAT Anti-Evasion Branch in 1986 was £2,673,000.  This figure does not include amounts which may have been collected in the ordinary course by the Collector-General in cases drawn to his <Col N="574" /> attention by that branch.  The cost of operating the branch for the year was £281,000.</P>
      <P>The transfer of staff from the VAT Anti-Evasion Branch to the office of the Collector-General is but one of a number of measures needed to adapt the Revenue organisation from the traditional method of examining traders accounts to a system of selective auditing of records.  The move was also necessary to strengthen the office of the Collector-General to enable him to mount a major drive against tax arrears.  I am satisfied that additional yield will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of these measures.</P>
      <P>It is not contemplated that less audit work will be carried out in the future. The anti-evasion outdoor work will be centralised under the Chief Inspector of Taxes who has carried out the bulk of this work in the past.  The VAT inspectors in the Chief Inspector's Branch have developed a considerable expertise in this area of work over many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The clawback scheme is designed to favour leasing by small and medium sized farmers and to provide a national reserve for certain priority classes of farmers.  This reserve will be available for: (i) young farmers under 35 years of age, with certain educational and training qualifications, who have no quotas at present; (ii) producers with quotas under 10,000 gallons, and (iii) producers who sold land between 1 January 1983 and 21 May 1984 and unwittingly relinquished their quotas.  The reserve is being established by means of percentage deductions from quotas being transferred via land sales or leases.  The deduction in the case of sales is 5 per cent.  In the case of leases no clawback applies where the lessee's quota, together with the quota involved in the leasing transaction, is less than 25,000 gallons.  Deductions above that level are on a graduated basis.  The maximum deduction &mdash; 25 per cent &mdash; applies only where the total quota involved in a leasing transaction is over 100,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>The cost of advertising lots of immature forests in 1987 was £6,175.  They were advertised widely both in this country and abroad.</P>
      <P>Private consultants were not engaged in marketing the lots.

Any misguided expectations to the contrary have now been dispelled. All lots sold did reflect their true market value.</P>

    <P>The guidelines used in determining the location of the timber were that, on the <Col N="584" /> basis of age, species, yield class and size, the lots should broadly reflect State forestry countrywide while at the same time being accessible to potential purchasers.</P>

      <P>My Department received a request for exemption in respect of the individual in question by letter dated 17 September 1987.  My Department replied to the request on 13 October 1987.  A subsequent representation from the Deputy on behalf of the pupil is being considered at present together with many other applications for exemptions of a similar nature.  I hope to be in a position to inform the Deputy of my decision in the near future.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she has any plans to make capital grants available to statutory or voluntary bodies for the provision of sporting and recreational facilities including sports halls, athletic tracks and swimming pools; whether there are funds allocated for such projects in 1988; where the funds are to be drawn from; if her Department has received any applications for funding under the above headings from County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of £4 million has been provided from the national lottery surplus for the capital grant scheme for the provision of recreational facilities operated by my Department.  The scheme is open to all voluntary bodies and is designed to assist and encourage local initiatives in the provision of youth, sport and community facilities throughout the country.  Details of the scheme are being circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projects such as the provision of public bathing facilities or projects submitted by statutory bodies would not come within <Col N="597" /> the terms of the scheme and would fall more properly for consideration within the ambit of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>A small number of grants have been provisionally allocated to date and the Department is at present considering a great number of proposals for grant assistance, including those received from County Kildare.  It is expected that the selection of further projects to be grantaided will be decided in the near future.</P>
    <P>An amount of £1.9 million for 1988, from the proceeds of the national lottery, has been allocated by the Government to my Department for the establishment of fourteen local sports centres in various locations throughout the country.  Naas, County Kildare is one of these locations and my Department will be discussing the matter with the relevant local authorities at an early date.</P>
    <P>Following are details of the scheme:</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Objective of Scheme</P>
    <P>This scheme is designed to assist and encourage local initiatives in the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities (excluding swimming pools and environmental works).  The provision of indoor and outdoor facilities are eligible for consideration under this scheme.  The scheme is open to all voluntary community organisations wishing to provide recreational facilities and thereby promote the greater availability of recreational and leisure opportunities for the community.</P>
    <P>2.  Conditions for Participation</P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Site Acquisition</i></P>
    <P>Applicant organisations must provide a suitable site for the development.  The site must be owned or held under long-term lease (not less than 25 years from time of application) by the applicant.  In determining the suitability of a site the Department will take into account its proximity to existing facilities and its accessibility in terms of the potential use of the proposed facility by the community and schools. Grants will not be made available towards the purchase of sites or premises.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Grant Limits and Local Contribution</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> Grantees will be required to provide a local financial contribution of at least 30 per cent of construction cost of the proposed project but in very exceptional circumstances a contribution as low as 20 per cent will be acceptable (in such cases full particulars of these circumstances must be furnished).  The level of grant-aid will be at the discretion of the Department.  Grants will only be considered in respect of work to be done by recognised building contractors and will not exceed £100,000.  Under no circumstances will the grant exceed 80 per cent of construction costs for the proposed project, as agreed in advance by the Department. Grants will not be increased in line with increased building costs.</P>
    <P>Where the development of playing pitches is proposed a grant maximum of £20,000 will apply in the case of any single project or group.  All other conditions of grant assistance stipulated in this schedule shall apply in the case of such developments.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory evidence of the ready availability of the required local contribution amount must be produced prior to the confirmation of grant-aid by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>Plans</i></P>
    <P>Plans for the proposed development must be prepared and submitted to the Department. The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard. Each development must proceed in accordance with the design and costs agreed by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iv)  <i>Planning Permission</i></P>
    <P>Applicants will be required to secure planning permission and by-law approval for the proposed development.  The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Construction of Project</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be responsible for all arrangements for the construction of their project.  The project must be put out to tender and subsequently executed by building contract.  If it is proposed to pass over the lowest of any tender the Department must be notified before any other tender is examined.  Failure to accept the lowest suitable tender may result in reduction or cancellation of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory arrangements must be made by the grantee for the professional supervision of construction works.  The Department will not be liable for professional fees incurred.</P>
    <P>Grants will not be provided towards work performed by voluntary labour or under Government training schemes.</P>
    <P>Where proposed construction works exceed £100,000 building contractors will be required to secure an insurance bond in <Col N="599" /> respect of such projects in advance of the award of a contract.</P>
    <P>Tax clearance procedure (i.e. production of a current C.2 Certificate of tax clearance) in respect of contractors proposed for selection must be complied with in advance of any contractual commitments being made on the part of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Commencement of Building Work</i></P>
    <P>Reasonable progress towards the commencement of building work on the project must be in evidence within six months from the date of provisional allocation of grant aid.  The onus will be on the grantee to show evidence of satisfactory progress towards project construction stage.  In the absence of such evidence the Department retains the right to withdraw the offer of grant assistance.</P>
    <P>(vii)  <i>Management and Maintenance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the proposed facility.</P>
    <P>(viii)  <i>Guarantee of Community Access and Continued Usage</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to submint a written guarantee that the completed facility will be made fully available to the local community.  It will also be necessary to provide an undertaking protecting the Department's financial interest in the facility and guaranteeing the repayment of grants should it cease to operate or should a change of usage occur.</P>
    <P>(ix)  <i>Insurance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to arrange for the provision of adequate insurance cover for the completed facility, against fire and all other insurable risks, with an approved insurance company and to pay all necessary premiums.  The insurance will be for such amount as will provide cover for the full re-instatement value of the facility, together with a sum for professional fees.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the grantee to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc.</P>
    <P>Groups wishing to avail of grant-aid must be in a position to comply in full with the conditions for participation in the Scheme outlined above.  All applications will be considered on their merits, but special consideration will be given to cases where an early commencement of building work is possible.</P>
    <P>3.  Payment of Grant</P>
    <P>Grants will be paid to approved projects following submission of architects' certificates/ builders' invoices in respect of work completed. <Col N="600" /> Grant instalments will issue at a rate established by the Department having regard to the level of grant approved.</P>
    <P>The Department will retain a proportion of the approved grant amount against satisfactory completion of the proposed development works.</P>
    <P>A grant will not be payable in respect of projects being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>4.  Project Visits</P>
    <P>Approved projects will be subject to occasional visits by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>5.  Application Forms</P>
    <P>Application forms for completion in respect of eligible projects are available from The Secretary, Department of Education, Youth Section, 11th Floor, Hawkins House, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>All questions on the form must be answered and failure to disclose full details will render applications ineligible for consideration.</P>
    <P>6.  Acknowledgement</P>
    <P>This grant scheme is being funded from the surplus proceeds of the National Lottery.  All grant assisted projects must display an acknowledgement that the project has been aided by the National Lottery.</P>
    <P>November, 1987.</P>
