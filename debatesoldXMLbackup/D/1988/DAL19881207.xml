      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 7, 8, 15, 9, 10 and 11.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 11.30 p.m.  It is further proposed that Nos. 7 and 8 shall be taken without debate.  It is further proposed that No. 15 shall be taken between 10.30 a.m. and 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that Nos. 9, 10 and 11 shall be taken together for the purposes of debate and the proceedings, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 11.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply:</P>
      <P>(a)  The speech of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups as defined in Standing Order No. 89, shall not exceed 20 minutes;</P>

      <P>Those proposals are not agreed for the reasons I stated yesterday and on previous occasions.  I wish to propose that the proposal that &ldquo;the speech of the main spokesperson nominated by each of the groups, as defined in Standing Order No. 89, shall not exceed 20 minutes,&rdquo; be amended with the deletion of, &ldquo;as defined in Standing Order No. 89&rdquo;.  I have made my reasons clear previously as to why I am proposing that.  I regard it as a petty discrimination against The Workers' Party who are a registered political party. Deputies of this party have been elected to this House and they should be accorded the same rights as other parties in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of my general approach to this debate and in particular to amendments.  When this Bill was going through the other House I indicated that at all times I would be willing to listen to reasonable arguments and where I was convinced by the merits of the arguments I went ahead and made the amendments. I think Senators on all sides of the House were very gratified I took that approach and the Seanad generally agreed that the Bill left that House much improved.  I would like to adopt the same approach in this House and, therefore, when I see an amendment which will clearly improve the Bill I will have little or no difficulty in accepting it.  In some cases, while I may see some merit in an amendment I may have difficulties with the wording and may wish to look at it between now and Report Stage.  In other cases, I will disagree with Deputies in regard to amendments to the Bill and I hope they will understand that I am not doing so just to be difficult but rather because I am committed to the section in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Having said that, I am fairly happy that we have just about struck the right balance at this stage and at this point I would not see us embarking upon any major change in policy or direction but I will be more than happy to listen to the points that will be put forward.  I would like to remind the House that this is major legislation which has come through the Seanad and Second Stage in this House. We are now coming to deal with the most important Stage and getting down to deal with the details of the various sections.  I hope we will do so in a constructive way and I hope to accept as many amendments as I possibly can and where I cannot accept them to explain my reasons for not doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That approach on the part of the Minister of State is most welcome. It has been suggested by some, including Mr. Justice Keane in his book <i>Company Law in the Republic of Ireland,</i> that we should seek to codify company law in one consolidating Act in the same way that all social welfare legislation was consolidated in one Act a few years ago. This Bill will tag many amendments onto the existing legislation rather than codifying all previous legislation.  Can the Minister tell us if he thinks that codified legislation might come forth in the foreseeable future and can he indicate if other legislation in connection with company law, such as legislation arising from the EC Eighth Directive governing auditors, which would allow auditors to be bodies corporate &mdash; up until now they have only been allowed to operate in a sole capacity with full personal liability &mdash; will be brought forward?  Is there likely to be more legislation in the future in this area? Can the Minister of State give us a date, if any, on which we will reach the point where it will be appropriate to say that we have made most of the changes which have to be made and we can introduce a consolidating Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.  I would dearly love to be able to do that but at this stage it is a question of priorities and resources.  The <Col N="565" /> Seventh and Eighth Directives have still to be dealt with and I would hope to deal with them as soon as possible.  We have difficulties in regard to resources and I have allocated our resources in such a way that we can get this legislation through.  I would like to consolidate all the legislation in one Act but I cannot apply the thin resources I have to that task right now.  It is certainly an objective which I will get to as soon as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>By referring to thin resources, I hope the Minister of State is aware of the fact that many companies also have thin resources with which to comply with the provisions of this Bill. Some of the reporting requirements which will be imposed by this Bill are quite severe and we should bear in mind that the Minister of State's Department have failed to present the annual report on companies as required by the Companies Act for each of the last three years. The Department have not yet presented a report on companies as required by the 1963 Act for the years 1985, 1986 or 1987. I am sure that if this were done by a company in the private sector it would be regarded as recklessness and possibly they would find themselves facing dire consequences, such as those outlined in this Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will bear in mind that to fall behind in one's work is sometimes human and this can happen even in well-ordered and well-administered entities such as the Department of Industry and Commerce who have not presented an annual report on companies as required under the Companies Act for each of the last three calendar years.  I hope the Minister of State, himself being a sinner in this matter in his corporate capacity, will appreciate that others may sin in trying to comply with the requirements of the legislation and that as we go through the Bill, he will bear in mind that many companies have a scarcity of resources with which to fulfil every last comma of statutory requirements, a problem which his Department also obviously face.</P>

      <P>I know of a member of the business community who was in touch with the Department yesterday to ask when it was expected that this Bill would become law and they were told in four or five months time.  But for the Christmas recess, it could have been three months but it does not make any difference.  It is important to make the point that this Committee Stage presents the last opportunity to make material changes in the Bill.  New matter cannot be introduced on Report Stage if it has not been mentioned on Committee Stage and new matter cannot be introduced by the Government in the Seanad; the only purpose for which they can go back to the Seanad is to discuss amendments which have been made in this House.  While the Bill may not technically become law for three or four months it should be made clear to any business entity who are concerned about any provision of this Bill that they should make their representations to the Department and Members of the House within the next week because it will not be possible to make changes in policy terms after that date.  In view of that the business community should pay special attention to what the Minister said a few moments ago about his willingness to contemplate amendments on Committee Stage.  The <Col N="567" /> time for remedying any errors there may be in this Bill is running out very rapidly.</P>

This Bill is taking shape very quickly and, depending on the work which we in this House put into it on Committee Stage, it will have the opportunity to emerge as very strong legislation.  Without going through a list as such, I want to remind the public of the controversial items dealt with in the Bill &mdash; loans to directors, the disclosure of who owns companies, insider dealing and the penalties for that, the introduction of reckless trading, the lifting of limited liability, the question of groups of companies and the lifting of the veil between the groups, the disqualification of directors, tackling the Phoenix syndrome whereby companies cease trading on a Friday and start again on a Monday and the introduction of a new company rescue operation system, which has been spoken about many times before.  There is a lot in this legislation and because this is the last opportunity we will get &mdash; this legislation has been in preparation for many years &mdash; it is very important that anybody who has anything to say about the legislation should say it now.</P>

      <P>I think there are 207 sections in this very complex Bill and there is only one day this week devoted to Committee Stage.  In view of the desire to have the Bill passed, can the Minister say at this stage whether we will have an opportunity to continue with Committee Stage next week or is it likely that we will have to wait until after the Christmas recess to continue Committee Stage? Obviously, that would mean a further delay in bringing the Bill into law.</P>

      <P>I do not know what time scale can be given within which this Bill will be passed by the House but section 2 provides, by order of the Minister, for the coming into operation of different sections on different days. Throughout the debate on the various sections of the Bill I suppose we will come across different sections which will need <Col N="569" /> to come into operation on different days, but if the Bill is passed by the end of the next session I believe that a particular date should be fixed for all of the sections to come into effect.  There has been a plethora of companies legislation but I think the 1963 Companies Act has served its purpose quite well.  If different dates are set for the coming into effect of different provisions this will make things more complicated.</P>
      <P>My experience over the years with companies legislation &mdash; and this is a major amendment of the Principal Act, 1963 &mdash; is that the Companies Registration Office is completely overrun with the volume of work and the staff in that office are not able to cope with their normal work of registrations, annual returns and so on.  I know the system is more computerised now but that has only happened in the recent past.  It is fine bringing in new companies legislation but it will be of no benefit if the Department are not in a position to police its introduction. I do not think that at present the Companies Registration Office are in a position to police the introduction of the legislation because they are understaffed. Even without these new powers they are not able to keep up with the filing of annual returns.  For many years the only way the staff in that office knew someone had not sent in their annual returns for the year was when someone looked at a file to find out who owned a particular company and before they put it back they checked to see whether the annual returns were up to date.  In some cases they might have found that the annual returns had not been sent in for ten years. This section makes provision for the introduction of different sections of the Bill on different days, but if the Bill is passed by the end of the next session I think all sections should come into effect on a certain date so that there will be more order in this area.</P>

      <P>I gather that this is a standard provision in legislation like this. There are some parts of the legislation which can be brought into effect immediately but there are others which may <Col N="570" /> require some form of supplementary provision whether in relation, for example, to the making of regulations by the Minister after the Bill comes into effect or the making of court rules which would set out procedures which would be followed by the court.  It is unlikely that we could bring the whole Bill into force at any one time given the different objectives of different parts of the Bill.  I share the Deputy's interest in this area.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (1) states that the following sections of the Principal Act are repealed: 147, 162, inserted by section 6 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982, 163, 165 to 173, 184, 296, 380 and 385 and the Seventh and Tenth Schedules.  This legislation is a major document.  It has been under consideration for a number of years within the Department and the industry.  Major work has been done by individuals in that section of the Department and in the Seanad major amendments have been made, with more work.  When such effort has been put into all this, it would be just as easy to take the 1963 Act and the few Acts since and put them all together in one Bill.  Before the 1963 Act, everybody operated under an Act, I think, of 1908. The 1963 Act did one great thing, it put company law into one big book.  There <Col N="572" /> were no amendments to it until the eighties and there have been different Acts since.</P>
      <P>The Companies Act of 1963 is a monster. However, it brought everything into one place at the one time.  Now, under this Bill we will take out provisions of the Principal Act under section 6.  People who have to operate under companies Acts, such as lawyers and accountants, are under considerable stress and strain in finding relevant sections all over the place and the Department officials may not be fully aware of this.  I know that nothing can be done about it now, but this legislation has taken so many years, with the easily seen amount of effort that has gone into it here and in the Seanad. The same procedure should have been carried out with a whole new companies Bill.  Some sections will now be deleted from the 1963 Act as a result of section 6 of this Bill.  There have been amending Acts of 1986, etc.  In regard to liquidations, there are superior courts rules and so forth.  The whole area is a mine-field. It is no wonder that lawyers can make fortunes.  A lawyer who specialises will know what Acts he should look up and can follow them.  To have all this effort put together, as was the case in the 1963 Act, could not mean any more work.  People involved may not be familiar enough with the sections repealed. There are hundreds of sections in the 1963 Act and hundreds in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with some aspects of this.  Section 6 (1) lists a number of sections of the 1963 Act which I am proposing to repeal simply because they are being superseded by sections of this Bill.  The Deputy, of course, is right in principle.  The difficulty is that since the 1963 Act there have been five amending Acts.  This legislation started out to deal with a few particular areas, to tackle, head on, abuse in limited liability, to introduce the insider dealing concept, to bring about greater disclosure, to introduce the concept of reckless trading, to bring in a rescue system and deal with other areas of company law.  It is a fairly targeted Bill, although it is lengthy and <Col N="573" /> complex.  There is a set number of areas that it seeks to address.  I would like it to be all nice and neat in one book, removing the necessity of reading any other book.  However, that is just not a practical proposition at present.  It is something we will try to get to as soon as possible but I cannot hold out any hope that it will be immediate.</P>

Members would have read into them in the order in which they were likely to be taken by reference to the section in the Bill to which they refer, which is more or less the order in which they appear on this green amendment sheet.  I have not read amendment No. 110 for the very simple reason that it was circulated only yesterday.  I spent a good deal of yesterday preparing my own amendments which I wished to have circulated in time.  I am working my way through the list of amendments before us.  In dealing with amendment No. 110, we are dealing with a substantive proposal, as I understand it.  While I would have no wish to suggest that the Minister, in explaining what it means, would mislead the House, it is not desirable that we deal with it without having had a reasonable opportunity to read it and consult about it, if necessary.</P>

As Deputy Bruton has said, this is a very complex Bill.  There are provisions in later sections that would require much advance study and thought. If we take them in conjunction with earlier sections it is likely that we will not do those later sections the justice they merit. If we stick to the format of taking them in the order in which they are numbered it will be much more satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to these four related amendments is complicated. The object is to rationalise and extend the application of certain Companies Acts provisions to unregistered companies.  Section 377 of the Ninth Schedule to the 1963 Act applied certain provisions of the Act to unregistered companies and the third column of that Schedule gave the Minister an enabling power to apply certain further provisions. Section 377 provides that an unregistered company is any corporate body other than, first, a body incorporated under a general statute, such as a registered company, a building society or an industrial and provident society; secondly, a non-profit making body or, thirdly, any body which is prohibited from distributing its income or property among its members.  This leaves us with companies incorporated by a charter, by letters patent or by a special Act of Parliament. Perhaps the most notable example nowadays is the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of unregistered companies in various pieces of companies legislation since 1963 has been something of a hit and miss affair, with various bits and pieces applied selectively to such companies.  As a result, the legal position of unregistered companies is not very clear.  These amendments represent an opportunity to consolidate existing law on these companies, with some amendments. If it is necessary I can go into <Col N="576" /> detail on the amendments at this stage. We are trying to pull together the legal position in regard to unregistered companies. I am trying to achieve a little bit of consolidation, which I think is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are many chartered companies or corporations operating in Ireland but that very few of them carry on business for gain.  They include bodies such as the Incorporated Law Society, the universities, the Royal Irish Academy, the Royal College of Surgeons, voluntary hospitals, etc.  I am also advised that there are a number of companies which are incorporated by statute.  These would include bodies such as CIE, the ESB, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, the Irish Sugar Company, the ICC, Telecom and An Post.  Am I to take it that these provisions apply to all the bodies I have mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The universities and those sorts of bodies differ quite radically from a body like Aer Lingus in their operational ethos.  The meat lies in amendment No. 112 which applies a number of provisions in regard to such things the pre-incorporation of contracts, prospectuses and allotments, a registered office, an annual return, the validity of acts of the directors, a register of directors and secretaries, the liability of officers and others for negligence, share certificates, company records, maintenance of capital etc.  These are all being applied to bodies like the Royal College of Surgeons and Kings Inns, as well as Aer Lingus and the Sugar Company.  I wonder whether this is entirely appropriate in so far as certain things like the <Col N="577" /> liability of officers and others for negligence should, it is argued, be different in the case of a body which is carried on for profit in the private sector, for example, the Bank of Ireland, or a body in the private sector which is not carried on for profit, for example, the Royal Irish Academy, as against a body in the public sector like Aer Lingus which is a commercial company operating in the commercial arena.  Applying these provisions as to liability of directors for negligence under section 200 of the 1963 Act could be rather severe in the case of some of the bodies which are carried on not for profit and who have a purely beneficent and benevolent purpose.  I stress this is very much a first reading on my part.</P>

      <P>The Minister might use that time to look at the very wide diversities of bodies which come under these provisions.  All semi-State companies will be affected, if I am not mistaken.  A number of semi-State bodies are not companies. There is a distinction here which is interesting.  Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, the Sugar Company, ICC, Telecom Éireann and An Post are companies incorporated by statute.  Then there are other semi-State bodies which are not companies.  Why the distinction was made I do not know.  They include the Electricity Supply Board, CIE, Bord na Móna, RTE, Bord Gáis, Bord na gCapall, Bord Fáilte, the Racing Board and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  They are known as boards, not companies, and they are different from Aer Rianta etc.  Does the section apply to semi-State bodies which are not companies?</P>

      <P>I accept that but they are all part of the public sector and, so far as this House is concerned, there is not much distinction between them.  The point I am making is that all these provisions in regard to share certificates, company records, maintenance for capital liability or to officers for negligence etc. apply, for example, to companies in the State sector which are producing airports, air travel, sugar, telephone and postal services but they do not apply to State companies producing surface transport, turf, gas, etc.  There does not seem to be a clear policy distinction as to why these requirements should apply to one set and not to the other.  These provisions should be extended to include on a uniform basis all semi-State boards which are not companies in that there should be a level playing field for competition in terms of their statutory obligations between all State companies, some of which are, indirectly at least, competing with one another.</P>

      <P>This is an interesting debate but there has been some confusion in relation to the difference between State companies and State boards.  As I understand it, the Minister has direct responsibility for State boards, the ESB, Bord na Móna etc and can interfere in a way in which he cannot interfere with the running and day to day business of State companies.  The Minister's direct responsibility makes the difference in relation to State boards.</P>

      <P>It depends on whether a Minister wants a company to remain an independent republic but the Minister can interfere in CIE or Bord na Móna or he can at any time break up a company into three companies or alter the boards.  He can alter the operation of the company as he did with the ESB, as he is suggesting in relation to Bord na Móna and as he has done with CIE.  He can &mdash; as he has done with the ESB &mdash; impose levies of £10 million, £15 million or £20 million in times of crisis.  The Minister can really take over and change the structure of a company and of State boards.  As I understand it, State companies are somewhat different and that is why they come under the operation of the Act.  I should like the Minister to tell us the specific difference.  My understanding is that there is a difference between State boards and state companies and, if that is so, the State boards should have a different status because the issue would be whether one makes the State boards into state companies and brings them all together.  That should be the way forward.</P>

      <P>In drafting these amendments, we were giving consideration to private sector companies particularly.  In my introduction I mentioned one large banking group, for example, which is an unregistered company. The legislation was moulded to include unregistered companies in the private sector.  We did not give deep consideration to the question of whether State companies not being registered companies should be included in it.  My impression is that they are not included in it but I will take an opportunity to look at that matter again.  Companies like CIE and the ESB have their own legislation and I am not clear whether it would not be appropriate to apply some of these provisions to supersede or interfere with that legislation.  I will have to look again at the question of State companies.  The <Col N="580" /> amendments are targeted particularly at the private sector because there are some extremely well known unregistered companies in the private sector, one of which I mentioned earlier.</P>

We consult many people such as accountants, lawyers, companies and so on but there are many people affected by this legislation to whom we did not write.  We did not write to private companies or to various other people to tell them that we were introducing new mechanisms.  I have to be satisfied that the companies in question have accesss to the information and I am happy that they have that access.  There are many people affected by the legislation but I do not think there is any requirement to formally write to them all to tell them we are going to enact legislation that might affect them.  The companies legislation has been on the stocks for a while and those people are quite well aware of it, but whether or not they are aware of the detailed amendments I cannot be sure.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being disingenuous.  We are not talking about consultation with the commercial sector in regard to the Companies (No. 2) Bill in general.  That has been on the stocks since 1986 and anybody who has not read it by now is to some extent at fault.  What we are talking about here is an amendment that was published yesterday which applies in most cases not to normal commercial entities but to bodies who would not normally feel it part of their responsibility to keep up to date with the arguments about company law.  It applies to bodies such as the Royal College of Surgeons, the voluntary hospitals, the Royal Irish Academy and bodies of that kind who would not normally keep in touch with company law because it is not part of their normal trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would argue that while the Minister might be perfectly happy to say that he <Col N="582" /> has consulted accountants, lawyers and so on about the general Companies (No. 2) Bill, in regard to this specific amendment which brings into company law a lot of entities that were not previously in it some special measures, particularly in view of the lateness of the introduction of the amendment &mdash; yesterday &mdash; should be adopted.  I would urge the Minister to take some steps to communicate with all of these bodies to let them know what they are being obliged to comply with. I do not think that is an unreasonable suggestion.</P>

The provision is not meant to be as far-reaching as the Deputy is suggesting. If it were it should have been in the main legislation and not just put in as an amendment.  If it affected all the areas the Deputy is considering it certainly would be a major change and one to which we would have to give much thought.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (2), line 10, after &ldquo;require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or as may be specified by regulation under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before talking about the amendment I will firstly, for the sake of clarity, refer to the section which it is proposed to amend.  The section allows for investigations of the affairs of companies to be initiated as a result of a decision by the court following an application by a number of parties which include the Minister. Section 7 (2) as it stands, reads:</P>
      <P>The application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that until such time as a measure of precedent is built up in regard to what the courts will require in the matter of evidence to support an application for an investigation there will be continuing uncertainly in regard to the type of evidence a court would require. Probably this means that people making an application will have to go into court with their evidence and be told by the <Col N="585" /> judge: &ldquo;Sorry, you have not given me sufficient evidence.  Come back here next week with more evidence.&rdquo;  I know it would not happen quite like that, I am sure there would be a lot more convoluted and archaic procedures, but that would be the effect.  I predict that a lot of time would be wasted and money spent on professional advisers and so on until it becomes an established precedent as to what are the sorts of things a court would require, both as to content and form, in terms of evidence to support an application for an investigation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to allow the Minister to specify the type of evidence a court would require.  The relevant subsection would then read:</P>
    <P>The application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require or as may be specified by regulation under this Act.</P>
    <P>That would make for an amount of certainty and clarity in this field.  Obviously the amendment is not intended to take away the discretion of the court to look for more evidence simply by virtue of the fact that the Minister would have prescribed the sort of evidence that would be acceptable.  What I would envisage would be that the Minister, having consulted with the judges, would set out in a regulation what are minimum requirements as to evidence.  Then if in particular cases a judge wanted more evidence to back an application for an investigation, he would of course retain discretion to ask for it; but there would be a regulation, which would act as a guideline to people seeking an investigation, a regulation capable of being consulted somewhere which would be made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This amendment is wholly non-contentious and is designed to facilitate the administration of this part of the Bill.  I would hope the Minister would accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what Deputy John Bruton has said.  I am dubious as to whether what he proposes in his amendment would benefit the Bill in any way &mdash; having the Minister bring in regulations that would direct the kind <Col N="586" /> of evidence that should be produced or broaden the scope of the provisions of this subsection.  The courts should be allowed to decide what evidence they require.  I do not know that the provisions would be enhanced in any way by bringing in regulations.  Indeed, the Minister might experience some difficulty in framing regulations that would anticipate something that, under the procedures laid down in the Bill as it stands, the courts cannot do anyway.  I understand that Deputy Bruton is endeavouring to improve that subsection but I am not convinced that his amendment will achieve that purpose.  I believe the courts are entirely capable of deciding what evidence should be brought before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the reasoning in what Deputy Bruton is saying but I have a difficulty with it in that the subsection as it stands talks of such evidence &ldquo;as the courts may require&rdquo;.  Of course, a court might require varying levels of information in particular cases.  But since the amount or type of evidence which would be required thus would be totally at the discretion of the court, it would be difficult to legislate in this Bill for what a court might require.  Furthermore, it would be difficult for a Minister to make regulations as to the type of evidence which he thinks a court might require since he would have no way of knowing that and for precisely the same reason that, as the subsection is at present drafted, it is at the discretion of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a practical level what I predict would happen is that when the Bill is enacted the superior court rules committee would come along, put a framework on this, setting down their rules as to the minimum amount of information which would have to accompany an application for an investigation.  I am advised that that is what would happen in practice, that that committee would draw up the minimum information they would require.  Therefore, when a person brings forward an application he or she would automatically be bringing forward this minimum amount of information as laid down by the committee.  At that stage <Col N="587" /> a court might decide, depending on the circumstances of an individual case, that more information was required and could so advise the applicant.</P>
    <P>I do not feel extremely strongly about this, but having said that I have a practical difficulty in attempting to go along with it, given that we are laying the responsibility on the court to obtain such evidence as it may require, to come along then and endeavour to tell them what evidence should be required.  Again, on a practical basis probably we would not bring the provisions of section 7 into effect until the courts committee had made their rules.  I presume we would have some informal input in their compilation.</P>

However, since the whole purpose of this Part of the Bill is to transfer the procedures for appointment of inspectors from the Minister to the courts, we should leave it up to the courts to decide on what evidence is required.  I would predict that as usual the superior court rules would specify the type of evidence that would be required.  Since the spirit of this Part of the Bill is to transfer the responsibility from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the courts, we should not attempt to hamstring the courts by the inclusion of this amendment. I am doubtful whether it would improve the provisions of the relevant subsection.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (3), line 13, after &ldquo;amount&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not less than £500 and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the provision whereby a court may require an applicant or applicants for an investigation into a company to give security for the cost of the investigation to an amount not exceeding £200,000.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment simply is to rule out mischievous applications by saying that there should also be a minimum security laid down by law of £500 so that people would know there is not much point in making an application unless they are prepared to contribute £500 at least towards its cost.  One need not wait until the judge says that one has to come up with a larger sum of money. While the Bill contains a maximum of £200,000 which the court may require it should also contain a minimum and I suggest a figure of £500 just to keep frivolous applications from being made only to be shot down by the judge.  A sum of £500 would not represent a barrier to any genuine applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment No. 6 is a slightly more complicated amendment.  The section says that one may be asked to lodge up to £200,000 for the payment of costs in an investigation.  Under this section an applicant may find himself paying the entire cost of the application and his entire security of £200,000 could be used to pay <Col N="589" /> the cost of the investigation notwithstanding the fact that the investigation might transpire to have revealed serious malfeasance on the part of the company, of a kind that would have justified the initiative of the applicant in seeking the application.  The security put in by the applicant should not be used to cover more than half of the cost of the investigation.  If an applicant had been asked to lodge £200,000 and the investigation costs £200,000 he should not have to leave the £200,000 to pay costs.  The maximum that the applicant should be asked to pay would be half of that.  That is not an unreasonable suggestion and it is intended to achieve what Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment is intended to achieve, although in a slightly different way.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that it is up to the judge to decide whether an applicant applied for a justifiable investigation and whether he should get back half of three-quarters of the sum lodged.  I presume there is some provision to that effect in the Bill; if there is not, there should be. However, the difficulty with that response is that it leaves a high measure of uncertainty and people, when initiating an investigation, do not know whether they will have to pay the entire cost at the end.  My amendment would make it more likely that people would initiate investigations and render Part II of this Bill as a whole more useful and used than were the investigation provisions of the 1963 Act.  I understand that the powers in that Act were rarely invoked and that the only investigation of any consequence in modern times took place with regard to the inquiry into Irish Estates, published on 23 October 1963, and that there has been no investigation since.  This requirement of getting the court rather than the Minister to initiate the investigation could make it less likely that investigation would be initiated than was the case when one only had to get the Minister to do the job.  That is arguable but the prospect of having to pay the entire cost of the application if one is an applicant is also rather daunting. While there should be a £500 minimum fee to rule out frivolous applications an <Col N="590" /> applicant should not find himself at risk of having to pay all of the cost of the investigation.  The most he should legally be capable of being required to pay should be 50 per cent of the cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the arguments Deputy Bruton made and I agree with his amendments.  In regard to amendment No. 4, Deputy Bruton says that his reason for proposing the amendment is that there should also be a minimum figure.  I agree with putting in a figure of not less than £500 but I do not agree with putting in &ldquo;not exceeding £200,000&rdquo;.  That is excessive to say the least.  The section already limits applications for an investigation.  In the case of a company with share capital the application must be made by at least 100 members or alternatively one member with one-tenth of the share capital.  That is a considerable restriction on who can make an application for an investigation. On that basis one must take it that any investigation would be a serious investigation. In a non-share capital company an application is made by the company itself or by a creditor of the company. The part relating to a creditor might be a bit wide because a creditor could be a person who is owed from £5 upwards. However having regard to the other provision there frivolous applications will not be made.  The problem of inserting &ldquo;not exceeding £200,000&rdquo; is that this is an enormous penalty to put on anybody who might make an application because once one applies to the courts one could be expected then to pay the full cost of the investigation whether it be £150,000 or £200,000.  From the restrictions already in the Bill any investigation applied for would be serious.  It would probably be an investigation into a problem which arose due to managerial problems or director problems in the company and a person would have a right to have the company examined to ascertain the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to have the maximum reduced to £50,000 which is a very substantial sum for any individual, regardless of whether he owns one-tenth <Col N="591" /> of the share capital, in applying for an investigation by one or more competent inspectors.  The fact that a sum of £200,000 may be involved would prevent many individuals, even 100 members of a company, from making an application even though they felt it was justified as long as there is this threat of £200,000 to cover the investigation hanging over them.  If there is real cause for concern in a company and a director, shareholder, member, creditor, or any person affected by the company, wants to have it investigated, under this section they can do so before the company goes into liquidation and there are no assets left.  That possibility is recognised in this Bill.  If somebody sees a company in difficulties and has reason to believe that his information is correct and that the company should be investigated, he must put those reasons before the court and investigators will be appointed by the court, but this threat of £200,000 hanging over somebody ruins the effect of the section.  As I said, under this section a person can have an investigation carried out into the affairs of a company when it can do some good, that is, before the company gets into the final phase, namely, liquidation which can cause trauma for workers, shareholders, creditors, suppliers and everybody who does business with the company.  This has happened many times.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the section is that anybody who knows what is going on in a company now has the opportunity to have the matter investigated, to discover which individual is responsible for the trouble or what the trouble is, before the company goes into liquidation.  I ask the Minister to look at the words &ldquo;an amount not exceeding £200,000&rdquo;.  The Minister will say that the amount of £200,000 may never apply unless an investigation costs, say, £10 million or something like that.  I believe a sum of £200,000 is excessive for an individual, a group of individuals, suppliers or creditors to have to put up as security and would prevent them from applying for an investigation.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point <Col N="592" /> Deputy Mac Giolla is making but I believe a sum of £200,000 is reasonable, because one must leave it up to the court to decide the amount.  Section 7 (3) says that the court may require the applicant or applicants to give security to an amount not exceeding £200,000 for payment of the costs of the investigation.  Say we had a company like Guinness, which has been in the news in the United Kingdom for a few years, and somebody got wind of something illegal happening and went to the court and said they believed X, Y and Z was happening, the court would have to recommend that a very large sum would have to be provided by way of security because it would take a very great deal of money to investigate such a big company.  Of course, if a smaller company were involved the amount needed as security would not be as high.  I believe the court would take all this into account.  I recognise what Deputy Mac Giolla said.  The applicant is probably a supplier who has lost a considerable amount of money and he is faced with the prospect of losing another large sum of money, throwing good money after bad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment deals with spurious applications being made to the court.  I do not think that will happen but over the last ten years we as a nation have become very interested in the law. Even the fellow drinking his pint in the pub on a Friday night knows more about the finer points of law and his rights than the legal practitioner.  I would be worried about spurious applications being made to the court.  As Deputy Burton said, I believe we should include a sum which would prevent spurious applications being made to the court.  I suggest that £500 is too little; maybe £5,000 would be more appropriate.  In a few years time £500 may not represent a vast amount to some people but a malicious person might decide £500 would be a very small sum if it meant causing trouble for a company through adverse publicity, even if the court threw out the application.</P>

      <P>Yes, the old Irish attitude that there must be something going on if a case has been brought to court.  I would be more anxious to increase the minimum than the maximum sum.  I did not know inspectors had been appointed under the 1963 Act.  Why is it now thought that by giving powers to the court rather than to the Minister for Industry and Commerce greater use will be made of this facility to appoint inspectors? What is the general thinking behind that? My experience is that if a shareholder or director thinks a company is in difficulties, they will have it wound up by liquidation.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to ensure that an applicant would not be inhibited from making an application to have an investigation carried out, and so far as they do that they are worthwhile.  Deputy Bruton's amendment setting out a minimum sum is good because it will get rid of vexatious and spurious applications.  In any event, the court has discretion as to what amount should be lodged as security to cover the ultimate costs of these investigations. While we are talking about minimum and maximum figures we should not lose sight of the fact that the court has discretion at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point Deputies have made about inhibiting a person making an application because the amount of security they will have to lodge would be excessive.  On the other hand, as Deputy McCreevy pointed out, if a very large company warrants an investigation, there will obviously be a very high cost attached to the carrying out of that investigation. One tries to pick a figure to put into the legislation, and perhaps the figure of £200,000 is correct, but one could possibly pick another figure.  It is difficult to decide on the most appropriate figure.  In this section, we have to rely ultimately on the fact that the court have discretion when the application is made to decide on the appropriate level of money that should apply to cover the costs of the investigation.  I think it is appropriate to leave it that way.  For the reasons I have <Col N="594" /> mentioned I would not be very keen that we should reduce the figure of £200,000 down to the figure of £50,000 as proposed in The Workers' Party amendment.  In the case of a large company which would require a major investigation the figure of £50,000 would not be sufficient to cover the costs of such investigation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the spirit in which the amendments were put down.  It is important that applicants would not in any way be inhibited from applying for an investigation to be carried out but, I think the lower limit of £500 as proposed in Deputy Bruton's amendment and an upper limit of £200,000 would be satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Bruton.  The effect of that amendment would be to require definite security although of a small minimum amount.  I can accept that proposal and I am prepared to accept the amendment.  It is a good idea that some security would be available at all stages and the figure of £500 is sensible.  On the other hand, amendment No.5 in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla seeks to reduce from £200,000 to £50,000 the maximum amount of security which would be required of an applicant for an investigation. If we accept the idea that there should be some upper limit, we are really talking about where that figure should fall.  It is important that we stitch in that the figure of £200,000 as the maximum figure and that the courts are completely free to decide on a much lower figure, indeed I should stress on no figure at all in any particular case if the circumstances warranted it.  At the same time I would like us to be clear that we are not talking about a necessarily quick speedy resolution as the formal investigation envisaged under section 7 is a serious affair and experience to date would suggest that it can be very expensive to mount such an investigation.  Because of the complexities of the matter, those involved feel they need legal representation and expert witnesses, which may become necessary.  Getting to the bottom of the <Col N="595" /> wrongdoing or other problem that is alleged to have occurred can take a substantial amount of time, and when we take this in conjunction with the need for legal representation and expert witnesses, we can see that the meter is running all the time this is going on.</P>
      <P>The House will gather that I do not see such formal investigation being an every day occurrence.  In fact, I think it would only arise in exceptionally serious circumstances, where serious wrong doings were suspected.  For that reason I think the highish upper limit is required.  I should also mention that in section 19 to 21, inclusive, the Minister is given considerable power to get information directly from the companies, without the need to set out on the more expensive route of a formal investigation under sections 7 and 8 of the Bill.  This adds weight to my own view that because of the scale and seriousness of such formal inquiries, the scale of security involved should match the gravity of the issues concerned.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with Deputy Bruton's second amendment, amendment No. 6. I wish to make a number of things clear. It has been the position since 1963 that the applicant for an investigation could be required to pay the full costs of the investigation, without any upper limit at all.  Indeed, section 171 (1)(c)(ii) of the Companies Act, 1963, specifically provides that the applicants for the investigation shall be liable to such extent (if any) as the Minister may direct for the expenses of and incidental to an investigation. We are coming from a position where there has been no upper limit at all to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 171 (1)(c)(ii). Secondly, I can accept that where the Minister is the applicant for an investigation, he might be required to pay the expenses up to the full amount of any security he has been required to give, <Col N="596" /> equally where somebody else is the applicant the same principle should apply, bearing in mind all the time that the court may ultimately decide to apportion the costs in such a way as to relieve the original applicant entirely from any liability whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I do not think that amendment No. 6 is workable.  The Deputy is suggesting that the security for costs should relate to half the costs of the investigation, but the court will not know at the time the application is made what the costs of the investigation are going to be.  The amendment would give rise to practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked about the Minister and the court.  We have had some technical problems with investigation procedures in the past, for example, persons refusing to answer questions and putting up legal obstacles and so on.  By transferring the jurisdiction to the High Court, we thought this would bring the court into a more central role and make it easier to adjudicate on disputes. The previous system made it difficult to get some adjudication on disputes because of the legal obstacles that were being put up to the Minister. Therefore, I have no difficulty with amendment No. 4, which I welcome and thank Deputy Bruton for, but I have difficulty with amendment Nos. 5 and 6 for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want further clarification.  The Minister has said that under the 1963 Act the applicant would have had to pay the full costs without an upper limit being set.  I presume that meant there were practically no applications &mdash; and I do not know if there was ever an application under the 1963 Act.  I presume that as legal fees increased, the number of applications would have dropped considerably, if they had to pay the full costs of the investigations. The Minister has faced up to this.  When making provisions for applications in the Act, we must not have penalties to such an extent that would <Col N="597" /> prevent people from availing of the provisions. Is it intended, as Deputy O'Malley appears to think, that the applicant should pay the full cost, and if it costs £250,000 or £300,000, or £1 million to carry out the investigation, as in the case of a really big company when there is a really big investigation, they will not have to pay the full costs?  Is it the case that the bigger the company the less they will have to pay?  In Ireland we do not have many companies which compare with the size of Guinness and Bell's which were under investigation &mdash; and the investigation is still going on in the case of Mr. Saunders &mdash; but it is very unlikely that we will have such an incident here because we have no companies that would come up to that size.  However, we have two or three companies that are reasonably big.</P>
      <P>I have said £200,000 is probably the cost of 95 per cent of any investigations that may take place.  Is the purpose that we want the applicant to stop?  Is it that the applicant is being a nuisance and we would be better off if nobody applied for an investigation, therefore if you apply for an investigation you are going to have to pay the full cost of this to £200,000? That is an unbelievable sum and there is not much point in having the facility there if the person is to be expected to pay the full cost of the investigation.  I think £50,000 is a fair mark for a person to go to have an investigation into a company to save his or her present investment or assets and ensure the future is going to be better, to have this company investigated in the meantime, and £50,000 in Irish terms is a fairly big maximum sum to have to pay for an investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it turns out that the investigation means nothing, that the company are impeccable and very well managed, bookkeeping and accounting are top class, there is nothing in this section to indicate that the person will have to pay any more.  If it turns out that the company are in a disastrous condition, the applicant is absolutely right; not alone is he saving himself money as a supplier or whatever, he is saving hundreds of <Col N="598" /> others, he is saving jobs and other suppliers by having his investigation, but there is nothing to indicate that money will come back.  It is said it is security. Normally if you put up security you get your security back.  There is nothing in the section about paying the cost of the investigation.  Does this mean people are asked to put up this security to show they are substantial people with substantial backing and are not having a frivolous complaint, or are they putting up the money to pay the cost of the investigation? It is not clear.  If they put up £200,000 security and the investigation costs £150,000, do they get £50,000 back? If it costs £50,000, do they get £150,000 back?  I see nothing about paying the money back to them.  It is for payment of costs of the investigation and you are estimating in advance.  As the Minister said, how does the court have any clue as to what the investigation is going to cost? The whole thing is clouded in mystery.</P>
    <P>You might have other members with you, you might have one-tenth of the shares in the company, but £200,000 is a formidable figure.  As an applicant, I will have no more idea of what the investigation is going to cost than a court would have; probably I will have less idea.  It could easily cost £150,000 or £200,000. How will I know?  The applicant should not have to pay the full cost of the investigation. If he fulfils the requirements in the section the court then has to be satisfied that he has grounds for investigation. Therefore, why should the person have to pay?  The person is not only helping himself, in the vast majority of cases he is helping a number of other people against a corrupt, inefficient company. The court decides an investigation is justified; therefore, under the Bill the applicant is performing as a good citizen. I do not understand why he should have to pay the cost.  Surely the costs will be shared with the company, and perhaps with the Minister, in the interests of ensuring that companies are run properly under the Bill?  Was the intention of putting in the provision that the applicant should pay the cost or most of the cost? <Col N="599" /> This brings me to Deputy Bruton's amendment about half the costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me express my appreciation of the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 4.  I would like to pursue amendment No. 6.  The Minister says it is not possible for the court to determine what is half of the cost of an investigation when the investigation has not yet commenced.  That stands to reason.  However, I understood that the way in which security being given would operate would be that you would lodge £200,000 in the court and if the investigation costs only £100,000 you would get your money back.  Obviously the effect of amendment No. 6 would arise only when the investigation was over and all the costs were seen to have been established. If half the cost was less than the amount the applicant had lodged he would get the difference back.  That is the way I see this amendment working.</P>
      <P>Perhaps instead of phrasing the amendment as I have put it by including that the applicant is required to give security of an amount not exceeding £200,000 or up to half the cost of the investigation, it might have been better to put in a second amendment, perhaps to section 13, which would provide something to the effect that in the case of security lodged by an applicant under section 7 (3) such proportion of the security shall be refunded which transpires to be in excess of half the cost of the investigation.  Perhaps the amendment should be put in there rather than where I have put it. Therefore, I propose on Report Stage to bring in an amendment to meet that sort of drafting difficulty raised by the Minister. However, the principle that an applicant should not have to pay more than half the cost is something I would like to pursue a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 171 of the Companies Act, 1963, which is being repealed by this Bill and is referred to in section 6 as being repealed.  I take it that it is being replaced by section 13 of the <Col N="600" /> Bill.  Section 13 provides that the following persons shall to the extent mentioned be liable to repay the costs of an investigation to the Minister for Justice: a person convicted of an offence arising from the investigation, a body corporate dealt with in the report &mdash; in other words, the subject of the investigation &mdash; and the applicant or applicants for the investigation. Let me make two points.  First, it is entirely uncertain where the cost is going to fall.  It is to be left to the court to decide afterwards who is going to pay the costs.  No one knows really.</P>
    <P>I presume if a prosecution is initiated nobody will know until the individual concerned has been convicted and sent to jail, which could be two years after the investigation was even completed.  Only at that stage would the court be able to decide who was going to pay the costs of the investigation.  That will have two or three consequences.  First, either people will hold out for their money for a long time or somebody will have to pay them, presumably the court, and the Minister for Justice will not be able to get his money back from them for a long time afterwards.  It is also going to be very difficult to know what the proportion is going to be in a case.  A peculiar situation will arise in which a person is convicted of a crime under company law and sent to jail and he will have to pay out of his personal assets the costs of the investigation that led to him being sent to jail.  It is rather like somebody who was convicted of burglary being asked to refund what he was found in possession of, serve a jail sentence and also pay the travelling expenses of the detectives who caught him.  It is a very unusual legal principle that a person convicted of a crime should, in addition to suffering the normal penalties under the criminal law, that is imprisonment, and the penalties under the civil law, that is refunding the goods or services of which they have deprived the victim should also have to pay the cost of the Government or police investigation.  It seems odd that we should have this provision in regard to a company law offence but not in regard to murder.  Nobody would suggest that <Col N="601" /> somebody who has committed a murder and is sent to jail for 25 years or whatever should be asked to pay out of his assets the costs of detectives who may have stalked him for two years before actually assembling the evidence.  It seems curious that this provision applies in regard to company law but does not apply to other aspects of the law.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on this.  I know he will come back, quick as a flash, and say that this has been on the Statute Book since 1963 and has not caused any problem.  That would not be a very good answer because this provision has never been used.  There has not been any investigation under the 1963 Act; the only investigation there was was under the 1803 Act and that took place in 1963 before the 1963 Act had become law.  There has been no investigation since.  So this curious provision has never been implemented in practice. It is a very odd principle of jurisprudence, to say the least.  If we are going to ask criminals to pay the cost of detection we should do it in respect of all crimes much as we are introducing confiscation of assets in regard to drug dealing.  If we are going to go after the assets of criminals we should go after the assets of all criminals, not just company law offenders and drug dealers, the only two categories I am aware of where this sort of personal assets liability applies.  What is so different about company law crimes to render them liable to this happening?</P>
    <P>There is what appears to be an omission in section 13 in regard to people who might have to pay towards the cost of an investigation.  Under the original section 171 any body corporate in whose names proceedings are brought on the conclusion of an investigation and who have, as a result of these proceedings, recovered property shall be liable to the costs of the investigation.  As I see it that does not re-appear in section 13.  It would deal with the legitimate point made by Deputy Mac Giolla that where one creditor initiates an investigation, the result of which benefits a whole lot of other creditors, and there is not provision whereby the costs of the investigation would be shared, the creditor who initiates the <Col N="602" /> investigation could end up paying the entire cost of the investigation.  That is not a reasonable legal principle.  We are in totally uncharted waters because no such investigation has occurred.  Indeed, we may be wasting our time because it may well be that this whole part of the Bill will be so much of a dead letter. We might be better off removing it and having a shorter Bill; but it is there now and we have to do the best we can with it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things we would need to do and one of them is to try to establish a clearer indication as to the likely proportions in which costs would be attributed as between various parties under section 13.  One purpose of my amendment No. 6 today is to limit the amount that an applicant should pay to half the total cost.  I would ask the Minister to look at this again.  If he cannot accept this amendment, which I can see might have unintended effects, could he accept the principle that an applicant should not have to pay more than half of the costs and that if the security exceeds half of the costs he would get a refund? Would the Minister be prepared to accept that as a general principle, remembering that the investigation will only occur if the court thinks it is a good idea that there should be one?  It is not as if the applicant can simply cause the other party to have to pay a lot of costs simply by taking an action.  The court has first to agree with him that the investigation should occur.  It is not like a situation where I might sue Deputy McCreevy and it is a totally foolish action which is decided in Deputy McCreevy's favour and his costs and mine are paid by me. In that situation nobody can stop me taking a court case; but in this case there is a stop before the investigation takes place in that the court must decide that there should be an investigation.  There has to be some good reason for the investigation or it will be thrown out by the court.  Against the background of there being sufficient evidence to satisfy the court that there should be an investigation, to say that the applicant could be liable to pay the entire cost seems to <Col N="603" /> be going too far.  This could be one of the key reasons this whole part of the Bill will be a total dead letter because nobody will take the risk of initiating an investigation. Let me quote from Mr. Justice Ronan Keane on this whole matter, at page 295 of <i>Company Law in the Republic of Ireland:</i></P>
    <P>The powers conferred on the Minister by Part V of the Principal Act have rarely been invoked.  Indeed the only investigation of any consequence into a company's affairs in modern times was carried out under the corresponding provisions of the 1908 Act. This is presumably because where matters have reached the stage at which an investigation might be appropriate, those concerned prefer to petition for the winding up of the company or for the alternative remedy under s 205, rather than go down the lengthy and uncertain road of a departmental inquiry. It is all the more surprising in these circumstances to find that one of the proposals apparently under consideration at the time of writing for incorporation in amending legislation is the extension of the investigation procedure.  It is apparently contemplated that the court, rather than the Minister, will have the power to appoint inspectors.  It is also suggested that the powers of the inspectors as to the obtaining of evidence will be strengthened.  It remains to be seen what form these proposals will take, but the history of the procedure under the Principal Act does not inspire much confidence in such proposals as providing a more effective remedy for abuses of company law.</P>
    <P>  In other words, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, who is the leading expert in terms of publication on company law in Ireland, is extremely sceptical as to the value of this whole process.  It seems to me that one thing that will ensure this legislation will not be used is the prospect that an applicant, even though he might convince a court that an investigation was necessary, might end up having to bear the <Col N="604" /> entire costs of the investigation.  There is no certainty as to the apportionment of costs of such an investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has considerable business experience and I am sure he, like other Members, will agree that one thing that inhibits any move in the business arena is uncertainty.  People like to know the risks involved and like to minimise the parameters of the risk to something that is reasonably definite.  However, the parameters of the risk in terms of initiating an investigation of a company's affairs, in terms of the way one might have to meet the costs of an investigation, are so uncertain and broad that I do not think people will bother using the provisions, just as the provisions in section 171 of the 1963 Act ensured that nobody used those investigation proceedings.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge the Minister to see if he can accept amendment No. 6, perhaps in the context of making it an amendment to section 13 rather than an amendment to section 7.  I suggest that the Minister should consider introducing some guidelines as to the distribution of costs.  One way of doing this would be for either the Minister or, if that is not appropriate, the superior court rules to make a regulation which would set out guiding principles in terms of apportionment of costs of investigations under the legislation.  People would then know roughly where they stood; they would know the tolerance as to costs.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unreasonable to ask a company to pay a minimum share of the cost of an investigation into its affairs. If a company is not able to convince a court on the first day that an investigation should not take place then it is fair to say the company had something to answer for.  One way of approaching this would be to say that an applicant should pay not less than £500 and not more than half of the costs; that a company should pay towards the cost of an investigation not more than £10,000 and not more than half of the costs.  I suggest that we should say that a person convicted of an offence shall pay not less than £2,000 and not more than, say, one-third of the investigation and that a person benefiting from <Col N="605" /> the results of an investigation by the recovery of property shall pay not less than 10 per cent of the benefit received as a result of the investigation and not more than the proportion that their debt represented of the total debts of the company. The formula may sound complicated but a procedure like that is necessary or otherwise the investigation procedure may be another dead letter.</P>
    <P>When I was drafting this legislation as Minister there was so much involved that I did not have an opportunity to go into it in the depth that I would have liked. However, I am puzzled as to why we are bothering with the question of investigations when the main change is transferring this to the courts.  What is the point?  If we cannot try to address the reason why this procedure has not been used in a more fundamental way perhaps we should consider scrapping the whole thing.  My amendment tends to move in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Bruton has said.  We must try to visualise when investigations will take place.  I do not think any investigations took place under the provisions in the 1963 Act.  It is almost impossible to visualise when these powers will be used.  When a company goes into liquidation the Revenue Commissioners and other creditors will be aware of it.  If the company is guilty of some wrong the Minister has power under the 1963 Act to send in an investigator and, if necessary, institute a prosecution as a result of that investigation.  Section 8 of the Bill states that the Minister can apply to the courts to have an investigator appointed but a similar provision in the 1963 Act was not availed of.  I do not see any future Ministers aplying to the courts if they are satisfied that a company has done some wrong when their predecessors did not bother using that procedure since 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure should have been used in the past where the debts of companies were allowed to run up and directors took off with a lot of money.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill to correct the imbalances that have arisen in regard to such <Col N="606" /> activities.  I accept, as the Minister said, that it is necessary to include such provisions in the Bill because it may be necessary to use those powers, but it is difficult to understand who will use them other than the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is hard to visualise creditors using that provision because in my view they will simply apply for a liquidation in order to get some money.  Why should they bother using this provision when they may have to put up security which may cost them up to £200,000? They will collect whatever money they can and if they cannot get it through court judgments they will apply to have the company put into liquidation so that they will get a certain percentage in the pound.  I cannot visualise a situation where a creditor would go through this route to get his money back when he has other alternatives available.  There may be things I am not thinking about, if he went on this route he would not end up getting his money back and it could cost him additional money because he could be caught for security to the value of £200,000.</P>
    <P>Shareholders of very large companies might want an inspector appointed by the court in certain circumstances because they might feel they were being oppressed or that the company was run in a manner which was not beneficial to them.  There are already powers under the 1963 Act regarding the oppression of minority shareholders.  I cannot see a situation where the majority shareholder would be affected because his position is so strong in the first place &mdash; in a big company he is running the show in any event.  I do not see him applying to the court for the appointment of an inspector. In the case of small shareholders in the company it is unlikely that they would go this route because it would be too expensive.  What we are really thinking about are fairly large companies who have shareholdings in very large companies. If a company buys a 20 per cent shareholding in another company and it gets to the stage where the company is <Col N="607" /> run into the ground and things are going wrong, I visualise the situation where they might apply to the courts for the appointment of inspectors.  It might happen, but I doubt very much whether it would because if it got to that stage the company would be wound up and everyone paid off.</P>
    <P>We have strayed a little from Deputy Bruton's amendments.  A later subsection of section 13 is very disturbing. This is where the court can find, apportion the blame or whatever and where the applicant who has put up the security maybe liable for costs, or the court may direct that he should pay £50,000 costs and he has to put up security of £200,000.  There is a subsectior in section 13 which says that, if the court finds a shortfall from any of the other people to whom the court has apportioned the blame and they have no money to come up with, they cannot stand the poor devil who initiated the proceedings in the first instance the extra £150,000.  If there was an investigation which benefited everyone &mdash; and as I said earlier I find it difficult to visualise a situation where this would ever happen &mdash; then I do not think it would be fair that the person who commenced the proceedings should be penalised.  He is the only one who put up the money and everyone else benefits by the investigation. As I said earlier, I do not see this happening because it has never happened under the 1963 Act.  Nevertheless, it is important to have it there.</P>
    <P>Why not have an official administrator or an official investigator appointed under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce who could initiate investigations and do all this type of work?  I do not see either the Minister or any of these people ever applying for an investigation because there are a whole lot of other avenues they can follow and it would not be worth the cost.  Under the 1963 Act the Minister for Industry and Commerce could appoint an inspector&mdash;it was usually assumed that it would be an official from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Whom <Col N="608" /> do we expect that the courts are going to appoint as inspectors?  It has relevance for various sections in regard to expenses and so on.  Do they visualise that they will be officials from the Department of Industry and Commerce or will they be accountants or whatever or people who investigate companies and deal with liquidations? Whom do we visualise being appointed as inspectors?  Even though we are spending a certain amount of time on this amendment, investigation is a very important part of the Bill.  As I said a long time ago, it will not be used any more often than the powers of the 1963 Act which were available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the appointment of inspectors.  I do not see people rushing to the courts to do it under this section either; I am sure they will be very few and far between.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed at the view that this whole section might never be used because the section in the 1963 Act was not used.  If I seriously thought that would be the case I would be with the House in whisking all this out because it would be wasting the time for all of us.  However, there are some essential differences which will make a major difference.  The first thing we have to realise when investigating a company is that we are not setting up a procedure for someone who is owed a couple of hundred pounds to get their money back. There are other routes through which you can get your money back from a company &mdash;you can seek the winding up of the company or sue the company.  It is not meant to be a quick way of getting back the few bob that is owed from the company. That is not what it is all about, It is a full dress rehearsal of a formal investigation into a company.  The essential difference between the 1963 Act and this section is that we have transferred much of the action away from the Minister and given it to the courts.  The reasons that prevented Ministers moving quicker in the past will not exist here because the courts will be in a position to adjudicate much more speedily.  In the past actions by Ministers were held up by <Col N="609" /> legal debate and legal wrangle.  I would expect that this section would be used more often.  Having said that, it is not meant to be used as a normal everyday method of getting money back from a company.  This section is all about formally investigating the affairs of a company, sending in lawyers and accountants and carrying out a full formal investigation under the courts of the land in that company.  I would like to dispel the notion that this is supposed to be some easy quick way of getting money back from a company.  There are other routes for that.  It is not meant to be that.</P>

      <P>Obviously what I am saying is so interesting that the Deputies cannot resist interrupting.  We can speculate as to why the 1963 Act was not used. In relation to one of the changes I am now making, in regard to the figure of £200,000, under the 1963 Act an applicant could be caught for the total figure. If it costs £500,000 or £1 million, under the 1963 Act the applicant could get caught with having to pay all of that figure.  Deputy Bruton refers to certainty but let me point out that there is certainty, not at the level which the Deputy would wish it to be, in that the most the applicant would have to pay is £200,000. Under the 1963 Act he could have to pay £500,000 or £800,000.  There is certainty in that the most an applicant would have to pay is that figure, £200,000.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that I want to change all of the 1963 Act so that there would be a flood of investigations.  What I am saying is that we have attempted to alter the régime under the 1963 Act to make it easier, to bring the court on stage and so that there would be more certainty. Perhaps the reason for there being no applications is that people may not have been able to convince or would not be able to convince the courts that an inspector should be sent in.  I am not going to go out and drag people into the courts to make applications to have inspectors sent into companies.  This is a matter for the court to decide on when it sees the evidence presented to it.  In the past the ministerial system has not worked.  Now we are going to try the courts system.  We should not panic about the fact that there has been a lack of applicants.  Let us give this system a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me refer to a number of other points made.  Deputy Mac Giolla referred to the upper limit.  As now proposed, the upper limit would be £200,000.  If the investigation costs £500,000 or £800,000, the most the applicant would have to pay is £200,000.  Let us say that the investigation costs £800,000, the most the <Col N="612" /> applicant would be asked to pay is £200,000.  I also want to make it clear that we are not talking about asking someone to put their money away for a number of years until the costs become known. Security does not necessarily consist of money, it could also be insurance, bonds and so on.  We are not talking about leaving a sum of £200,000 aside for a couple of years until the court decides.  I say this to Deputy Mac Giolla in particular that I would not like it to be seen in this way: it is not meant to fend off applicants.  In many ways more protection will now be offered to the applicant than was the case under the previous Act.</P>
    <P>There is a question to be answered here by all of the Deputies who made points in regard to the figure of £200,000.  If the applicant does not pay, if the body who have been investigated do not pay, and if the convicted person is not in a position to pay, are we suggesting if an investigation costs £800,000 that the State should carry the can?  The question which I would have to throw back to the other side of the House is, who would pay for the cost of the investigation if the applicant and the other parties involved were not to be held liable for the cost?  It is important in referring to that figure of £200,000 that we ask ourselves: what about the balance?</P>

      <P>The Deputy should refer that question to the Minister for Justice.  I am dealing with company legislation. Under section 13 and arising out of section 7 any person who is convicted, any body corporate or an applicant could be held liable.  What I am trying to do is to allow the court to apportion blame, if there is blame to be apportioned.  The court would be able to lay a figure of anything up to £200,000 on the applicant. The court would be able to apportion the costs between the person convicted, the body being investigated and the applicant but the applicant would only be asked to pay a figure of up to £200,000.  Arguably, the applicant would be most protected in that an upper limit would be laid down. The court should be free to decide on how to apportion the blame as between the various parties but one cannot apportion the blame through some fixed formula in advance as the Deputy envisages. It makes more sense to allow the court to decide on how to apportion the blame as between the convicted person, the body who have been investigated and the applicant, with an upper ceiling of £200,000 in the case of the applicant.  I am not going to quibble with the Deputy but I cannot accept the wording of the Deputy's amendment as it does not make the position clear enough.  It could still cost the applicant £200,000.  I take it that is so?</P>

      <P>There were a number of other points made and I would like to respond to them.  It is sensible that we allow the court to decide on any figure below £200,000.  The court may decide on a figure of £5,000 or £20,000 or any other figure below £200,000.  Following <Col N="615" /> an investigation, the court should be in a position to apportion blame as between three groups of people.  It would be a good idea to allow the court to decide and for us not to try to decide it here. The court should be allowed to decide where the blame lies as between those three different groups of people, a person convicted, the company or the applicant. The maximum figure is £200,000 and it is not the case that that figure is going to be applied in all cases.  I would not want that figure to discourage anyone from making an application.  If anything, it should encourage them because unlike the position under the previous Act, they now know that the most they will have to pay is £200,000 and I am sure they can rely on the court to ensure that there will be fair play.</P>

      <P>I think we have over debated this section.  An awful lot of time has been lost in debating this section which I and many other Deputies regard as being very important.  The Minister of State in his last remarks put the question as to who should pay the cost.  That is a question which has not been addressed in this section.  The Minister of State did make one very good point, that the court should apportion the blame.  If the Minister of State can satisfy me that there is something in the section or something later in the Bill which says that the investigation having taken place and a sum of money having been lodged in the court, the court can apportion the costs, then I will be happy.  As has been pointed out, first, the applicant may be doing a tremendous lot of good for other people who will benefit and, second, the company may have been lax in adhering to various procedures they should have adhered to and the investigation having taken place, the court may think it justified to allocate a share of the cost to the company.  Perhaps the Minister will say whether he thinks it necessary to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which would provide that an investigation having taken place the court could allocate or share out the costs.  This would <Col N="616" /> be helpful and the applicant would not feel he has to take all the stick and blame and carry all the costs.</P>

      <P>Under section 13 of the Bill, there are three groups of people over which the costs can be apportioned by the court and I think what the Deputy wants to achieve is provided for in that section.  The court can apportion the costs over any person who is convicted, any body corporate &mdash; that is the company being investigated &mdash; and the applicant. We are putting an upper limit of £200,000 on the applicant.  We are all talking about an applicant as though he is an individual &mdash; and that may be the case &mdash; but an applicant may also be a very powerful wealthy company, and likely to be so in many cases.</P>

      <P>If this section is to be used I believe it will only be used by big powerful companies who have a stake in other companies.  That is the only sector who will ever use this section.  With regard to section 13, the costs in the first instance will be borne by the Minister for Justice.  They can then be apportioned down along the line and if there is a big shortfall the Minister for Justice will pay up&mdash;and effectively this is the State and the taxpayers.  This is the point I was making earlier about the most likely group of people who will ask the court to appoint inspectors.  Like the Minister I believe it will be a big company who have a shareholding in another company.  I do not visualise that it will be used by anyone else.  I understand why Part II of the Bill deals with investigations &mdash; the concept behind it is very good and worthwhile&mdash; but in reality it is hard to visualise this Part of the Bill being used by anyone other than those people I mentioned earlier. There will still be thousands of cases where investigations could and should take place but due to the costs involved will not take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old system in the 1963 Act, which was never utilised, investors would have written to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking for an inspector to be appointed because they knew there <Col N="617" /> were wrong doings in a company. However, because of the reasons outlined earlier by the Minister no inspector was even appointed.  There is provision in later sections of the Bill, particularly in section 8, whereby the Minister can apply to the court to appoint an inspector but I do not think he will do that.  Why should he bear the costs involved if it is not a matter involving wrong-doings against the public interest, which should be his prime consideration?  Because the Minister did not do this in the past when he had direct power to do so, I cannot see him doing it now.  However, this will not negative the fact that there will be thousands of instances where a full investigation of a company's affairs should be carried out and I believe an official investigator should be appointed &mdash; and this proposal has been put forward over the years by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, of which I am a member&mdash; to investigate the kind of things we all know really go on in companies.  The official investigator could, like the Director of Public Prosecutions in criminal law, receive complaints from people who believe that a company is being maliciously run that there is evidence of wrongdoing in the company and that people have got away with thousands of pounds, having done the taxpayer and everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is unnecessary.  I want to ask a question: if there was no procedure for the investigation of companies, would we be introducing something like this?  The answer is probably no.  We would certainly not be introducing a procedure whereby one has to go to a court to appoint an investigator who produces a report, on the foot of which prosecutions are eventually taken or the company is wound-up.  If we were going about this sensibly I do not believe we would adopt such a cumbersome procedure.  I do not think we need this system of investigation of companies and the only reason it is being <Col N="619" /> introduced is that it was in the 1963 Act and there is a certain residual affection for anything in the 1963 Act &mdash; and the Department are reluctant to throw it out completely.</P>
      <P>I believe that one should first establish in the law the purpose for which investigations of this kind would be conducted. There are no criteria laid down in section 7 which set out the basis for having investigations under the section.  All the section says is that &ldquo;the court may appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of the company and report there-on&rdquo;. It does not say &ldquo;The court may appoint inspectors if it is satisfied there is a need for it on the basis of the following criteria...&rdquo; It does not say, nor does the Minister or anyone else, say that the existing procedures for dealing with company affairs &mdash; that is, normal investigation by the Minister leading to a prosecution or normal investigation of the affairs of the company when it is being wound-up by the liquidator leading to a prosecution, are inadequate for finding out offences.  The sensible way of detecting offences &mdash; if that is the purpose of these investigations &mdash; is for the Minister to appoint an official investigator who would, in the same way as the Fraud Squad in the Garda or any other people involved in detecting offences, go into a company, investigate it, collect the evidence and initiate prosecution, or alternatively leave it to liquidators when companies are being liquidated to detect offences, or alternatively, as I suggest in another amendment, the Minister should be capable of moving to wind-up a company.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Candidates for the post of director of the National Museum were interviewed on 24 November by a panel set up by the Civil Service Commission.  Corresponding interviews for the post of director of the National Library will be held on 14 December.  The posts should be filled early in 1989.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance of the posts in question, very careful consideration was given to devising an appropriate job specification in each case.  That process required detailed consultation with union representatives and other interested parties. It was also considered appropriate to defer publication of the advertisement for the director posts until the resumption of the academic year, thereby bringing the competition to the notice of the widest possible number of potential applicants.</P>

Would the Taoiseach agree that it is a very retrogade <Col N="621" /> step not only for these two institutions but also for a third institution, the National Gallery, which was originally in my question, that there should be vacant for so long the posts of directors when so much work needs to be done?

      <P>The chairman of the board of the National Concert Hall wrote on 23 March 1987 to seek lottery funding over a three year period for a number of capital projects at the National Concert Hall, including the provision of a pipe organ at a cost of approximately £300,000.

        <i>Limerick West):</i> Members of the Army Observer Corps have not been co-operating with members of the armed forces of NATO countries in nuclear fallout exercises.  With our Civil Defence Organisation, they have participated for many years in exercises involving the British Warning and Monitoring Organisation, which is under the control of the British Home Office.  The purpose of these exercises is to ensure that the necessary communications, including telephone links, are operating.</P>
      <P>There are contacts between our Civil Defence and similar organisations abroad to secure information on nuclear bursts and fallout patterns which is vital to their role of protection of civilian lives in wartime.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> An amount of £12.8 million is being included in a Supplementary Estimate on the Defence Vote, which will shortly come before the House, to cover the purchase of two Peacock class patrol vessels and some spares for the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service has personnel to man the two vessels.  I am making arrangements, however, to have 100 additional personnel recruited for the Naval Service to offset wastage in numbers and to meet the extra requirements for personnel arising from the acquisition of the vessels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether the Army Engineering Corps has the expertise and resources to allow it take control of the national power system in an emergency; whether a modern army should have the capacity to maintain essential supplies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As I have stated in reply to previous questions raised by the Deputy, the Corps of Engineers do not have the expertise necessary to operate the ESB generating stations. As regards the question of the Army maintaining essential supplies, the position is that the Government have in specific emergency situations in the past directed that the Defence Force should assist in maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community. <Col N="641" /> The provision of such assistance at any given time is, understandably, dependent on the availability of resources and skills within the force and having regard to prior operational commitments.  A notable example was where the Army provided an emergency fire service in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire during the firemen's strike earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has again confirmed that the Army do not have the capacity to man ESB power stations and provide an electricity supply when there is an emergency or a strike. Is the Minister satisfied that this State should be left with no defence and no alternative plans in the event of an emergency arising?  If the Minister accepts what I have said would he not consider that he is grossly negligent in his duties to allow that situation to prevail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i>&ldquo;No&rdquo; is the answer to the last part of the Deputy's question.  A committe under the Department of Energy constantly deals with this question.  The situation is monitored from time to time.  I am telling the Deputy the situation as it prevails at the present time. We cannot afford to have another body standing by in the event of an emergency that may never happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we afford not to have a body standing by?  I am not aware that the Army are standing by.  They have other duties to perform in the normal course of events.  Surely the Minister should ensure that the army will be trained and given the relevant expertise to go into our power stations and operate them in the event of an emergency?  Does the Minister not agree that every other European country has such a capacity available and would the Minister not further consider that a modern army should be equipped to man power stations?  I have made the point about the Minister being grossly negligent in his duties in not ensuring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 22 together.  The special widows' and children's contributory pension scheme for non-commissioned officers and privates introduced in 1978 is based on a similar scheme introduced for the public service. Members are required to pay the appropriate contributions to ensure that their families qualify for the benefits under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, contributions take the form of (a) periodic contributions, which are deducted from pay; and (b) non-periodic contributions, which are deducted from gratuity.  Non-periodic contributions are made in respect of each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 31 years, for which deductions are not made.</P>
      <P>No change in these arrangements is proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Defence Forces (pensions) schemes provide for the payment of a special increment of £2.33 a week for each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years, up to a maximum of 31 years. As a general rule, this special increment <Col N="651" /> continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension or to a contributory old age pension, at which stage the special increment is withdrawn. As the social welfare pension is greater than the special increment, the pensioner is financially better off when he receives that pension even though the special increment is withdrawn.  His total income is then much greater than 50 per cent of his Army pay.</P>
      <P>Service pensions for non-commissioned Army personnel are non-contributory and are payable out of public funds.  The State as the employer of the soldier also makes a substantial contribution to the social insurance fund from which the social welfare pensions are paid.  Hence, the State is entitled to take into account such a pension in determining the rates of non-contributory service pensions.</P>
      <P>In this respect, soldiers are treated more favourably than other State employees whose rates of occupational pensions are calculated having regard to their social welfare entitlements so that their total income from public funds does not exceed 50 per cent of their pay.</P>
      <P>No change in the present practice is proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that an anomaly exists in the payment of pensions to non-commissioned Army personnel compared with other civil servants such as teachers, gardaí and many others?  It has been stated that the deduction is made because the State as an employer has contributed to the pension, but that hardly seems reasonable, when in fact this is the only category of person in the State to whom this condition applies when qualifying for a pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> That is not correct, Deputy.  The amounts referred to, that is the basic pension and the long service increment of 5p per week for each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years, but not exceeding 31 years, are paid to the pensioner during <Col N="652" /> his lifetime.  However, the additional increment mentioned, that is the additional £2.33 a week, terminates when the soldier reaches 66 years, the age prescribed for a contributory old age pension or when he becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension at 65 years of age under the Social Welfare Acts.  The additional increment would, however, continue to be paid if, without his own default, the soldier fails to qualify for a contributory old age pension.  As a special concession the additional increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner discharged before 1 August 1978 provided he is not in receipt of the social welfare retirement pension.</P>

Certainly, there is no demand within the Army for such a representative body.  As I have said, it would be incompatible with Army structures and the systems that soldiers have to operate under.  Of course, I know that the conditions of service of members are under constant and sympathetic consideration with a view to effecting any improvements which are regarded as necessary.  Indeed, the recent pay review which was set up by the Government is an example of that.</P>

      <P>I respectfully suggest that it is not contrary to the DFR.  In each country in Europe, of which we are now supposed to be a member, there are representative bodies&mdash;even within the UK, our nearest neighbour &mdash; within the <Col N="654" /> armed forces to convey their views.  The best example of a representative body in European terms is the fact that half the total membership of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster were serving members in the defence forces.</P>

    <Title>European Council in Rhodes: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I attended the European Council in Rhodes on 2 and 3 December with Deputy Brian Lenihan, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was also in attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Against the background of the Community's renewed momentum towards the single market, the main items discussed at the meeting were: (1) progress towards the internal market; (2) the role of the Community in the world and certain political co-operation items; (3) the environment; and (4) audio visual policies. I have had copies of the presidency conclusions laid before the House.</P>
    <P>Following the decisive breakthrough at our meeting in Brussels last February on the major packet of reforms contained in the Delors Plan, our meeting in Rhodes devoted some time to examining the prospects for the further development of the Community and its place in the world. In this context, we noted with satisfaction that the progress made in implementing the Single European Act was already beginning to create a new dynamism in the Community's economy &mdash; economic growth in the Community this year is likely to be the strongest since the end of the seventies with the growth in investment the highest for over two decades while inflation should be down to the levels obtaining in the sixties.  However, while unemployment has started to decline, it is still at an unacceptably high level.</P>
    <P>At the Rhodes Council we had before us the mid-term report from the Commission on the progress achieved in the implementation of the internal market programme.  This report indicates that, of the 279 proposals required to be submitted from the Commission about 90 per cent will be tabled by the end of 1988. The shape of Europe as it will be after 31 December 1992 will soon be clearly apparent.  At present the Council has adopted one-third of these measures; if one adds &ldquo;common positions&rdquo; the proportion rises to almost 40 per cent.  The Commission hopes that by the end of the year this figure will have reached 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In some areas progress has been good &mdash; particularly in relation to the removal of technical barriers to trade in goods and services and in the liberalisation of capital movements.</P>
    <P>In services, and in financial services in <Col N="685" /> particular, important advances have been made.  The Council has adopted the far-reaching second non-life insurance directive. All measures needed to create a European-wide banking market have now been tabled including the crucially important second banking co-ordination directive; and all measures required for the complete liberalisation of capital movements have been adopted.  The directive liberalising long-term capital movements is already in force.</P>
    <P>Work on public procurement, which accounts for such a significant proportion of economic activity in the Community, is now also making progress, and the directive providing for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications has every prospect of being adopted by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Community regulations governing the Structural Funds, which will double in real terms for the less prosperous regions by 1992, are now expected to be fully in place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Work on our national development plan that will provide the strategic framework to enable Ireland to benefit from these funds in a fully co-ordinated manner is now well advanced.  The plan will be completed early in 1989 so that we can take the maximum advantage of the new arrangements.  The plan will essentially consist of national and sub-national expenditure programmes that will serve as Ireland's application for European Structural Fund assistance for the years from 1989 to 1993.</P>
    <P>A special effort will be made to outline for the private sector how private participation will be possible either through public-private partnerships or through strictly commercial private investment which will attract European Community matching funds.  The kind of projects envisaged include toll roads and bridges, marinas, caravan parks, tourist and leisure facilities, heritage and cultural centres, science parks and forestry projects.</P>
    <P>Work is also well advanced in each of the seven sub-national or regional areas throughout the country on identifying strategies and projects for those areas to be incorporated within the framework of <Col N="686" /> the total funds available to Ireland as an Objective No. 1 region.  As a result there will be for the first time an input and margin for choice by those at that sub-national level in determining the content of the sub-national applications for European Structural Funds for the five years to 1993.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall from our debate in the House last May that the Cecchini report identified the major economic advantages for the Community as a whole from the achievement of the internal market.  I am particularly pleased that one of my main criticisms of that report has now been responded to and, at Rhodes, the European Council called on the Commission to supplement the Cecchini report with an analysis of the macro-economic effects of the internal market on the Community's regions.</P>
    <P>At Rhodes, we singled out for priority attention the areas of transport and energy, animal and plant health and the free movement of persons in addition to the other areas which we had listed at Hanover.  The inclusion of transport reflects my concern to ensure that the second phase in the liberalisation of air transport should provide for the removal of existing constraints and limitations and for a further significant step in the liberalisation of this sector.</P>
    <P>Each of these areas is of considerable importance to us.  We have a high animal and plant health status and agriculture is vital to our economy.  We have to protect that status which is a valuable asset for the Community at large.  Consequently, we believe that removal of controls on movement of plants and animals should be preceded by actions necessary to attain a uniform high level of animal and plant health throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Many countries have difficulties in relation to fiscal harmonisation.  VAT rates in the Community in 1987 vary from 1 per cent in Belgium to 38 per cent in Italy.  For Ireland, harmonisation of indirect taxes which concentrates solely on the structures, rates and technical arrangements, runs the risk of neglecting the wider issues which the proposals raise <Col N="687" /> for some member states.  We will continue to urge, therefore, that regard be had to the development and cohesion objectives of the Treaty, and that the Commission's review of its proposals must ensure that our difficulties of a budgetary, economic and social kind will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>In relation to the free movement of persons, the Council took note of the real difficulties of attaining the Community's objectives and especially the area without internal frontiers.  Progress here is linked to progress on the intergovernmental co-operation to combat terrorism, international crime and drug trafficking.  The Council agreed that this co-operation will be stepped up to achieve rapid and concrete results and turn Europe into a tangible reality for its citizens.  The Council agreed that each of us would appoint a person responsible for the necessary co-ordination.</P>
    <P>On the social dimension, we renewed our commitment to ensuring that the internal market will be for the benefit of all our citizens, and we identified a number of particular aspects which need to be taken into account in the Community's work programme in this area. The development of transport infrastructure was also singled out for attention which, of course, is of particular importance for us, given our peripheral situation and needs in this area.</P>
    <P>On the environment, we agreed that solutions are urgently needed to such global issues as the depletion of the ozone layer, the rise in the temperature &mdash; or the &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo;&mdash; threats to the natural environment, the problem of water resources, soil erosion, safe management of toxic chemicals and waste, air pollution and problems of urban areas. On my proposal, it was agreed to add the Irish Sea as one of the seas and coastal regions requiring special attention.</P>
    <P>What was particularly striking at Rhodes was the spontaneous philosophical discussions we had about the future shape of the Community, with particular reference to its people and its cultural diversity and development. <Col N="688" /> Deputies will see from the Presidency's Conclusions the emphasis placed on the importance of the development of Europe's audio-visual capacity and that the Community's work programme in this area should take account of the recent progress made in finalising the draft Council of Europe Convention on Transfrontier Broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We endorsed the proposals from the French Government for the convening next spring of an international meeting of all the parties concerned to develop the audio-visual market on a European scale.  It is important that we derive maximum economic benefit from this lucrative market which is estimated to exceed $100 billion by 1991 as well as exploit its potential to strengthen European culture in all its aspects, including the needs of minority languages where Irish was again singled out for specific mention by President Mitterrand.  Co-operation in this area clearly needs to be intensified and involve all countries in Europe, otherwise the market will be dominated by outside influences.</P>
    <P>On its international role, the Council stressed, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Community will be a partner, not a fortress Europe, that it will be open to the world and that it will seek to strengthen economic and political relations with the OECD countries and co-operation with other countries and regional groups.  The Twelve pledged to strengthen the effectiveness of the United Nations and to contribute actively to its peace-keeping role.  The Council re-affirmed their determination to strive to overcome East-West division in Europe within the framework of the CSCE process and set out the objectives of their policy towards the countries of Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Council also discussed the situation in the Middle East.  They reaffirmed their welcome for the acceptance by the Palestine National Council of the Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for an international conference as well as its explicit rejection of terrorism.  Recalling the Twelve's statement of 30 November requesting the US to review its refusal to grant an entry <Col N="689" /> visa to the PLO leader, Mr. Arafat, we agreed that the Twelve should be represented by permanent representatives from New York as well as the Presidency Foreign Minister, when the UN General Assembly re-convenes in Geneva to consider the question of Palestine.</P>
    <P>We called on the Lebanese parties to renew their attempts at an agreement which would make it possible to elect a new President and expressed our wish that the intercommunal talks on the future of Cyprus, which are being conducted under the aegis of the UN Secretary-General, will lead rapidly to a solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>At the end of the Council, I met with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, for about an hour.  The convention in now established that the details of these discussions are not publicised.  I can, however, say that at Rhodes the discussion was wide ranging and covered a number of issues, including extradition, fair employment, security co-operation and the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. We also talked about Community issues which had come up at the Council. The discussion took place in a realistic atmosphere and views were exchanged openly and frankly.  On extradition, I expressed disquiet at the fact that each case now seems to become politicised, and this affects the whole background and is a matter of serious concern in its effects on the legal process and the rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>The arrangements and the ambience for the Council were excellent, and I would like to take this opportunity of placing on record my appreciation of the hospitality and efficiency of the Greek Presidency in Rhodes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's review of the outcome of the European Council meeting in Rhodes gives us an opportunity to examine where we stand in relation to the development of the European Community and the move towards a unified market.  The Government's approach to planning for the use of extra EC investment funds is seriously deficient.  The economic interests that have to produce <Col N="690" /> the jobs and the extra output are not properly involved in the planning process. Consultation of public representatives and consultation of representative groups is no more than a sham.  There is a serious risk that the deficiencies in the planning process will prevent us from getting as much investment assistance as we need and as the Community is prepared to provide.  If that happens our regions will suffer still further and there will be fewer new jobs for our people.</P>
      <P>The Government, so far as I can see, have carried out no systematic study into the economic and social consequences here of the 1992 programme.  They are working on the basis of best guesses and that is not planning.  It is clear from the Taoiseach's remarks that relations between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister are cold &mdash; not wanting to put it any more bluntly than that.  It is not enough for the Taoiseach to say, as he said last Sunday, that there will be difficulties for as long as there is a problem in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach has a duty that goes far beyond that, a duty to work towards the resolution of that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined the conclusions of the Presidency in some detail.  Following that I can only describe the outcome of the European Council meeting as disappointing. It was disappointing for the European Community as a whole because rather than resolving any of the outstanding issues in relation to the whole 1992 enterprise, it saw the raising of a new obstacle by the French President in relation to taxes on savings and it witnessed a further reiteration of the UK Prime Minister's opposition to the necessary process of indirect tax harmonisation. The outcome was disappointing for this country and, indeed, for the other less developed regions of the Community in that no further progress was made in giving practical expression to the obligations taken on by the Community under the Single European Act to pursue a conscious and active <Col N="691" /> policy of favouring the development of low income regions.</P>
    <P>One of the decisions reportedly made by the Council is to appoint a national co-ordinator in each member state to speed up preparations for the complete removal of internal frontier controls after 1992.  Frankly, I have to say that the rest of us had all understood that this was already in hand and in our own case we had been led to understand that this role was being carried out by the Minister of State at the Taoiseach's Department, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  Now we must ask if a new co-ordinator is being appointed?  What has the Minister of State been doing up to now?  If she is already co-ordinating why do we need another co-ordinator?  I would suggest, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is time the Government got their thinking straight on this matter and made clear what is happening.  We had another case, only a week or two ago, when we were told in this House that the Minister for the Environment was going to co-ordinate some of the work of the Minister for Finance but when we asked a question in the House the soft shoe shuffle appeared to have been done and the Minister for Finance had shuffled the deck back in his favour.  I do not know what is going on between them and I do not know if the Taoiseach knows what is going on between the two of them.  I am afraid that this Government's record on co-ordinating their own activities is not good and I am not at all convinced that they will co-ordinate our European action properly either.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be well to keep his voice <i>sotto voce</i>.  I must agree, however, that in the case of this Government at least there is a need to strengthen the structures that have been put forward to prepare for 1992 and they need strengthening from several points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures that have been put in <Col N="692" /> place will not ensure any real involvement in planning on the part of the people who have to make the plans work in practice.  I would like to make the point that before coming down to the Chamber I read again the answer given by the then Minister for Finance on 25 October in which he outlined the structures.  The more you look at them the barer they become.  The national and regional plans will, in fact, be drawn up by the Department of Finance and the European Commission. Local authority managers who are nominally involved in the process will have no real say.  I do not believe there is a Deputy in this House who has met a local authority manager, supposedly involved in this process, who believes he has any real role to play.  The people who are the living links that turn the national economy into a living entity have no involvement at all in planning.  Here I speak of workers, managers, managing directors, self-employed people, farmers, educators and all the people whose activity, when added together, makes up the national economy.  None of the people who are charged with the task, however perfectly or imperfectly they carry it out, of turning popular desire into political action and of tailoring political action in the public interest, will have any influence on the plans.  I am speaking here of members of local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas.  The whole planning machine will motor on without the slightest input from those people.</P>
    <P>Consultative structures have been set in place and as I have said they are only a sham.  Day after day we hear that opinion being voiced by the very people who are themselves being consulted.  Now we find the Minister for Finance in hot water with the association of municipal authorities because he cannot even organise those sham consultations in an efficient way. He puts in a totally artificial population criteria on the local authorities that he will &ldquo;consult&rdquo;.  I have heard reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the outcome of the European Council meeting because the European Council had rather a lot to say about its hopes for Europe and what was going to be done under this new planning process that is being set up.  If the Deputy's patience is wearing as thin as the top of his head then I will not detain him in the House.  I have heard reports, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, of some of the meetings that have been organised up and down the country by the Government under this slogan, EUROPEN.  Time after time I have heard it said that the only area of economic activity that gets any attention from Government speakers is manufacturing activity.  That is clearly a very important part of the whole picture but it is only a part.  A great many of the 1992 directives will, of course, have fundamental effects on manufacturing industry but there is also the whole range of service activities ranging from activities that are already in place to new ones that we should develop as was envisaged in the project the Taoiseach mentioned on the audio-visual side and, indeed, as my colleague Deputy Richard Bruton has recently proposed.</P>
      <P>According to the reports I hear of those meetings very little attention is given to the whole area of infrastructure planning. Yet this must obviously be a very high priority in integrated development plans and it must be given very particular attention if we are to turn the results of the Single European Act into real benefits and more jobs for our people.</P>
      <P>It is not enough for the Government to agree with the other governments in the Community that each member state will appoint a person responsible for the necessary co-ordination.  There is no point in appointing another person to co-ordinate if there is no clear view in the Government's mind as to what has to be co-ordinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading through the conclusions of the Presidency it is difficult to see what the real purpose of the meeting was.  The Taoiseach has said that the most extraordinary thing to happen at the summit was a major philosophical discussion led by President Mitterrand and Chancellor <Col N="694" /> Kohl about what kind of Europe they would like to see emerge.  That discussion apparently took place in the context of President Mitterrand's proposal on audio-visual developments.  I am sure that may well have been quite fascinating and I know that both the President and the Chancellor are compelling speakers, each in his own way, but that was not the business of the European Council. I would have thought that the proper business of the Council was to push forward with the 1992 enterprise in some concrete terms but that does not seem to have happened.</P>
    <P>One of the conclusions is that the European Council expects the Council rapidly to complete the adoption of a number of directives aimed at completing the internal market.  Public contracts, banking and financial services, the approximation of technical standards and intellectual property were singled out for particular mention.  Of course they should all be tackled but what I find disquieting about all of this is that there is no public information as to what our Government's view is in relation to any one of these issues.</P>
    <P>During the course of a similar discussion in this House after a previous European Council meeting I underlined the necessity for the Government to consult widely, both inside and outside of this House, on the approach we must take to each one of these directives.  From the contacts I have in one sector &mdash; to mention only one &mdash; banking and financial services, I have come to the conclusion that they are not sure what the Government have in mind and I am forced to the conclusion that the Government themselves are not sure of what they have in mind for the development of that particular sector and how we fit our banking and financial sector into an integrated market in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The conclusions point out that the European Council is now urgently appealing to the Council of Ministers to step up its efforts in areas where progress has not been so rapid.  Areas singled out for particular mention are transport and <Col N="695" /> energy, and animal and plant health controls. Here again we need some clarity and some definition as to what the Government have in mind.  The Taoiseach particularly mentioned animal health controls but he has not spelt out what the Government have in mind, what objectives they have in mind.  It is all very fine to come into this House and say that before any harmonisation can take place we must make sure that everybody has attained the same standards we have attained but what is the Taoiseach doing to make sure this is going to happen? What are the Government's plans for influencing the other member states so that they attain the same high plateau of quality we have attained?  That is what the enterprise is all about and that is what the Taoiseach should be telling us about in this House today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned transport policy, air transport only, mind you.  I would like to know if the Taoiseach and the Government have any particular ideas about other forms of transport, such as surface transport and sea transport which are so important to our industry. Are there any proposals in this regard? Do the Government have any proposals in relation to intra Community road transport or will they be tempted to go down the old derogation line again, something that will eventually work to the disadvantage of our industry?  All of these areas need to be teased out and again I would have thought that presenting a report of what happened at a European Council meeting would have offered an appropriate opportunity for the Taoiseach to at least indicate what the main lines of Government thinking are in this area.  We hear time after time, in area after area, that the Government are not bringing forward proposals in relation to transport, banking and other areas because they are not yet sure of what is facing them in the context of the 1992 enterprise.  That is not the way to go about it.  The Government should now be planning what we are going to do to fit each of those sectors for the kind of <Col N="696" /> world we are going to be living in from 1992 onwards.</P>
    <P>The Council stressed the need for progress in intergovernmental co-operation to combat terrorism, international crime, drug trafficking and trafficking of all kinds.  I am bound to say that the recent record of this Government in intergovernmental co-operation in combating terrorism is not impressive, to say the least.  For example, I believe that this House made the wrong decision last night and in the light of this I am not at all hopeful that the Government on our behalf will throw themselves whole-heartedly behind the major effort required to step up international co-operation against terrorism.  Do the Government have any idea as to how this might be done in an integrated Europe without internal frontiers?  Will this Government take the steps required to use the manpower which will be made available following the abolition of customs controls and convert it into an effective force to combat terrorism, drug trafficking and so on?  Are there any proposals for using what will then be surplus manpower for any one of these important jobs?</P>
    <P>The European Council called on the Council to speed up its work so that tax measures to the extent that they are necessary for the establishment and operation of the internal market can be adopted in accordance with the timetable set.  I am afraid that we will have to regard that as a pious aspiration.  We can now see that there are forces in the European Council pulling in different directions. This is neatly illustrated by the reference to tax measures to the extent that they are necessary for the establishment and operation of the internal market.  President Mitterrand said apparently that it would be difficult for France to implement complete freedom of capital movements from 1 January 1990 unless there was agreement by then on Community-wide approximation of savings tax rates.  On the other hand the British Prime Minister apparently reiterated her view that Community decisions in the area of indirect tax harmonisation are <Col N="697" /> not necessary to complete the internal market.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to find themselves in the middle of that titanic struggle, presumably being pulled in all directions at once without any clear express view as to how we should go about preparing ourselves for that process. Time and again I and other members of my party have insisted on the need to plan our participation in the harmonisation of indirect taxes, to plan it now and to set it in train in the 1989 budget.  So far as I can see, the Government so far have shown only the faintest understanding of how important that whole process is going to be for us.  The Government should now be planning and beginning to execute a political campaign to ensure that the necessary transitional budgetary arrangements are put in place in the Community so that we can begin the process of aligning our excise duty rates and our VAT rates with the common European target rates.  They should now be planning each stage of that process with a clear view of the budgetary implications, year by year, and a clear view as to how those implications are to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The European Council laid some stress on the necessity to ensure progess by strengthening economic and social cohesion.  I am glad to see emphasis being placed on social cohesion in particular.  It is encouraging to see that the European Council recognises the need to contribute towards putting the available human resources to the best use.  I think that what this means is they want to provide more jobs in the Community.  Because of the language of these conclusions it is inevitable that we come out with that kind of phraseology but I think that is what they mean and I am glad to see that being mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Council emphasised in that connection the crucial importance of reforming training schemes, including vocational training.  That is an area which will be of particular importance to us given the daunting level of our unemployment and our levels of emigration. Here again I would like to hear from <Col N="698" /> the Government what plans they have to modify, up-date and recast our training schemes so that we can obtain maximum advantage from this stated view of the European Council and from the new funding that is to be made available.</P>
    <P>That leads me to look at the preparations being made to ensure that the Community structural policies are developed and used in this country in the most productive possible way.  I have very grave worries in that connection.  The European Council noted with satisfaction and the Taoiseach referred to this also, that, &ldquo;all the legislative texts on the reform of the various funds will be adopted by the end of the year so that they will be operational from 1989&rdquo;.  I am afraid I cannot share that satisfaction. There is cause for major disappointment here in view of the situation which will prevail in 1989.  Within the last couple of weeks the Council of Ministers decided that the rate at which the Community participates in financing structural expenditure will be increased to 75 per cent in 1989 for the Regional Fund only.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs claimed some credit for this but he has made very little reference to the fact that the Government have failed to secure a corresponding increase in Community participation in funding activities under the Social Fund and the agricultural structures fund in 1989.  That, for us, is a major setback on the road to greater European integration.  It means that in 1989 we will not see a comprehensive commitment by the Community to achieving economic and social cohesion as between Ireland and the more prosperous regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>We had all hoped, and indeed the Government had led us to believe, that in 1989 we would see a major expansion in the operations of the Social Fund and the agricultural structures fund on the basis of increased Community participation. That is not going to happen and it means that unless the Government make different decisions about our national expenditure we will not, for example, have the resources to start off a major programme of expansion in our <Col N="699" /> beef herd nor will we have the resources to start off a major programme of building up and upgrading skills in our workforce, skills we need to develop if we are going to be competitive and use all the opportunities which the new integrated market will open up to us.  As I said, that has been a major failure on the Government's part and I am afraid that it is probably now too late even to try to mend the Government's hand for 1989.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in the face of this signal failure on the Government's part, the European Council should have recognised specifically the particular socio-economic problems of certain island regions in the Community.  That is only one example of where the Government's failure to plan properly and to get political action at Community level will prejudice our attempts to promote regional development in a meaningful way.  We all know the needs of our island communities.  We all know the needs for basic things like electricity supply, for access, for port facilities and for a decent search and rescue service which can come to their help when they need it in emergencies. We are not going to see in 1989 the kind of expansion in those provisions that should have been available to us had we had the full development and full implementation in 1989 of the extra Community participation in Structural Fund activities.</P>
    <P>The European Council &mdash; and again the Taoiseach referred to this &mdash; called on the Commission to supplement its analysis of the macro-economic consequences of the internal market as regards its regional impact.  Again, in the slightly Delphic language of these conclusions, that means that the European Council would like the Commission to spell out what the effects of its proposed actions are going to be on the different regions of the Community, on income levels in the different regions and on the levels of development in the different regions.  It is about time that was done.  I remember on a previous occasion in this House when the Taoiseach criticised the Commission for not having done that I asked <Col N="700" /> if the Government had any intention of carrying out such a study at national level. I did not get an answer to that question because in the form of these discussions there is not the opportunity for the Taoiseach to answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he has not answered it in the meantime.  The simple answer to the question of whether the Government are carrying out any systematic analysis of the effects of all these on our regions is no.  Are the Government going to give the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment or whichever Minister it happens to be, any basis for deciding where to put the weight of our structural expenditure by telling them how it will affect different regions? The answer is no.  They will be flying by the seat of their pants.  I was tempted to think that if these were the old, old Fianna Fáil, the ragged pants Republicans, they might have been more in contact with what they were flying in but there is an arse in their breeches now and they seem to be a good deal more out of touch with the reality as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council went to the trouble of adopting a separate declaration on the environment.  As with most such declarations it is very general and rather bland although it does highlight the importance of the Irish Sea from an economic and ecological standpoint and on the basis of what the Taoiseach has said I must agree that it is significant that at his insistence this reference was made.  However, I am appalled to find that in a statement for the European Council on the Environment no mention is made of the fact that the UK and some other member states have clearly failed in their duty to ensure that their nuclear industries do not put the rest of us at risk.  I should like to know whether the Taoiseach even tried to have this matter addressed by the European Council or whether he just passively accepted this rather bland and pre-packaged statement. I know that is an issue which raises <Col N="701" /> hackles in the European Community.  I know that all of the member states which use nuclear power to generate electricity resist attempts being made at European level, whether in the Council or in the European Parliament, to have this problem aired.  That is a further reason for our drawing attention to it on every possible occasion because if we do not as the record of the last 20 years shows those other member states will always be inclined to take chances, cut corners and to produce the kind of results we all fear.</P>
    <P>The European Council also adopted a declaration on the international role of the Community.  There is a great deal of food for thought in that declaration. Paragraph 3 of the declaration states:</P>
    <P>The European Council emphasise the need to improve social and economic conditions in less developed countries and to promote structural adjustment both through trade and aid.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach had the grace to look a little bit shame-faced when he put his name to that declaration in view of the way the Government have slashed our bi-lateral aid programme during the past two years.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the improvement in East-West relations the declaration goes on in paragraph 5 to say, among other things, that the European Council will strive to achieve, and I quote:</P>
    <P>... the establishment of a secure and stable balance of conventional forces in Europe at a lower level, the strengthening of mutual confidence and military transparence and the conclusion of a global and verifiable ban on chemical weapons...</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement and I welcome the determination of the European Council to act in that way.  I welcome the fact that the Government subscribed to that statement in sharp contrast to the non-sensical bleating we heard from some of its more prominent members when the Single European Act and all it entails in terms of European political co-operation first came before this House in 1986.  I am all the more pleased to note that <Col N="702" /> declaration of the European Council on a day when it is reported that Mr. Gorbachev in the United Nations is going to announce a reduction of between 20 and 30 per cent in the level of Soviet conventional armaments in Europe and on the borders of China.  That is a very good illustration of why European political co-operation is good for us and good for our neighbours in the world.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 6 of the declaration states:</P>
    <P>The European Community and the 12 are determined to make full use of the provisions of the Single European Act in order to strengthen solidarity among them, co-ordination on the political and economic aspects of security, and consistency between the external policies of the European Community and the policies agreed in the framework of the European Political Co-Operation. They will strive to reach swift adoption of common positions and implementation of joint action.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of statement which has to be looked at for a few minutes before the language becomes somewhat transparent, but I recommend that we regard that statement as a sane and practical expression of the objectives and the benefits of European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a brief reference to the Taoiseach's meeting with the UK Prime Minister in Rhodes.  I know it is not the custom to reveal in this House the details of the kinds of conversation which take place at such meetings and I am bound to say that this is probably a good thing on this occasion.  I believe the Taoiseach was right not to respond in kind and in public to the statements made in Westminister early last week by the UK Prime Minister.  I should also put it on record that I believe the UK Prime Minister in turn was provoked into making rash and excessive statements by what can only be described as deliberate and blunderheaded leaking by Government sources over the course of the previous weekend.  It is regrettable that the latest meeting between the Taoiseach and the UK Prime Minister should have been another frosty one and it is not <Col N="703" /> enough for the Taoiseach to say in the very vague language he used last Sunday night that for as long as there is a problem in Northern Ireland relations between Ireland and the UK will be difficult.  That is looking for the easy way out and it almost amounts to defeatism.  It is certainly not the frame of mind in which Anglo-Irish relations should be conducted by our Government.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not and even with a difficult partner on the other side of the Irish Sea, we have to live with our neighbour and work with our neighbour to protect and promote the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland and of this island as a whole.  That requires determination and application and above all it requires a detailed and painstaking approach to the working of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The Irish people will accept nothing less from this Government and this Government should try to offer them nothing less.</P>

      <P>Given that we had a debate last night on the European Single Market, I want to concentrate the main body of my remarks on the Anglo-Irish summit meeting between the Taoiseach and Mrs. Thatcher on the fringe of the European Council meeting in Rhodes.  I fear that this meeting will have more far-reaching and immediate implications for the interests of this country than the rather bland, philosophical and disappointing reports of developments towards the Single Market in 1992.  It was for this reason that I tried unsuccessfully earlier this week by means of a Private Notice Question to get the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, to inform the House fully of his discussions with the British Prime Minister on extradition and Anglo-Irish matters before last evening's debate on the motion to extend permanently section 7 (4) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the Taoiseach received the full support of Deputy Des O'Malley and all party leaders before going to Rhodes and that he was enabled to use it to strengthen his hand in the continuing <Col N="704" /> extradition exchanges with Mrs. Thatcher, I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach has chosen to restrict his remarks on the Anglo-Irish implications of the Rhodes summit to a mere paragraph in his contribution today.  There is no doubt that the current row on extradition has broken out at the worst possible time for Anglo-Irish relations, that is, during the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement over the next couple of months.  It is impossible to see how the great opportunity presented by the review will be realised when the two leaders, in whose hands the stewardship of the Anglo-Irish Agreement is now placed, are locked in difficulties over extradition and the rule of law in each jurisdiction.  There is little chance now of a full Anglo-Irish summit meeting to give political direction to the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>We strongly condemned Mrs. Thatcher's outburst about the Fr. Ryan case last week which caused such deep offence in this country, especially among those politicians who have shown no ambivalence on the extradition issue.  Her remarks were based entirely on wrong assumptions about the separate legal process operating in this country.  I note, in passing, that the Taoiseach's meeting with Mrs. Thatcher must not have had much effect since she repeated her claim in the House of Commons again yesterday that she expected Fr. Ryan to be arrested while a decision on his extradition was being considered and pending in this country.  It is no &ldquo;nit-picking&rdquo;&mdash; to use Mrs. Thatcher's words &mdash; to state that such an arrest and detention without charge is simply not possible in this jurisdiction where we have a written Constitution with stronger personal rights than those prevailing in Britain.</P>
    <P>Standing aside from the particular case now in contention, we in the Progressive Democrats believe that the present extradition arrangements between Ireland and Britain cannot work satisfactorily because of the role given to the Attorney General to implement safeguards.  We make no apology for stating and voting <Col N="705" /> for safeguards in the extradition process between the two jurisdictions.  It was for this reason that, given the stark black-and-white choice last night, we voted for the only safeguard on offer &mdash; even though we regard it as unsatisfactory &mdash; rather than no safeguard at all.</P>
    <P>We believe that the role given to the Attorney General &mdash; because he is a politically-appointed legal officer to the Government of the day &mdash; does lead to confusion, misinterpretation and charges about the politicisation of the extradition process here.  It would be infinitely preferable, as we suggested in our amendment which was disallowed yesterday, if amending legislation were introduced to provide that all extradition proceedings be heard and disposed of in the High Court and that the functions of the Attorney General in relation to extradition should be carried out by a judge of the High Court.  That is short of a <i>prima facie</i> case.  It removes any political complexion from the issue of extradition.</P>
    <P>The need for some satisfactory safeguard in the extradition process in undeniable, given recent developments in Britain even over the last couple of days. It is absolutely unacceptable for Britain, a country which is questioning the rule of law here, to dither over whether it should derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights ruling against detention for seven days without charge.</P>
    <P>On top of this apparent disregard for the rule of law, I note that an officer in the Information Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, a Mr. P.J. Haseldine, in a letter to <i>The Guardian</i> today, states:</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Mrs. Thatcher to inveigh against the Belgians and the Irish with such self-righteous invective. Naturally, she would not care to admit it but in the not too distant past her allegations of being soft on terrorism and allowing political considerations to override the due legal process could have been levelled at Mrs. Thatcher herself.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haseldine then referred to alleged political interference from the Foreign <Col N="706" /> Office in the case of the Coventry Four in 1984.  I understand that the official response this afternoon to Mr. Haseldine's claim is that he has been suspended pending an inquiry.</P>
    <P>In the continuing atmosphere of charges about double standards and political interference in the extradition process which is doing no good whatsoever for the future of Anglo-Irish relations, I want to ask the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, if he would consider meeting the leaders of all parties in the Dáil in the New Year with a view to considering the most appropriate safeguards which should be placed in the extradition process with Britain.  I hope the Taoiseach would agree that there was a general view in the Dáil last night that the Attorney General's role was not the right or the best one, but it was the only option put before the House as a safeguard. Since the Taoiseach has undertaken to consider the workings of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, and report to the Dáil on the matter in the New Year, would he also consider having consultations with Members of Opposition parties on more suitable safeguards to be put in place if they could be agreed among the parties in the House?</P>
    <P>Before leaving the Anglo-Irish summit meeting at the fringe of the European Council meeting, I want to ask the Taoiseach if any joint political initiative was agreed between the two leaders in the context of the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and whether any joint plan has emerged to get the Unionists involved in the Anglo-Irish process.  Otherwise there were two points of fundamental importance to the interests of this country at the Council meeting.</P>
    <P>I noted with disappointment that the Taoiseach stated in his press conference after the meeting and indicated in his contribution today that the leaders had not got very far with VAT and excise duty harmonisation.  He said this was one of the issues that he had discussed in his bilateral meeting with Mrs. Thatcher. The Commissioner-elect and outgoing <Col N="707" /> Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray Mac-Sharry, gave the go-ahead, as I understand it, in principle for the full harmonisation of Irish VAT rates under the 1992 proposals at the Crete Council of Ministers meeting last September.  That is a welcome development.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach what plans, if any, the Government have to proceed with this proposal.  Will it be done, as would seem the obvious way, over the next three or four budgets?  I would also like to ask the Taoiseach, in regard to another matter arising from the Council meeting &mdash; the only other concrete matter which seems to have arisen &mdash; if he would consider putting the national development plan for applications for structural funds before this House for debate before it is submitted to Brussels in the early months of next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a fairly extensive debate this afternoon.  I will try to confine my remarks to the Taoiseach's report on the Council meeting in Rhodes. He reported on four categories and I will confine myself to those.  First, he referred to progress in regard to the internal market.  We have to take at face value the Taoiseach's assurances that progress is being made and that on the various fronts, including the directives that have been adopted to date and the ones which are likely to be completed by the end of the year, the progress which is satisfactory and to which the Taoiseach referred will continue.  As other Deputies who have already spoken have said, we have no other way of knowing what progress is made because various Ministers consistently refuse to tell us either by way of Parliamentary Question or otherwise. I do not doubt the Taoiseach's assurances but I have to tell him, as one parliamentarian to another, that I have no other way of knowing how accurate his assurances are because we have no official or formal way of verifying what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not speculate in this House as to the rumours on the positions that are being taken in relation to various matters. <Col N="708" /> I note the presence in the House of the Minister of State with responsibility for marketing and trade, Deputy Seamus Brennan, who has taken a position in relation to the social dimension of Europe that would give pride and pleasure to the staunchest Thatcherite supporter.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to other aspects of the internal market, specifically the large question of the Structural Fund on which this House has had some debates already.  I do not wish to repeat the extensive comments that have been made by the leader of Fine Gael, comments which I welcome, however belated they might be in their realisation of the scam that is going on in this country.  I use that word advisedly and I have used it in an Adjournment debate.  We can remove that political scam by having a full and frank debate in this House on the nature and the extent of the national programme of Community interest and the extent to which there can, should or will be public participation in the preparation and finalisation of those programmes before they go to Brussels.  We have between now and 31 March to do so.  My position on this matter is already clearly on the record and I will not take up the time of the House now to restate it.</P>
    <P>I share the concern that Deputy Dukes has expressed in relation to not only the method of programme formation but also the role of the Department of Finance in nobbling certain projects and in restricting certain kinds of investment on the public side.  Let us not be fooled about the possibility of private sector involvement. There have been only two private sector involvements in infrastructure by the same individual.  I am referring to two bridges in the Dublin area.  Every other infrastructural investment in the last ten to 12 years has amounted to nothing.  I want to put down a marker in relation to that matter but I do not think this is the time to go into it in detail.  I and the Labour Party are not happy with this matter.  There is much concern about it. I would say to the Taoiseach that we share very similar objectives.  This House should be properly trusted.  I do not think <Col N="709" /> the Department of Finance have anything to fear in this respect.  In relation to the social dimension, worker participation and the Regional Fund there are serious questions which have been repeatedly asked but which have been answered unsatisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The second point of the Rhodes Council report referred to the role of the Community in the world and certain political co-operation items.  The Taoiseach spoke about peace generally and about the Middle East, which I welcome.  There was no significant reference to South Africa.  I do not know if it was discussed but if not I regret that.  We have, in Europe, a unique responsibility, with the new United States presidency, to jointly apply substantial pressure on the apartheid régime.  The western world &mdash; I include Ireland unequivocally within it, and colonial Europe of which at one stage we were a part although not necessarily a willing part&mdash;has a moral responsibility to impose mandatory financial sanctions on South Africa.  Alternatively, that entire society will collapse in some form of physical violence and with it will go the whole economy of a sub-Continent, capable of sustaining the lives of millions of people.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that there was no reference to that country.  I know the Germans and the British have been consistently opposed to concerted European political co-operation type action on the question of South Africa.  It is a matter that has the support of this Government, notwithstanding the position that was adopted with the various resolutions in the United Nations, which we will have time to talk about on another occasion.  I know it has the support of Spain, Greece, President Mitterand and many others.  I would ask the Taoiseach to refer to that point in his reply or on some suitable occasion.</P>
    <P>The other point to raise in relation to the question of Palestine and the Middle East, which is a continuous source of concern on the international side, is that consistent requests have been made by the Israeli State to have a residential embassy established in this country. <Col N="710" /> Having regard to the critical nature of the negotiations, in which Europe will have an increasing role, it is my regret that previous administrations did not respond to the Israeli Government's request to have a residential embassy in the capital of this Republic, without any obligation or understanding that we would reciprocate by having a similar presence in the State of Israel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes has already referred to the bilateral aid programme and I concur with his views.  I will not take up the time of the House but I just wish to say that I too share his concern.</P>
    <P>The third point in the Taoiseach's statement referred to the environment.  I welcome very much the increasing concern that the politicians in general are expressing on environmental issues. About five weeks ago <i>The Economist</i> referred to green as the new political colour of the 21st political agenda.  Some people have travelled a long way while others, including the Taoiseach, have not had to travel very far in regard to an awareness of environmental issues.  I welcome the fact it is forcing its way up the political agenda, but that is only the beginning; concerted action is the next step.  Whether this is the appropriate occasion or whether it would be more appropriate at European Councils I do not know but certainly serious co-ordinated Community action to deal with environmental matters is now needed urgently.  For the last ten to 12 years, during the four political administrations &mdash; the Taoiseach will be aware of this &mdash; there has been a political empasse in respect of a toxic waste facility in this country.  There have been numerous reports from the IDA and other organisations about the impediment to economic growth that the absence of such a facility imposes upon us.  We have been served notice in varying degrees by the United Kingdom, who accept, process and neutralise our toxic waste, that they cannot do so indefinitely.  It is a problem and there is no easy solution.  Perhaps the solution cannot be found exclusively within the narrow framework of the State, but maybe there is a solution to be <Col N="711" /> found within the broader framework of the European Community.  I hope the Minister and Council responsible, and ultimately the political leaders of the 12 member states, would grasp this bunch of political nettles, because there is not just one.</P>
    <P>That takes me to the second point which relates to what has been said already by other speakers &mdash; the whole question of the nuclear industry &mdash; and the Taoiseach's vociferous condemnation of what is happening in the Irish Sea.  I unreservedly welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has succeeded in having the Irish Sea put into the category of coastal areas and seas that warrant special environmental attention.  But we must go beyond the level of rhetoric in which all of us have indulged in the past and endeavour to work out some appropriate measures to monitor the whole management of the coastal zones on both sides of the Irish Sea, north and south on our side, right across the Scottish, Welsh and English frontiers.  I might add that this has nothing to do with the present state of Anglo-Irish relations and the current problems in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>For a whole variety of historical reasons I do not believe that that can be done outside the framework of some kind of European inspectorate.  There are all sorts of historical and cultural impediments to that.  Indeed we are part of those impediments and I have no reservations about saying so.  We should press on with some form of European inspectorate.  It will not be easy to achieve but it constitutes the next logical step after the rhetoric.  The rhetoric is necessary to arouse consciousness.  Unless we want to run the risk of bitterly disappointing a whole generation of young people &mdash; most of whom are politically concerned with environmental issues to the exclusion of others &mdash; we must put something in its place.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to the fourth item listed on the front page of the Taoiseach's statement this afternoon, as having formed the agenda of the Rhodes Summit, that is <Col N="712" /> audio-visual policies.  I know that the translation of French philosophical statements sometimes comes across in a rather strange Anglophone manner, as exemplified by the use of the words &ldquo;social cohesion&rdquo;.  Indeed the phrase &ldquo;audio-visual policies&rdquo; is another.  Nonetheless it is fundamental to what the whole European project is about, that is the consolidation of European culture, of which audio-visual manifestation is as technocratically and technologically the most up-to-date example.  In that regard, if the Taoiseach really wants to give tangible effect to the marvellous and invigorating philosophical musings and dissertations that undoubtedly came from the mouth of President Francois Mitterrand &mdash; whom we heard in full flight in this Chamber &mdash; he might consider the re-establishment of the National Film Board.  He might consider examining a policy that would give tangible effect to such a goal, perhaps with the assistance of Regional or Structural Fund moneys because, at the end of the day, the only way we will keep out Japanese or American-type invasions of the European audio-visual space &mdash; to maintain the awkward translation of French into English &mdash; is to have a funded type of European alternative in its place. That was what the National Film Board was originally.  We should remember that we are not short of talent in that regard here.  Perhaps the Taoiseach who now has full Departmental responsibility for culture, including audio-visual-type activities &mdash; since he has seen fit to refer to it in his statement &mdash; would give another thought to that aspect.  The constraints imposed on him in the first instance have not been removed.  If he wishes to address some of the very real concerns expressed by European Leaders in Rhodes, then he should ensure that the State, in partnership, with whatever alternative sources of private funds, should be used to underpin our enormous cultural activity and capability.  The Taoiseach may have heard this already on numerous occasions from other people.  By virtue of the fact that we speak English we have an enormous export market beyond this island <Col N="713" /> so that the constraints normally applicable to the traditional market base do not necessarily apply to us.</P>
    <P>The House will note that I have deliberately made no reference to Mrs. Thatcher other than within a European socio-economic context.  I have not mentioned the word &ldquo;extradition&rdquo;.  I refuse to jump to the agenda constantly being rammed down our throats.  I wanted simply to put on record in this House that the Labour Party Leader sought to have this matter raised by way of a Private Notice Question earlier today.  Understandably it was ruled out of order on the grounds that the Taoiseach in his statement would refer to his meeting with Mrs. Thatcher. However, the Taoiseach will agree that his report of that meeting at the end of his statement was rather short.  The Labour Party Leader has responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs and has already expressed our position extensively in relation to extradition.  Since other Members have raised this question in response to the Taoiseach's statement on the Rhodes Summit I want to state that what we have said already, what is on the record as expressed by Deputy Spring on these matters, stands.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement was a report of the European Summit.  I said in this House last night &mdash; at a time when perhaps most Members have the sense not to be in here and therefore their remarks are not reported &mdash; that we need to devote more energy and time to the 1992 project.</P>
    <P>I might reiterate to the Taoiseach &mdash; because probably he is not aware &mdash; that the Oireachtas joint committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are incapable of functioning at present, incapable of scrutinising the work of this or any other Minister through sheer lack of staff.  I believe that committee should be renamed and called the Joint Oireachtas 1992 Committee.  There is a motion to that effect on the Order Paper.  They should be given adequate staff beyond the priorities or constraints prevailing.  I realise resources are scarce but we must remember that we are talking about the <Col N="714" /> single largest project this nation has encountered or undertaken since we entered the European Community in the first instance.</P>
    <P>There should be built into the regular weekly routine of this House an hour, perhaps on a Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, some time to be agreed with the Whips, when we could get a regular report on this matter.  The democratic deficit about which we complain so much in the European Parliament is beginning to erode our status in this House.  We should be able to ask the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, the Environment and Labour what exactly they are doing in relation to the various Councils, why they may be adopting a particular line, ascertaining, if necessary, how we can help.  As the Taoiseach probably will know from the co-ordinated replies I received from various Departments to questions I have attempted to ask in relation to this matter, resort to Parliamentary Questions is absolutely useless in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been fairly clear from the Taoiseach's statement today and from the various press reports that the Rhodes Summit, by and large, was a non-event in terms of decisions taken or progress made.  The Taoiseach had many references to the fact that it had been agreed that urgent action was needed on this or that matter; that it had been agreed to appoint a co-ordinator in respect of this, that or the other.  There are many issues that might have been dealt with more specifically and decisions taken on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind in particular the tax and excise harmonisation issue in respect of which it is quite clear this Government have capitulated to whatever pressures exist within the EC with regard to agreeing to such harmonisation.  For example, in the course of the debate on the Single European Act I recall the former Minister for Finance saying that under no circumstances would he countenance tax harmonisation, that if necessary he would use the veto in order to prevent the effects of tax harmonisation on our <Col N="715" /> people.  Yet there are reports to the effect that he has now accepted tax harmonisation and is seeking some kind of assistance to relieve the shock.  It is interesting to note that the British Prime Minister made it quite clear that, under no circumstances, would she accept tax or excise harmonisation, obviously for very different reasons.  Nevertheless it is an indication of how that Prime Minister's strength, to put it mildly, can be used in the interests of the people of Britain.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that tax harmonisation will have serious effects particularly for those on low pay and on social welfare.  What is being proposed is a tax band which will ensure that luxury items are reduced to a low level and that tax will come on essentials such as food and clothing, public transport and so on. We are not seriously addressing ourselves to the problems which will face the ordinary man and woman here if we ignore the reality of the effects of tax harmonisation.</P>
    <P>Obviously there is also an effect relating to a loss of income to the Exchequer as a result of tax harmonisation. There are various estimates as to how much it will be from as low as £300 million or £400 million to as high as £1,000 million depending on the rates which will apply at the different levels.  It is difficult to see how that kind of fall off in Exchequer revenue will be made up.  Perhaps the Government will succeed in getting some assistance for the first few years, but inevitably they will be faced with the choice of increasing PAYE taxes which produce the bulk of income tax here or of further cutting the social servcies which are already under severe attack.  It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach in his speech referred to this issue only in passing when he said:</P>
    <P>We will continue to urge therefore that regard be had to the development and cohesion objectives of the Treaty, and that the Commission's review of <Col N="716" /> its proposals must ensure that our difficulties of a budgetary, economic and social kind will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is a secret code of some kind for saying that we will not allow it to happen but it seems to me that we are again going cap in hand arguing from a weak position instead of maintaining from the beginning that we will have no compunction in using the veto if it is found that tax harmonisation is going to have a very serious effect on our people.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern must be the reports that Mrs. Thatcher is opposing the implementation of the social element of the 1992 proposals.  It is interesting to note specifically that she opposes the provision of the right of workers for representation on private company boards. It is also interesting to note that our own Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, has gone on record saying that we do not regard that as a matter of importance and that we are not pressing it either.  It is nice to see the British and the Irish representatives agreeing on something but unfortunately it is not something which will be acceptable to the working classes here or to the trade unions who have quite clearly stated that they want a charter of rights for workers in the EC, both Irish workers and EC workers as a whole. It is unfortunate that we seem to have got ourselves into a position where we on the one hand are making declarations in this House and elsewhere that of course we support the package on social policy but on the other hand in meetings of various kinds we seem to be rolling back from that position when it comes to the point of actually interfering with the rights of private enterprise either nationally or in Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>It would not be right to speak in this debate without acknowledging the advances in having the Irish Sea accepted as an area of special concern.  I welcome that and congratulate the Taoiseach on achieving it.  However, that must be followed up by demanding that action be taken in relation to the pollution of the Irish Sea particularly by Sellafield, although that is not the only problem in <Col N="717" /> relation to the Irish Sea.  The Sellafield nuclear processing plant is constantly polluting the Irish Sea and we believe there is urgency for international action in that regard.  The Taoiseach has expressed his interest in this whole issue on a number of occasions and I have no doubt that he will take action on it.  I hope in time that the Taoiseach will be reporting on a regular basis to the House on the progress we have made.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the meeting of the Heads of State did not more positively welcome the declaration by the Palestine National Council in relation to the declaration of an independent state.  The wording of the welcome was a bit lukewarm but I suppose it is difficult to reconcile the various political interests amongst those Heads of State in the EC. It is important, apart from what the EC may say, that the Irish Government should make clear their unequivocal support for the step the Palestine National Council have taken.  They have cleared the way for an international peace conference on the Middle East.  They have accepted resolution 242 which had been an obstacle to them participating in such peace talks.  It is important that Ireland, given our special relationship with the US in particular, should impress on the US the urgency of getting down to talks with the various parties in the Middle East so as to resolve the problem there.  It will not be too easy, but the Palestine National Council have taken a major step which facilitates the setting up of a peace conference on the Middle East.  I would urge the Irish Government to either publicly or privately exert pressure where appropriate to get the US to accept that the Palestine National Council have taken a valuable step forward.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas which it is important to cover in relation to the EC but it is not right to cover them in relation to statements being made here today. However, what must be borne in mind particularly in relation to the Cecchini report is that it does not cover Ireland in its consideration.  It makes general reference to the regions as perhaps benefiting from the effect of the internal <Col N="718" /> market.  The Taoiseach in his speech indicated that he had succeeded in getting agreement that there would be a review of the effect of the internal market on the regions and that is very welcome but I hope he will indicate to us when this report will be available.  Will it be available for the next meeting of the Heads of State of the EC and in what way will the outcome of this report affect the decisions by the Heads of State or indeed by our own Government?  The Cecchini report does not deal with the question of the internal market as it relates to Ireland.  It fails to point out that despite the fact that there will be new jobs created as a result of the internal market, many more jobs will be lost.  It is difficult to see how regions on the periphery, like Ireland which are relatively speaking under-developed can benefit from these new jobs unless specific policy decisions are taken to ensure that we are brought up to the necessary level of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>There are other matters relating to social policy which are important but I will leave them to another day when there might be a more appropriate occasion to discuss these issues.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 concerns the power to have what are known as investigations into a company's affairs.  These investigations must be agreed to by a court before they can take place and a variety of people can apply for investigations. There is no result from such investigations other than simply a report presented by the person responsible for the investigation.  It may be that the contents of the report lead to prosecutions <Col N="719" /> being initiated or to the winding up of a company but if the law were properly applied independently of the investigations it is possible for the company to be wound up under the normal winding up procedure and for persons to be prosecuted for offences against company law by means of the normal process of prosecution, either on the basis of a report from the liquidator on the winding up of a company or on the basis of information obtained by the Minister in another way, apart from the court ordered investigation provided for in section 7 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have criticised this section because it does not demonstrate the purpose that will be served by an investigation of this kind.  The fact that the investigation procedures provided in the 1963 Act have not been used is evidence that there is no need for this separate legal process. Those who might have been expected to have used the investigating procedure have invariably sought to have the company wound up and have their problems remedied in that fashion rather than by using this investigation procedure.  The fact that section 7 does not provide any criteria, guidelines, or stated purposes for investigations which would indicate to the court the circumstances in which they might order such an investigation, is itself an indication that this section is there, and has been there in another form, for no particular purpose and is in fact a waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been trying to pursue with the Minister the reasons this process is being maintained and the only answer he gave me &mdash; admittedly it was in the form of a response to an interjection &mdash; was so that there might be prosecutions.  If that is the case, there are ample sections elsewhere in this Bill which enable the Minister to get information preliminary to an investigation. If those sections are there and if the Minister has power to prosecute, why not prosecute?  Why have an investigation of this kind at all?  If nobody else is prepared to do it and if the Minister suspects that a company's affairs are being conducted with the intent to <Col N="720" /> defraud, or if he suspects that persons connected with the formation or the management of a company have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other conduct, the remedy is for the Minister to petition for the winding up of the company, not for this cumbersome, lengthy and unused procedure of an investigation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy that if there is a need for investigations they should be conducted in the same way as a normal investigation of any crime, in other words, by normal detection work, by seeking information and by searching for documents and obtaining them in the same way as the Fraud Squad investigate the activities of an individual preliminary to taking criminal proceedings, or deciding not to take criminal proceedings as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I do not see the purpose of this process in section 7 and I am not alone in being sceptical about the value or purpose of this section.  As I said, Mr. Justice Keane, the leading published authority on company law in the Republic of Ireland &mdash; he published a textbook on the subject &mdash; has said that the history of this investigation procedure does not &ldquo;inspire much confidence in such proposals as providing a more effective remedy for abuses in company law&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Commonsense and Mr. Justice Keane both suggest that there is no need for this provision, that there is little or no need for most of this part of the Bill, that it will just add a lot more weight to what people have to read about company law and that it will serve little or no purpose. A much neater, simpler and more effective solution to the investigation of company affairs with a view to prosecution would be to adopt the following procedure. Let the Minister investigate companies in the same way crime is investigated and initiate prosecutions, or let liquidators investigate as they are obliged to do and recommend prosecution arising out of their reports and give the Minister power to petition for the winding up of companies, if other people do not do so rather than get involved in this unnecessary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, section 7 is very much to company law what the appendix is to the human body.  It is there but nobody has ever discovered its purpose and nobody has bothered to remove it because it has not caused harm to anybody, it has not been used and it serves no useful purpose. To my mind that is not the way to make law.  I would urge the House to remove section 7 from the Bill, and keep section 8 which serves a purpose, strengthen the Minister's powers to petition for winding up and, if necessary, strengthen his power to obtain information about companies in the normal way, by the normal process <Col N="722" /> of investigation, and not by the formalised process set out here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Bruton has said that the present system of investigations has been a somewhat atrophied element of the company law code, atrophied due to lack of use. However two things strike me arising from his remarks.  First, investigations are not only confined to situations where criminality is suspected or indeed established. Second, investigation is something short of the all-out step which is involved in applying to a court for the winding up of a company.  For instance there could be quite a profitable company with a large workforce being run wrongly or unfairly by management, and to say that the only real non-ministerial remedy available to any person interested in the affairs of the company or affected by them is to petition to the court to wind up that company, is like saying that you should not have a police force but that you should have a nuclear bomb, and that the only thing you can do is to destroy a company, or hold this ultimate sanction over them as a means of making sure that their affairs are conducted properly.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a need for some step to allow people who are being excluded unfairly from knowing what is happening in a company or who want to establish as a matter of public record misconduct, short of criminality or even criminality itelf.  There should be a mechanism whereby they can, without seeking the winding up of the company, preserve that company's existence and apply to the court for the purpose of having such an investigation carried out by an inspector. I believe it is correct to extend the right of initiating the investigation to persons other than the Minister.  It is a happy situation that the right will now be available to those who are not simply in a position to persuade the Minister that such an investigation should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look to sections 7 and 8, it seems to me that an investigatory procedure is a good one.  It may not be used often, but because remedies are not used often does not mean they do not have their effects. <Col N="723" /> If the investigatory mechanism was effectively got rid of, the effect would be that people who knew that it was politically, economically or socially undesirable to wind up a company could effectively trample on minority shareholders in that company, because they would know that no court would dare, for instance, to wind up a large financial institution.  Let us suppose a large financial institution was facing an investigation of this kind, it should be capable of investigation without somebody going to the High Court petitioning for its winding up and it should not depend on the Minister to initiate an investigation.  If somebody is willing to put their money where their mouth is by way of security to cover the costs of such an investigation, I believe they should have that remedy available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I was arguing somewhat on the lines of Deputy Bruton.  In theory one could hardly disagree with what Deputy McDowell has said, and in one sense I can see the necessity of retaining powers which already exist in the 1963 Act regarding investigations. But as we discussed earlier this morning, the powers which were available to the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the 1963 Act are now being transferred to the courts &mdash; the Minister for Industry and Commerce is getting rid of this potato which he always had but never used.  As it turns out there have been no investigations under the powers of the 1963 Act and there has never been a case under which the Minister has exercised those powers.  In my short time in this House, I remember instances in regard to a number of companies, and one in particular in my own constituency which finally went into liquidation and was sold off but in the period before that happened information came to light to the then Minister that there was something not <i>ad idem</i> with what had been stated to the Department because special allocations had been given to the company.  It was asked that an investigation take place under the powers <Col N="724" /> given to the Minister in the 1963 Act but the investigation never took place.  In fact, no Minister has ever exercised this power.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell is absolutely correct in saying that in broad theory it is as well to retain those powers, but no one could deny that it is most unlikely to envisage a situation where anybody will apply to have this investigation carried out under the section because there is an extreme cost involved and the person making the application will be asked to put up a sum in security not less than £200,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not exceeding £200,000.  I see the general theory behind retaining the provisions of the 1963 Act, but I think &mdash; and I know we can do something on Report Stage&mdash;the matter should have been tackled differently. Section 8 of the Bill gives powers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to petition himself on behalf of the court, but as I said this morning when the Minister had such powers under the 1963 Act, he never investigated the collapse of companies or appointed inspectors to investigate such collapses down through the years.  Under section 8, we are giving the Minister powers to go to the court and ask the court the same as other people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>But why will the Minister now use these powers?  I accept what the Minister said this morning that one of the reasons there were never investigations under the 1963 Act is that there were procedural and legal difficulties and I can readily understand that there were reasons why the powers were never used, but I am still prepared to bet that the Minister will not use these powers very frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have dealt with this whole Part of the Bill differently.  I would have appointed an officer called an &ldquo;official investigator&rdquo; which Deputy Bruton <Col N="725" /> referred to.  This would be a similar appointment to the Director of Consumer Affairs and this officer would be given all the powers under Part II of the Bill and the ordinary person could apply to the official investigator when things were going wrong in a company and he could decide to utilise his powers and apply to the court and bear the costs of same.  This official would be the equivalent of the Director of Public Prosecutions except that he would be acting in company affairs.  I imagine that would have been the approach I would have adopted with regard to the whole area of investigation.  The powers have not been utilised in the past and I would agree with Deputy Bruton that the provisions of sections 7 and 8 are superfluous, but having said that, I believe there is merit in Deputy McDowell's suggestion and, since we cannot look into the future, perhaps these provisions will be useful in the years to come.</P>
    <P>From my analysis this morning, I can only see one area where anybody will be prepared to operate under this section.  I rule out the Minister initiating an investigation under section 8 because I do not think the Minister would be prepared to carry it out, when he was not prepared to do it when he had the direct powers to do so.  Where major companies have shareholdings in other major companies &mdash;and £200,000 is neither here nor there to them &mdash; they would be prepared to put up the money for an investigation. However, if things are going that badly they probably would not bother with that course of action and would use other means available to them.  The official investigator or whatever title we may give him will be the person to do this.  I am opposed to creating new branches of bureaucracy but if we are to have investigations that is the correct approach.  I cannot see the purpose of the whole area of investigation.  Probably it is necessary to leave it there.  Under other sections of the Bill other things can be done in this regard, but I ask the Minister to consider the idea I have put forward.</P>

      <P>We will be here for <Col N="726" /> a long time if Deputies are to discuss amendments which they have not even put down.  Deputy McCreevy says what he thinks should be in the Bill but he has no amendment down to that effect, proposing a special investigator or whatever. You can go on all day saying all sorts of things about what you think should be in the Bill but if we are not tied to something like amendments put down we could go on forever.  It is a pity the debate has deteriorated into saying this whole section should not be in the Bill at all.  It is an improvement on the 1965 Act but the 1965 Act has been around for the past 23 years, and according to Deputy Bruton there should never have been an amendment in the 1965 Act.  What did he do about it all the time he was Minister? It is there in the 1965 Act and if it is not in this Bill we are still operating under the 1965 Act system.</P>

      <P>It is a great improvement.  It is far better that the courts appoint the inspector than that the Minister appoint the inspector.  Furthermore, the Minister now under this Part of the Bill can require information from companies without going through formal investigation procedures.  I think that is a great improvement.  There is a number of improvements here and section 7 is an improvement.  It is very cumbersome still.  Possibly there are simpler systems of an investigator or whatever, but it is a great improvement. Deputy Bruton and I have amendments down and certainly the purpose of mine is to try to make it easier for people to require an investigation, which nobody did under the 1963 Act.  There was no restriction on costs; it could cost a fortune and that was one reason nobody would go into the business.  I still thought £200,000 would be rather frightening and that is <Col N="727" /> the maximum but you could go up to that amount.  My amendment was to reduce that to £50,000.  Obviously, Deputy Bruton similarly thought paying the whole of the cost would be unfair to a person requiring an investigation and he put down an amendment that the person would be required to pay only half the cost.  I was pleased that Deputies thought it was good to try to improve this and make sure people involved in a company as members with certain shareholdings or for whatever reason could go to court and ask for an investigation to be carried out and if the courts agreed it should be carried out they would have to bear part of the cost.  A later section provides that the courts can assure that the cost is divided up between different parties, be it the company themselves or whoever.  The section is good and essential.  We should move on from it.  We did the best we could to improve it.  The Minister accepted one amendment and did not accept the other two.  We should accept the section now.  This is a huge Bill and we want to move on.  It is now 5.35 p.m.</P>

      <P>It would but it is accretion to this Bill as it stands and would represent a potential charge.  For that reason I did not put down such an amendment.  I am sorry to have to disagree with Deputy McDowell on a matter of law, but adequate remedies are available to people who are oppressed minorities within a company other than the <Col N="728" /> cumbersome procedure of investigation. I refer the House to section 205 of the Companies Act, 1963 which will remain in force after the enactment of this Bill, which provides that a person can petition a court if he feels he is in the position of being an oppressed minority and the court may make such order as it thinks fit whether directing or prohibiting any act or cancelling or varying any transactions or regulating the conduct of the company's affairs in future.  Therefore, there are adequate provisions for going to court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is unlikely that a company who would act by majority vote would be unable to investigate their own affairs or the activities of their own officers who are their employees and that they would require a court order for investigation to deal with the situation. The point made by Deputy McDowell justifying this investigative procedure referred to minorities and there is already more than adequate protection in section 205 of the Principal Act for minorities without going through the process of investigation.  Furthermore, even if investigation threw up some evidence of oppression of minorities, the report of the inspector would not solve the problem because the minority would then have to go to court to get an order under section 12 arising out of the inspector's report. Therefore, it would end up in court anyway.  Again, any oppressed minority would use section 205 to deal with the problem rather than this process.  For this reason I think this is an unnecessary section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the need for the section 8 provisions in regard to the Minister obtaining preliminary information but I <Col N="729" /> believe he should be using it for the possible initiation of winding up proceedings or prosecutions rather than for the initiation of an investigation.  I would leave section 8 there in the sense that it might be necessary as a long stop.  I see no need at all for section 7 which is essentially the initiation of investigations by persons other than the Minister.  We should get rid of section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am doing by putting in this section instead of the 1963 Act is simply to give another avenue to applicants who wish to have a company investigated.  It is a total of 15 lines in a Bill that runs to 153 pages.  I do not accept it is the enormous burden Deputy Bruton seems to think it is or that it is clogging up the legislation.  Far from it, it is another remedy and I think a sensible one.  I am not saying it is going to solve all the difficulties of company investigations, but we should give it an opportunity to work.</P>
      <P>The major innovation in this section is transferring from the Minister to the court the functions of appointing inspectors. We felt it necessary to do that because of severe difficulties encountered by inspectors appointed in recent years.  An investigation under section 165 or section 166 of the 1963 Act, that is by the inspectors appointed by the Minister, is in many ways akin to a judicial process and the constitutional and legal problems which this created were quite substantial. While no action has been appealed to the High Court under the existing investigation provisions, the two most recent investigations instituted proved quite inconclusive, as a result of legal points raised.  Among the legal points raised were, for example, the possibility that advance notification should be given to those who were to be investigated prior to the commencement of an investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second legal point raised was that as no detailed procedures for the conduct of investigations were outlined it was felt that the provision of natural justice might be contravened in not allowing the prime persons involved in the investigation to cross-examine witnesses, to obtain legal <Col N="730" /> advice and to make rebutting evidence. That is just an example of a second area of legal difficulty in regard to the old system.  Another cause for concern was that the publication of the report would in itself be a very severe sanction and might jeopardise a person's livelihood. There are others.</P>
    <P>The point that Deputy Bruton and I have difficulty in reconciling is that appointment of inspectors by the court should &mdash; there is no guarantee &mdash; overcome most of the legal problems that were raised in the past, since the inspector will now be an officer of the court and will have all the authority of the court behind him.  Furthermore, following the enactment of this Bill, the bare bones of part 2 will be fleshed out by a series of rules, procedures and so on prepared by the Superior Court's Rules Committee which would hopefully obviate some of the procedural obstacles raised in previous investigations.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputy Bruton to give this an opportunity to work.  It is an attempt to tackle some of the things that prevented the 1963 version playing a major role.  It also opens up new avenues for persons to establish the facts in regard to a company.  The purpose, after all, is to allow the facts to be established in major cases.  I said this morning, and it is worth repeating, that this is not meant to be a &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; method of finding out what is happening in a company.  Under section 19 the Minister can get his hands on documentation and books and so on in a summary fashion; but that would not be suitable at all in circumstances where a fully fledged dress rehearsal investigation of a major company is sought, perhaps by another company.  Where that sort of investigation is required it would not be sufficient at all for the Minister just to write looking for books and information. We might greatly regret removing a weapon like this from Statutes.  Who knows but that the fact that it is there and will now be much easier to use is a deterrent to would-be delinquent directors. It is not heavy baggage to carry.  It is a useful weapon to have in our armoury <Col N="731" /> in case it is needed.  We are now simplifying the procedure somewhat.  I cannot guarantee that it will work either, but I think it is a genuine attempt and we would be very foolish indeed to disarm ourselves of a formal mechanism to have a fully fledged investigation of a company's affairs.  There are other remedies. One can wrap up a company or seek information from the Minister but if we were to take this out of our legislation we would be taking out a formal mechanism of laying out all the information about a company's affairs, and we might regret not having that in our legislation in the future.  It is not great baggage to carry and therefore we should hang on to it.</P>
    <P>The idea of an official investigator seems like a neat idea, but it is not something that is on the political agenda at the moment in regard to this Bill because we are not in the business at the moment of building additional empires within the State service.  This is a better solution because it leaves it very much to the market, to companies, to take on each other with the court acting as referee.  I appeal to Deputy Bruton to reconsider his view on this section.  It is a weapon we would be foolish to throw away because it might now be used more sensibly.  Given the legal difficulties I referred to in this area, Deputy McDowell is right about the other options in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just one point on the section.  If I wanted to undermine an individual for whatever purpose and had the power that is open to an individual under this Act it would probably be defamatory to go through the formula of becoming a creditor and applying for an investigation of that individual's affairs; a company cannot be defamed but can be undermined, and if I wanted to undermine a limited company I could meet the various requirements in this Bill by becoming a creditor of that company and then applying to the court for an investigation of the company's affairs with the view in mind of putting the word around that I was having this company investigated, or that the company was being <Col N="732" /> investigated because a creditor had sought such an investigation from the courts, or that there was likely to be an investigation.  This is a very wide power to give to the creditor.  Even the right to apply to the court is a wide power in these circumstances.  This section, as wide as it is, could cause difficulties which the Minister has not considered.  I would ask the Minister in the House to give consideration to this.  If he is not prepared to accept what has been put forward here by Deputy Bruton today, perhaps he would rethink that and come back on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of limited liability, the whole idea of incorporation is to allow a new entity to conduct affairs with limited liability.  Whereas one cannot defame a limited company, one can undermine it. The idea of limited liability is to encourage trade, to encourage people to take risks, to get involved in enterprise.  This is a formula for undermining and there will be people who are very skilled in doing that not just in corporate raids but in determining opposition.  I doubt if the Minister has given that the depth of consideration the House might expect and I would ask him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we are prepared to accept the Minister's position that this section might be useful in the future, I would like to make a point on the section.  I understand that under subsection (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) a number of people can apply to the court for this inspector to be appointed, including people holding more than 10 per cent of the share capital, creditors etc; but there are thousands of companies with directors that do not hold share capital in the company at all, people such as ex-Members of this House, ex-European Commissioners, ex-Taoisigh and so on. If it were to come to such a director's notice that the company were engaged in criminal activity or that there were things going on that should not be going on, would it not be better that that director would also be entitled to look for an investigation?  Under paragraphs (a), (b), <Col N="733" /> (c) and (d) such a director may not qualify. Would the section not be better if these types of directors were included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting idea and I will certainly look at it.  One slight worry I have about it is the corporate responsibility of the board of directors acting jointly.  However, it is an interesting idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, it may be that one share would qualify a person as a director of a company but such a person may not be involved in the executive running of the company.  Such a person may be there for his goodwill or expertise in certain areas.  It is more likely that executive directors will go to the court and say that it has come to their attention that things were being run very badly at the company and request the court to appoint an inspector.  The Minister should consider adding that category on Report Stage.  Those type of upright individuals would, if anything came to their attention, want to bring the matter to the public attention and seek to have an inspector appointed.  We should consider including them if they are not referred to elsewhere in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting idea and I will see if I can find a formula for it.  However, I have the residual worry about splitting up the directors but I will give the matter some thought between now and Report Stage.  I should like to thank the Deputy for raising the matter. Deputy Mitchell's point is shared by many people in industry.  I am referring to the notion that if one goes after a company there is somehow an allegation in that move, a fear that one undermines a company if one goes after it.  However, if we travelled that road we would not go after any company on the basis that we might undermine it.  We have ensured that we can go after a company if we smell a rat but quite an amount of security is required, up to £200,000, by a person making an application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The point I wish to make is that nobody can lightly or frivolously make such an application. Deputy Bruton's amendment which was moved this morning takes away some of the difficulties in that the minimum figure for such an application is £500.  The danger of people frivolously going through this heavy procedure, which I admit it is, to undermine a company in unlikely.  It would be a silly thing for any person to do because that person might end up with a lot of egg on his or face.  It should be remembered that a creditor of a company who is owed as little as £50 can apply to the High Court for a winding up of the company.  Arguably, that is a greater undermining jump than what is envisaged in the Bill.  I accept the Deputy's concern but in my view the balance is right.</P>

If we do that and confine the investigations to those initiated by the Minister under section 8 we will be getting rid of all the necessity about contributions to the cost of the investigation and a lot of the formalities and problems we were discussing earlier.  I would also argue that we should retain sections 19 and 20 which give the Minister very wide powers to get information about companies without the necessity of a formal investigation.  That would enable him to initiate prosecutions directly.  The Minister may go straight to the court with a prosecution or a petition to wind up a company without the need for all this time consuming and expensive investigation.  That is why I consider section 7 to be a waste of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I query the need for the inclusion of subsection (1) (c) in section 8.  The undertaking of an investigation is very expensive and it seems very spurious to launch an investigation simply because the members of a company have not been given all the information relating to the affairs of the company they might reasonably expect to receive.  I would have <Col N="739" /> thought it should have been possible to come up with a more simple and quick method to ensure that the member of a company get the information they require on the way in which the company is being run without the Minister having to take the initiative of launching an investigation under section 8.  If it is deemed that the provision in regard to information being given to the members of the company relating to the affairs of the company which they might reasonably expect to receive is considered to be a necessary ground for the carrying out of an investigation, which I question, it would appear that that should be one of the criteria under which an investigation might be sought under section 7, subsection (1) (b), by one-fifth of the members rather than there being a requirement on the members to go to the Minister to initiate an investigation.  I believe that he should not use this procedure but I can certainly see justification for the Minister to launch an investigation on the grounds of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct.  It would be proper that the Minister would carry out an investigation on those grounds but I do not see any need for the inclusion of subsection (1) (c).  I believe that if it is needed it should be included in section 7.</P>

      <P>Section 8 is fairly close to being an exact replica of section 166 of the Companies Act, 1963.  Section 6 of this Bill is going to repeal all of the provisions contained in section 165 to 173, inclusive, of the Principal Act.  While I do not have section 166 of the Companies Act, 1963 in front of me I think section 8 is more or less <i>ad idem</i> with that section except in one respect.  Subsection (2) (a) of section 8 states:</P>
      <P>The power conferred by subsection (1) shall be exercisable with respect to a body corporate notwithstanding that it is in course of being voluntarily wound up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in the course of a company being voluntarily wound up some malpractice <Col N="740" /> comes to light I do not think the Minister has the power under section 166 to investigate it.  Therefore, that is an important addition.</P>

      <P>I do not think under the 1963 Act the Minister has the power to appoint these inspectors.  Under the 1963 Act, if in the course of a company being voluntarily wound up some malpractice comes to light I do not think the Minister has the power to appoint inspectors.  If we are going to have all of these sections perhaps it is good that we have this addition.  Would the Minister of State like to comment on this?  Perhaps the Minister of State would also tell me if section 8 is more or less at one with section 166 of the 1963 Act before I go any further as the answer to that question is relevant to the points I would like to make?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are changing the emphasis in section 7 so as to give the court the power to appoint these inspectors. Section 7 (2) states that the application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require.  Section 8 gives the Minister the power to apply to the court for the appointment of an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company but he must apply under certain criteria and these are listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 8 (1).  I wonder if it is necessary to replicate the provisions of section 166 of the Act in section 8 considering that these are provided for in section 7 of the Bill.  Because section 7 (2) of the Bill states that the application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require, is it not superfluous to give the Minister these powers under section 8?  I would only give the Minister power under section 8 to appoint inspectors under the new Act and include a provision about voluntary winding-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to appoint an <Col N="741" /> inspector under section 8 there are certain grounds on which he will have to base his application to the court.  The hardest point he will have to prove is, as provided for in section 8 (1) (a), the intent to defraud.  This is very difficult to prove in a court.  Section 8 (1) (a) states &ldquo;... that its affairs are being or have been conducted with intent to defraud its creditors or the creditors of any other person ...&rdquo;.  I am not a lawyer but this is an extremely difficult point to prove.  I know it does not limit the Minister's powers in this regard because he has powers under the other subsections to make application but I wonder if most of section 8 is superfluous given the powers available in section 7.  However, because this is a replica of section 166 of the Act perhaps it is necessary to have this provision in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (a) is a new provision which makes it clear that the court's powers under section 166 (2) of the 1963 Act may be exercised even where the body concerned is in voluntary liquidation, which I think is the point made by Deputy McCreevy.  The reason for allowing investigations in these cases lies in the grounds listed in subsection (1) on which the Minister can apply to the courts for an investigation which, as the Deputy said, have to do with suggestions of fraud, oppression, etc. in a company. In cases which are regarded as serious the Deputy will appreciate that it is considered that the Minister should have the right to apply to the court to have the company investigated in the public interest as well as in the interests of creditors, members and so on, even if the company is being wound up.  Giving the Minister such a power should help to counteract any inclination by a company to wind up in order to prevent an investigation taking place which, of course, would be a temptation for a company at any stage.  I do not think it is necessary to extend the powers still further to cases of court winding-ups since I think it is accepted that one of the functions of the official liquidator in such cases is to investigate the affairs of the company so as to <Col N="742" /> ensure that no fraud has occurred prior to a winding-up.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to paragraph (c) which, as I think he is aware, corresponds to section 166 (b) (iii) of the 1963 Act.  This paragraph provides that the court may authorise an investigation where the members of the company have been denied certain material information about the affairs of the company. Examples of this might be, say, the improper placing of contracts to the detriment of a company or the diversion of some of the company's business to another company privately owned by the director of the last company.  Those are examples of two cases in which members might claim they have not been given all the information.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if I understand the Deputy's remarks in relation to paragraph (c) when he suggested that this provision might not be appropriate in this section. Was Deputy Bruton suggesting that this was a useful ground to have when members might feel they had not been given all the information but perhaps it should be in section 7 where they could use the provision themselves instead of having to go through the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take a look at that point.  The Deputy will, of course, recall that if they use the provision in section 7 they will be in the £200,000 area because they are using that procedure, whereas if they use the provisions under section 8 they can initiate the proceedings through the Minister.  I will certainly think about that point but I would want to include a provision in the Bill where if a view is taken that members are not given all the information, they might have recourse to the procedure in section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a persuasive point when he said that by moving the reference in section 8 (1) (a) to section 7 this would involve people in the costs of security and so on.  My basic <Col N="743" /> argument is that it would be better if methods of getting this information which did not involve this formalised court order procedure could be provided because of the costs which are inherent in that.  I wonder if the Minister could possibly deal with the matter contained in paragraph (c) by the use of the powers he has under section 19 of the Bill, which is the section dealing with the production of documents and obtaining information. That is probably an easier way of dealing with this matter and obviously if he does not get any assistance from a company in providing the documents he has power under section 20 to enter the premises to get that information.  That might be an easier way for an oppressed minority to get information which they could not get. If they got the Minister's help he could use his powers under section 19 rather than those under section 8 which involve the very formal establishment of an inquiry, something which has not happened for the past 25 or 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's line of thinking in the use of section 19 but I might have difficulties with this because section 19 enables the Minister to require the production of documents and what is involved in the Deputy's suggestion is that the Minister would get the information which the members are unable to get and obviously he would pass it on to them.  This might place the Minister in a very difficult position as a &ldquo;getter&rdquo; and &ldquo;passer on&rdquo; of information to members.  If one wanted to go that road one would need to build some procedures into the Bill because the Minister could not run around handing over information to members just because some members wrote to him asking for the information.  It may be confidential information and it may not be wise for the Minister to pass it on.  It may be better for the members to use a court procedure so as to ensure they are entitled to the information.  It has a superficial attractiveness&mdash;let the Minister get all the information and pass it on to the members &mdash; but I would not be in a <Col N="744" /> position to do any more than look at the proposal.</P>

      <P>It does not do any good for this House to pass legislation which it knows is not going to be used and is simply put in for symbolic value.  Unless we get an administratively efficient method of getting this sort of information we might as well not bother dealing with this aspect of the Bill at all.  If the case is that this power should exist, perhaps the answer would be to extend the provisions in section 20 where a court is involved, and in this case the District Court, so that under section 19 the Minister could seek information for members of a company but if that information is not provided he could apply to the District Justice in the same way as is provided for in section 20. This would be a relatively speedy way of getting the information: the District Justice would say yes or no and that would be the end of the matter.  In this way one would not have to go to court, which presumably would be the Circuit Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they had to go to the High Court they would be into bigger bucks immediately.  You would not even get the information at that point.  An official investigator would have to be appointed who would present a report.  I would urge the Minister to look at sections 19 and 20 as a method of dealing with this.  By all means leave paragraph (c) in this section, but try to deal with the problem addressed by paragraph (c) in another way as well.  We should try to deal with the issue in sections 19 and 20.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has powers to require a company to furnish <Col N="745" /> him with certain information, books documents etc.  Presumably he would only use section 8 if the information he received was not satisfactory and he would then apply to the court for an appointment of an inspector.  I doubt that we will see the Minister for Industry and Commerce applying to the courts for the appointment of inspectors.  He has other powers in the Bill which will enable him to form an opinion.  I suppose it is better to have this provision included.  A further point to note is that under section 7 (3), the court may also require the Minister for Industry and Commerce to put forward security of an amount not exceeding £200,000.  Section 7 (3) states:</P>
      <P>Where an application is made under this section or section 8, the court may require the applicant or applicants to give security, to an amount not exceeding £200,000, for payment of the costs of the investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At what point would this happen?  Does a related company mean a wholly-owned subsidiary or a <Col N="747" /> company which is the whole owner of the company being investigated?

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section effectively re-enacts section 167 of the 1963 Act, with one substantive change, that is, the substitution of the word, &ldquo;court&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.  This amendment is consequential on the changes being introduced in sections 7 and 8, under which inspectors will now be appointed by the court and not by the Minister as heretofore.  The section now provides that where an inspector considers it necessary, for the purpose of his investigation into a company, to investigate a subsidiary or a holding company he will need the approval of the court to do so and not of the Minister as previously.  It is clearly vital for an inspector to be able to extend his investigation into other companies which might not have been mentioned in his original terms of reference and to be able to follow up any trails which may emerge during the investigation. Behind a simple looking company group structure, a veritable labyrinth of further group companies can exist whose association with the group may be cloaked by nominee holdings and so on.  Section 9 is designed to enable the inspector to follow that trail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister as to the importance of section 9.  It would be ridiculous to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of one company when he might discover a whole series of other companies existing behind it.  I remember being manager of an audit in this city and we spent six months putting together the number of companies which had been created over the years, some of which were dormant.  Section 9 contains an important provision.  Since the passing of the 1963 Act, company affairs have become more complex.  Most big companies have a myriad of subsidiary companies and if an inspector had <Col N="748" /> to get the approval of the court to investigate each of them, he would spend a lot of time going in and out of court, even though it might be only a matter of form. When the 1963 Act was passed, matters relating to companies were not as complex as they are now.  I wonder if we could make some improvement so that the inspector will not have to go back and forward to court looking for approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is what I am saying.  Matters are much more complex now than they were at the time of the passing of the 1963 Act.  At that time there was very little growth in the industrial economy and there were only a few large companies in the State.  There were very few public or private companies.  As Deputy McDowell has suggested, would it be possible to give prior approval? What would happen if an investigator who is appointed to investigate a company found subsidiary companies incorporated in other States such as Saudi Arabia or Libya?  Would he extend the investigation to that country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem also arises with offshore holding companies. I know the intention of the section is good but I wonder how would the investigator get his hands on companies held in trust in, for example, the Cayman Islands or some such place.  He would not be able to exercise his powers outside this jurisdiction. If people go to the trouble of setting up companies with the intention of defrauding, they will cover their tracks in such a way that nobody will find out about them.</P>

I would not envisage a major court hearing in <Col N="749" /> that regard but rather a reasonably short quick procedure.  The alternative might be difficult.  If we did not make it necessary for the inspector to go back to court to get permission to investigate other companies in the group we would be giving him a blank cheque to inspect every company that might or might not be involved.</P>

      <P>On the point of foreign ownership, as Deputy Bruton rightly said section 17 covers this matter.  The whole question of a company which is incorporated outside the State is a very broad one.  We will deal with that matter on section 17.  Basically we are trying to catch any company incorporated outside the State who are carrying on business in the State.  Perhaps we should postpone the debate on that until we come to section 17.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy has raised a valid point.  A common theme in this debate has been the fact that this procedure has not been used because it is so expensive.  Anything that renders the investigation procedure less expensive is likely to make it more useful in practice.  The Minister expressed a fear that to take out the words &ldquo;with the approval of the court&rdquo; from the section, which is what would be involved, would be to give too wide a power to the investigator. It is fair to say that section 155, <Col N="750" /> which has been drawn to my attention by Deputy McDowell, which defines what is a subsidiary and what is a holding company is fairly precise.  It states that a company shall be deemed to be the subsidiary of another company if, but only if, that other company is a member of it and controls the composition of its board of directors or holds more than half the nominal value of its equity share capital or holds more than half, in nominal value, of its shares, carrying voting rights.  In practice the investigator could only investigate a company which fulfilled one of those three requirements.  Therefore I do not think he would be holding a blank cheque.  He would not be able to go beyond the precise terms laid down in section 155 of the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister may be wrong in his worries.  Maybe he could look at that provision again to see if the words &ldquo;with the approval of the court&rdquo; could be removed from the section, in deference to the point made by Deputy McCreevy. If that does not satisfy the case perhaps he might look at the procedure I am suggesting in amendment No. 20 which provides for the court to lay down terms of reference of inspectors.  What I am saying is that the terms of reference shall be such as to enable the court to complete its investigations as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.  Perhaps one could add to that the words &ldquo;and to give such authority to the inspector in regard to the investigation of related companies in advance as is necessary for the expeditious completion of the investigation&rdquo; or some such phraseology.  That might solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the matter in case Deputy Bruton and Deputy McCreevy are worried about it. What would probably happen is that an inspector would be appointed by a court. In 99 cases out of 100 he would say there are subsidiaries and whoever is making the application, either he or his solicitor, would tell the court that he is applying for authority to investigate them.  The court would then give permission by way of an ancillary order.  There would not <Col N="751" /> be huge expense involved.  An inspector would say that he needs all these powers and he would be given them.  When liquidators are appointed they frequently get extra powers on the day on their appointment. It does not mean a lot of money to barristers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the purpose of the section and I can see both sides of the argument.  On the one hand, the investigator must get the approval of the court because otherwise he could investigate all kinds of things that relate to a company.  On the other hand, there is the cost factor and the loss of time involved.  Would it not be possible to leave out the words &ldquo;with the approval of the court&rdquo; so that the section would then read &ldquo;he shall have power to do so&rdquo;?  Why not insert a subsection later to the effect that any aggrieved person or company could apply to the court to prove why he should not go into a particular subsidiary.  In other words, give an inspector wider powers, with the proviso that a person objecting to his investigating a further subsidiary, holding company or whatever, could apply to the court.  That would be approaching the problem from another direction.  These provisions merely constitute a replica of section 167 of the Principal Act of 1963. That Act was passed 25 years ago and many things have changed in the interim. Why not give him wider-ranging powers but with a proviso within the Bill that a company that would not want him to investigate would be protected, so that a person, company or whoever could say <Col N="752" /> that he must have the approval of the court to do so?  Such approval would obtain unless someone objected and then the court would have to decide the issue. It might be a speedier way of doing so.  It is looking at the problem from a different perspective.</P>

      <P>All we are endeavouring to do here is ensure that an inspector gets clearance from the court if he is going into a company other than the one he has been appointed to inspect.  As Deputy McDowell said, in most cases, such an inspector will have a full list of subsidiaries when the question of his appointment first arises; he will know the subsidiaries.  But, in the event of his coming across one later of which he was not aware at the beginning, then we are giving him the facility to go back into court.  I would envisage that being a very quick procedure, not by any means a full court hearing.  That is necessary because we are talking here about a very formal, high-powered investigation into a company's affairs, not a quick collation of information.  Because we are talking about that quick formal investigation of a company's affairs, we should not lightly allow an inspector jump into a subsidiary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That could happen if we did not insert these few words for the court.  For example, a subsidiary may be totally at arms length other than the shareholding, and there are subsidiaries and subsidiaries.  A subsidiary may be totally at arms length and, if it is, an inspector could run in there without having to check with the court.  The sheer fact that an inspector does that could cause havoc in that company whereas, had it been done in a somewhat calmer fashion, the court procedure having been gone through quickly, it would have been better.  Of course we are also talking about the costs involved in this whole area.  The circumstances should not arise that frequently because more inspectors being appointed, as Deputy McDowell rightly said, will also seek appointment <Col N="753" /> to the subsidiaries.  I understand that is what happens in the case of receiverships and liquidations generally and I imagine is what will happen here.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, such an inspector will know most of the names. Almost certainly he will check what is publicly available before the first appointment which will not happen at ten minutes notice.  Therefore, he can check what is publicly available, have a list of subsidiaries and the holding company. Subsequently if one turns up about which he did not know then it would be legitimate to dash back to the court and seek approval.  The alternative would be to allow him go in without that approval or agreement; it may be a perfectly innocent company and may not warrant that sudden decision on the part of an inspector. We should remember that we complained earlier that this procedure would not be resorted to anyway.  I would agree that it will be used lightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Principal Act of 1963 relating to the appointment of inspectors, which was the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, it was assumed that the Minister would appoint a person, probably from within his Department, to investigate such matters.  In the case of liquidations it is a totally different matter because usually a creditor asks that somebody be appointed, or it is agreed beforehand by the banks, as the case may be. This is a totally different matter.  I can envisage a High Court judge sitting there saying: &ldquo;I will appoint an inspector, who do I know?  I know Deputy McDowell, perhaps I will appoint him, or Deputy McCreevy&rdquo;, as the case may be.  For example, will there be a panel of qualified people to act as inspectors.  Who will decide who should be eligible because I do not think a High Court judge would want a job of appointing an individual person.  It is different when a Minister is appointing an inspector because he will have a panel of names available to him and will decide that in the case of, say, company X, Mr. Y should carry out this investigation.  I want to ascertain how that will operate in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see this as a problem because it is already covered in the case of receiverships and liquidations. There is never a difficulty experienced at court level when a court appoints a receiver, liquidator or indeed an administrator for that matter.  There is never any great difficulty in finding suitable people to undertake the task.  In fact quite the contrary is the case, there is quite a queue of people known to the court to be available &mdash; accountants, lawyers, consultants, various professional people &mdash; who are available for such posts.  The courts do not experience any difficulty in the case of receiverships or liquidations. <Col N="755" /> I do not see why they should experience any difficulty in this area either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this will be a different investigation altogether.  I do not agree at all.  For example, in the case of a receivership, the bank will be putting in someone on behalf of some creditor, debenture holder or whoever, who will usually have a person in mind he will recommend to the court.  If it is an application for liquidation the petitioning creditor usually states in his application who will be appointed liquidator.  This is a totally different matter.  I do not forsee that any of those people will have a specific person in mind, nor is there any provision in these sections that they will name them in their applications unless there is recourse to the superior court rules to cover this.  The Minister is correct in saying that even in the case of voluntary liquidations, there will be queues of people fighting outside as to who will be appointed liquidator but I do not foresee the same thing happening in this instance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 48 to 51, to delete subsection (4), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  An inspector may examine on oath, either by word of mouth or on written interrogatories the officers and agents of the company or other body corporate and such person as is mentioned in subsection (2) in relation to its affairs and may&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> (a)  administer an oath accordingly.</P>
    <P>(b)  reduce the answers of such person to writing and require him to sign them.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps amendments Nos. 7 and 8 could be discussed together because they both relate to the same issue.</P>
    <P>These amendments propose, first, to give an inspector the right to give written questions to an officer or agent of a company he is entitled to examine and to require the officer or agent to sign the statement.  This is not something that has been thought up off the top of our heads. The reason it is proposed is that very frequently it is important to have a written agreed version of what a person actually said to an inspector for clarity afterwards, so that the inspector would be entitled to oblige the person to sign a transcript of his examination.</P>
    <P>The second point I would put to the Minister is that it is reasonable to make answers given to an inspector non-admissible against a person, especially when section 105 of this Bill replicating section 245 of the 1963 Act makes similar answers given in the course of a winding up investigation by the court non-admissible, and also in the light of the provisions of section 19 (6) which come into play.  It is reasonable in those circumstances to grant immunity to somebody who is examined on oath by an inspector where the court carrying out its own investigation under a similar and parallel procedure would have to grant such immunity.  I would ask the Minister to look at those two sections and see whether or not there is merit in Deputy Cullen's amendment.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the folowing motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the Report entitled &lsquo;The Development of Community and Social Services in Tallaght&rsquo;, published by the Tallaght Welfare Society in May, 1988 and circulated to each Party in the Dáil.  Dáil Éireann notes also that if all existing developments plans are completed, Tallaght will soon have a population roughly the same as that of Cork City; and that the headlong, unplanned growth of the greater Dublin South West area has taken place without the provision of the basic amenities &mdash; or even social services &mdash; taken for granted in established urban areas of a similar size.  Having regard to the particular needs of Tallaght, and bearing in mind that the problems of Tallaght represent a microcosm of disadvantage throughout the country, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a special programme to address and resolve these problems.  In particular, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;establish a single authority, to include representation by the people of Tallaght, to oversee and control the continued development of the area, <Col N="758" /> with the ultimate aim of establishing a separate local authority for Tallaght;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I started to refer to the problem of local government structures as they affect Tallaght and pointed out that currently Dublin County Council as a council with 78 members represented the entire county of Dublin and deals with Tallaght although there is a sub-committee, the Belgard Committee which is centred around both Tallaght and a number of other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to get on with providing the type of local government structure necessary to ensure the proper and full development of Tallaght, there is a need for radical reform in the area of local government.  The previous Government started on the road to recognising the need to divide up Dublin County Council. Unfortunately the momentum for local government reform which started under the previous Administration has ground to a halt.  I regard with a great deal of cynicism the comments made by the Minister for the Environment last night when he told us that since becoming <Col N="759" /> Minister he has been carrying out an intensive review of the local government system and that work on reorganisation is in progress, because it became quite clear during the course of Question Time to the Minister for the Environment recently, that no substantive progress of any nature is being made by this Government in the area of local government reform.  This Government have no idea what they should do about reforming the structures of local government in the city and county of Dublin and they have not addressed the issue of providing an adequate local government structure for Tallaght, an area that has approximately 75,000 people residing in it.  The Fine Gael Party fully supports the approach that there should be a local government structure directly for Tallaght with which the people of Tallaght could identify.</P>
    <P>This Government have an absolutely appalling record with regard to Tallaght. It is usual for politicians when addressing the growth of Tallaght to refer to the fact that it is one of the fastest growing areas in the county.  Indeed, it is the fastest growing area in the county and one of the fastest growing areas in all of Europe in the way the population has been growing between 1971 and 1988.  How this Government responded at local government level is by drastically reducing the rates support grant provided by Dublin County Council.  It was reduced by 13 per cent for the financial year 1988 and it has been reduced by a further 11 per cent for the year 1989.  That has some relevance because the reality is that this Government are failing to take account of the fact that Tallaght is growing.  It is not an area whose population is receding. Rather than reducing the funding allocation to Dublin County Council or to a new local authority to be provided for the people of Tallaght, the Government should be increasing the funding by way of domestic rates support grant to acknowledge the needs of the growing population.  Under this Government there has been less money for amenities, for park maintenance, for the provision of services and for road development. <Col N="760" /> The need to provide essential resources for additional amenities for both the burgeoning youth population of Tallaght and for some of the elderly residing in Tallaght is very clearly recognised by the Tallaght Welfare Society in their report.</P>
    <P>A great difficulty in the area of local government which was referred to by Deputy Dukes yesterday is the fact that many people living in Tallaght are living in a sort of twilight zone of local government where there is no direct political responsibility either for their estates or for the amenities provided to them. There are 4,620 corporation houses in Tallaght.  Because the corporation have these houses sited within county Dublin, in local government terms there are a large number of people in Tallaght effectively disenfranchised from local government. There is no direct political accountability for the way in which their estates are managed and there is no direct political focus.  This was raised by the Fine Gael Party both in Dublin County Council and in Dublin Corporation and, as Deputy Dukes pointed out, in Dublin County Council all parties have expressed the view that the council should take on board responsibility for the Dublin Corporation estates in Tallaght. In Dublin Corporation the Fianna Fáil group opposed that, so that we have the typical approach of Fianna Fáil pointing in two different directions at once on an issue about which immediate political decisions are required.  It is essential that we have an integrated plan to cover the entire area of Tallaght, to deal not just with local government but to cover an adequate health service, social services, transport services and educational services.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in the area of transport we have seen in the way CIE have dealt with Tallaght that only in recent weeks are they coming to grips with the needs of that growing community.  We are finally talking about the provision of buses linking Tallaght not just with the centre city but with other outlying areas.  In yesterday evening's paper there was an announcement from Dublin Bus about the provision of new services.  What is <Col N="761" /> clearly lacking in the context of the development of Tallaght is an integrated plan which provides a co-ordinated service that would bring together all the different agencies, the local authorities, the health boards, the IDA, CIE and so on.  In effect, there is no central authority that can guarantee that services are provided as they are needed.  Each of these bodies, although on occasions talking to each other, have operated in a vacuum. There are lessons to be learned from this, the first being that there is now a need to provide a new form of local authority with a developmental role to deal with the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>In the context of similar developments in other parts of County Dublin or throughout the country there is a need to ensure in future that there is a central body which can co-ordinate the provision of services and provide an integrated plan.  We need a different type of approach in dealing with a new town such as Tallaght.  It requires an immediate initiative.  It does not require the Minister for the Environment to prognosticate and worry over what sort of local government reform is required for the entire country.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent problems affecting people in Tallaght is unemployment. Fine Gael have made their commitment to tackling the problem of unemployment in Tallaght very clear.  I support the approach taken in the Tallaght COMTEC plan where they talk about the need for a jobs task force for Tallaght.  We have a growing young population in Tallaght who must be given hope that as they come out of second level education they will have the possibility of third level education by the provision of the regional college in Tallaght, or that, after second or third level education, they will have the possibility of employment. The emigration ship or permanent unemployment should not be the options facing them.  That requires, due to the numbers of young people in the Tallaght Community, a very definite jobs task force to be put into place.  It requires the IDA to have a real presence in Tallaght and it <Col N="762" /> requires a new focus from this Government to meet the demands of what is a growing community.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies I shared my time with Deputy Dukes.  There are many other things which should be said, but at the end of the day the people of Tallaght will not judge all of us by what we say in this House.  They will judge us by our actions.  They will judge this Government by the decisions made and implemented. A very detailed plan was published by the Fine Gael Party to tackle many of the problems in Tallaght, and I hope this debate will act as a catalyst to this Government taking seriously the needs of the people of Tallaght and that it will galvanise the Government into taking the necessary action with support from all sides of this House.</P>

      <P>This is a very important and valuable report.  I was very pleased last May to formally launch the Tallaght Welfare Society's excellent report entitled &ldquo;The Development of Community and Social Services in Tallaght&rdquo;, on which this motion is largely based.  Community development organisations have an important role in influencing social policies and the report is an excellent example of how this can be done.  The COMTEC report is another excellent example of this kind of approach to the Tallaght area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tallaght is an area with very special needs.  With a population of 73,000 it is larger than many towns in Ireland.  Thirty three per cent of its population is under age ten as against 20 per cent nationally, and half its population is under 20 years. The rate of unemployment in Tallaght, <Col N="763" /> which at 40 per cent is more than twice the national average, and its social welfare dependency rate of over 60 per cent is three times the national average.  In Tallaght we had a very large number of young people, a great need for employment and a very high dependency on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Although Tallaght faces many development problems and challenges, the major problem is unemployment. The report shows that in March 1988 unemployment payments were being made to 6,100 people.  The current number of recipients of unemployment payments is 5,200 and the expenditure amounts to almost £20 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The report contains a number of recommendations in relation to social welfare.  The principal recommendation in this area is that a comprehensive social welfare office be established in Tallaght. I recognise the urgent need for the establishment of such an office and I consider it to be an essential element of my Department's plans for the localisation of services.  The Office of Public Works have already entered into discussions with the local authority concerning the provision of a suitable site for this office. I am making every effort to ensure that the construction work on the project commences at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Once established, this office will tie in with the thrust of the recommendations contained in the report in relation to improvements in the delivery of social welfare services.  The new one-stop-shop style social welfare office which I am introducing will not only speed up the delivery of services but will help simplify the system for claimants by enabling them to have all their social welfare needs dealt with at a single office.  This would meet many of the proposals in the report, and I have already started a number of these offices at other centres.  This will provide the public in Tallaght with a much more comprehensive and co-ordinated service.  As the system develops it will be further enhanced by closer working relationships at local level between <Col N="764" /> my Department, FÁS, the Health Boards, the Revenue Commissioners and other State agencies.</P>
    <P>Pending the establishment of the new office in Tallaght, I am determined to bring about improvements in the existing facilities.  I have already set out on a programme to computerise unemployment payments throughout the country. I began this programme last July and it is now well under way.  One of the first areas where unemployment payments were computerised was Tallaght.  This enables payment dockets and pay sheets to be produced at the Tallaght office.  It has provided clients with better information, speedier processing of their claims and a much faster response to changes in their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the special problems of the unemployed and have already given them special additional assistance.  This year all social welfare recipients received a general increase of 3 per cent from July and this has more than protected the real value of payments given that the increase in the cost of living this year is expected to be just over 2 per cent.  In addition a significant increase of 11 per cent in the personal rate of payment and 6 per cent in the child dependant payment was granted to recipients of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance from July. These special increases costing an extra £30 million in a full year have significantly improved the position of those at greatest risk, namely, families headed by an unemployed person, particularly large families.  Further assistance has been provided to the long term unemployed through the extension of the free fuel scheme and this has benefited some 30,000 people, many of whom are living in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>One of the other recommendations contained in the report in the social welfare area relates to the need for greater publicity in relation to entitlements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This scheme is currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to achieving uniformity of treatment in <Col N="765" /> the application of the scheme.  In conjunction with the review of the guidelines about the scheme, a series of information leaflets covering different aspects of supplementary welfare allowance will be made available.  These leaflets will outline the circumstances in which assistance can be provided and the degree to which assistance is at the discretion of the health boards.</P>
    <P>The question of the take up of the scheme is one of the issues being addressed as part of the examination of the findings of the ESRI report on poverty. This report represents the initial results of a major survey of poverty in Ireland, which is being jointly funded by the ESRI itself, the EC Commission and the Combat Poverty Agency as part of the Second European Poverty Programme. The ESRI will be carrying out further research on the extent of and the reasons for non-take up of social welfare entitlements and this will include the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Further action to improve the level of take up under this scheme will be considered in the light of the findings which emerge.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the Combat Poverty Agency's report on moneylending and low income families highlights the appalling situation arising from the activities of unscrupulous moneylenders who impose charges equivalent to an annual percentage rate of 210 to 288 per cent.  This problem is of particular relevance for Tallaght, which incidentally was one of the areas surveyed in the report.  The Government have decided on an action plan to tackle the problems of moneylending, which includes the development nationwide of schemes similar to those operated by local credit unions in Cork and Waterford.  These schemes are designed to get people out of the grip of moneylenders and into credit unions.  I recently announced that the Government have decided to set up a loan guarantee fund for this purpose to be funded by way of a grant of £100,000 in 1989 from national lottery moneys.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to tell the House that following a meeting which I had with Dr. <Col N="766" /> Louden Ryan and Mr. Jim Bardon of the Irish Banks Standing Committee last week, the four Associated Banks, the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Ulster Bank and the National Irish Bank, have agreed to match the Government's contribution by contributing £100,000 to the fund.  The Associated Banks have also agreed to participate in the supervisory committee which I will be setting up shortly to oversee the operation of the fund.</P>
    <P>The voluntary sector has an important role in our society.  Voluntary organisations are in a position to identify local needs and concerns.  The Government recognise the invaluable contribution which the voluntary sector make in the provision of social services.  We have given a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to take measures to ensure a closer liaison with voluntary organisations in the preparation and implementation of policies in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>In line with this commitment last week I met a number of voluntary organisations working in the social welfare area, including Tallaght Welfare Society, for a pre-budget forum.  The purpose of this forum was to give me an opportunity to talk to the organisations about their concerns and to hear at first hand their recommendations and suggestions as to where the priorities should lie in framing the social welfare input to the forth-coming budget.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Social Welfare I am very pleased to have been able to support the invaluable work of voluntary organisations in Tallaght through the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies administered by my Department.  Earlier this year I approved a grant of £20,000 for the Kiltalown house centre towards the setting up of workshops and the purchase of equipment.  I also provided a grant of £8,000 to the Tallaght welfare society to fund reconstruction work to its centre to improve accommodation, access and facilities for the physically handicapped. Other grants for voluntary organisations in the Tallaght area include £5,000 to the Tallaght unemployed resource centre, <Col N="767" /> £1,000 for the Tallaght travellers project and £800 for the special child's club in Killinarden.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Combat Poverty Agency is jointly funding the West Tallaght Resource Centre with the EC Commission. This centre is one off the nine Irish projects which are participating in the second EC Poverty Programme.  One of the aims of this project is to help build a community response to the problems of unemployment.  I am pleased that the Exchequer, through the Combat Poverty Agency, will be providing £110,800 to the project over the four years of the programme, of which some £28,700 has been provided this year.</P>
    <P>Overall the total value of the grants which have been provided through my Department this year to voluntary bodies in Tallaght is £63,500.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, A Cheann Comhairle. in my experience there is a marvellous community in Tallaght.  There are 128 organisations in the area.  There are probably more youth bands in Tallaght than any other community in the country, and you would see that on St. Patrick's Day or at the community games.  I congratulate the members of the community on their great comunity spirit.  This can be seen in the community, among the social welfare groups and the business community.  The Chamber of Commerce, in particular, have taken a very active interest in the community.  I can assure the House that I will continue to give every assistance to the people in dealing with the problems of Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  The particular part of the motion as put down by the Labour Party which affects my Department is to &ldquo;proceed with the building of the regional technical college in Tallaght&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Before I speak on the above point, though, I would like to list a number of very positive steps which this Government have taken in relation to the Tallaght area.  However, I will be concentrating on my own Department. In 1988 my Department allocated £365,000 to youth services in the Tallaght and Blanchardstown areas.  A grant of £100,000 has been made available to the Eastern Health Board to fund a special project in Tallaght to develop a community response to the problems of young homeless people.  Capital grants totalling £700,000 have been allocated to sport and community centres in Tallaght. Most of this money comes from the Department of Education.  The sport section within my Department has provided £800,000 which has been allocated for the development of a National Basketball Centre which is to be located at Tymon north, Tallaght.</P>
      <P>It is intended that County Dublin VEC would provide 50 places in the Tallaght area under the Youthreach programme, a recently announced joint programme between the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and myself.  The Youthreach programme which is a joint initiative by the Departments of Education and Labour deals with the problems of young people of 15 to 18 years of age who have left school without any qualifications and are unemployed.</P>
      <P>The educational opportunities scheme is being continued in Tallaght in 1989. This is a scheme in conjunction with the Minister for Social Welfare and myself. This scheme has been very successful in providing second chance adult education for the long term unemployed leading to participation in education and resulting in formal qualifications at intermediate and leaving certificate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above is just a brief précis of the <Col N="769" /> positive initiatives taken by this Government for the Tallaght area.  However, I now wish to turn to the main part of the motion which concerns my Department, that is, the building of the regional technical college for the area.</P>
    <P>The previous Government decided to set up an interdepartmental committee representative of Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour, Health, and Agriculture and Food to examine: the provision of third-level places, the rationalisation of third-level departments and institutions and the funding of these institutions.</P>
    <P>I expect to have an interim report from the committee early in the new year. While not anticipating the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee a number of factors are clear. First, the population participating in third level education is projected to continue growing until the year 2000.  There is considerable scope for increased participation levels and increased demand is likely to be fuelled by the higher skills required to operate in a free market after 1992.</P>
    <P>The second factor which weighs very heavily on me is that the RTCs generally have had spectacular success in the areas where they have been established, not only in attracting students in these localities, which previously had no tradition of third level education, but also in stimulating economic development and in placing graduates in jobs.</P>
    <P>Third, the wider role of regional colleges in continuing education and in supporting through research and consultancy the economic development of their particular catchment areas is now a growing feature of the existing colleges.  Upcoming legislation which I will bring to the House concerning vocational education committees will be aimed at putting research and development projects currently being carried out in third level VEC colleges on a firmer footing.  Up to now these colleges have operated research and development projects in an admirable but <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.  RTCs are particularly poised to take advantage of current European funding for specific <Col N="770" /> projects aimed at strengthening ties between industry and education.</P>
    <P>Recently I was at a meeting in Brussels when the Minister for Education discussed the COMET, the SPRITE, the ERASMUS and other programmes which link industry with education at third level.  They were particularly appreciate of the role of the VEC third level colleges, particularly the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges in the way they have succeeded in intertwining with the local business community and with research and development in the community.</P>
    <P>It is for all these reasons that I have instructed my Department to include the Tallaght regional technical college project in the submission it has made in connection with the development programme which is being drawn up for the greater Dublin area in the context of the revised European Structrual Fund.  I will be personally involving myself at Government level in the follow-up to this submission.</P>
    <P>All speakers on this motion are in common accord on the need to provide more and better facilities for Tallaght.  I would like to assure all concerned that my Department and I will continue within the available resources to support in every way possible the provision of the necessary and desirable educational facilities.</P>
    <P>Today there was launched a very important third level research study into education, the Patrick Clancy second report <i>Who Goes Into Third Level Education?</i> He had an earlier one which ended with 1982 and this report deals with 1982 to 1986.  As in all major research projects there were many factors, some startling, some not so, in this report.  One factor which had a relevant bearing on the matter we are touching on here tonight, the provision of the regional college for Tallaght, was the fact that the participatory rate by young people in Dublin and greater Dublin area in third level education is very much below that in the rest of the country.  There were very many other factors in the report, but that was a very <Col N="771" /> startling and dominant one which, having met with Mr. Clancy today and on previous occasions and having studied the report very carefully, was in my mind when I was preparing my speech for this very important debate here tonight.  That survey of the years 1982-86 shows the imbalance between the participants in third level education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> I have known Tallaght for many years from the time one could describe it as a real country village with just a main street, two licensed premises, the Dominican Priory, the Garda station and two very well-known industries, Urney Chocolates and Glen Abbey.  I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to these two industries for their contribution to Tallaght in those early days.</P>
    <P>Before I commence to speak on the motion I think it is only right and proper to place on the record of this House the good name of Tallaght.  Tallaght has been very much in the news from time to time for many years, If anything bad happens in Tallaght it will receive banner headlines in the papers.  If anything good happens there &mdash; and many good things happen in Tallaght from time to time &mdash; it might receive a line or two on the back page of a paper; at times no reference would be made at all to it.  Think of the many fine people in Tallaght.  People have used their life savings to purchase houses there.  Tallaght has many organisations both community and residents', and the Minister, Deputy Woods, has mentioned the number of bands, football and hurling clubs etc., and the teachers attached to the various schools.  Considering the very valuable work all these people do.  Tallaght does not deserve much of the criticism levelled at it.  I am a member of some of the school boards there and have served on interview boards.  In that capacity I met people who came from the country having applied for jobs.  On a few occasions I went to the trouble of asking them what they knew about Tallaght and on one or two occasions I was very surprised and let me say, very disappointed at the answer I received: &ldquo;Tallaght must be a desperate place; it is in the news every day&rdquo;.  I refer to this because everyone has a part to play so far as Tallaght is concerned, not only the elected representatives.  The criticism that has been levelled at Tallaght over the years is most unfair to the people there.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time I have heard of the contents of this motion.  I have been hearing about them for many years. <Col N="773" /> The people of Tallaght have become a little tired of the politicians and others talking of what should be done while when the opportunity is provided very little has been done at times.  I am not going to engage in much criticism here tonight.  I recognise the needs of Tallaght and I welcome the motion as tabled by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Tallaght was once a country village with a population of 300 to 500 people; now it has 70,000 to 80,000, and the problems of the area are vast.  This Fianna Fáil Government, despite the lack of finance, have made an effort to meet some of the needs and to solve the problems of Tallaght and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Government on having the courage and will to designate a number of acres of land &mdash; I think 120 acres was mentioned &mdash; for the town centre and additional industries.  I hope the facilities which will arise from this when availed of will go a long way towards solving some of the unemployment problems there.  Of course, that designation is not the solution to all the problems.  Much more than that is required, and I have no doubt that with the availability of finance and things improving generally the Government will turn their attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>This motion refers to the establishment of a separate authority for Tallaght.  Prior to the last local government elections, as everybody knows, there was a considerable review of all local authority areas, particularly in Dublin.  There is that well known body, Tallaght Community Council, which sent a number of deputations to this House seeking a separate authority for Tallaght.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>You will not have any difficulty with me because when I sit in that Chair myself I am really glad to get the co-operation of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tallaght Community Council were met by Ministers on the question of a separate <Col N="774" /> authority and were told that the Government were very sympathetic and that the representations of the Tallaght Community Council would be taken into consideration. The council areas were revised but no special authority was set up for Tallaght.  The local elections for County Dublin were set on the basis that we would have three county councils in Dublin.  We have now a Dublin County Council with 78 members and it is very difficult to operate.  I will close on that note.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want at the outset to compliment the Labour Party and my colleague, Deputy Taylor, in particular for giving their Private Members' Time to this debate.  The Labour Party, like the Progressive Democrats, have an opportunity only once every Dáil term to move a Private Members' Motion and they deserve all our thanks, particularly those of us who have worked on behalf of the people in Tallaght to bring about the much needed facilities for the area, for bringing this debate to the floor of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I have to take issue with the remarks of Deputy Shatter who believes that the catalyst for this debate was the Fine Gael proposals launched by Deputy Dukes some months ago in the Tallaght area. The catalyst for this debate was the very fine report drawn up by the Tallaght Welfare Society and I would like to compliment them, their chairman, Mr. Aidan Thomas, and their director, Mr. Brian Kenny, for the marvellous work they have done for all of us; indeed, they put Government agencies to shame by the fine way they have been able to draw together the facts and the information and present in a very coherent way the case for change in the manner in which Tallaght has been treated by various Government agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is anything we do not need more of in Tallaght it is false political promises from whatever political party happens to be in power.  As somebody who has sat on both sides of this House in my six years since becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann it seems to me that when <Col N="775" /> people move from the Government side to the Opposition side suddenly they can find the panacea for all Tallaght's ills and nothing is impossible.  Tallaght, for its size, has never been given any recognition by any Government in this country. As Deputy Walsh says, Tallaght receives more than its share of bad publicity from the national media, and I suppose it is indicative of their attitude that none of their representatives is in the press gallery at the moment.  It is a pity because that bad publicity has exacerbated the problems and led to the outside world, to people who do not live in Tallaght, having a very poor impression of the area and its people.  It has led to house values in the area declining even when the market is on the increase nationally. It has led to the private sector turning a blind eye to the business and development opportunities that exist in Tallaght. I and the rest of my colleagues were very pleased today to attend the launching by an American group, AMC, of their plans for the 16 cinema multi-cinema complex for the Tallaght area.  It is not the answer to all the problems or all the leisure demands, but it is significant that it has taken an American company to have confidence enough to invest their resources and to provide this facility for the people. I hope that many of their Irish counterparts will follow suit and that the business community in this country will have the confidence to invest in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on their decision to designate 120 acres in the centre of Tallaght under the urban renewal scheme, bringing as it will, many tax benefits to those who locate there or are presently located there to expand and develop their business.  That will play a significant role in creating the much needed job opportunities for the people who reside in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I also believe that if Tallaght were located 30 or 40 miles from Dublin city centre it would not be treated in the manner in which it has.  It would not be seen, as it is seen at the moment by Government agencies, merely as a suburb on the outskirts of Dublin but as <Col N="776" /> a town of 73,000 people with a separate identity and very particular demands.  It would be seen as a town that requires a hospital and a third level college and many other facilities, and now 25 years after the development started I believe it will have those facilities.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that Tallaght, as well as Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown, the other new towns on the outskirts of Dublin, have had to suffer because there was no overall development authority established prior to the town being built.  The failure to set up such an authority is a poor reflection on our concept of planning.  Planning is not simply about building houses and putting people into them.  The whole concept of building a new town means we must have an overall co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to what that town and its people will require.  We have not had that in Tallaght and neither have we had it in relation to the other new towns and it is a disgrace.  If we learn no other lesson from the mistakes that have been made we must now realise that before we embark on any major new town development again we must ensure that a development authority is established and that that development is co-ordinated and planned and that the much needed shopping, leisure, community, health and other facilities that are part and parcel of any town come as the people come and not many years later.</P>
    <P>The building of the community facilities and the infrastructure in Tallaght requires a number of things.  It obviously requires more money, and here I want to refer to the comments made last night by Deputy Taylor.  He said that there was no point in people making fine speeches in this debate and voting for his motion if they did not follow through when the Estimates were being voted on.  Even in the good days Tallaght did not get its share of the public finances and not just because the money was not there.  There were times when there was money available which was being freely spent.  Tallaght did not get its share of national resources because the kind of commitment that was required to give it its <Col N="777" /> share never existed in any Government in this country.  Not until such time as there is at the Cabinet table &mdash; and I do not mind who is in power &mdash; somebody who represents the area will Tallaght get the kind of resources it deserves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, the Minister for Social Welfare, made great play of the fact that he had allocated £63,000 this year to voluntary groups in Tallaght.  I am pleased he did that, but that was not even as much money as was allocated to golf clubs in County Sligo.  Nobody could say that the allocation of £63,000, in an area with the problems and disadvantages that Tallaght has had to endure is half enough money. I will not say that it is because the money goes to golf clubs outside my constituency; but even in our constituency, the Minister for Sport, Deputy Fahey, recently went out to the Slade Valley Golf Club and told them he was going to give them £15,000 towards the development of their club house.  That club has £300,000 on deposit in a bank.  I am not against those who play golf; indeed, I have many friends who are members of that club but it is obvious that they have a lot of clout.  A couple of miles down the road from that club, the Tallaght Senior Citizens, a group of elderly people from a disadvantaged area, got together to try to build a clubhouse for their members but they were refused an allocation.  Who can say that there is any justification in giving money to a private golf club and refusing money to an organisation that represents senior citizens in a disadvantaged area?</P>
    <P>Such decisions are made because the sense of priority people have about various issues is often very different.  The way the national lottery funds are being dispersed is indicative of the sense of priority certain people have.  If this debate does nothing else but highlights the problems of Tallaght, an area on the outskirts of Dublin with a population of 73,000 people, many of whom have lived there for 20 years without basic infra-structural facilities, it will have been worthwhile.  If it encourages Members to re-think their attitude to new towns like <Col N="778" /> Tallaght we will have achieved something. I hope that when lottery funds and Government money is being distributed it will be given to areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>In complimenting community and voluntary organisations, particularly in the Tallaght area &mdash; reference has been made to the fact that there are 125 such organisations in Tallaght &mdash; I should like to say, on behalf of other public representatives, that if it was not for the work of those voluntary groups I shudder to think of the problems that would exist in Tallaght today.  I shudder to think of the workload that Deputies and councillors for that area would have to carry if we did not have such organisations.  Those groups in doing such excellent voluntary work save many of us a lot of trouble.  In particular, the Tallaght Welfare Society which processed 42,000 queries last year, 75 per cent of them in relation to social welfare matters, deserve our compliments for the speedy and efficient way they are able to process the cases that go before them. They would put many Government Departments to shame.</P>
    <P>We need to re-think the way we assist voluntary and community organisations in terms of the grant scheme that operates through local authorities.  In the last five years, £950,000 has been given by Dublin County Council and the Department of the Environment to community and voluntary groups operating in the Tallaght area and 94.5 per cent of that money was in respect of bricks and mortar.  The time has come to introduce a new scheme of grants, as recommended by the Tallaght Welfare Society, to help those organisations employ people and run their affairs.  Those groups should be given assistance towards insurance, lighting and maintenance costs.  There is little point in erecting buildings if we do not use them to the maximum.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister for Education has made a commitment in relation to a regional college.  The Minister referred to the publication today of the Clancy report on third level education. That report drew attention to the fact that the rate of participation by students in Dublin is a great deal lower than <Col N="779" /> the national average.  If facilities are not provided in an area, the rate of participation in either second or third level education will be lower.  The existence of facilities encourages people to think in terms of third level education, it brings third level education to within the reach of many, particularly if the facility is erected in an area like Tallaght.  Therefore, even if this is not accepted as a suitable project for EC funding through the Structural Funds, it must be a priority of the Government to provide that facility in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest where the finance might come from.  I have calculated that if we were to build a hospital, a third level college and the schools that are necessary in the area, we would have to spend in the region of £150 million.  I am no fool and I am aware that that money is not easily available.  If the Structural Funds that will become available to this country in the run up to 1992 are to be of any use they must go to disadvantaged areas and I can think of no more disadvantaged area than Tallaght.  If they are not suitable projects for that fund, the Ministers for Education and Health should do as has been done in relation to the new Cavan Regional Hospital, make an arrangement with Banque Nationale de Paris &mdash; that deal was struck by the previous Government &mdash; to raise a loan on foot of capital expenditure and guarantee the loan repayments.  That would mean that if £150 million was borrowed on a guarantee by the Government, a figure in the region of £16,500,000 would have to be paid each year, £3,500,000 less than is paid to the unemployed in Tallaght each year.  I do not think that is a huge commitment to seek from any Government.  The country is not so badly off that it cannot afford that level of finance.  We must have a determination and a commitment to help deprived and disadvantaged areas like Tallaght.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to give some of my time to Deputy Mac Giolla and I note that in the amendment tabled by Members of his party there is a reference <Col N="780" /> to the need to provide second level schools in Kilnamanagh-Kingswood and Jobstown.  I endorse that call.  The history of the Kilnamanagh-Kingswood school project is comical.  The Department of Education, unsure of whether to build a school at Kingswood or Kilnamanagh, acquired two sites.  They spent more than £250,000 in design fees and so on in respect of one site, a scandal if it is not their intention to build a school.  If a school is not provided, 1,000 children will leave that area each day using public transport.  I urge the Minister for Education to make an announcement about that project in the near future.</P>
    <P>If Tallaght can be described as a disadvantaged area, I do not know what phrase could be used to describe Jobstown where up to 70 per cent of the people are dependent on social welfare. There is a high level of unemployment and the number of single parent families there is greater than the national average. However, unlike Kilnamanagh-Kingswood, there is a school in Jobstown.  The problem there is that they do not have a building.  I understand that 1,400 children are attending primary schools in the Jobstown area and if such an area does not deserve a new second level school, I do not know where we should build one.  The Minister for Education, and her officials, constantly tell us of the places in adjoining schools.  To them Tallaght is like a village and if there is a school at one end of the village they do not see any reason the children should not travel to it.  If the position was as simple as that, we would not be objecting.  Tallaght is a huge town in terms of its population and its needs. It is not possible to split up 1,400 students and expect them to travel all over the place to second level schools.  If that community needs anything, it needs those students kept together in one building. They must learn geography, history, Irish and so on in the one building.  The Minister may say that the numbers do not justify the erection of a second level school but the social disadvantages in that area are such that unless the Government adopt a new approach to the concept of education, they are storing up huge <Col N="781" /> problems for the future.  Jobstown is an obvious example of an area that could benefit under a new pilot scheme combining second level and adult education in the one building.  It should be the start of new Government thinking in relation to disadvantaged areas.  If the Minister goes down that road, I do not think there is anybody who will criticise her.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul published their annual report and it makes frightening reading.  Those of us who represent Tallaght which has a social welfare dependency rate three times the national average are well aware of the difficulties experienced by those who reside in that area and do not have adequate benefits.  That situation will continue, regardless of which party is in power, whether they are of the right or of the left it does not matter, because as far as Tallaght is concerned they have all been in power and they have all failed. That situation will continue until such time as we think in new ways about the building of new towns and about areas of disadvantage.  I hope this debate has started that rethink in this House.  I hope that this debate, by focusing all our minds and our attention on this area of special need, will result in the much needed community facilities being developed there and will result in the establishment even now of a single development authority whose role would be a different role than the role they may have had 20 years ago.  Their rule would be to go out and market Tallaght and to highlight the good points.  I would say to the national media that if they were to give even half the attention to the good things in Tallaght as they do to the unpleasant things it would make all of us very happy.</P>
    <P>Last night we saw on our national television screens yet another programme that highlighted the inadequacies and the bad sides.  Tallaght does not have enough gardaí.  If it were to have its national average it should have over 300.  Tallaght just does not require 300 gardaí; Tallaght requires new and imaginative policies.  It requires a new approach from all of us <Col N="782" /> who represent the area and, in particular, it requires a new approach from Government.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for allowing me some of her very precious time.  This is one area in which I am in agreement with her remarks.  I have been involved with the development of Tallaght in Dublin City Council over the last decade from the time when it was a green field until its development today. Not alone was I involved on the planning and building of the Tallaght area from the Dublin Corporation point of view but I knew many of the hundreds of people who moved out from Inchicore, Bluebell, Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Walkinstown which I represented at the time. Also 600 or 700 families from the Gardiner Street inner city area were moved to the Clondalkin, Tallaght and Blanchardstown areas.  These were three new towns, great planning was involved and everyone was full of hope.  Blanchardstown and Clondalkin are looking to Tallaght because they know Tallaght is ahead of them.  They will not reach the Tallaght situation for some time but their hopes are gone already when they see nothing happening in Tallaght.  There are over 30,000 people in Blanchardstown and over 30,000 in the Clondalkin-Ronanstown area and well over 70,000 in Tallaght.  I would disagree with one point made by Deputy Harney.  She said there was a lack of planning, but it was all planned.  I saw all the plans; but there was no money and no investment so therefore the plans died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that the plans for the town centre in Tallaght came before us in Dublin Corporation in 1979 or 1980. They were put to tender and eventually a group &mdash; whose name I cannot remember, it is so long ago &mdash; from Scotland were going to build this marvellous town centre at the beginning of the development in Tallaght in the 1980-81 period. They pulled out because they could not hang around forever waiting for someone to provide funding.  We are now left with Monarch Properties Ltd., P.J. Monaghan whose plan is for something half <Col N="783" /> the size of what was originally intended. We no longer have plans for a town centre but rather a shopping complex in the area.</P>
    <P>The problems of Tallaght have been related by Deputy Harney and others. It has no identity, no town centre, no hospital, no RTC, no district library, no arts and culture centre, no leisure complex and no municipal headquarters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh referred to local authority development.  It is essential that Tallaght should have its own urban local authority &mdash; Leixlip already has commissioner status and that area is tiny compared with Tallaght &mdash; and it should have its own municipal headquarters as well. Tallaght should have a town centre with theatres and cinemas and not just a shopping complex.  The whole original concept has died in the development of the Tallaght area.  I congratulate the Labour Party for putting down this motion. Unfortunately, the Coalition Government from 1982 to 1987 ignored Tallaght just as the present Government are doing in the area of hard investment and that is what is required.</P>
    <P>There is no point in drawing up marvellous plans for the three new towns, new cities, outside Dublin unless investment is provided for public transport and everything else that is involved.  Maynooth, with a tiny population compared to Tallaght, has a far better public transport service.  This Government decided last autumn that the rapid transit system would not go ahead and that Tallaght would be written off.</P>
    <P>Jobs and investment in Tallaght are crucial as every report done on Tallaght has indicated.  The building of the town centre would provide at least 800 jobs during construction and as many as 2,000 jobs afterwards in the development of the town centre in jobs in the area.  The Tallaght hospital would also provide many hundreds of jobs during construction and jobs for 1,500 to 2,000 people in the hospital.  Similarly, about 300 jobs would be provided in the construction of RTC and many hundreds of new jobs when the RTC is functioning. <Col N="784" /> This investment in jobs would create a whole new environment in the area which would attract further industry and further development.  What is required is investment. This Government have cut back the capital programme for the whole country.  It is essential that the capital programme be restored in this budget. We can have all the plans we like but we have got to have the money and the investment.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is an area that does not attract new jobs and new industry at present because of the environment and the lack of facilities etc.  If jobs and industries were there great progress could be made. The Workers' Party did a survey in the region which showed that the region which would be served by the RTC from Firhouse to Clondalkin has currently 16,375 pupils at second level schools. Towns like Tralee and Dundalk have an RTC.  Galway, which has a smaller population than Tallaght, has both a university and an RTC.  I was very disappointed to hear the Minister's statement that she has now decided to include the Tallaght RTC project in the integrated plan for the EC for the greater Dublin area.  In other words, she is saying we will ask the EC to build our schools.  Everything in Dublin is being thrown into this integrated plan. The EC will now have to pay for parks, schools, the road system in Dublin &mdash; the inner tangent ring road has been included in the plan.  The Government are tossing everything into that plan and are evading their responsibility to build these schools. As Deputy Harney said, the Minister totally ignored the community college in Jobstown.  Today in the <i>Evening Herald</i> there is an item showing the protest of the children in Jobstown.  They have teachers, they have pupils but they have no school.  It is an absolute disgrace and the Minister never even mentioned them. I believe they were in seeking to meet her this afternoon.  Whether or not they met her I do not know, but she gave no commitment whatever to them.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comments of the Minister for Poverty, the facilities are good and are very welcome in the area but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, is correct. You identified him correctly.  He has hounded and harassed the people of Tallaght and many other areas of this city in the name of fighting fraud.  He is harassing people who are trying to put bread on the table for their children and this is grinding them further into the poverty trap.  Deputy Harney also referred to policing in the area.  Superintendent McMunn issued a report in which he acknowledged that there are major policing problems in Tallaght and that these problems can be linked to the conditions existing in the area.  He is very much aware of these.  He has 75 gardaí under his control in an area which has a population of 73,000.  There are 325 gardaí in Limerick which has a population smaller than that of Tallaght.  This is a sign of the commitment which this and the previous Government had to the people living in the Tallaght area and to those living in new towns.  People went to live in these new towns with great hopes but now they are trying to get out of those towns because they feel that they would be able to live better near to where their mothers, fathers and other relatives are living rather than living in an area such as Tallaght where there are no decent shops, no town centre or amenities for their children.  Tallaght is losing its population because of both migration and emigration due to the lack of facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for finance to ensure that in the coming budget this problem is tackled.  The problem of the lack of facilities such as schools, hospitals and a town centre which has been referred to by every other speaker in this debate can be tackled through the drawing up of a construction programme.  The one thing Fianna Fáil were expected to do was to bring the construction industry to life again.  That is the one thing they were expected to do but they have failed to do so.  In fact they have cut back on spending on the capital side on construction.  A fantastic possibility exists in the Tallaght <Col N="786" /> area if a construction programme is developed for it, a programme which will create jobs and provide the facilities which will attract more industry.</P>

      <P>I understand, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that my colleague, Deputy Desmond, will be replying to the <Col N="787" /> debate on behalf of the Labour Party.  In the two to three minutes at my disposal I would like as Education spokesperson for the Labour Party to direct my attention to the speech made by the Minister for Education.  Next Saturday we will celebrate the Fortieth Anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights which was signed on 10 December 1948. In 1959 the document on the rights of the child was promulgated and Ireland is a signatory to that document.  In this debate reference has been made to the rights of people being slashed by what might be called an anti-urban bias on the part of many of those who have planned and legislated on their behalf.  Many of those who have entered this House and who have sat in powerful positions here were not oriented towards realising that Irish society was an urbanising one.</P>
      <P>What I want to say in regard to educational facilities is this: let us clearly establish once and for all that in talking about the provision of a regional technical college, we are talking about the right of the area to a regional technical college.  Once that has been accepted the Minister should then seek funding from wherever she likes but it should not be the case that you put the expectation of a regional technical college into the bucket of the regional plan and then hope for a favourable outcome.  At the end of this debate let us agree that an unanswerable case has been made for second level schools in Jobstown and Kilnamanagh-Kingswood. In one case, a school without a home and in the other an unanswerable case, by population projections for enrolment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Clancy report but what she did not give were the hard figures contained in Dr. Patrick Clancy's first report.  That report stated that 19.5 per cent of the children of parents in the ownership and managerial brackets were likely to enter third level education while those in the bottom fifth had only a 1.2 per cent chance of entering third level education.  What the Minister forgot to tell the House, although I believe that in goodwill she was moving <Col N="788" /> in that direction, was that the gaps had all widened since the presentation of Dr. Clancy's first report and the one which was referred to in the press this morning, which states that the disadvantaged have least access to third level education.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by referring to something very important.  Let us accept that it is socially wrong that there are inequities. Every taxpayer, 74 per cent of whom are PAYE workers, pays the taxes which are transferred to education but many of the children of those paying taxes have only a one-eighteenth or a one-twentieth chance of entering third level education. The provision of a regional technical college would provide them with that opportunity. That is a case built on rights, the funding is a matter for ingenuity.  If we were to look at the figures and at the experience in connection with the two second level facilities one would have to ask if it is not time for a commitment to be given and a timescale established to deliver second level facilities in both cases?  That is the position of the Labour Party.  It is one which we do not equivocate on and it is one we have communicated to the teachers, the parents, the children and the community organisations involved.  That is what we will continue to press for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding this debate on behalf of the Labour Party I should stress the positive aspects of this debate.  The most positive aspect so far as we are concerned is that there has been a general acceptance of our motion by the Government and by the other Opposition party in the Dáil.  We are also very pleased to accept the amendment tabled by The Workers' Party.  I thank the House for its agreement and we must press forward from here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another positive aspect of this debate is that three Government Ministers, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Education and the Minister for Social Welfare, came into the House to deal with the problems in the Tallaght area.  This is an indication of the concern among members of the Cabinet in regard to the major problems in this area.  I <Col N="789" /> thank warmly my colleague, Deputy Taylor, for coming to the parliamentary Labour Party to seek time in Private Members' time to have this debate. When we met the Tallaght Welfare Society we indicated that we were prepared to make time available for such a debate and the party unanimously agreed that we should do so despite the many other pressing issues on the agenda for Private Members' time.  That, too, is a positive development.</P>
    <P>There are grave questions which have to be addressed.  The unanimity of this House masks, and tends to gloss over the true position in respect of the provision of fundamental capital resources for the development of Tallaght.  The catalyst of cuts is not just on the capital side; it is very much hidden on the agenda of the current cuts as well.  I will give a classic example of this.  The budget of the Eastern Health Board for 1989, a budget which delivered multiple services into Tallaght, has been cut by £7 million.  In terms of a straight ratio of cuts for Tallaght that means that at least £1 million of health services are being clawed out of the community delivery system into that area, whether it is community care, hospital beds allocated to that area or general medical services delivered into that area.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two hospitals which deliver services into that area.  The Children's Hospital in Crumlin is well known to many Tallaght families and between 1977 and 1988 the budget of that hospital was cut by £500,000.  That has had an impact on outpatient services, public beds for children and paediatric services in that hospital and has affected the quality of the lives of families in Tallaght. That is the hidden agenda and that, I would stress, is a matter of grave importance. The budget of the National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street was cut by 10 per cent in 1988.  As a consequence of these cuts there are fewer staff, fewer children's beds, fewer consultant hours and more deficient outpatient services in these two hospitals.  That is the reality of these cuts and that is why we have to examine the true situation.  I <Col N="790" /> make that point &mdash; and this is the nub of the problem &mdash; because the budget for that health board was passed by this House and the only political party who voted against it in the lobby were the Labour Party.  One cannot camouflage that fact and one cannot produce rhetoric to cover that reality.  We, with the support of The Worker's Party and the Independents, voted against that Estimate.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the other scandalous issue which exists in relation to the overall development of Tallaght.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, came in here and said, after a decade of gestation in relation to the development of Tallaght, that the prospects for local government is a matter which falls to be considered in the context of a comprehensive programme for the reform of local government.  How much more do we have to go through in terms of this proposal?  The Minister even went so far as to say that he had been carrying out an intensive review and he capped it all by saying that the question of the appropriate local government system for Dublin is one of the matters which will be dealt with in the context of this review. I served on Dublin County Council for seven years from 1974 to 1981 and I was chairman and vice-chairman of the council. I served on the council with Deputy Walsh and Deputy Taylor and we all know that Tallaght, that conurbation, is crying out for its own local authority. There is no relationship between the 130 public voluntary organisations in that area and the executive authority of that area.  If one goes to the meetings of Dublin County Council one will realise that 76 people spend only 20 minutes a month talking about a particular item on the Tallaght agenda as they desperately try to address the multiple problems of the greater Dublin area.  I say to the Minister that it is not good enough to come in here and not give any prospect of the appointment of an assistant city and county manager, in an executive position, to deal with Tallaght.  There would be a public outcry in Cork, Limerick, Galway or any other conurbation <Col N="791" /> at that non-existent local authority structure and it is up to the Minister to provide a proper structure.</P>
    <P>We had the crowning glory this evening when the Minister for Education came back into the House and reinstated the RTC in Tallaght.  She took it out in 1987, 1988 and again in 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the draft estimates for the public service which the Minister voted through the House and there is a reduction in the third level capital allocation from £16.79 million to £11.4 million, a cut of 32 per cent on the capital allocation for third level education. for 1989.  The Minister is now going to have an RTC built in Tallaght through the Structural Fund even though, as we well know, there is a substantial requirement for additional Exchequer funding for any proposition and it goes into the maw of projects for the greater Dublin area.  It is disgraceful that the Minister should act in such an opportunistic way. The people of Tallaght and of Dublin South and in the general location are entitled to a third level college.  While we welcome the conversion of the Minister there this evening, it is a conversion we will monitor very sharply in the months ahead so that that reinstatement of the Tallaght RTC, which was taken out in 1987, 1988 and removed again in the capital budget for 1989, will gel and stick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to the Minister for the Environment that he is the Minister responsible as of last week for the co-ordination of social infrastructure expenditure in the Cabinet.  It is strange that he came in here &mdash; and he is not known for lacking in opportunities to make major announcements &mdash; and did not make any reference in his speech, 14 typed pages, to the fact that the Minister for Education has apparently instructed the officials in her Department to include the Tallaght RTC project in the submission for the greater Dublin area.  I presume the Minister endorses the decisions of his Cabinet colleague. At this stage nobody is sure who <Col N="792" /> is responsible for what in terms of the infrastructural funds of the Government in their lead up to the programme for March 1989.</P>

      <P>There are more people unemployed in Tallaght than in Galway city.  There are 5,100 people unemployed in Galway and 5,772 unemployed in Tallaght. Our clear-cut demand relates not only to the proposed RTC development but also to the other capital projects &mdash; and the Minister should remember that <Col N="793" /> he has already cut the health capital budget for 1989 from £41 million to £35 million, and I hope the Tallaght hospital is not part of those cuts.  It looks suspiciously like a quota of deferment for that hospital as the capital programme is allocated down the line.  We will insist that the basic industrial infrastructure is also put in place in Tallaght to cope with this crisis of unemployment.  A total of 5,722 people are out of work and in urgent need of employment.</P>
      <P>I conclude by thanking the Government for accepting our motion and the amendment and I thank the other political parties for co-operating generously in this debate.  I also thank the officers and the committee of the Tallaght Welfare Society and the many organisations, who made such trenchant, comprehensive and coherent submissions, bringing the issue before the political parties and having it raised in Dáil Éireann. For that we are grateful.  The local community have reason to be grateful to those organisations for that outstanding contribution to Private Members' Time.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the draft Order applying Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965 to Australia, entitled Extradition Act, 1965 (Part II) (No. 24) Order, 1988.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal together with the three motions on the Order Paper relating to the Extradition Act.  As many of the aspects involved are technical, I will be glad when replying to deal with any problems raised by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the three motions relate to four different international instruments <Col N="794" /> they all concern the same subject matter, namely, extradition.  Similarly, the purpose of each of the three motions is to facilitate extradition under Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, and so enable Ireland to act in accordance with its international obligations.  In the course of my address I will deal with each draft order and the relevant international instrument in turn.</P>
    <P>I turn first to the motion dealing with the European Convention on Extradition. This motion is one of a number of measures which are designed to enable Ireland to comply fully with its international obligations under the European Convention on Extradition, 1957.  The European Convention on Extradition is a multilateral Convention, which was drawn up under the auspices of the Council of Europe and was opened for signature by its member states in Paris in 1957.</P>
    <P>Ireland signed and ratified the convention on 2 May 1966 and it entered into force in respect of Ireland on 31 July 1966.  All of the 21 member states of the Council of Europe are entitled to become parties to the Convention, together with any other state which the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may also invite to become a party.  To date, 16 other member states of the Council of Europe and two non-members &mdash; Israel and Finland &mdash; are parties to the Convention. Deputies should note that Britain is not a party to this Convention.</P>
    <P>I should now like to explain why, having being in operation for over 20 years in this country, this House is now being asked to concern itself with the European Convention on Extradition.  It arises as a consequence of a recent Supreme Court decision in the Gilliland case.  The Attorney General has advised that a charge on public funds within the meaning of Article 29 of the Constitution would arise in every case of the State being requested under the Convention to extradite the person sought.</P>
    <P>No motion approving the terms of the <Col N="795" /> European Convention on Extradition was brought to this House prior to its ratification by Ireland in 1966, as the provision dealing with expenses, Article 24, was not considered at that time to come within the ambit of Article 29 of the Constitution.  Consequently, in the event of a court challenge now, Ireland's ratification in 1966 and subsequent implementing orders might well be declared invalid under domestic law unless we clear up this impression which has arisen as a result of the Gilliland case.  We must make the matter quite clear through ratification by the House and the subsequent making of an order by the House in regard to this Convention.  This was not done in 1966 on the basis that the constitutional provision did not apply.  It was subsequently held in the Gilliland case that it did apply.</P>
    <P>In order to rectify this situation and to allow Ireland to comply with the international obligations it has already covenanted to undertake by its earlier ratification, it was necessary, having got the approval of Dáil Éireann to the terms of the Convention on 29 June 1988, to deposit a new instrument of ratification with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.  This was done on 12 July 1988.  What is now required is to confirm that ratification by a specific order of the House so as to clear up this matter of practice, and implementation of the convention that has operated since 1966.</P>
    <P>I do not propose here to go through the various Articles in the Convention, which are reflected in the Extradition Act.  I would, however, draw the attention of Deputies to the considerable safeguards for the individual contained in the Convention.  Under Article 10, extradition for a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence is not permitted.  In addition, if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that extradition has been requested for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person on account of his race, <Col N="796" /> religion, nationality or political opinion, or that the person's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons, extradition must be refused.  This of course is reflected in the provisions in section 11 of the Extradition Act, 1965, and provides what is considered to be appropriate protection for individuals who might be potential victims in these circumstances.  Traditionally, extradition is refused for military offences, nor will extradition be granted for fiscal offences.</P>
    <P>Consequently, Dáil Éireann is today being asked to approve the draft order before it which implements the act of ratification, the purpose of which is to allow extradition to take place between Ireland and the other 18 contracting parties to the European Convention on Extradition, 1957, as listed in the draft order before the House.  I commend the draft order to the House.</P>
    <P>I now turn to deal with the draft order before the House which concerns the Extradition Treaty between Ireland and Australia.</P>
    <P>This treaty, which was signed in Dublin on 2 September 1985, concerns extradition between Ireland and Austrialia.  It is a bilateral treaty and will come into force once each party has notified the other that they have completed all their necessary domestic requirements.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House today is part of that process of giving the treaty legal effect in this country.  This motion requests Dáil Éireann to approve the terms of a draft Government order applying Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to Australia.</P>
    <P>The object of this treaty is to facilitate and make more effective the co-operation between Ireland and Australia in the suppression of crime.  It sets down very clearly and precisely the circumstances under which extradition may take place, the procedures which must be followed, the documents required and the various other matters to be taken into account.  The treaty provides a detailed, <Col N="797" /> concise and clear procedure for the operation of extradition between Ireland and Australia while also seeking to protect the rights of the individual sought.</P>
    <P>The third resolution before the House this evening deals with the Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, 1970, and the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, 1971.  I propose to deal with both of the motions relating to the Hague and Montreal Hijacking Conventions together since they deal with different aspects of the same topics.</P>
    <P>These conventions were both concluded after lengthy International Conferences on Air Law, which were held at the beginning of the seventies in an attempt to deal with the growing terrorist threat to the safety of aviation.  The occurrence of terrorist acts leading to potential or actual loss of life were seen as a threat to the safety of civil aviation causing great concern throughout the world at that time, and it is still the case. The object of the conferences and the conventions that were negotiated and adopted was to provide an international regime to deal with such unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation no matter where they occur and particularly to provide appropriate international measures for the punishment of offenders.  These conventions are still of great relevance today.</P>
    <P>Ireland acceded to the Hague Convention on 24 November 1975 and to the Montreal Convention on 12 October 1976.  To date there are 137 other States also parties to both conventions.</P>
    <P>The 1973 and 1975 Air Navigation and Transport Acts give effect to these conventions in Irish law.  The offences created in these conventions are therefore offences under Irish law also as part of the international legal regime created by these conventions.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a party of these conventions, must be in a position to comply with the international obligations which <Col N="798" /> they impose.  Consequently, it is necessary to apply Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, to those states, parties to the Hague and Montreal Conventions, with whom we have no other extradition arrangements.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland's accession to these conventions a number of these orders have been made.  The draft order before the House today applies Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, not only to 46 countries which recently became parties to the convention, but the draft in effect consolidates into one order both conventions and all the existing parties to them.</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of these conventions and to enable Ireland to comply fully with its obligations in repect of these additional countries I commend this draft order to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor my party have any problem in accepting the Minister's recommendation to the House to pass these conventions speedily.  By a peculiar throw of the political dice, I had a personal involvement in all four conventions in that I was where the Minister is now when the Gilliland and Trimbole cases arose and I was Minister for Transport when the two hijacking conventions were acceded to.  In regard to the Gilliland and Trimbole cases, I have a more intimate knowledge of those than I would wish to have because they caused quite a few problems at the time.  The other conventions are a very necessary part of the worldwide fight against terrorism.  I thought at the time that it was important that we accede to those conventions and I have no problem with them now that we are bringing the matter up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard today that the Belgian Prime Minister has made a suggestion that there should be a European Extradition Act covering the 12 member states of the European Community.  There should be some measure, either a treaty or an Act, in which we could get common ground among the 12 on extradition.  I do not know how practical that is or whether it <Col N="799" /> is legally, politically or in any other way possible; but if it has the effect of avoiding the unseemly wrangling that took place between the United Kingdom, Belgium and Ireland in the last fortnight then it would be very good.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will consider this matter and see if we can take extradition, which, in my view and that of my party is a very necessary part of the fight against terrorism, off the front pages of newspapers and have it dealt with on a purely legal Europewide basis.  I am quite happy to accept the Minister's recommendation that the House adopt these conventions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the Minister's recommendation that we accept the three motions before us tonight.  I would like to make two points.  Firstly, it is noteworthy and not merely coincidental that we are considering these matters one week after Mrs. Thatcher's imprudent and unhelpful remarks in the House of Commons regarding Ireland's commitment to the due process of law.  The legislative care in regard to these treaties cannot be misplaced by this House because they demonstrate to the world at large, if not to the British, that we as a State have taken all the steps required to ensure proper extradition arrangements between friendly states.</P>
      <P>Although we are considering those treaties that come under Part II of the 1965 Act and not the arrangements with Britain that come under Part III of that Act, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs would do well to point out to his British counterpart that the Dáil has taken the trouble to ensure that whatever loopholes may exist in regard to extradition procedures are being closed and that the law on extradition is being copperfastened tonight.</P>

      <P>In fairness to my colleague, Deputy Kennedy, her point was that the requirements in Part II of the 1965 Act are being vindicated this evening whereas the difficulties have arisen in relation to Part III of that Act.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to say that I share the sentiments that have been expressed so far.  I see in these three instruments that are before us this evening the execution of basic agreements that have been entered into by Ireland.  In one case there is a bilateral agreement with Australia.  What we are really doing is giving effect to the understandable and negotiated co-operation to further goodwill between two countries that look upon each other as having favourable future relationships.  In the other cases it is singular that we are executing instruments to give effect to our signature and ratification of conventions that have been agreed within the ambit of international fora and our obligations within the international community.  I very much agree with what has been said so far and, on behalf of my party, I see absolutely no difficulty with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make two points in terms of the European Convention.  The point has been made that we are extending the 1965 Act to take account of our new obligations.  That is a point well made to those who suggest that we have difficulty in using the 1965 Act.  Deputy Kennedy is absolutely correct in stating that.  It strikes me that, in relation to the legislation of other countries and the process by which countries bring their laws up to date, in an international context the more signatories one has and the more transcendence there is beyond the difficulties of individual countries in a bilateral relationship, the better prospect and the greater ease there is in having amending and enabling legislation and instruments that execute the obligations. It is as if one ascends to a series of principles governing legitimate relationships between states that cannot be contradicted by possibly temporal or indeed <Col N="801" /> historical, inherited antagonistic relationships of a bilateral kind.</P>
    <P>The third instrument with which we are dealing this evening effectively involves our accepting our obligations under The Hague Convention of 1970 and the Montreal Convention of 1971 dealing with hijacking.  It is important that we be absolutely foursquare in terms of our obligations.</P>
    <P>The last point I make more as a reflection, which is that if international fora seem to be places where instruments relating to issues such as extradition can be considered within a more generous framework then very often it is within these wider frameworks that the principles of legitimacy are more easily accepted.  The difficulty precisely at the bilateral level is that questions of the legitimacy of both parties, when one is dealing with a face to face confrontation, frequently create these problems.</P>
    <P>Next Saturday we celebrate the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The worst time for human rights is when they become an object of abuse by one group of nations against another.  There has also been enormous abuse of the terms &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;, &ldquo;anti-terrorism&rdquo;, &ldquo;counter-terrorism&rdquo; and so on.  But what is interesting is that the people who accepted their obligations under treaties of this kind, particularly those signed within the family of nations, knew exactly what it was they were accepting.  I am inclined to the view expressed by previous speakers that it would be a good development if perhaps we could shift what are too closely-locked encounters of an antagonistic and often bilateral nature to a wider arena.  However, I am not advancing that as a demand or anything of that kind on behalf of my party.  I quite agree that any such proposal would have to be taken in the wider context. For example, in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement how many of its components would be moved sideways and what would be the total implications?</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I can <Col N="802" /> say we are pleased to facilitate the Government in the speedy passage of these three instruments here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party readily support the three proposals of the Minister for Foreign Affairs this evening. It is fortunate, in the immediate aftermath of events of the past few days and the debate that took place here last evening, that we are being afforded the opportunity to talk about extradition in the normal atmosphere in which it should be pursued, developed and discussed at all times.  It has been a constant point in any intervention made by The Workers' Party in any of these debates that we must underline the importance of extradition as a normal concept in the everyday administration of justice between states when dealing with fugitives from crime.  Unfortunately, in the hysteria of debates in recent times many commentators have strayed from that understanding and concept.  For that reason it seems that the issue of extradition must be burdened with a huge degree of confusion, emotion and unreality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing better illustrates that than an examination of the number of countries that will be affected by the provisions of these instruments being passed here this evening.  It should be remembered that we are talking about an overall figure approaching 100 in different arenas.  In different legislative measures Ireland has extradition arrangements and agreements with hundreds of countries world-wide. One gains the impression from recent debates that we had an extradition arrangement with one country only.  It is worth asking the question of many of these people who sought to argue so trenchantly against extradition to our nearest neighbour, where there is trial by jury available and where there are many safeguards, what is their position when we quite correctly agree to extradite somebody to the more continental-type inquisitorial systems of justice where the <Col N="803" /> notion of jury trial does not exist at all, where all of the procedures of definition require a person to remain in custody, where it is often suggested that the onus shifts the other way onto the defendant to vindicate himself or herself?  We are having a reasoned debate in this Chamber this evening which should be the atmosphere prevailing if there is to be any balance struck in this debate on extradition with regard to all of our contracting partners, including our nearest neighbour.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted here &mdash; a point the Minister made in his contribution&mdash; that the United Kingdom was not a party to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism of 1957.  That is a remarkable state of affairs.  It should be noted that the mother of all parliaments, the jurisdiction that gave us the politically acceptable defence in its original courts and decisions, is not a party to what Europe has been endeavouring to do with regard to extradition since 1957.  That is something we should not forget.  Indeed, we might well remind those neighbours to enter into the European order of things.</P>
    <P>The necessity for the draft treaty instrument before us this evening in regard to Australia illustrates in a small way the somewhat unsatisfactory or haphazard way in which we have tended to deal with extradition.  It is a worrying feature.  Article 29 is clear in its working. It is inconceivable that it could have been overlooked when our treaty with the United States was being drafted and agreed.  Gilliland in the Supreme Court highlighted that deficiency.  It was overlooked in the haste with which we brought in the treaty initially to deal with Trimbole and Australia.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to consider, in consultation with the Attorney-General and departmental officials, the establishment of a Departmental working group of officials to survey the entirety of our extradition laws and arrangements to ensure there will be no more of these <Col N="804" /> problems lurking there that might surface only at a stage when there is someone sitting in a dock who is being sought abroad.  That is not the way in which we should be arranging our extradition affairs, developing them on errors being exposed in a court of law.  We should put Departmental resources aside to examine such matters in detail.</P>
    <P>In regard to Australia and the agreement with them, my party are concerned that there is not a requirement in the relevant treaty for the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case in these courts.  It is not a light matter to send somebody to the other side of the hemisphere on extradition. Indeed, the more remote is a country geographically from us, all the greater is the onus on us to ensure that any such extradition is not sought on any half-baked or frivolous ground.  While all of these extradition procedures and arrangements are founded on international trust and co-operation nonetheless such onus devolves on the parties to them.  <i>Prima facie</i> evidence is a requirement used in some of our international procedures.  It is something we should have examined in the Australian context.</P>
    <P>The final point I would make in the context of Australia is this.  The usual standard rule of thumb &mdash; certainly it applies in regard to the United Kingdom, the country to which we extradite most people &mdash; is that where an offence carries a minimum prison sentence of six months then we will agree to extradite.  I want to pose the following question to the Minister: is it realistic to consider extraditing people for a term of six months?  For example, in the Australian agreement it is 12 months.  It is my opinion that that is too short a period.  If we are to send people so far afield we should be examining a minimum prison term of two years or thereabouts.  With remission and good behaviour entitlements, the realistic lock-up time even for a 12 months sentence is very short.  Do we achieve anything by sending someone back?  Under <Col N="805" /> the treaty where there is an unexpired period of six months of a sentence remaining, a person is liable to be extradited. Should we not look a bit more closely at that and suggest in future agreements a longer period in terms of a warrant which is unexpired, or a greater sentence, if a sentence is to be imposed?</P>
    <P>The other treaties are very welcome and they help to illustrate that we as a country recognise extradition as a standard form of inter-State relationships in dealing with fugitive crime.  It is obvious that there is a great need for extradition procedures when one looks at crimes involving air strikes.  The effectiveness of extradition as a process to move quickly and efficiently is really the only way available to the democratic process to deal with crime.  Unless extradition works effectively, because of greater mobility nowadays and increased inter-State crime, we are only fooling ourselves if we think that we are doing something to seriously address the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the manner in which this debate has been conducted.  This debate has occurred on the proper level; as has been indicated in the recent exchanges on extradition <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain and Ireland and Belgium, it is all-important that extradition be placed firmly within a legal framework.  The politicisation of extradition and the sensationalism with which it has been treated in the public media particularly in London has lifted the matter out of the correct milieu in which it should be considered. Extradition should be dealt with by way of international treaty or convention and it should be processed through the courts in the countries that agree to a convention or other international agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy McCartan said, the motions before us are designed to bring the offences concerned within the ambit of three documents which are now being approved by this House.  I am glad that <Col N="806" /> Deputy McCartan referred to the fact that Britain is not a party to the part of the extradition law covered in Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.  Part III of that Act relates to the backing of warrants and the execution of warrants between Ireland and Britain.  This Act has codified the law as it was since the formation of the State in regard to arrangements between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with Part II of the Act dealing with our multilateral international obligations both with regard to air traffic offences and the other European countries and other countries such as Finland, Israel and now Australia. All of the extradition arrangements with safeguards, that we have entered into with other countries are governed by Part II of the Extradition Act.  Over 100 countries are involved in these agreements when we talk about offences relating to air traffic.  The various conventions and protocols to which we have subscribed are now incorporated in three documents that relate directly to Part II of the 1965 Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>Our amendment to Part III of the Act in relation to our bilateral agreements with Britain was discussed last night.  The safeguards we discussed enable our Attorney General to be satisfied before a person can be extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to sentences. The minimum with regard to the Australian treaty arrangement is 12 months.  In practice it is only in serious cases requiring a sterner penalty that a State will apply for extradition.  It would not be worth the expense to extradite for that sort of minimal penalty.  Countries only apply in very serious cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and some other Deputy raised a question about what Mr. Martens, the Prime Minister of Belgium, said in regard to the Community countries coming together to devise some form of uniform application for extradition.  This is a matter which, in view of the recent <Col N="807" /> contretemps, merits examination.  We will be examining that aspect because it is evident that, while extradition with all other countries is proceeding smoothly, with the incorporation of these three conventions approved by the Dáil under Part II of the Act, our international position will be clarified and we will do away with any ambiguity or confusion.  As we all know, the problems relate to our bilateral arrangements under Part III of the Act and the safeguards we passed last night will be a very positive contribution towards ensuring that the Attorney General will be assured that there is a case to be met.</P>
    <P>I welcome any suggestion, such as that made by the Belgian Prime Minister, which further clarifies this issue.  I want to reiterate what has been said in this House.  I said extradition was essentially a legal matter concerned with the freedom of the individual, interpretation and administration by the courts.  This is a civilised exchange between nations.  This is part of the world rule of law relating to international order and is fully defensible. There is a lot of wild talk about extradition which ignores the central factor, which is that having extradition arrangements of this kind with other countries is very meaningful because it adds to the <i>corpus</i> of international law designed to ensure a real rule of law between nations.  It would be intolerable if each nation was so hidebound that they could not deal with other nations.  This needs to be said again.  Some of the politicisation and sensationalism, as well as some emotional propaganda, we have seen lately missed the point that extradition arrangements are part of the rule of law between nations and as such are an example of civilised behaviour according to the law between nations.  However, that is separate from our bilateral agreement under Part III of the Act of 1965.  I cannot put it any clearer than that.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that many people do not want to know about these matters.  One <Col N="808" /> could try to explain this a dozen times, but one might not get as receptive an audience as one gets in this House.  We must all say very clearly what the real distinctions are and we should not have any confusion by labelling, smearing and branding what are highly complex international laws, conventions, rules and regulations designed to facilitate exchanges under the court systems of different countries so that no country can be used as an international refuge for criminals, whether involved in drugs, terrorism, murder or anything else.  The international implementation of the rule of law is much to be desired and is welcomed by us.</P>
    <P>A Deputy made a very good point when he said that the discussions on extradition in recent days had been conducted mainly through megaphone diplomacy from London.  Coming after those discussions, this is the sign of a civilised Parliament dealing with civilised international business in a civilised manner.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment transport facilities for children from the Knocknagoshel area of County Kerry to the Nano Nagle Special School in Lixnaw.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter which is very important to the parents, children, teachers and the social workers involved. There are three cases &mdash; Joan from Cloghane, Knocknagoshel, Mary from Meinleitrim, Knocknagoshel and Seán from Killacolleen, Templeglantine, County Limerick.  I will deal with each case individually.</P>
      <P>Joan is a Down's syndrome child and has been recommended to attend the Nano Nagle School for the Handicapped in Lixnaw.  She was to start school in April 1988 but the Department of Education refused to sanction the extension of the bus route to her home.  On 2 November 1988 her father was informed by the Department that an extension of the service to facilitate Joan from her home would involve an extra 17.1 miles per day and a considerable additional daily cost. The Department could not sustain this expenditure given the financial constraints. There is no way the O'Sullivans would be able to take Joan to the nearest pick-up point, which is five miles away. Her father goes to work early in the morning and the mother has no car, and anyway she cannot drive.  The family live in a very isolated rural area.  Joan is almost six years old and still not attending school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All studies and recent reports emphasise how important the early years are for the development of the child.  Joan is missing out badly and this is inhibiting the development of this child.  Her parents are doing their best but nothing can make up for the stimulation Joan would receive in the company of her <Col N="810" /> peers in the school setting.  The parents are most discouraged and saddened that they will have to consider sending Joan into residential care.  Her mother feels she will not be able to keep her at home much longer if the school problem is not sorted out.  Joan is bored and frustrated and her behaviour is becoming a problem and it is obvious her progress is being held back.</P>
    <P>The next case is Mary.  She is a Down's syndrome child and has been recommended to attend the Nano Nagle school for the Handicapped in Lixnaw.  She was to start school last September, but the Department of Education informed her father that an extension of the school transport service to facilitate Mary would invlove a journey of 16.7 miles extra per day at a considerable additional daily cost.  The Department said they could not sanction this expenditure, given the financial restraints imposed on them.  The Nelligan family have no way of taking Mary to the pick-up point, as Mr. Nelligan uses his car to go to work and leaves too early to drop Mary off.  Mary is loved and accepted as part of the family.  It would break their hearts if she were to be placed in residential care, which seems to be the only option that the Department of Education is offering the family.  It would be detrimental to her emotional and intellectual development if this happened. The parents are adamant that they never will allow Mary to go into residential care.  Surely, this child has a right to remain at home with her family and attend the nearest special school? The family find the position in regard to transport most distressing and it is unfair to place this burden on them when they already have to cope with having a handicapped child.  In effect, this child is being denied her right to education.</P>
    <P>The third case is that of Seán, from Killacolleen, Templeglantine, County Limerick.  Seán is moderately mentally handicapped.  He has been recommended to attend the Nano Nagle school for the Handicapped.  He was due to start school <Col N="811" /> in September 1988 but the Department of Education informed his father on 28 October that a re-routing of the service to facilitate Seán would involve a journey of 16.3 miles extra per day at considerable extra daily cost.  The Department said they could not sanction this extra expenditure, given the financial restraints imposed on them.  The parents have no way of providing transport to the nearest pick-up point as the boy's father is working and his mother does not have access to a car.  She cannot drive.  The parents are most distressed.  Above all else, they hope to keep their handicapped child at home so that he will remain part of the family and will benefit from the home environment.  The emphasis in recent years, and I do not have to point this out to the Minister, has been to keep mentally handicapped people in their local community and where possible to keep them at home rather than to institutionalise them.  It seems to be a regression to former times when children like Seán have to opt for residential care due to inadequate transport facilities. This is the only option being given to these families of handicapped children.</P>
    <P>It is well known and agreed by all experts in child psychology that there is nothing more beneficial for the fullest emotional and intellectual development of the child than to be part of a loving and caring family, yet this is being denied to these children.</P>
    <P>I have examined the costs involved.  In fact, I believe the State will save money if they provide transport for the children. The cost of putting the children into institutional care is more than double the cost of providing school transport.  There would not only be a net gain for the taxpayer.  It would also be of social and emotional benefit for the children and their parents.  Surely this is sufficient justification to provide the children with a transport service?</P>
    <P>The Nano Nagle school for the Handicapped will be transferred from Lixnaw to <Col N="812" /> Listowel at the end of 1989.  The Minister would have received deputations already from the school about this.  The children will then be within the 15 mile radius and will be entitled automatically to transport to the new location.  Therefore, we are really speaking about the cost of transport for the remainder of the school year and for a short period of the next term. However, by then the children will have lost out considerably, both academically and socially and their whole developmental progress will be further retarded.  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the children and their parents, teachers and social workers to reconsider the Department's decision in view of the evidence I have put before him tonight.</P>
    <P>We all realise the financial constraints imposed on the Department.  However, it would be very wrong for a nation, and indeed it would be wrong for the politicians, to discriminate against the most vulnerable sector of our society, the handicapped.  I am sure that neither the Minister of State nor the Minister would like to be called insensitive.  As we are now approaching the season of goodwill I appeal to the Minister of State's better judgement to provide these children with the necessary transport.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the various studies on handicapped children and adults would indicate that people should stay within their own communities where they are happiest.  They feel more secure and the parents are happier when their handicapped children are under their observation. The children can form attachments to their parents and overall it is a far better arrangement.  I wish to emphasise again that I have looked at the costs closely and I have found that there would be a substantial saving for the taxpayer if the transport service could be provided.  Might I remind the Minister that these children will be entitled to transport in nine months time so why should we hold back their progress and <Col N="813" /> disturb their families for the sake of providing a paltry sum to provide transport facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan has made a very reasonable case and I would concur with his concern for children with special handicaps.  I hope that neither the Minister, nor I nor indeed any official would ever be insensitive to the needs of such children.</P>
      <P>My Department are aware of the three families from the Knocknagoshel area each with a child suitable for enrolment in the Nano Nagle school in Lixnaw. There is in fact a special transport service, as the Deputy has pointed out, which is paid for by my Department operating in the area from points south of Abbeyfeale, and then by way of Abbeyfeale and Listowel to Lixnaw.  The daily mileage of this service is well in excess of 100 miles. The three children in question live in the general area, but off the route.  The nearest child to the school lives 18½ miles from the school and five miles from the route.  The next nearest child lives at a point 25 miles from the school and over four miles from the nearest route.  The third lives 28 miles from the school and nearly 5½ miles from the route.  In each case diversions or extension to the routes could involve an additional 16 to 17 miles a day and add considerably to the cost, but more importantly add considerably to the time the route takes.  The first pick-up time as a result of any one of these diversions would be about 7.30 a.m. with a corresponding later drop-off in the evening. In fact the earliest pick-up time would be approximately 7 a.m. if all children were picked up.  I am not in a position to indicate exactly the effect on the timetable if all three extensions were sanctioned, but I understand that it may be necessary to start the route prior to 7 a.m. in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should make some general remarks about the transport provided to pupils of special schools.  The cost of <Col N="814" /> transporting handicapped pupils is high &mdash; approximately £6 million per annum for about 9,000 pupils when compared with £35 million for all classes of school transport.  This works out at between £3 and £4 a day to transport each handicapped child.  It is of course, only right that special efforts should be made for such children.  I take the point and agree with Deputy Deenihan that every effort should be made to ensure that the children can as far as possible live at home. Indeed, that effort has been made very successfully by the Department in recent years.  However, at the best of times there has been a financial limit on the amount of money that could be spent on transporting handicapped children to school and the Department have no sanction to exceed that limit.  The limit is generous but in general would not suffice to allow daily transport for pupils more than 15 miles' distance from the school unless there were unusually large numbers of such pupils presenting for transport and sharing the cost of the special service between them.</P>
    <P>In the nature of things it is unusual to find large numbers of handicapped children in a limited area.  They tend rather to be scattered in ones and twos over a very wide area.  This example points to the kind of difficulty the Department have to contend with where people live miles apart and miles away from the route.  It is very difficult to go around and pick up everybody.  One of our problems is that, while we would like as far as possible to pick up people from their homes, if you were to apply the criteria proposed by Deputy Deenihan across the board that would add very considerably to the overall mileage to which we would have to extend all the routes at present. We have associations involved with the handicapped asking us all the time to extend routes, to provide new routes and so on and in the Department we are doing our best to try to meet the needs of those people; but obviously there is a limit to what one can do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> However, I take the points the Deputy has made this evening and I am prepared to look again at this case.  The question of providing a grant to the parents involved in order to help them with the cost of getting to the pick-up points can be addressed and we will see if we can do anything in that respect; but the time factor is still a problem.  An extra 16 or 17 miles a day in three different directions would undoubtedly mean a very long time from when the children would leave home in the morning until they would get back in the afternoon.</P>
    <P>I assure the House, and Deputy Deenihan particularly, that we will have another look at this case and see what improvements, if any, we can bring about.  My hope would be to try to provide the best service possible taking into account all the constraints upon us. Indeed, we want to do our best for all mentally and physically handicapped children, especially in the line of transport, because we know hardships are being caused.  Indeed, hardships are <Col N="816" /> being caused in the city of Dublin.  In many areas of the city bus services are not adequate and people want a service for a deaf child or whatever where the child can be picked up, put on a bus and left off at the school.  I would appreciate the Deputy's patience in understanding that is very difficult to do.  It is much easier to pick up 40 kids in one area and bring them to school.  It is very difficult when you are trying to pick up ten kids in ten different areas from both the time and cost factors because often it means more than one bus if there is a route that is too long.  We are conscious of the difficulty.  Certainly we would not wish to be insensitive, and I will take this case and examine it carefully with a view to improving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 35, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>At 22 September, 1988, the seven companies which had received certificates under section 39B of the Finance Act, 1980 (inserted by section 30 of the Finance Act, 1987) were:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Gandon Securities Ltd,</P>
      <P>&mdash;KB Financial Services (Ireland) Ltd,</P>
      <P>&mdash;North Wall Street Investments,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Reflex International Financial Services Ltd,</P>
      <P>&mdash;IBI International Finance Ltd,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Ulster International Finance Ltd, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;Cambridge International Finance Ltd.</P>
      <P>Since then a further four companies have received certificates under the relevant legislation.  They are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Ericsson Treasury Ireland Ltd,</P>
      <P>&mdash;ABN Financial Services Company,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Allied Irish International Financial Services Ltd, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;Capital International Financial Services Ltd.</P>
      <P>A further 30 projects have been approved in principle to date and they are in the process of being certified.  It would not be appropriate for me to give the names of these companies until they are actually certified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards job numbers, while it would not be appropriate for me to give details <Col N="664" /> of the conditions imposed on individual companies, including the employment condition, I can tell the Deputy that the 11 companies certified to date have undertaken to create a total of 224 jobs. The other 30 projects which have been approved in principle involve 830 jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to location, all the companies certified to date are at present located elsewhere in Dublin pending the availability of accommodation in the Custom House Docks Area.  It is written as a condition into each of the certificates given that the companies must move to the Custom House Docks Area as soon as premises become available there which, in the opinion of the Minister for Finance, are suitable for the carrying on of the trading operations certified.</P>
    <P>As regards the period for which the tax benefits are available to companies in the Custom House Docks Area in respect of their operations, the main tax relief that is available to certified companies is the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and that relief remains in force until 31 December 2000.  The other relevant tax benefits which are available to such companies locating in the Custom House Docks Area are (i) 100 per cent first-year capital allowances for commercial buildings, (ii) a double rent allowance for commercial premises as a deduction in computing trading income for ten years in respect of a qualifying lease granted in a specified period, and (iii) a ten-year remission of rates in respect of certain premises which are erected, enlarged or improved in the Custom House Docks Area within a specified period.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of projects which are funded only by Irish capital, I do not have the information available to me to answer that part of the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>He requested a review of his means on 22 November 1988 and his papers have been returned to the social welfare officer for reinvestigation.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of claimants in receipt of reduced unemployment benefit arising from the requirement of an average of 40 paid contributions for each of the previous seven years; the reason these claimants are paid at the equivalent of short term unemployment assistance instead of long term unemployment assistance; and if he will arrange for such claimants to opt for means tested unemployment assistance where this could be financially beneficial to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit is made for a maximum duration of 15 months.  The rate of benefit payable after six months is reduced where the claimant has less than 280 paid contributions in the seven years prior to the first date of claim.  The reduced rate of benefit payable in such cases for the last nine months of the claim is equivalent to the maximum short-term rate of unemployment assistance payable to persons living in urban areas who have been unemployed for less than 15 months.  It is estimated that of the 71,000 current recipients of unemployment benefit, some 16,000 claimants are in receipt of the special rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reduced rate of benefit is equivalent <Col N="671" /> to the highest rate of unemployment assistance payable to any claimant with the exception of the long-term rate of assistance which is payable to persons who have been unemployed for over 15 months.  This higher rate was introduced some years ago to cater for the special needs of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Section 142 (1) (d) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, precludes a person from applying for unemployment assistance while entitled to or in receipt of unemployment benefit. There are no proposals to amend this provision.  When claimants' entitlement to unemployment benefit expires after the maximum duration of 15 months and they qualify for unemployment assistance, they are entitled to the long-term rate in common with other claimants who have been unemployed for at least the same length of time.</P>
    <P>The gap between the full rate and the special rate unemployment benefit was reduced arising from the 11 per cent increase in the rates of unemployment assistance in the context of the 1988 Budget, effective from last July.  Any further changes would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The income to be reckoned for higher education grant purposes in the case of self-employed persons is the profits from business or farming activities (including lettings of land, equipment etc.) after deducting expenses incurred in earning these profits, such as rent, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchases of seeds, fertilisers, business interest and stock relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When reckoning expenses which may be taken into account as expenses incurred in earning profits no amount should be included in respect of depreciation (including capital allowances such as on plant or equipment), expenditure on the construction of fences, roadways, holding yards, drains <Col N="680" /> or land reclamation, expenditure on construction of farmhouses, farm buildings or business premises.</P>
    <P>The amount included for business interest may not be allowable in total as a deduction.  Local authorities may therefore require applicants to distinguish between interest payable on loans in respect of items which may be taken into account as deductible expenses and items which are not so allowable. Local authorities are not obliged to accept assessments by the Revenue Commissioners as the sole criterion for determining eligibility for higher education grants.</P>
    <P>It is possible to have different criteria when assessing for the purpose of income tax on the one hand and when assessing for the purpose of allocating scarce Exchequer resources for the purposes of providing higher education on the other. Tax documentation may not on occasions be suitable for use in determining eligibility for services.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the teacher allocations to the Vocational Education Committees in each county; the counties in which supernumerary teachers became permanent full-time teachers; and the reason they were retained.</P>

      <P>It would not be in accordance with normal practice to supply the information sought about the teacher allocation in respect of individual vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The designation &ldquo;supernumerary teachers&rdquo; is normally used in the case of VEC teachers to denote existing permanent whole-time teachers who cannot be accommodated within the teacher allocation authorised by my Department to a VEC for a particular school year. Supernumerary teachers as defined are therefore already permanent whole-time teachers.</P>
