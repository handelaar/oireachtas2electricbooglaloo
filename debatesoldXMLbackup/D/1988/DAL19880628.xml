      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if the debt of £116,657.97 owed to his Department by Connaught Airport Development Company Limited in June 1987 has now been paid; if not, the amount outstanding; if any further debts have been incurred to his Department or any body or company under his aegis; if so, the amount; and what this amount was in respect of.</P>

      <P>The amount, inclusive of interest accruing on arrears, due by Connaught Regional Airport to my Department on 30 June 1987 was £109,357.59. The Deputy mentioned £116,657.97 in his question.  My Department have continued to provide an air traffic control service at the airport since that time and the amount outstanding at 31 May 1988 was £232,766.95.</P>
      <P>The airport company have now come to an arrangement with my Department to discharge the outstanding debt.  There are no other debts due by the airport company to my Department, nor to any bodies or companies under the aegis therefor.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the measures which are being taken in response to the refusal of the Italian authorities to allow Aer Lingus to operate a service to Milan via Manchester; if any direct representations have been made to the Italian Government on their refusal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1856" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of EC Council Decision 87/602/EC on capacity sharing and market access, adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1987, I granted approval to Aer Lingus earlier this year for the operation of scheduled air services on the route Dublin-Manchester-Milan, with fifth freedom rights on the Manchester-Milan service.  The Italian authorities, while permitting Aer Lingus to operate the Dublin-Manchester-Milan service on a combination of points basis, have refused to allow them to carry any fifth freedom traffic between Manchester and Milan.</P>
      <P>The Italian authorities hold that since Milan Airport is exempt, on the grounds that it has insufficient facilities, from the application of Article 6.1 of the Council decision, which permits the introduction of third/fourth freedom scheduled services between hub and regional airports in member states, it is also exempt from the provisions of Article 8 which permits, subject to certain conditions, the operation of fifth freedom services where third/fourth freedom traffic rights exist.  I do not accept the Italian interpretation of the Council decision.  I have made strong representations to my Italian counterpart in this matter and it has been the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and officials of the Italian Ministry of Transport.  In addition, it has been taken up with the EC Commission both by my Department and Aer Lingus.  I have also personally discussed the matter with Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, EC Commissioner for Transport.</P>
      <P>The EC Commission, I am glad to say, regards the Italian argument as invalid and has decided to open infraction proceedings against Italy for its refusal to grant fifth freedom rights to Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Had the Minister the agreement of the Italian authorities when he licensed Aer Lingus for this route?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I licensed Aer Lingus for <Col N="1857" /> the route on the basis of the air package of 14 December 1987, and was fully within my rights in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Included in the proceedings against Italy will there be proceedings for compensation for revenue lost while this matter is being decided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to compensation for revenue lost, I could not answer straight away.  What we are concentrating on is clearing the way for the exercise of fifth freedom rights at Manchester. A rather sinister aspect of the matter is that Alitalia, the Italian airline, have started a Manchester-Milan service in the meantime.  This adds a particular edge to our efforts with the Italians at ministerial and official levels and to our representations to the Commission, which is fully behind us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. P. McCartan Mr. P. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm what appears to be obvious that the service is not operating at present and that there are no flights along this route? Has the Minister contemplated seeking the aid of the Manchester authority and the British Government to reciprocate on the issue so that Alitalia are not allowed to steal a march on Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that there is no service.  As I indicated in my answer, there is a service from Dublin through Manchester to Milan on a combination of points basis, but not with fifth freedom rights at Manchester.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the second part of my question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can take it for granted that of the 12 signatories to the 14 December agreement, 11 of them will be fully in support of the Irish Government and Aer Lingus in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What exactly is happening to the five scheduled flights every week from Dublin to Milan through Manchester and back?  Are these flights actually operating with the difference only <Col N="1858" /> that they may not carry passengers between Manchester and Milan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be specific on the number of flights but the service Dublin-Manchester-Milan is continuing on the combination of points basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>But with the difference that Aer Lingus are not allowed to pick up passengers in Milan and take them to Manchester?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and they cannot pick them up in Manchester and take them to Milan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the only difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there are other differences. We can travel from Dublin to Manchester and drop passengers there but not take them up.  We then go on to Milan and drop passengers there.  We can take up passengers from Milan for Dublin but not for Manchester.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we should seek compensation for revenue lost?  If we do not, the Italians will have gained the time we are waiting for a decision from the court? Would he not make it clear to the Italian authorities that we will be seeking compensation in the European Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We know what the Commission's view is and we know there are three steps to be followed by the Commission. Consequent on that the question of compensation for loss would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put it to the Minister, very much in support of what Deputy Mitchell said, that it is important in a general way to let your adversary know from the word go what you will ultimately be seeking so that he will know he will be facing a claim for revenue the Irish line has been losing, and will continue to lose, until this matter is settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear <Col N="1859" /> that from the beginning of the impasse negotiations were going on and at official level we were convinced the problem would be resolved.  Finally, we got word from the Minister that it was not being resolved.  At that time, there was not much point in going at it like a bull at a gate but now the chips are down, the full strength of the Commission is being brought to bear on the Italian authorities, and the House can be assured that we will not be remiss in pursuing the Italian Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister rule out the possibility of banning Alitalia from coming to Ireland until this matter is resolved, or would he consider that a regressive step?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered it as of now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my reply to a Parliamentary Question on 20 April 1988, I referred to a proposal before me by Aer Lingus to acquire two new Boeing 737-400 aircraft.  Following consideration of the proposal by the Aer Lingus Review Group, which supported the approval of the proposal, the Government, on 8 June 1988, approved the acquisition of the two aircraft, on the understanding that there would be no recourse to the Exchequer for the financing of the aircraft.  The aircraft are being acquired at a cost of US$71.2 million for delivery in July and October 1989 to cater for the anticipated growth in traffic, particularly tourist traffic, on the Dublin-London routes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will outline the Government's policy on the provision of an efficient and economic public transport system in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy on the provision of public transport in the Dublin area is based on the Transport Acts which deal with CIE and the Road Transport Act, 1932, which regulates the licensing of bus services.  As a consequence rail services are provided by Iarnród Éireann and bus services are almost completely provided by Bus Átha Cliath in the area. Exchequer financial support, as necessary, will continue to be provided for these companies, in line with available resources, with the objective of keeping fares as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1987 the Government instructed CIE to prepare transport investment plans for the Dublin area <Col N="1862" /> involving bus-based options or diesel services on existing rail lines.  I understand that the board will be in a position to forward their plans to me shortly for consideration.</P>
    <P>Existing services, adapted as necessary, decisions reached on the basis of the CIE plans and any changes which may result from the planned new road passenger transport legislation following the review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, will be the basis for meeting public transport needs in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Dublin Transportation Task Force in improving traffic managment and introducing further measures in that regard will facilitate the greater use of public transport.</P>

      <P>Since the general directive of October 1987 to suspend consideration of the DART, has the Minister issued any other directives to Dublin Bus or Iarnród Éireann with regard to transport services in the city?

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 13.</P>
      <P>As I indicated during the course of the debate on the B &amp; I Line Bill, 1988 in March last, the Government, on 11 December 1987, having noted the B &amp; I's plan of action and its across-the-board support by the company's workforce, agreed, on the basis of the plan, to provide the B &amp; I with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.  The Government also decided to review the position of the B &amp; I not later than the autumn of 1988 on the basis of detailed comparisons of the company's performance against forecast.</P>
      <P>The plan of action forecasts an operating loss of £1.7 million for 1988 and a net loss, after financial charges, of £6.2 million.  I am pleased to say that, in the context of the recent B &amp; I annual general meeting, the B &amp; I chairman indicated that for the four months to end April, 1988 the company's financial performance was £800,000 better than forecast. It is too early to say whether this trend will be maintained throughout the rest of the year.  I can inform the House, however, that I have exhorted the board of the B &amp; I to make every effort to improve, if at all possible, on this level of performance.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he has had any policy discussions with the board of CIE regarding the level of bus fares on Dublin city routes; if he has any plans for a reduction in the present fare levels; if he has made any decision regarding the use of private bus operators on any of these routes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 10 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Increases in bus fare levels by Bus Átha Cliath are subject to approval by the Government and in that context discussions are held with the company as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last bus fares increase was implemented by the company on 24 January 1988.  The increases granted were lower than those sought.  Bus Átha Cliath provide a large range of prepaid commuter tickets and special fares at discounts which reduce the costs for passengers.  It is policy to promote the <Col N="1866" /> wider and increased use of public transport and to keep fares at the lowest possible levels, taking account of the costs of providing the services and the financial resources of Coras Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals under consideration in my Department for reductions in bus fares.  No doubt, the company would make such a proposal if the likely consequences for their finances were favourable.</P>
    <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, regulates the licensing of bus services generally, including those of the Dublin area.  In the course of the recently completed review of that Act, I have taken account of the question of a greater role for the private bus industry in the provision of bus services.  I am now finalising my proposals for consideration by the Government and I plan to introduce amending legislation later this year.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of the new legislation, I shall continue to consider applications for road passenger licences on their merits in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is part of the question.  Why does the Minister not come in properly briefed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a proper brief and I thought I gave a fairly full answer.  As the Deputy knows, the basic Act is the 1932 Act.  Any applications that are made will be decided upon in the light of that Act.  We regard that Act as antiquated now.  We have done a full survey of the Act and legislation is pending.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1867" /> not agree that he exudes an air of complacency about the bus fares in Dublin which are barely affordable by middle class people, never mind working class people in the outer suburbs.  Would the Minister give an assurance to those hard pressed people that he intends to do something about this?  Would he not agree that as part of his plans for the one person operation of buses, fares were to be reduced by 20 per cent in real terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question, the one-person bus operation has not been put in place fully.  Two of the unions have accepted, the union with the vast majority of the workers and another smaller union.  One union has still not acceded to the company's request. Second, I reject the idea that I am complacent about fares.  As an indication of that lack of complacency on the part of myself and the Government, we refused to give the level of increased fares asked for by CIE on the most recent occasion and it was particularly with an eye to the hardship of the people who are using the bus services continually that we did just that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the fare increase was in excess of the rate of inflation now running at 1.8 per cent and that every year now CIE seem to congratulate themselves on having their fare increases at less than they applied for but greater than the rate of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if he will grant a licence to Suirway Bus and Coach Service, Knockroe, Passage East, County Waterford to operate a service from Dunmore East-Tramore-Waterford directly to Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11(3) of the Road Transport Act, 1932, governs the consideration of applications for road passenger licences.  The section requires me to have regard to whether the service in question is required in the public interest, having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.  The application in question was given detailed and sympathetic consideration but, due to the level of services on or near the proposed route, it was not possible to grant a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the applicant was informed that I am prepared to consider extending existing licences held by him on the Passage East-Waterford and Dunmore East-Waterford routes to allow for the provision by him of feeder services to-from Waterford city on Sunday and weekday <Col N="1872" /> evenings.  These feeder services would connect with existing CIE bus and train services to and from Dublin.  No response has been made by the applicant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this but this company were probably set up before the date of the enactment of the Act he mentioned, 1932, and they provide a very satisfactory local service.  They now want to provide a service to Dublin but the Minister has not sanctioned this.  Surely, this is going against the Minister's stated policy of some months ago when he said he would allow competition between State services and privately owned services?  Surely, the Minister should allow an established company such as this one to operate a service from an area which at present has no direct service to Dublin?</P>

      <P>In response to the Deputy's supplementary question, let me reiterate for the fourth or fifth time that my hands are tied by the provisions of the 1932 Road Transport Act.  According to that Act I have to have regard &ldquo;to whether the service in respect of which such application is made is required in the public interest having regard to the passenger road services and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the routes of the proposed service.&rdquo;  I cannot contravene that Act, I cannot break the law.  I have already told the Deputy that we have completed a study and will be bringing legislation before the House.  In regard to the company named by the Deputy, from the information which I have, let me say that what he has said is correct.  It is an efficient company and has been providing a good local service over the years.</P>

      <P>The Government, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, have set targets for the tourism sector over the next five years and the broad thrust of policy to achieve these.  A special provision of £4 million was provided in this year's budget to boost tourism numbers and revenue in 1988.  A special task force was set up to advise on how this money should be spent.  Its recommendations have been accepted and implemented.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the increase in foreign revenue from tourism in 1988 arising from these and other initiatives taken by this Government, allied with Bord Fáilte's drive to get more people to holiday at home, will lead to an improvement in our tourism and travel balance for 1988.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that all people who come to this country enrich the country.  I do not care whether they are ethnic or non-ethnic.  It is a false exercise to compare the figures for 1984, 1985 and 1986 when absolutely different conditions prevailed, particularly with regard to the North American market, as the Ministers in the previous Government will assure the Deputy.  The weakening dollar helped considerably our tourist earnings from the United States. When a punt equalled a dollar, naturally people were getting exceptionally good value.  It is now about $1.50 to the punt and people have to consider that when they are budgeting for a holiday here. All those factors have to be taken into consideration and we should compare like with like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that access transport costs are a key factor in improving tourism and he has already recognised what has been done in that area during the past four or five years.  Can he tell the House what further plans he has to build on the progress of the past four or five years, in <Col N="1880" /> relation to reducing access prices and increasing the number of access routes to this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes I will give him a very substantial list of new fares, new routes, a new charter agreement which has been introduced allowing a certain mix with the charter people of ordinary passengers on a west to east basis so far as the United States is concerned; and the new agreement signed with Lord Brabazon of Tara during the year, which is a headline in liberalisation for the rest of Europe and which the Europeans are being told about.  All of these factors have tended to bring down access fares.  I realise what the Deputy did in this regard when he was Minister and I think I have built a very effective superstructure on that.</P>

      <P>In addition to financing the full acquisition of the Berkshire Place Hotel, Aer Lingus intend using the funds from the disposal of the Omni Hotel chain to finance its programme for the development of its hotel and leisure interests in other markets.  This programme includes the recent purchase by the company of the Copthorne chain of hotels in the UK, continental Europe and Africa.  It also includes significant investment in upgrading the Brussels and Glasgow hotels which were part of this chain.  Further investment is also envisaged in the company's London Tara Hotel.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my response to a broadly similar question by the <Col N="1885" /> Deputy on 24 May 1988, studies have concluded that Irish hauliers operate under a certain cost disadvantage particularly in relation to United KingdomNorthern Ireland, but the extent of that disadvantage cannot be accurately quantified at present since these studies did not appear to compare like with like.</P>
      <P>My Department recently asked the haulage industry to provide data on their members' costs on which a more precise comparison can be based.  This information is still awaited.  If the Deputy wishes to repeat the question later this year I will be glad to supply him with what information I have at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The points made by the Deputy are valid ones.  The fuel costs of our operators are substantially greater. However, what is not generally known is that road tax on a 38 tonne, five axle, vehicle in the south of Ireland amounts to £1,041 whereas in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland the corresponding tax amounts to £3,000, a substantial difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept what the Deputy says with regard to fuel and other costs, and that they place us at a disadvantage &mdash; particularly ones involving excise duties &mdash; there is at least that small balancing amount.  It does not make up for the difference or place them in an equal green field, so to speak, but in the context of the completion of the totally free internal market in 1992, the Government are and will be addressing those problems further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the implications resulting from the completion of the internal market of the EC in 1992 for Aer Lingus and other Irish carriers on air services to and from Ireland particularly on major routes such as Dublin-London and Cork-London; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The completion of the internal market in air transport, which is to become effective from 1 January 1993, will provide major opportunities, as well as challenges, for Irish airlines.  The process is being accomplished in three phases, the first of which was the package of air transport liberalisation measures adopted in December 1987 and which became effective on 1 January 1988.  The second phase is to be introduced by 30 June 1990 with the third and final phase being implemented on 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage there are no proposals before the Council from the Commission for the next phase in liberalisation.  There are, however, a number of aspects of the current regime which I would like to see <Col N="1887" /> further liberalised in the next phase. Specifically, I shall be pressing for a less restrictive fares regime, a more open capacity regime, and increased opportunities for market access, including an increase in the 30 per cent limit on the number of seats available for fifth freedom traffic.  Progressive liberalisation of air transport within the Community will provide opportunities for Irish airlines to compete within a Community-wide market.  Irish carriers have been to the forefront in taking up the new opportunities presented in the first phase package. This has already been illustrated by the inauguration by Aer Lingus of new third-fourth and fifth freedom services and new third-fourth freedom services by Ryanair.</P>
    <P>In relation to the increased competition which will be faced by Irish airlines, as the completion of the internal market progresses I am confident that based on results to date our airlines have the will and the ability to meet competition from foreign airlines and to expand successfully into the wider European market.</P>
    <P>Irish Government policy has consistently supported the liberalisation of air transport within the Community. Recent experience has shown the benefits of healthy competition in the domestic and Ireland-UK markets.  In pursuing such a policy, the major objective of the Government is to secure a wider market base in order to provide scope for the further successful growth in the Irish air transport industry in line with Government targets for growth in tourism numbers.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the revised Ireland-UK bilteral air services agreement signed in Dublin on 11 March 1988, went a good deal further in terms of liberalisation than the December 1987 EC package &mdash; to which I referred earlier &mdash; in that it provides for an open route schedule, with multiple designation on the major routes, a double disapproval fares regime and an open capacity regime.  In so far as the Dublin-London and Cork-London routes are concerned, <Col N="1888" /> a substantial degree of liberalisation in a bilteral context has effectively taken place.  This is reflected in the increase of 73 per cent in traffic on the Dublin-London routes over the past two years and of 61 per cent on the Cork-London route during the same period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his full reply.  Can the Minister confirm the concern voiced in a report to this House on the half-yearly activities of the Community, that in view of the greater liberalisation that will be effective after 1992, apparently other carriers will be allowed to operate on the Dublin-London and Cork-London routes? Because traditionally these routes have been confined to British and Irish carriers, would he agree that if other carriers are allowed to operate on them it will present Aer Lingus with a difficulty in that these have always been strong money-making routes for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that they are the strong economic routes as far as Aer Lingus are concerned.  It is also true &mdash; as he has said &mdash; that other airlines will have freedom of the air as far as the establishment of routes are concerned.  The growth of British Airways who are already on the route since they purchased Caledonia means that a giant is operating on the route.  However, I have no reason to be pessimistic because Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Club Air will be able to cope with the competition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to report that <Col N="1889" /> at the meeting of the EC Council of Transport Ministers in Luxembourg on 20-21 June 1988, the Council agreed to major increases in the Community quota of authorisations for multilateral haulage. Ireland's 1988 allocation will increase from 420 to 671 with effect from 1 July and the 1989 allocation will be 940. I should point out that the Council took into account the particular difficulties for Irish hauliers because of our geographical location.</P>
      <P>These increases compare very favourably with the position obtaining in 1984, when we had 88 and in the latter part of 1987, when we had 341 authorisations. This meant that we were unable to meet the needs of Irish hauliers.  As a result of last week's decision, we should be able to meet in full the needs of Irish hauliers who wish to undertake haulage between EC member states.  I hope they will fully exploit the opportunities now being made available to them.</P>
      <P>The Council also confirmed that all quantitative restrictions on international road haulage will be abolished by 1 January 1993.  This represents a major step forward in the liberalisation of the European road freight industry, enabling it to prepare for the challenges and opportunities that will arise from the creation of the single European market.</P>
      <P>As a priority at Council level, I have always strongly supported the principle of liberalisation of international road haulage and, accordingly, I favour the removal of quantitative restrictions on international road haulage between member states, subject to qualitative controls directed mainly towards technical and professional competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liberalisation of the road haulage sector will also mean the introduction of cabotage operations, which involve the opening up of the domestic road haulage market to transport by hauliers of other member states.  While the Commission has submitted cabotage proposals to the Council of Transport Ministers, the debate has been protracted because some member states have serious reservations about its introduction.  My position at Council level has been that liberalisation <Col N="1890" /> of international haulage should precede the opening up of internal national haulage to non-resident hauliers.</P>
    <P>A third element of last week's Council decision provides for a review of the situation of the haulage industry in 1990 and decisions at that time on the measures to be taken in the event of a crisis.  Issues in this regard which might constitute problems for some member states relate particularly to the harmonisation of conditions of competition.</P>
    <P>Various common rules applicable to international haulage have already been adopted by the Transport Council in such areas as vehicle weights and dimensions and the social regulations.  Further proposals in these areas are currently being debated, as are proposals relating to access to the profession of road haulage operator.  Fiscal matters being discussed include harmonising excise duty on diesel, increasing the amount of diesel imported duty-free in fuel tanks, requiring road tax for heavy goods vehicles to be calculated according to laden weight, and proposals for harmonising road tax rates.  The EC fiscal harmonisation proposals are complex and have major economic and revenue implications for Ireland.  The proposed harmonisation of specific transport taxes must be considered in the context of the overall fiscal harmonisation proposals which is, of course, primarily a matter for the ECO/FIN Council.</P>
    <P>In so far as the liberalisation of road passenger transport is concerned, there are currently two proposals under consideration by transport Ministers.  These proposals provide for the further opening up of international passenger markets within the Community and for the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road passenger transport services within a member state. At Council level, these proposals have not reached a sufficiently advanced stage of consideration to allow their adoption. A considerable amount of work and discussion is still required to overcome many of the fundamental difficulties of member states.</P>

As part of the liberalisation programme now agreed, will it be possible for our hauliers to take up goods in a second country and to bring them to a third country?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Special Restaurant Licence (Standards) Regulations, 1988.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft was laid before the House on the 23rd day of June, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently enacted Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, allows restaurants which comply with prescribed standards to apply for the first time through the courts for a special restaurant licence.  This licence will enable such restaurants to supply a full range of intoxicating liquor <Col N="1998" /> to their patrons but only in connection with the consumption of a substantial meal.</P>
    <P>I am already on record on numerous occasions welcoming the licensing of restaurants which I see as a most positive development from the tourism viewpoint. I am also in agreement, however, with the principle underlying this Act, that the extension of licensing to the restaurant sector should be handled carefully and in a responsible manner.  A Bord Fáilte certificate certifying that the restaurant complies with standards prescribed in regulations made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport under section 12 of the Act will be a prerequisite for the grant of a special licence.  Accordingly I now place before the House for approval, in accordance with section 24 of the Act, a draft of the regulations which I propose to make in relation to standards for restaurants for the purposes of a special restaurant licence.</P>
    <P>Before we embark on a discussion on the Regulations I should like to point to a number of important provisions already written into the enabling legislation strictly controlling the sale and supply of liquor in restaurants.  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, a restaurant in receipt of a special restaurant licence cannot, for example, contain a bar.  Furthermore, drinks can only be ordered at the same time as a substantial meal is being ordered.  If a restaurant should have a waiting area, such area cannot exceed 20 per cent of the size of the floor area of the dining area.  The Act also gives Bord Fáilte clear powers in section 23 to revoke a restaurant's certificate if standards are not being complied with. The draft restaurant regulations now before the House are designed to ensure that only genuine, good quality restaurants can even be considered for a licence in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The House will see that the regulations are comprehensive and detail standards covering all aspects of a restaurant's operation.  They are set out very clearly <Col N="1999" /> and are largely self-explanatory.  In summary, they include requirements covering such aspects of a restaurant and its operation as: the physical structure and layout of the restaurant; furnishings and fittings in relation to waiting, dining, kitchen and service areas, cloakrooms and toilets; menus, catering, hygiene, management and staffing.</P>
    <P>The whole objective of the regulations is to ensure that the special restaurant licences will be available only to restaurants of good standard whose primary business is the serving of full meals to the public.  The supply of intoxicating liquor will be merely ancillary to their catering business.  This point has already been made most forcefully by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, during the Dáil debate on the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The regulations will be implemented by Bord Fáilte who will be the inspecting authority.  Bord Fáilte are the body statutorily charged with the registration and grading of hotels, guesthouses and other forms of tourist accommodation.  Monitoring of standards and inspection of these establishments have, of necessity, involved the board for many years in restaurant and catering standards.  The board have also introduced a voluntary inspection of restaurants for the purposes of inclusion in their annual &ldquo;Dining in Ireland&rdquo; publication.  The resultant level of expertise which the board have developed means that they possess the necessary credentials and competence to undertake their role under this piece of legislation.  I can assure the House today that the regulations will be both rigidly and fairly enforced by the board.  Under no circumstances will a restaurant be certified unless it complies fully with the provisions of the Act and these regulations.</P>
    <P>The draft Regulations provide for the inspection of restaurants at least once a year by the board.  Where warranted, the board will not hesitate to exercise their powers under section 13 of the Act which enables them to revoke a restaurant's certificate at any time if the restaurant <Col N="2000" /> does not continue to comply with the standards laid down.</P>
    <P>Inspection and application procedures for a Bord Fáilte certificate are set out in Part II of the regulations.  Applications must be accompanied by an application and inspection fee of £325 stipulated in the Second Schedule.  This fee and the £75 certification fee are pitched at these levels to cover the cost to Bord Fáilte of processing applications, verifying entries, carrying out inspections, preparing reports, issuing certificates, maintaining a register and enforcing the regulations throughout the year.  Fees at lower levels would effectively mean that the State would be subsidising the restaurant sector to ensure that they satisfy the statutory requirements for liquor licensing.</P>
    <P>For some time now our overseas visitors, particularly European and US visitors, have been expressing surprise at the fact that they could not enjoy our national beverages with their meals.  This new restaurant facility undoubtedly gives a boost to Irish tourism and indeed to the sale of a whole range of Irish alcoholic beverages hitherto not available in restaurants. We owe it to our visitors and, indeed, to our own people to provide this facility.  The draft regulations now before the House will ensure that they can enjoy this facility with their meal and in the confines of a good quality restaurant.</P>
    <P>Once the regulations are approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas it is my intention that a commencement order be introduced immediately.  This will allow restaurants to apply straight away to Bord Fáilte for a certificate of approval and give them the opportunity of securing the special restaurant licence at the earliest opportunity.  I should now like to commend these draft regulations to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the special restaurant licence and sincerely hope it will benefit the tourist industry substantially.  It is long overdue that our genuine restaurants should be able to serve one with an alcoholic drink with a meal.  I do not think there <Col N="2001" /> would be an grave objection to that.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate these regulations and to seek clarification in respect of some of them.</P>
      <P>I received today the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  From my reading of it there is an error in section 25(2). If one reads the Official Report of 24 May, 1988, Volume 380, column 2420, one will see that the Minister accepted an amendment in good faith from me that the level of fines be reduced from £400 and £800 to £300 and £600 respectively. The Act as published shows the fines at £400 and £800.  Something appears to be wrong here.  The Minister said, &ldquo;I would accept Deputy Barrett's figures of £300 and £600 instead of £400 and £800.&rdquo; I am sure that point will be checked.</P>
      <P>In relation to the regulations themselves, it was not quite clear whether we could amend regulations as distinct from just opposing individual regulations.  I think the Minister, in fairness to him, has made an attempt to outline protection for the licensed trade and at the same time to set a high standard for restaurants who will seek and perhaps get these special restaurant licences.  However, I seek clarification on a few points.</P>
      <P>Regulation 4 (2) (a) provides for &ldquo;survey drawings of the restaurant in respect of which the application is being made&rdquo;.  These have to be accompanied by the application.  It is not clear whether a similar situation will arise at renewal of these licences.  What happens if between the application and the renewal date an extension is added to the restaurant?  I brought this point up when we were debating the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  If somebody adds an extension is that part and parcel of the licensed premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Or cuts off a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In other words, is it obligatory when seeking renewal of one's certificate always to submit with one's renewal form all of this information? Likewise, regarding the requirement of showing evidence that the restaurant complies with the Local <Col N="2002" /> Government (Planning and Development) Acts and any by-laws that may be enforced, will we automatically refuse a licence if evidence of by-law approval cannot be produced?  This would have serious consequences for some restaurants because some small extensions are added to buildings over the years be they for private residence or premises where by-law approval was not sought and the owners subsequently sought by-law approval and could not get it because the engineers attached to that local authority will not produce a document to say that by-law approval is in place.  Have Bord Fáilte any discretion or is it obligatory on one to show that one has planning permission and by-law approval and that if one has not got them it is a clear case of refusing a certificate?  Regulation 4 (4) provides: &ldquo;In carrying out an inspection of a restaurant pursuant to Regulation 4 (3) the officer of the board shall have regard to the standards set out in Part III of these Regulations&rdquo;.  This would imply that some discretion is left to the inspector from Bord Fáilte as to whether strict compliance with these regulations is entirely necessary.  I want these points clarified because questions will be asked about them in future.</P>
      <P>Regulation 5 (9) refers to the reception area.  There is no definition in the Bill of the reception area and this is an innovation in these regulations.  We have in the regulations and in the Bill a provision that the waiting area cannot exceed 20 per cent of the floor area of the dining area of the restaurant, but there is no definition of a reception area.  The regulations require the reception area to contain &ldquo;furnishings, fittings and equipment of good quality and in good condition&rdquo;. Where did this reception area come in? Is it an area where one can consume alcohol, is it similar to the waiting area or what is it?  Again, as there is no definition of the reception area in the Bill there is need to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restaurants Association of Ireland have made a point &mdash; I am sure they have made it to all spokespersons for the different parties &mdash; about Regulation 7 (3) &mdash; I think Deputy Colley <Col N="2003" /> has an amendment down to delete this regulation &mdash; which provides that &ldquo;The overall capacity of the total dining area of the restaurant shall not exceed 250 diners and there shall be not less than 0.9 square metres of floor space for each diner&rdquo;.  I was trying to think of a restaurant that I know that can cater for more than 250 diners off the top of my head.  I cannot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, in the Deputy's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the figure of 250 selected?  I am more concerned that, irrespective of the capacity, whether it is 10, 250 or 300, the owner of the premises complies with the regulations and the Act and that sufficient floor space for each diner should be available.  If you have a premises that can accommodate 300 diners and you provide 0.9 square metres of floor space for each diner, surely it is unreasonable that Bord Fáilte would refuse a certificate provided all the other regulations are complied with.  We do not impose a restriction on the size of a licensed premises or a hotel, so why should we say 250 diners is the maximum in a restaurant provided there is sufficient floor space for each diner?  Why has the Minister selected that figure of 250?</P>
      <P>Rather than insert a regulation in relation to the cost of the meal what the Minister has done in these regulations is quite wise.  He has set standards, and I compliment him on that.  I was afraid we would reach the ludicrous situation that a substantial meal would be regarded as a meal for which you charged £7 or whatever. I go along with what the Minister has done in defining what is a genuine restaurant and what is not because in areas of cost matters can be quite ridiculous. The provisions in the Licensing Acts in relation to extended hours are quite ludicrous as matters stand at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the regulations relating to cloakroom facilities and toilets.  Here again we have standards set out which <Col N="2004" /> are reasonable, based on size and the number of persons a restaurant can cater for.  A number of restaurants at the moment perhaps have a very good reputation, supply good food, have excellent management, but the design of the building is such that maybe one could not straight away provide the type of requirements as laid out in Regulation 9 (4).  It would be a little unreasonable if we were to refuse a Bord Fáilte certificate for what I would regard as a genuine restaurant. Perhaps in the short term they could not possibly meet these requirements.  At the same time what they have may be sufficient in the short term.  Will the Bord Fáilte inspector have any leeway in deciding whether a restaurant which can seat, say, between 60 and 100 persons but may not have three WCs and two washhand basins for females but would hope to provide them in the very near future, as soon as they got planning permission for an extension or whatever to the building, are entitled to their certificate, refusal of which could have serious consequences for their business?  Is there any discretion here for Bord Fáilte when inspecting these premises and examining the facilities and standards?</P>
    <P>I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle but the only way to deal with this is to go through each regulation.  I will be as quick as I can.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be too many in here in this debate anyway.  Regulation 12. (3) provides that: &ldquo;Catering for special groups shall not necessitate the refusal of casual diners or reduce in any way the range of food and the service normally provided in the restaurant.&rdquo; I presume that if a group hire a restaurant for a day for a particular function, and use up all the tables, that will not mean the restaurant will lose its certificate.  The wording is very tight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Which regulation is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulation 12. (3).  It <Col N="2005" /> implies that if a group used all the space in the restaurant and there is no space for casual diners, that would not comply with the regulations, as I read them.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that after the debate on the amendments in the Seanad the Minister has decided to include a regulation requiring annual inspection of the premises.  This position is clarified in the regulations, but I still maintain the Bill, as worded, does not impose that obligation. By having this regulation included, we have achieved something from that debate.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the fees being charged.  I was one of those in the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill who said the taxpayer should not pay for these inspections or for the cost of producing certificates, and I still stand by that.  In the second Schedule of the regulations it is stated that application inspection fees will be £325 and certification fees £75.  I can accept that when one has the bother of inspecting a premises initially &mdash; looking at drawings, the application form and so on &mdash; there must be additional work involved compared with what would be needed at a renewal, but there could have been a third set of fees for the renewal inspection and renewal application.  In many cases there will be no change in the year and it will simply be a question of checking against last year's inspection. Charging £400 a year is a substantial amount.  The Minister might consider inserting a separate figure for renewal inspection because, as we said, if an inspector were going to Kerry he could inspect a number of restaurants in one day and a fee of £325 for each inspection is a considerable sum of money.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the <Col N="2006" /> speedy introduction of these regulations because the new licensing regime will benefit the tourist trade in general and will remove one of the barriers which foreign visitors had to spending a pleasant time in Ireland.  It is in Bord Fáilte's interests to make these regulations work and I believe they will set about implementing them in that frame of mind.  I also welcome the fact that we have achieved the right to review and debate the regulations before they become law. There are a number of these regulations to which I would like to refer.</P>
      <P>Because of the procedures of this House, I attempted to stay within the order of the House and make an amendment to the motion rather than to the regulations, but I have been informed that is out of order.  However, I will refer to the contents of that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is slightly unreal to have a block of regulations before the House and to be able to only take them or leave them.  I notice the Minister and his officials are assidiously taking notes, but it is an imperfect system which does not allow us to individually amend regulations. I would not have chosen to delete certain regulations; I would have proposed to make certain amendments to them, but I felt that was not open to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations to which I referred in my amendment &mdash; Deputy Barrett already referred to one of them, regulation 7.(3) &mdash; specifically refers to the capacity of a restaurant and the area which must be allowed to the diner.  I see no problem about the 0.9 square metres being allowed to each diner, but there could be difficulties relating to the figure of 250 diners.  Unlike Deputy Barrett, I know there is one, if not two restaurants in the Dublin area which otherwise would comply with the regulations &mdash; or certainly would attempt to.  On the face of it they would appear to be restaurants which would comply but they would be over the limit of 250 diners.  In every other respect, they would be in keeping <Col N="2007" /> with the high standards required not just by the legislation but by the regulations.</P>
    <P>It is worth making the point that if a restaurant complies with the regulations and with the requirements of the Bill, there should be no particular reason that it should be prohibited from being enterprising and providing a service that obviously will be used by the community. These restaurants are already in existence. There is a market for them and I see no reason that we should be stuck on the figure of 250.  I would prefer to see the first part of regulation 7 (3) omitted. It should start &ldquo;There shall not be less than 0.9 square metres of floor space for each diner&rdquo; and omit reference to the number of diners.  We should leave it to the board to see whether the other regulations have been complied with and, by implication, that such premises would be a premises which should be licensed.</P>
    <P>Regulation 9 (4) sets down particular specification for the provision of toilet facilities.  That is so defined that it would be impossible for the board to have any leeway.  Deputy Barrett asked if the inspector or the board would have any leeway, but it seems to me that if we have this regulation, there is no leeway.  The board cannot have discretion.  What I would have done was to put down an amendment saying that the inspector or the board would be allowed discretion or discussion between the restaurant owner and himself before a certificate was granted on the basis of adequate toilet facilities.  The board can be relied on to make sure those facilities come up to scratch and they have the power to withdraw the certificate at any stage if they feel the restaurant will not comply with these regulations.</P>
    <P>Regulation 11 (11) and 11 (13) deal with the availability of alcohol in the restaurant and the prices of those drinks. Regulation 11 (11) reads:</P>
    <P>A range of spirits and beers including spirits and beers of Irish origin shall be included on the drinks list and shall be available for purchase with a meal during permitted hours.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> I respectfully suggest there is no place for that in this set of regulations because we are talking about existing restaurants which do not have a spirits licence or a licence to sell beer, and which the board are being asked to certify have a drinks list.  The purpose of the certification is to allow the certificate to be granted before an application is made for this licence. Therefore, there can be no list of drinks in this restaurant.  Certainly it can be a requirement that following the granting of the licence that would be required, but &mdash; I do not want to be misquoted or misunderstood because I believe there should be a range of spirits and beers included on the drinks list &mdash; I believe it is a mistake to put it in there because the rest of the regulations refer to the situation before the licence was granted, not after.</P>
    <P>The same would generally apply to regulation 11 (13).  The drinks prices cannot be placed where the customer can see them in a restaurant which is not licenced for those purposes.  I would ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>Regulation 11 (11) specifies &ldquo;including spirits and beers of Irish origin.&rdquo; I wonder what the EC would have to say about that and whether it is allowable to specify domestic products in regulations under State auspices.</P>
    <P>I have some doubts in regard to regulations 4 (2) (c) and 4 (2) (d) which refer to the board's ensuring that the planning and fire regulations have been adhered to.  This seems to set up Bord Fáilte as an authority in the matter of deciding whether planning and fire regulations have been adhered to.  This should not be the case.  The decision by the board is taken prior to the granting of a certificate. If a certificate is not granted, the restaurant owner cannot apply for a licence. This means that the board is in reality a semi-judicial licensing authority.  There are proper procedures for planning and fire regulations which can be used and there is nothing to prevent those authorities being notifiable parties in the licensing application.  Bord Fáilte are not <Col N="2009" /> equipped and should not have the authority to say whether planning and fire regulations have been adhered to.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a restaurant owner who is planning to build a restaurant and wishes to be in compliance with the regulations. There seems to be no procedure whereby he can know that at the end of the day he will have done enough to obtain a certificate from the board.  I believe there are procedures in other licensing areas which allow this to be taken care of.  In some cases a very substantial investment can be made in the building of a restaurant with no sure knowledge that a certificate will be granted, although the owner may believe his premises are in compliance with the regulations.  There should be some consultative process which would allow people to make an investment in a relatively sure atmosphere.</P>
    <P>When an application is made to the board, there is no time limit within which they must carry out an inspection and make a decision.  This is not tight enough and it it open to mistakes, abuse and favouritism.  If somebody makes an application in September or October for a special restaurant licence he or she would surely expect that within six months at the outside Bord Fáilte would have inspected and made a decision.  As far as I know there is no such requirement in the regulations. It is reasonable to expect that the board should act within a particular time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the regulations. My amendments were designed to be constructive.  If the Minister can make changes at this stage it would be worthwhile.  These regulations will be introduced immediately and it would be far better to ward off troubles now than to leave it until later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The speed with which the Minister and his officials have responded to the legislation passed by the House only last week is to be commended. It is clear that a lot of attention has been given to the matter and it is proposed immediately upon the passing of these regulations that a commencement order will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> It must be noted that this debate is taking place the day after other aspects of the originating legislation have been cast into doubt.  It is regrettable that our entire licensed trade is under threat of strike action due to the extended hours of business provided for in the Act.  It is regrettable that an amendment in the name of The Worker's Party put forward on Committee Stage was not considered by the House.  We sought to provide that it would not be lawful for any person to compel or attempt to compel any employee of a licensed premises to work hours longer than those worked prior to the coming into effect of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the regulations will come into force as soon as an order in respect of Part II has been passed and a commencement order has been put in place.  Perhaps he would clear up the confusion which has arisen about the other portions of the Bill and say whether they are now in place and operating.  Do the provisions regarding extended hours and under-age drinking and other regulations require a commencement order?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would take a few moments to call on all concerned in the developing row to have sense and to appeal to the employers to recognise that this legislation devolves substantially increased responsibilities on staff and that they should respond sensibly and constructively to the reasonable demands for fair play in this regard.  It would be very regrettable if this legislation at its inception were tripped in any way by an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>The regulations as published are welcome. There is nothing particularly intricate or ingenious about them.  Concern about the overall thrust and direction of the provisions with regard to the special restaurant licence was expressed on Second Stage and on Committee Stage. I voiced a certain concern that we were legislating for an elite and well off section of the community.  Deputy Kelly to some extent hijacked the whole debate by talking about legislation for tourists and referring to the bewildered and confused foreigner who could not understand why he could not get a glass of beer with <Col N="2011" /> his meal.  We are legislating not just for tourists and foreigners but for all of us.</P>
    <P>The definition of a substantial meal gives rise to serious concern.  The clear intention is to provide for an elite type of restaurant and a very exclusive type of diner.  The man in the street will not be in a position to benefit from these provisions.  Deputy Barrett commended the approach of setting out the type of meal which should be served as opposed to laying down monetary levels, which have been set at ludicrous levels in the special exemptions laws.  It is provided that that table d'hôte menu shall provide a choice of hors d'oeuvres, including fresh soups, five main courses, a choice of fresh vegetables and a choice of three desserts.  It is also provided that a good selection of cheeses shall be available. Regulation 11 (5) deals with the á la carte menu.  I note that soup is to be provided but it is not specified that it shall be fresh soup.  Perhaps it is a typographical oversight.</P>
    <P>The local cuisine which can be offered in certain restaurants which specialise in particular dishes is to be excluded.  I am thinking here of restaurants that specialise in the serving of fish as a meal, or ethnic restaurants such as Italian restaurants. I am concerned that we are legislating all of these out, the type of restaurants frequented by working class people who do not want to sit down with good quality linen napkins as the regulations look for but want, nonetheless, what they rightly consider very substantial meals.</P>

I know that the regulations of the House do not allow for amendment or for change but I would ask the Minister to keep under close review the operation of this section with regard to what constitutes a substantial meal.  If there are concerns voiced by sections of the restaurant trade or by sections of the public because they feel <Col N="2012" /> hard done by, the Minister should be amenable to amending the regulations. This is a new departure and it is important that the Minister and his officials be receptive to changes should they be looked for.  In proposing the regulations in regard to genuine good quality restaurants, we are a little bit stuck in the strip of some sectors of the city.  There are other restaurants and other clientele that perhaps the Minister would not be too familiar with but who should be considered.</P>

      <P>Having said that, I would like to ask a few questions about the regulations.  The regulations laid down under 4 (1) that the only person who can apply is an owner and occupier is very restrictive.  The restaurant is defined as &ldquo;the premises&rdquo;.  The only applicant can be a bricks and mortar owner and occupier.  What is the position of a person who rents premises, has a leasehold interest or seeks to take on the restaurant trade of an existing restaurateur and is not strictly the occupier?</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the inspection, my reading of the regulations is that there would be one major inspection at the application stage and that is referred to in the schedule of fees.  Will there be an ongoing annual fee for the annual inspection?  I am glad that under regulation 14 it is insisted that there be an annual inspection but my reading is that there will not be any fee for this.  Deputy Barrett has a different interpretation, that it will be £325 or £400 per annum.  That certainly would be excessive and I do not think that is intended.  I read it the other way &mdash; and I am concerned about this &mdash; that there will be no annual fee at all.  I think there should be some fee laid down so that the point is made that it is not the taxpayer who will pay for these inspections of the applicant restaurateur.  I would ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> In regard to the type of restaurant we are pitching this at, I am concerned that all self-service, buffet type restaurants will be excluded.  Regulation 7 (4) insists that all service must be waitered.  I wonder if that is not an over-restrictive provision in the regulations.</P>

I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to my remarks, particularly in regard to the whole question of the pitch to which we are now putting the legislation on restaurants. We are being much too elitist in what we are seeking to do here today. Nevertheless I recognise that it is a new departure.  We must proceed with a degree of caution.  My only exhortation to the Minister is that he and his Department would be receptive to the many representations that he will receive both inside and outside the House with regard to the working of the regulations in the months to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had only five minutes.  That is why I was working up a sweat.  As I indicated, the regulations, including those on the renewals, will have to be adhered to.  There will be no inspection if, for example, the survey drawings are not in.  The same applies to planning. I want to make it quite clear that it is in the waiting area only that drink can be served.</P>
      <P>The next point that was raised, and it was raised by Deputy Colley as well, was on the question of the 250.  It is a problem to make a decision as to where exactly to stop.  No matter where one stops not everybody will be satisfied.  It is the old philosophical question in regard to how many hairs one has to pull from a horse's tail before it is not longer a horse's tail. As one begins to extend it or reduce it, one will have problems with people who think the number should be larger or smaller.  We wanted the legislation to cover restaurants, not larger areas where the major part of activity might be cabaret or entertainment and where we would lose sight of the food which is basic to the whole business.  We would be going into the function room area rather than the restaurant area if we went higher than that.  We had to pick a particular size.  I admit that there may be individual restaurants which will find themselves in difficulty with regard to that.  There is also the possibility that they could attenuate in order to cut down, say, to 250.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not envisage the cutoff or attenuated area being used for any such purpose.  I welcome what Deputy Barrett said about the inclusion of the words &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo; rather than going into the cost of a meal as this could become ridiculous in times of inflation or in times of deflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remarks that were made both by Deputy Barrett and <Col N="2015" /> Deputy Colley about toilet facilities, it is one of the areas where visitors have complained about our standards and about the size of accommodation.  I see very strong reasons for adhering to the dimensions laid down.  Deputy Barrett mentioned some very good restaurants that may have difficulties.  I am sure that they will be able to find a way in which to expand their facilities.  Even in places where no discretionary element is provided for, it is important that rules be applied sensibly, with reason, justice and equity.  I would adhere with the proposition that the regulations have to be adhered to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the fees. An inspection will take place each year. If we ever decide it should be reduced we will have to come back to the House to get agreement but as of now the regulations state that an inspection will have to be carried out each year and that the fees have to be paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the fines that would have to be paid and the acceptance of an amendment.  I think the fines which the Deputy is referring to are the fines outlined in the Schedule to the Act.  The fines to be paid by persons found on licensed premises during prohibited hours are being increased from £20 to £300 for a first offence and from £40 to £600 for a subsequent offence. Those are the two figures mentioned by the Deputy.  This was agreed to in the House.</P>

I accept what she said that there may be one or two restaurants which, apart from capacity, would fit in in every other way and I would suggest that attenuation might be of help in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not understand what Deputy Colley was getting at when she referred to the price list.  By law, public houses have to display a price list. What is required here is that restaurants would have to put up a price list where the customer can see it and it is only fair that this should be done <i>post factum</i> as soon as the newly licensed restaurant is under way.  In regard to planning permission all that would be required is evidence that planning permission has been received.  There are no judicial implications in it.  If at one of my political clinics someone brings in a document from the planning authority which shows that they have received planning permission that would be adequate and I do not see any problems about this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, there are many premises that would not have got planning permission for example, pre-1963 buildings.  It is evidence that the restaurant complies with the provisions of Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts: it is not necessarily planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett referred to extensions but the fact of the matter is that if a certificate is sought from the planning authority as regards the status of a pre-1963 building I do not think that there would be any problems in regard to it.  Bord Fáilte will be very conscious of the need to expedite matters.  In regard to the renewal of licences, the courts will sit at fixed times &mdash; that is so in regard to <Col N="2018" /> licensed premises.  I am assured that the inspection team are ready, willing and eager to go and that there will be no undue delay.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the staffing of licensed premises: I am the wrong Minister in regard to that matter as I think he was mainly speaking about public houses rather than restaurants.  I agree it is important that there be no industrial action in licensed premises and I appeal not merely to the employers but also to the workers &mdash; Deputy McCartan appealed to the employers but I would appeal to both groups &mdash; to try to avert industrial action if at all possible.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McCartan for his welcome for the regulations but I think he went off on an ideological jag when he referred to elitism.  I do not believe that this is the case.  The fact that you have a table d'hôte of considerable proportions does not impose any obligation to start with the egg, as the Romans used to say, and end with the apple.  I would not be able to work myself into an ideological sweat about what we are doing here.  Any citizen should be able to visit and partake selectively of a good substantial meal in any of our restaurants.  I agree wholeheartedly with him when he says that there are specialist restaurants and there is nothing in the regulations which would inhibit specialist restaurants from continuing.</P>
      <P>One of the things which I am delighted about, and Deputy McCartan referred to this, is that there is now a variety of cheeses available. I suppose there are about 15 small regional producers of cheese at present.  These cheeses are delightful and at a recent festival of fromage in Paris &mdash; where they are very snooty about their cheeses &mdash; the adjudicator, a Frenchman, judged the Irish cheeses as being in the very top rank.  I hope that continues to be the case.  There is a very fine goats cheese in Cavan which I recommend the Deputy to try if he ever goes there as well as a Gouda which is made at Kingscourt. I am only putting in a little plug here.</P>

      <P>I am referring to cheeses only because the Deputy mentioned them.  He appealed also for an open mind and I am sure that our minds will be kept open on any improvements that might be made in the regulations in the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question raised by the Deputy, if I understand him correctly, on whether the holding of a lease would entitle a lease holder to apply for a licence, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The Deputy raised the question about confusion as to what was and what was not in operation as of now.  The entire Act is in operation except for Part II, which deals with special restaurant licences, which is what we are dealing with here; section 40 which deals with voluntary age cards and section 47 which deals with restrictions on the sale of alcohol in supermarkets. The Act was signed into law by the President on 22 June.  There is nothing mandatory about the Act.  These requirements need to be met only if a restaurateur wants the new type of licence. If a restaurateur who has a restaurant with an established reputation and a good wine cellar wants to keep his restaurant as it is, of course he may do so.  I think some people are puzzled about that.  The main complaint over the years has been specifically that one could not get the wine of the country &mdash; either beer of whatever colour, Irish whiskey or Irish gin &mdash; in a restaurant and people felt, and I agree with them, that this should have been remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standards and some detailed level of inspection will apply to all renewals as well as to the initial issue of a certificate <Col N="2020" /> and that is what dictates the costing.  I did not fully understand Deputy Colley's remarks about the European situation. In all such areas it is only if some preference is shown for the products of a country, whether it is a service or a product as in this case, that one might come under EC regulations and be inhibited from doing something.  Here there is a mention of Irish products but this is not exclusive of products from any other EC country.  I think I have covered most of the points which were raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I understand the thinking behind that regulation, and this is from experience.  What the regulation wants to avoid are instances where a restaurant which is catering for special groups has a fixed menu for that special group, who have lobster for their principal dish, and I am told, if I go into the restaurant, that because there is a group in possession of the restaurant that I can only have lobster simply because the restaurant is almost full with a special group. What the regulation wants to avoid is the situation where a restaurateur can use a special group to in some way cut down on what is available to the general customer. That is as I understand the regulation and I agree with it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister refer to my main query about drink lists and the ranges available having to do with the logistical business of the regulations.  The regulations seem to imply that one has to have this list before a certificate can be granted and that the restaurant owner would not be allowed to show that he can sell spirits or beer or show the prices for the same because he does not have a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any problem with that.  When a restaurateur goes to court and gets his licence he will then, and not until then, be in a position to sell the spirits or beer which he cannot sell now.  He can then <Col N="2021" /> put up his list of prices and his certificate from Bord Fáilte and can do business.</P>

The inspector may say that he has inspected the premises and there is no such range of drink or, for arguments sake, there is no reception area.

I can foresee the possibility of the mandate of CBF being extended in the future to cover venison and poultry.</P>
      <P>The question then arises of whether the definitions section is correctly framed to permit that extension of mandate to take place should circumstances so demand.  The definition of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo;, as drafted, means bovine animals, sheep and pigs and such other species of animals as may be specified from time to time by the Minister by regulations.  The net question is whether the word &ldquo;animals&rdquo; includes poultry.  I am open to correction on this but, at first glance, I would contend that it does not include poultry.  I tabled these amendments to ensure that the obvious intent of the Bill is implemented.  No doubt the Minister's dictionary research will have been more in-depth than mine.  There is nothing contentious about these amendments.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the intent of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendments is to ensure that poultry, venison and other meats would be included within the definition of &ldquo;meat&rdquo;.  Let me assure him &mdash;as the explanatory and financial memorandum says&mdash;that is also my intention. I have checked the legal interpretation of the word &ldquo;animals&rdquo; and I find that it includes poultry.  Therefore, there is no amendment necessary for the insertion or inclusion of poultry.  Because the definition of &ldquo;animals&rdquo; does include poultry and other meats, if I were to include poultry specifically, that would imply that I was excluding poultry and other meats from the present definition.  That is the confirmed view of the legal advice available to me.  I am advised that not only is its insertion not necessary but that its inclusion could give rise to other interpretations that neither the Deputy nor I would wish.</P>

      <P>I oppose Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment.  Possibly the definition of &ldquo;meat&rdquo; is sufficiently wide, as at present drafted, but I oppose his amendment for another reason.  Essentially, the provisions of the Bill empower CBF to promote red meats.  Therefore, to specifically include white meats that have captured an inordinate share of the traditional red meat market would lead to a certain conflict of interests within the organisation and its mandate.  Córas Beostoic agus Feola are doing a very good job at present.  It might interest the House to know that the consumption of poultry has surpassed that of red meats in the United States, Britain last year and, I understand, some continental European countries.  Whereas poultry would not constitute a very large export commodity &mdash; because of its dependence on imported grain, representing 75 per cent of the market value of the finished commodity or product &mdash; on the other hand beef and lamb are of immense importance for our export purposes.  It is for that reason I oppose the amendment. I would see it leading to a conflict of interests within the activities of CBF.</P>

      <P>My purpose in putting down an amendment was to raise quite <Col N="2026" /> an important issue.  I am seeking an assurance from the Minister that he has the same outlook on the funding issue as I have.  My party did not oppose the imposition of the levies in relation to pigs or &mdash; more importantly &mdash; in relation to cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>It is important that sufficient funding is available to CBF for market development. I am cognisant of the fact that Ireland is the largest net exporter of beef in the European Community.  I accept that CBF must have a reasonable amount of funding available to them to ensure that market development is properly funded and catered for.  My concern is that the increased funding now available in the levies to CBF would not be available for market development and would, to a substantial degree, be devoted to the fixed costs of CBF.</P>
      <P>At present CBF are a pretty tightly run body and employ about 30 people.  The level of staff is considerably lower than the numbers prior to the establishment of the organisation as a statutory body in 1979.  They certainly fulfil the requirement of being &mdash; like the product they sell &mdash; a lean body and are cost effective. At the same time, they have fixed costs in relation to salaries, administrative costs, travelling expenses for promotion abroad and the maintenance of their four overseas offices.  The administration costs in all those areas are about £1 million per year.  By coincidence, the Exchequer subvention is just under that figure, around £915,000.  In broad terms, the Exchequer subvention roughly covers administration costs and the consequence is that the moneys available from the levies and the additional moneys which will now be available from the increased rates are &mdash; and should be &mdash; fully available in future for market development.  I am not demanding extra Exchequer funding from the Minister.  I have agreed the increase in the levies but I want them to be devoted to the market development aspect of CBF instead of going towards administration costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could resolve my concern by giving an indication that he shares my views in this regard.  I appreciate that <Col N="2027" /> he cannot give a specific commitment in terms of money but I should like an indication from the Government, represented here by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, that they share the approach which I outlined.  The case stands four square.  There is substantial Exchequer support for CTT &mdash; and I do not denigrate their work &mdash; but quite clearly, exports of our indigenous products are essentially of far greater benefit, pound for pound, than many of our industrial exports.  This arises principally because the inputs to our beef exports are produced domestically whereas a large part of inputs for industrial exports are themselves imported.  I understand that the relevant figures are approximately 84 per cent of the input for some of our industrial exports as opposed to about 16 per cent of import inputs to our food exports.  Therefore, when we look at our export figures, we must look at the exports net of their import content.  That, coupled with the substantial profit repatriation involved in our industrial exports, shows that our food exports are of equivalent value in net terms compared to our industrial exports.</P>
    <P>I mention those figures on the basis that the Exchequer contributes by way of subvention about £20 million to Coras Tráchtála and there is a strong case for a continuation of the Exchequer subvention to CBF.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to give an assurance to the House that he shares this outlook, that he wants to see our food exports growing from strength to strength, the additional levy raised by this Bill devoted to market development and, therefore, contributing to those additional exports which we need in the food sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that CBF, through their own levies and revenue, are setting a headline for the type of responsibility which attaches to each sector in terms of export promotion. Deputy O'Keeffe was right to draw attention to the fact that CBF are contributing in a ratio of at least two to one of tax-payers' contribution to the promotion of <Col N="2028" /> our meat exports abroad.  I should like to draw the attention of the House and the public to the fact that the meat industry is exceptional in that it is, as Deputy O'Keeffe pointed out the only sector where the industry makes the major contribution to the promotion of its own export products.</P>
      <P>Bord Bainne is not State funded, as the Deputy knows.  In relation to other exports funded under CTT there is a very considerable contribution from the State with no balancing contribution from the sector itself.  What has developed as a healthy process should be maintained and encouraged.  I commend CBF for achieving such worthwhile consequences and benefits for the economy generally and for the sector on such a funding basis.  In advance of any Government decisions, decisions which will be concluded before the end of the year in accordance with proceedings for the Book of Estimates it is not possible for me to give any formal commitment as to what the position will be.  However, it is evident from the fact that a sum of money was reallocated within the general votes to take account of the extra responsibility given to CBF for pigmeat, that the Government are aware of the role of CBF and acknowledge their role in this very important sector of the economy.  We have seen a very welcome trend and expansion here in the development of the agricultural food sector and we all want to maintain that trend.  The total meat exports for 1987 were 540,000 tonnes valued at £930 million, with important quantities going to other member states of the European Communities and to Third World countries. The output of cattle, sheep and pigs represented 45 per cent of farm output or about £1,300 million annually.  We are talking about a major contribution to the well-being of our economy and to our balance of trade within that economy. By comparison, the current cost of the Exchequer grant in aid to the organisation, at £915,000 is not substantial.  We want to see this contribution from the industry continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levies I am proposing in this section were unanimously recommended <Col N="2029" /> to me by the board of CBF.  I appreciate the work of this board which represents all the farming organisations.  It is their unanimous recommendation that I have transferred into this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have all seen the work of CBF at first hand here and in other countries but most recently I saw it at a magnificently organised international meat symposium held in Killarney which attracted representatives of the meat trade from 18 different countries and from all the continents of the world.  The biggest buyers in the trade agreed that the presentation and the professionalism of CBF was to be highly commended.  I am very encouraged at this particularly good example of the effective promotion of the image of Ireland and Irish meat which enhances the market advantages in several countries. CBF engage in promotional activities to a great extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe is right to want the maximum of funds to be employed for marketing purposes.  The Deputy also wants the minimum amount to be applied for general administration.  The Deputy will be glad to know that within a tight budget over two-thirds of the income goes towards market development and promotion, and market information, and less than one-third is spent on personnel and administration.  In any promotional organisation there is inevitably a high overhead in terms of personnel, because personnel make the organisation.  Administration covers a very wide range of activities including equipment.  The money spent on promotion as against personnel and administration is a very good balance and the success which has been achieved is quite remarkable.</P>
    <P>Different elements in the meat industry rely to a greater or lesser extent on the promotion of CBF.  Some firms are big enough to promote themselves almost all of the time but others, not quite so large scale, need CBF.  It is in our interests to ensure that we get a balanced promotional and marketing programme on behalf of the industry.  The five year plan which CBF are following with considerable success with regard to the promotion and expansion of the cattle trade <Col N="2030" /> and the Vac Pac beef export, proposes to increase total beef exports from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in 1990.  That is a major target which I have no doubt they will achieve.  They propose to double further downstream processing from the current share of 5 per cent of all exports and to expand the total value of exports from the industry to £1,100 million by 1990.  We are talking about an overall plan and I have produced this legislation to give effect to that plan.</P>
    <P>Over the years from 1985 to 1987 funding has been almost on a basis of two to one from the industry.  I am proposing to maintain that ratio.  The Deputy will appreciate that, happy though I am with the performance of CBF, and my actions will demonstrate my respect for what they have done, I cannot give firm commitments at the moment in respect of what is an ongoing Government exercise.</P>
    <P>CBF have made it very clear, as I have, that marketing promotion is based on quality Irish, the quality of our environment and so on, and that has enabled us to get the highest possible price, which is evident in the beef trade, particularly in the last number of months.  I will have more to say during the next few days about the risk to our environment, sometimes from the people who benefit most from it.  I hope that what so far has been a very successful promotion will not be undermined by the neglect or carelessness of a few who have damaged our environment and our reputation.  I assure the House that I and my colleagues will not stand for that sort of attitude.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister shares my outlook on the need to continue existing Exchequer funding to cover overheads.  I am glad to have that understanding in the Official Report. On that basis I am prepared to agree the section imposing the levies on the clear understanding that they will be devoted in full to market development in the interests of producers and processors alike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to the section which increases these levies <Col N="2031" /> in the case of beef and sheepmeat and which imposes a new levy in the case of pig meat.  Córas Beostoic agus Feola now have responsibility for pig meat whereas previously it was the responsibility of Córas Tráchtála.  The increase of 50p &mdash; from £1 to £1.50 &mdash; cannot be regarded, in the circumstances, as a punitive amount.  The farming organisations are very foolish, shortsighted and childish in criticising the measure because it is imperative that we sell what we produce. It must be obvious to anybody that restrictions on intervention for beef will increase rather than decrease.  If we cannot sell the beef we produce on the open market, without recourse to intervention, in a short period we will be in very serious difficulty in this country.  It is imperative that in the marketplace particularly in Britain and in Europe we get rid of the beef we produce.  Any movement in any other direction would be unwise.  It is essential for all of us to face up to the facts.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was speaking on this section he made reference to the recent conference in Killarney where the assistant director general of the agricultural commission, Mr. Peter Pooley, made it clear that there was a serious problem arising with regard to beef in the Community and that the existing stocks in intervention of 755,000 tonnes would, by the end of the year, have reached something in the order of one million tonnes and that the Commission would be likely to take action to stop that happening by imposing penalties such as lengthening the delay in payments for beef going into intervention.  They have done it on relatively small scales at times and perhaps on a larger scale at other times. That is a serious penalty to our producers and to our processors.  It is important that we get away from the crutch of intervention and that we be able to sell everything without recourse to intervention. The way to do that is by putting money in CBF and ensuring that their role is expanded.  Those opportunities have been limited because of the shortage of cash up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> The farming organisations when criticising the increase in this levy should bear in mind that we got a special beef premium in December 1985 &mdash; only 18 months ago &mdash; of £15 per beast &mdash; which we were not supposed to get originally. We got it only by virtue of threat of implementing the veto.  Now when one thirtieth of that £15 is to be taken away in order to sell beef we get these stupid objections.  The levy has been increased by 50p.  They got £15 and that should be regarded as a major boost.  It was one of the reasons cattle prices have steadily increased ever since, the main reason being that cow numbers are down and there was a shortage of fresh beef.  There should not be any objection because the meat premium is such a large boost and it is in their own interest that the beef be sold.</P>
    <P>Regarding the sheep meat increases levy from 10p to 20p one would have to be very shortsighted to oppose that increase.  Sheep farmers and the sheep meat industry have done better in recent years than most other sectors of agriculture. It is the one area where people have been able to expand numbers without any restriction whatsoever.  It can still be done in the beef area if you can sell the beef.  There is a deficiency of sheepmeat in the Community and there will be for several years.</P>
    <P>I was not as reassured as the Minister or, perhaps, as some other people by the statement at the Killarney conference to which he referred that there would not be any problems in the sheep meat industry in the near future.  There are bound to be problems because we are reaching a stage of self-sufficiency within the EC where sheep meat is concerned.  As well as that the New Zealanders have access to the Community markets and are pumping in 260,000 tonnes of sheep meat a year.  That is bound to have an effect fairly soon.  It is imperative that we have a marketing process whereby we get rid of all the sheep meat we produce.  We need that badly.</P>
    <P>We have got to devise better breeding systems whereby the fat content in our sheep meat is reduced because there is <Col N="2033" /> resistance to it on the Continent, primarily in France &mdash; which is the largest market &mdash; but also in Germany and Belgium which are markets which have got to be considered because they are reasonably large.  There is an incredible resistance to any meat, particularly sheep meat, which has fat attached so we must improve our breeding strains.  I have been preaching that for five or six years and I keep saying it.  One cannot say often enough that breeding strains for sheep will have to be improved.  The British have been doing it now for the past 15 or 20 years with positive results.  The British could be the basis for our problems in the future in the sheep meat sector because the numbers of sheep being produced there are astronomical.  One county alone in Britain, Devon, has more sheep than the whole of Ireland.  If that was multiplied it would be seen that they have a vast amount of sheep.  The total amount of sheep in Britain at present is something of the order of 30 million.  In Ireland we are approaching a figure of three million sheep.  As regards sheep we are underpopulated.</P>
    <P>There is potential in sheep production but we did not do what we should have done even prior to our entry to the EC. Invariably what will happen as time goes on is that the market will become selfsufficient in sheep meat and the 260,000 tonnes of New Zealand lamb which is coming in unrestricted can come in unrestricted for ever more.  I do not believe that there are two or three Members of this House who realise or understand that.  Because of GATT agreements, that 260,000 tonnes of New Zealind sheep meat cannot be stopped or curtailed. They have an absolute right to continue that importation into the Community. We could stop their butter importation into the Community overnight.  The reason we have not done it up to now is because there is a political involvement. The Germans and the French in particular are not keen that butter importation be stopped.  We cannot do anything about the sheep meat.  We cannot veto it.  We cannot stop it.  We can object to it <Col N="2034" /> but unless there is a vote in the Community to compensate them nothing can happen.  I am told that the compensation would amount to billions of pounds and it is not an alternative.  There could be a real problem.  Therefore, it is imperative that we sell the sheep meat.  The levy is not a huge amount.  Farming organisations and individuals will object to 20p per head of sheep but it is minor if you consider the problems we could face in that sector if we cannot sell it.</P>
    <P>Regarding pigmeat I was delighted to see that CBF have got the responsibility for marketing it here and abroad, because we have fallen far behind in the pigmeat industry <i>vis-à-vis</i> our competitors in Denmark and Holland, and it is not good enough.  We have fallen behind basically because our processing plants have not been up to scratch.  Most of them are fit only to be bulldozed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that because of the 75 per cent grant-aid which we procured from Europe two and a half or maybe three years ago a number of individuals, co-operatives and industries are in the process of investing heavily in pigmeat.  I can see the pig numbers in this country are going to increase dramatically as a result of these new slaughtering and processing facilities.  It is acknowledged right around the world that Irish pigmeat is the best; it is better than Dutch or Danish and quite often we find our pigmeat is being marketed by those countries as their own. Our producers, have produced in recent years a quality which is outstanding. Probably no other segment of Irish farmers is as good as the pig producers.  They are small in number at the moment but they are absolute geniuses at their job.  If the producers have a system, a structure which they can work through to the consumer in America, Japan, on the Continent or at home they are going to achieve absolute wonders.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous future for the pigmeat industry and the 20p levy suggested here is really a drop in the ocean. The producers will be only too glad to pay it when they see the benefits they will derive from the salesmanship of CBF. They have been left in limbo ever since <Col N="2035" /> the collapse of the Pigs and Bacon Commission. They have really had no way of promoting their produce on a national or international basis.  We should welcome this takeover by CBF of the function of selling pigmeat and we should not oppose the 20p levy suggested here in section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to Deputy Deasy and to Deputy O'Keeffe for the manner in which they have approached this proposal which in any event was the unanimous proposal of the board of CBF. Deputy Deasy in particular has made a very strong and direct statement to the producers, or at least to some of the organisations who suggest they represent them, that to cavil with the amounts involved here would be, to say the least, against their own interests.  I agree with him entirely.  The developments he has referred to require that the marketing particularly of all these sectors and now we are adding pigmeat into it, will be done in the most professional way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give some encouraging indications to the House of what is happening. Deputy Deasy is quite right to say we cannot continue to rely on intervention. I am glad to tell him &mdash; and I will give further details tomorrow in the House in reply to questions on this &mdash; that more than any other beef-producing country in the EC we are relying less rather than more on intervention.  The market he has referred to is now the target for all our production and processing effort, and intervention is really only a fail-safe or floor which has been introduced against the possibility of an overall decline, but Deputy Deasy will be aware that only for the second time since we joined the EC we have been triggered out of intervention for certain categories of beef very recently.  In line with what he has expressed and the direction he has pointed I hope we will see that pattern continue.  Intervention is not what we want.  We want to get out there and not only win the markets but keep them.  If other countries are relying more <Col N="2036" /> on intervention &mdash; and they are &mdash; that is their problem.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred rightly to Peter Pooley.  The fact of the matter is that other European countries are increasing their reliance on intervention and it is costing the EC more.  The proposals that follow from that, of course, could be seen in the first instance perhaps to impact on us, but I am confident they will not for as long as we hit the market as our target and use intervention for what it is for, only a fail-safe.  The real problem is not that we are putting more into intervention; others are.  Secondly, it is not being sold out of intervention sources at the same rate as it should be. I am glad to say we are all of one mind and view in relation to this, and I will continue to advocate a continuing attack on the market and a movement away from intervention.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is right, a major issue is coming up here on sheep.  I have reminded my colleagues in the EC that we should not introduce penalties on the Community producer without having regard to the fact that we are not in surplus in the EC in sheep.  The surplus, if it is one, is because, as Deputy Deasy pointed out, there is an established right, rather than an automatic right, for New Zealand particularly to export into the EC.  We have to strengthen our capacity in this area and that is precisely what we are doing.  We have introduced a whole range both in terms of getting away from the fatty mutton Deputy Deasy referred to and producing quality for the market. We have introduced a code of conduct and support for handling right from day one on the farm into transportation, right through the processing.  I have attended numerous functions and seminars in relation to this, trying to demonstrate as much as one Minister can or should that this is the only direction.  There, again, the evidence is that we are seeing an improvement in the quality of our sheepmeat but it will need to be sustained to ward off the attack which, Deputy Deasy has quite rightly pointed out, will be coming even more from New Zealand. No one is going to be in this business for <Col N="2037" /> charity, much less our competitors, and the bigger we get the less charity we can expect out there in the market, but if we are not looking for charity from others let them be aware that we will not be giving them much either.  We will be out there with quality and we are going to ensure that the income increase we have seen based on quality will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I should say except to acknowledge in relation to pigmeat that Deputy Deasy in his time made a major contribution with the special provision for the rationalisation of the pigmeat sector.  I am endeavouring to follow through on that and to encourage pig producers themselves to maximise the benefits that will now be available to them through a much more efficient and cost competitive processing industry than was available to them previously.  All in all, as has been heralded here, we are seeing through these levies we are talking about a degree of responsibility in terms of funding which we all recognise.  We are seeing for the first time a confidence that we do not need intervention in any of these areas. We can rely on our capacity in the marketplace. Intervention is there as a fail-safe and will remain there.</P>
    <P>Since I addressed my first reply to Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to the balance between administration and marketing, I am glad to tell him, I have just ascertained that even in the determination within existing funds, never mind increasing funds, CBF have reallocated as much as possible from administration to marketing and promotion.  I have not got the figures here at the moment but that is the trend we all want to see while maintaining a certain basic level of administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not entirely relevant to this discussion, but for what it is worth let me say that New Zealand has <Col N="2038" /> negotiated special access to the EC.  It is part of a binding agreement that arose originally on the accession of Britain to the EC as much as anything else because of the special preference Britain enjoyed for cheap sheepmeat from New Zealand and they had as much an interest in maintaining that position as New Zealand had in maintaining access.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Deasy pointed out, this is now being caught up in the GATT negotiations where they do not have the same right&mdash;if you want to call it that &mdash; for dairy imports.  They are all intermingled in terms of the balance in the GATT and these matters are being addressed at present and will be over the next few years.  As Deputy Deasy pointed out, we will have to live with access of sheepmeat from New Zealand for some considerable time and the best way to do that is to produce the product which will get a better return on the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disturbing that despite the reduction in cow numbers, the amount of beef in intervention has increased considerably.  Does this mean red meats are being rated as health hazards and that there is consumer resistence on the advice of the medical profession? Has the Minister any evidence of that? What were the consumption figures for the past two years?  I am a little out of date.  It is only commonsense to realise that if cow numbers are down beef production should be down, but stocks in intervention keep increasing.  Is there a rational explanation for that, other than that people are being advised not to eat red meat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to raise deals with the overall amount of money to be realised by these levies.  The Minister pointed out that the original figure being raised by the levies was £1.9 million, with the new levies the figure would be £3 million and when we add the pigmeat levy it would be £3.4 million.  Did I hear him say there would be funding for the Government on a two to one ratio?  I am particularly concerned that there would be a ratio maintained <i>vis-à-vis</i> funding <Col N="2039" /> paid by the producer and funding provided by the Government.  I would be apprehensive that there might be an effort to substitute funding being provided by the producer for funding which was previously provided by the Government. I do not want to draw parallels or to bring in red herrings, but there could be a parallel with the rod licence issue.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that we are not substituting moneys being provided by the producer for moneys which were provided by the Government.</P>

      <P>I have two queries.  As regards the levies, I hope this will be accepted by the farmers because it is in their interests as much as anybody else's that Córas Beostoic agus Feola be developed and given the resources necessary to do the job.  Arising from the Minister's statement about intervention, the exports of live cattle in the early eighties reached 500,000 per year and are still running at a huge level.  In 1986 we expoeted 322,000 live cattle, and consequently, we were exporting jobs.  I would ask the Minister to give some indication of how he sees that picture changing for the purpose of providing jobs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  I am glad to tell the Deputy the trend in live cattle exports are dropping.  I may have further details about this matter as Question Time tomorrow.  This is a very healthy trend. Last year out total exports were 270,000, a dramatic drop over the previous year and the indications I have at present are that that healthy trend is continuing.  That is what we want to see because the added value in employment and in earnings generated by processing at home in Vac Pac and so on is, and has to be, the priority of the industry at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the first point raised by Deputy Deasy, there is evidence that some interests are attempting to persuade consumers against eating red meat. As the Deputy pointed out, if production <Col N="2040" /> is dropping and intervention is increasing, something does not add up.  I am glad to say that that does not apply to our products.  We are enjoying premium prices for our products even in beef producing countries, notably Germany.  It is for other countries to argue their own case.  In a changing consumer market it is for us to demonstrate that our product is pure, natural and additive free.  If that is what the consumer wants, that is what the consumer must get, and the price we are getting for our product shows we are giving him what he wants.  I have taken a strong position in relation to all matters from hormones down the line, but as I said, I do not have any control over what happens in other countries.  I agree with Deputy Deasy that there may be other interests persuading some people from eating red meat but that, I am glad to say, is not affecting our trade.</P>
    <P>As far as funding is concerned, I cannot say what will be provided for any part of my Department, much less for a specific sub-Vote, before the Government programme for expenditure determination is concluded.  What I was telling Deputy Deasy was that the ratio has generally been of the order of two to one, and I recognise that is a healthy pattern.  I cannot say any more than that at this point.  I recognise the view of the House and I will be influenced by it when I am making my case.  However, no one can give a commitment in advance of a Government decision, and have not done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate that the fines should be increased because, unfortunately, many of our meat plants have the reputation for wholesale abuse and dishonesty.  There is plenty of evidence involving not just the failure to make returns on levies to CBF but in many cases there was wholesale fraud, <Col N="2041" /> especially involving EC payments.  There is a need for improved supervision of the meat industry to ensure that there is no evasion of payment of levies due and that all fraud is stamped out.  I hope these issues will be tackled by the strengthened and developed CBF.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant to this section which relates to the levies in respect of the appropriate contribution from the industry to the board which are looking after their marketing interests. This section is to enable CBF to get the proper contribution and to have access to accounts and records to ensure that is done.  These penalties are included in case there is any distortion of figures.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely about our obligation to ensure that fraud at whatever level will be attacked as strongly as possible.  We are in good standing in the European Community and I am determined to ensure that we stay that way.  We do not have to present constant checks and counterchecks to the Commission of the European Community because they trust the integrity of the establishment.  Wherever I see people in the industry trying to engage in any fraudulent practices, I can assure the House that I and my colleagues in Government will use every means available to ensure it stops.</P>

There has not been any culpable delay in this matter, having regard to all the legislation we are putting through and the pressures on the Parliamentary Draftsman's office and on the precedures of the House.  I signalled to the draftsman that July was the date.  One extra month is not something that will break our hearts. We have proceeded very expeditiously. The loss of revenue is at most £100,000.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister is trying to clear the legislative hurdles as quickly as possible.  I dispute the figure of £100,000 at most.  I make it £125,000.  It reinforces the case we have been making that the Government should not take advantage of the fact that this Bill is in place to cut in any way the Exchequer subvention.  There is a £125,000 argument in support of that contention. I urge the Minister to ensure that the comments I and my colleagues have made in this regard are fully borne in mind.  He is on record as saying that he shares our concerns and we hope to see this borne out in the continuation of the existing Exchequer subvention.</P>

The final proposition I will put to the Deputy is that we commence now, in accordance with the order.  If, as we move along, more time becomes available, we will send word to the Whips that they can get together if they want to extend the ten minutes to 15.  I think that the end product will be as favourable as the Deputy would have wished, and we will not have gone against what is ordered. The Deputy must bear in mind that even though he would have proposed that we adjourn, there would have to be agreement of the House, and I do not feel disposed to seeking that.  With the Deputy having succeeded, on his own admission, in advancing the time by five minutes, I think he could agree now that we proceed, and I am quite sure that everything will work out as he wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann salutes the contribution of Nelson Mandela, Leader of the African National Congress to the cause of freedom in South Africa and sends greetings to him on his 70th birthday on 18 July 1988.  As an ageing man in ill-health &mdash; one who has spent more than one-third of his life in prison &mdash; he still remains an inspiration to all who seek a peaceful, united and democratic South Africa, freed from the evils of Apartheid.  Dáil Éireann therefore calls for the unconditional and immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners in South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased at the opportunity of putting both my own and the Government's views on record in relation to this motion.  A birthday should be an occasion for rejoicing and congratulations.  I fear that the 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela gives us little to rejoice in or to congratulate him on.  The achievement of his <Col N="2046" /> 70th year, after a hard life of which more than a third has been spent in prison, is indeed a matter for some celebration. But, while any such celebration by him must take place in prison, our congratulations will be muted indeed.  I know I speak for the House and for the people of Ireland when I extend both my greetings and my sympathies to Nelson Mandela and his family.  His struggle for the cause of freedom, a cause to which our own history has given us a particular attachment, has struck a chord in all our hearts.  The motion placed on the Order Paper here today by Deputies from all parties is a measure of his standing in the eyes of Dáil Éireann and of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have called for his immediate and unconditional release, along with that of his fellow political prisoners and I welcome the opportunity to renew that call in this debate to mark the occasion of his 70th birthday.  Such an action would be humanitarian and since Mr. Mandela is now an ageing man in infirm health, it would also indicate to the world that South Africa can still listen to the voice of the international community which regards the freeing of political prisoners as a first prerequisite for real dialogue in South Africa.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela was born in 1918 and trained as a lawyer.  He joined the African National Congress in 1944 devoting his life to the fight against Apartheid.  He was sentenced to five years imprisonment in 1962 for the part he played in organising a three-day nationwide strike, and while serving that sentence he was further charged, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment under South Africa's Sabotage and Suppression of Communism Acts.  Despite numerous calls on the South African Government to release him, he has now spent more than 25 years in prison.  During this time he has not become a forgotten man but has continued to grow in statute both within South Africa and internationally.</P>
    <P>Nelson Mandela has become one of the most enduring and inspiring symbols of <Col N="2047" /> the struggle against Apartheid.  His dedication to the struggle for freedom and equality in South Africa has been undiminished by the years he has spent in prison.  He has become a symbolic leader of the black South African people and the focus of black aspirations for a just, multi-racial and democratic society in South Africa.  His imprisonment represents, therefore, an ever-present reminder to the world of the continuing denial of basic rights to the majority in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The years which Nelson Mandela has spent in prison have seen the continued oppression of the majority in South Africa.  The structure of Apartheid remains firmly in place.  The South African Government continues to deny basic human and civil rights to the majority. Black South Africans are excluded from any effective participation in the political process and are condemned to a lifetime of political, social, economic and cultural isolation and deprivation because of the colour of their skin.  Since the imposition of the nationwide state of emergency in June 1986, we have seen a steadily rising level of violence and terror.  Hundreds of people, mainly blacks, have been killed either at the hands of the security forces or in internecine conflict.  Thousands more, mainly black, have been arrested and detained without charge or trial often for months on end.  These thousands of detainees include many hundreds of children and young people, some of whom have not yet been released to their families.</P>
    <P>These intensified repressive activities no longer appear on our television or cinema screens.  Unfortunately this does not mean that they have ceased, rather the blinds have been drawn.  The worldwide horror at the events of the last few years merely caused the South African Government to institute a strict censorship of media coverage to try to hide the truth about the country's dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>The latest threat to the beleaguered black community is the proposed introduction of the Promotion of Orderly <Col N="2048" /> Internal Politics Bill, which would empower the South African Authorities to block any foreign funding destined for groups of which they would not approve. The effect on those organisations and bodies working to try to improve the lot of the victims of Apartheid could be disastrous. This is another example of the reaction of the South African authorities to any attempts by concerned parties to mitigate the worst effects of Apartheid.  If we are to judge from these reactions, I fear that even the combined efforts of Governments and private groups throughout the world will find it very difficult to bring about Nelson Mandela's release.</P>
    <P>It is notable that the international community has placed great emphasis on the issue of freedom for Mr. Mandela and other political prisoners in recent years. Such a gesture from the South African Government is regarded as an essential step to show their willingness to engage in genuine national dialogue with representatives of all shades of opinion in South Africa.  The international community earnestly wishes to see the peaceful abolition of Apartheid and the establishment in its place of a democratic multiracial society transcending barriers of colour, politics and religion.  This, however, cannot be achieved while Nelson Mandela and other black leaders remain in prison or detained and organisations opposed to apartheid remain proscribed.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Communities, has long called for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, the lifting of the state of emergency, and the unbanning of the African National Congress, the Pan-Africanist Congress and other political parties as necessary first steps to institute the process of genuine national dialogue which is needed in South Africa. I now renew this call for the immediate and unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and urge the South African President, in whose hands the decision lies, to seize the opportunity of Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday to release him <Col N="2049" /> along with all other political prisoners.  By doing this the South African Government could show that a will for peaceful reconciliation exists on their part.  The move would be an important step towards establishing a basis for negotiations aimed at a democratic, non-racial and united South Africa.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are deeply concerned at the failure of the South African Government to institute reforms.  Sooner or later they will have to embark on fundamental reforms leading to abolition of the Apartheid system.  The sooner this new course is embarked upon, the more likely it is that the transition can be made in peace.  A decision to release Nelson Mandela would be an esential first move in this transition, which is now so crucially necessary to the people of South Africa and to the Southern African region as a whole.</P>
    <P>May I conclude with a heartfelt wish that this, his 70th birthday, will mark Nelson Mandela's transition from prison convict to free man and that he may then live to enjoy many years in liberty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, support unequivocally this motion in every single incidence.  We, likewise, are horrified that a man of the stature of Nelson Mandela should be imprisoned for the past 25 years.  We hope that on the occasion of his 70th birthday, which he celebrates on 18 July, that the South African Government will be moved by all the calls from the free world to free him.  To us he epitomises the spirit of black Africa.  We hope that the suffering he has endured on behalf of all the black people in South Africa will lead to a free South Africa.  We in Ireland can sympathise with Nelson Mandela and his people because for 700 years we bore the yoke of slavery.  We were colonised and victimised.  In the early twenties some of our leaders died in prison while others served long years in prison and it was they who kept the spirit of freedom alive.  We know the same applies to Nelson Mandela.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plea strikes a sympathetic cord in the hearts of all freedom-loving Irish <Col N="2050" /> people and I have no doubt everybody in this country would support this House in its request to President Botha to release Nelson Mandela.  The 25 long years which hw has spent in prison have not broken his spirit and, as I have said, he epitomises what black South Africa stands for.  Even if he were to spend another 25 years in prison, the struggle against Apartheid will continue and, as the Minister of State has said, will ultimately meet with success.  I believe within a shorter period than most people imagine that the scourge of Apartheid will be removed in South Africa forcibly if not peacefully. We hope that President Botha and his Government at this juncture will realise that history is against them, that they cannot hold on to power through maintaining the unjust system of Apartheid and that justice will prevail in the long run.</P>
    <P>We hope that all freedom-loving countries and all international organisations who, like us, are pressing for his release will be successful in their efforts.  We can recall the Sharpeville massacre and other horrors in South Africa and surely President Botha looking back on South Africa's troubled history must see that black people have suffered enough.  It would be a magnificent gesture on his part if he were to concede to this wish. Up to now all of our pleas have fallen on deaf ears but we hope the South African Government will not be able to withstand the plea being made by all freedom-loving peoples that this ailing man, who epitomises black resistance and who symbolises all that is good and noble in black people, will be released and will not have to live out his remaining years in prison. He has now reached his 70th birthday and his health is continuing to fail.  It would be a humanitarian gesture on the part of the South African Government if they were now to release him.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House fully support this plea and we urge the Minister of State to make known at every international forum of which we are a member, such as the United Nations, and the Council of Europe, that this motion has been adopted by this House.  The <Col N="2051" /> Minister of State should let it be known that we join with others in calling on the South African Government to free Nelson Mandela and to end once and for all this terrible scourge of Apartheid. Perhaps we should also include a plea to President Botha that he take mercy on those who are under the shadow of death and commute their sentences to life imprisonment or a short period in prison.</P>
    <P>By acceding to these two requests he would at least show that he is responsive to the pleas being made by the free world and it would lead to a build-up of goodwill towards him if he were to heed the pleas being so earnestly made by various groups.  It gives me great pleasure to join with the Minister of State in urging this evening that Nelson Mandela be set free and I hope that the Minister of State's actions will prove successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak on this motion let me make it clear that the Progressive Democrats support the motion before the House but it shows the ineptitude of the free world, after years of discussing South Africa and particularly the position of Nelson Mandela, that we again find ourselves in the position of calling for the release of Nelson Mandela while sending him best wishes on his 70th birthday.  This man epitomises the suffering which has been endured by most of the people of South Africa and it is important that we understand it is not alone Nelson Mandela we are speaking about this evening but also the people of South Africa.  I believe that the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela represents the imprisonment of the people of South Africa.  That fact must be borne in mind when people speak here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is there a real desire on the part of many governments to seriously tackle Apartheid in South Africa?  I do not accept that nothing can be done. Some sanctions have been imposed but all of the efforts which have been made to date have achieved very little.  The message should go out to white people in South Africa that the rest of the world will have no truck with them while they <Col N="2052" /> continue to support Apartheid, that they are as guilty as the judge who sentenced Nelson Mandela all those years ago and that they are equally guilty of keeping that man in prison.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should remind ourselves of the atrocities which were carried out during the Second World War by Nazi Germany.  Parallels can be drawn between what is taking place in South Africa today and what took place then.  I have often heard people say that events which took place during the Second World War should never be allowed to happen again but on whose terms is the question which I ask.  I believe that the treatment of people in South Africa which has a population of 30 million people is similar to the way in which many people were treated in Europe some 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is far too easy just to stand up in various parliaments to trot out the usual clichés and niceties but that is not sufficient and is in some way abhorrent.  I believe that action can be taken but it is not being taken because there are far too many vested interests involved.  Governments do not want to tackle Apartheid in South Africa because of the involvement of commerce and business but I believe at a time when Europe is facing up to so many changes, in the process becoming a united states of Europe, that one clear position be adopted and what should be at the top of the agenda in discussions between heads of state is how we can once and for all rid ourselves of Apartheid in South Africa.  Although it is helpful for individual countries to have their own sanctions, this is not a strong or forceful enough front to put up to South Africa.  In the European context, a clear and decisive view must be put forward unitedly from Europe with regard to South Africa.</P>
    <P>The case of the Sharpeville Six is again a symbol of what is happening in South Africa today.  There is there, a totally unjust regime by any normal standards of justice which operate anywhere in the western world.  The system of justice in South Africa does not even come near what we would believe to be a normal <Col N="2053" /> and fair system of justice.  I believe there is too much political influence on the courts in South Africa.  They are dictated to by the Government of South Africa and the independence of the judiciary in South Africa has to be seriously questioned. Are they just a mouthpiece for the Apartheid system and do they implement justice at the level wanted by the people who support Apartheid?</P>
    <P>In the weeks ahead, South Africa has an opportunity to show the rest of the world that it wants to come back into the international community and that there are at least some sensible and level headed people in that country who want South Africa to retake its place in the world.  I believe that the beginning of that process should be the release of Nelson Mandela and I call, as we all do, for the release of that man.  However, that should not be an end in itself.  It should be the very beginning of what the South African Government do in an effort to dismantle the Apartheid system in that country and to move as quickly as possible in giving all South Africans a vote in order to have a free democracy.  If the South Africans begin to make a move in this direction I believe the rest of the world will support them.  Let there be no doubt that they are isolated from the international community and the rest of the world and they will continue to be isolated until such time as they take the basic steps towards a system which any free society would be expected to operate in the world today.  I support this motion and I hope this message is brought home once again to the Government of South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have responded to an all-party request for this motion to be moved and to be resolved unanimously.  I am also anxious that the representatives of all the political parties in the Chamber get a chance to speak.  The Labour Party unequivocally and totally endorse the sentiments and the spirit behind the wording of this motion.  In focusing on the fact that it is the 70th birthday of Nelson Mandela, it is right that in so <Col N="2054" /> doing we are representing the views, as he does, of thousands, if not millions, of black South Africans who seek what we and many other people throughout the world take for granted and enjoy on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>There are very many repressive and repugnant regimes throughout the world but South Africa is unique in having written into the tablets of stone which go to make up the charter of this white supremist South African republic that level of racial segregation, that level of racial inequality and that level of racial injustice. It is what makes South Africa unique and it is what makes it repugnant to virtually all opinions represented in the political spectrum.  Therefore, it is essential that a single voice go out from this Chamber, representing all the political parties elected by the Irish people, that in this regard not only do we want Nelson Mandela made free on his 70th birthday but that in the symbolism of that gesture we want Apartheid in South Africa to be removed.</P>
      <P>There is a unique responsibility on the Government, who represent the Irish people, in this regard.  I call on the Fianna Fáil Government to revert to the radical tradition which was introduced by the previous Government in relation to the introduction of a unilateral ban and sanction. A small step was taken by the previous Administration in banning the importation of South African fruit and vegetables into this country.  I ask the Minister, in his reply or on an appropriate occasion, to extend that ban to South African coal and, indeed, not just South African coal, which comes directly from South Africa, but also the coal which is being rerouted through the Netherlands. Recent reports suggest that there has been a substantial increase in the amount of coal from the Netherlands coming into this country despite the fact that the coalmines in the Netherlands have not been operated for the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opposition within the Community to multilateral sanctions has effectively made it impossible for Community action to bring force to bear on the South African Government.  If we do not take action <Col N="2055" /> then the European moral community and the Western moral community, if I can use that phrase, will stand condemned in the eyes of the rest of the world because, like it or not, the white regime in South Africa has European origins and bears some resemblance to what we have overcome on the continent of Europe.  For that reason the Government have to confront, in the community, the British authorities and the German Government, within the process of EPC, on the effectiveness of economic sanctions.</P>
    <P>I believe the British Government are being hypocritical when Mrs. Thatcher repeatedly says that economic sanctions are not effective and that she does not believe in them.  The same Prime Minister demanded, if not commanded, the support of her European partners for economic sanctions against Argentina and the Community continues to apply sanctions in relation to development co-operation aid to Kampuchea and Vietnam. These economic sanctions have had, as the Minister will be aware from a recent visit by representatives from the democratic republic of Vietnam, a devastating effect.  There is a hypocrisy here which does not bear with the reality on the ground.  The British Government, when they saw fit, have used the instrument of sanctions, and continue to use the instrument of sanctions, on occasion against other countries.  If we in the West do not bring economic pressure to bear on South Africa then more violent forces will ultimately wreak havoc on that society and there will be a great number of innocent victims.  Not only are the people in South Africa in chains, so to speak, at present but the political instability which has been generated by the Apartheid system has disastrously affected the peripheral nations of Nambia, Mozambique and Angola.</P>
    <P>The pressure of time obliges me to conclude at this stage in deference to the other speakers in the House, but, in pledging the full support of the Labour Party for this resolution, I urge the Minister to renew the position of the Irish Government in relation to unilateral <Col N="2056" /> sanctions against the importation of South African coal, from whatever point of origin it may come, into this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken on board the proposal from the all-party group who initiated this motion.  However, I regret that some aspects of the motion tabled by the all-party group of Deputies have been deleted from the Government motion.  I do not wish to introduce any sense of disunity &mdash; The Workers' Party are supporting the Government motion &mdash; but it is unfortunate that the reference to Namibia was deleted from the motion.  It was also unfortunate that the reference to the ANC and the fact that Nelson Mandela is their leader, was deleted from the motion because, to some extent, its omission weakens the motion.  Nevertheless it is a unique move, certainly within Europe, for a parliament to call for the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners in South Africa.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that Apartheid cannot exist without the co-operation of western Governments.  It must also be recognised that Apartheid and the white government in South Africa would collapse in the morning if western European Governments and the United States withdrew their support for the white régime there.  I am not talking about political support because, as in our case, there is no question of there being any; but there is commercial support.  For example, we continue to import coal from South Africa, much by way of devious routes. Also we continue to export computers to South Africa which are used to maintain the Apartheid system, a system which could not be maintained in this modern age &mdash; in a country with a population of the order of 22 million blacks and another almost 8 million of mixed colour and Asians &mdash; without their aid.  Yet we continue to export computers there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome this motion I contend we must be serious about what we are doing in relation to South Africa.  We must take steps that may hurt ourselves initially but which will, in the long-term, be beneficial to tens of millions of people <Col N="2057" /> in South Africa who are ground down by an inhuman system of Apartheid, one described by the United Nations as a crime against humanity.  There is no doubt that we, as fellow human beings, must respond to the United Nations call to ensure that the regime in South Africa falls, or, alternatively, change their system and become democratic.</P>
    <P>If we do not take those practical, firm steps to indicate our dissatisfaction with that regime, then the passage of this motion will amount to nothing more than a fine, unique gesture.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is unfortunate that the reference to Namibia was deleted from the motion for the reason that, without Namibia being used as a funnel for supplies to South Africa, it would render the survival of the South African regime that much more difficult.  Namibia, in terms of its resources, is one of the richest countries worldwide but it has perhaps the poorest population.  It is equally important to demand that South Africa pull out of Namibia.  They have no right to be there; they are illegally occupying the country and, in view of the United Nations declaration, have no right to be there.  In fact the United Nations authorities are the legal authorities in Namibia. The regime which South Africa has in place in Namibia is no less inhumane than that operated in their own country. Therefore, in calling for the release of Nelson Mandela and other prisoners in South Africa, it is important that we demand that they also pull out of Namibia. Indeed any sanctions we introduce against South Africa should apply equally to Namibia.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of the importation of South African coal here, coal being one of their most important exports.  Significantly, something in the region of 60 per cent of the coal imported into the EC comes from South Africa.  Clearly there is an important task to be undertaken in banning the import of coal here &mdash; something we can do ourselves &mdash; and likewise into the EC, something we can urge our European partners to do through the various EC processes available.  The black miners of <Col N="2058" /> South Africa themselves have called for a boycott of coal imports.  The black miners there are subjected to appalling conditions, living in prison-like compounds, single sex hostels, comprised of largely immigrant labour who are not allowed to bring their families with them.  In addition, black miners receive something like one-fifth of the income of their white counterparts and an average of 600 black miners are killed annually in mining accidents in South Africa.  Clearly from the point of view of miners there is real need for a change in the regime in South Africa apart altogether from the political aspect of this issue.  The conditions in which those black miners live and work and the fact that our imports of South African coal help to maintain those conditions is appalling.  There is no reason Ireland should not unilaterally introduce a boycott on imports of coal from South Africa.  Indeed the National Union of Mine Workers in South Africa have called for such a boycott.  There is an urgent need for us to intensify our boycott of South Africa products.  We have implemented a restricted boycott of fruit from that country.  If we are serious about ending the appalling and inhuman system of Apartheid obtaining in South Africa and in Namibia &mdash; and the deplorable conditions obtaining there &mdash; we must take practical steps.  If our EC partners are not prepared to go along with us then we should give a lead &mdash; as we are doing here this evening &mdash; to the remainder of Europe by unilaterally banning the importation of coal and the export of computers to South Africa.</P>

That is the only hope that our message will resound and reverberate around the world, with other fora joining us in seeking the release of Nelson Mandela on his 70th birthday.  As the Minister said, a lifespan of three score years and ten should be a cause of celebration. Unfortunately, there is no celebration in this House this evening &mdash; but there will be a celebration in this country because the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement have organised a concert in Dublin on 17 July at which leading Irish singers and entertainers will be celebrating his 70th birthday.  There will be a twofold purpose.  We, as parliamentarians and public representatives, can make our voices heard and singers and entertainers will make their voices heard in a more melodious manner, but we are supporting the same cause.  I call upon the trade unions and other bodies to join with us in this twofold call.  Church bodies are also influential and there have been many notable churchmen, in Ireland and elsewhere, who have come out in favour of abolition of this terrible scourge of Apartheid.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - District Court Extradition procedures: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Seán Barrett on Tuesday, 21 June 1988:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to review extradition procedures in the District Courts and in particular, to consider legislation to <Col N="2060" /> transfer cases brought under the Acts from District Court to Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to review the provisions of the Extradition Act of 1965 and in particular, to consider whether in any proceedings under that Act, where the person arrested does not acquiesce in the making of such extradition order when brought before the District Court, the hearing of all matters relating to the making of such order should be before the High Court&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that I need all that time.  I opened last week by making the point that there are few issues that are so often misconstrued &mdash; and deliberately so &mdash; in this country of ours as the vexed issue of extradition.  Little did I know at that time how true those comments would prove to be.  Members can imagine, given my contribution on a number of items in this House, my sense of amazement at reading during the weekend, in a piece of unsolicited junk mail that fell through my letter box, <i>An Poblacht</i>, that I had said in another forum that not only was I in favour of extradition but would willingly and happily extradite all or any of the Birmingham Six should the matter arise.  Given my contributions here on the case of the freedom of those people, and the need for safeguards in our extradition laws, the printing of such a completely baseless mistruth illustrates the correctness of my opening remarks, the point being that this issue is one which is deliberately and consistently subjected to misleading comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the extradition issue is so frequently the subject of distortion by the <Col N="2061" /> forces of both extremes in the debate, by those who subscribe to the sort of rubbish trotted out in <i>An Poblacht</i> and by those who take the extreme Tory view that this is an island of at best, fellow travellers and at worst bloodthirsty extremists &mdash; a view which is evidently shared by a member of a Government that ran this country for a period in the seventies &mdash; I wonder at the timeliness of this debate. It has struck me that there are pros and cons in moving the issue to the Circuit Court and there is a case to be made, perhaps, for moving it to the High Court. Of the two, I would prefer the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.  I wonder if Deputy Barrett has quite unwittingly supported those outside the State who from time to time question our motivation.</P>
    <P>The point that joins us all together in the debate on this issue is that none of us shares a wish to see this part of this island, this jurisdiction, converted into a haven for murderers, terrorists and people who reject the great democratic principles on which our State is based.  We may in a sense be underscoring some of the criticism which is being made of our Judiciary, particularly injudicious criticisms that have been made by Members of the British House of Commons and in the UK yellow press.  It may be that we are unwittingly contributing a degree of credibility to those arguments.  That is not the intention &mdash; I am not suggesting that it is.  There is a danger, however, that that may be the outcome.</P>
    <P>In the law as it exists at present there is provision for a review of the situation and of the operation of the extradition procedures.  Whatever the strong arguments one way or the other, it strikes me that there may be a better time for us to review progress and the appropriateness of the procedures at the District Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no basis, and neither can the Labour Party, for a move to transfer the hearing of these extradition applications away from the District Court, either to the Circuit Court, as suggested by Deputy Barrett, or to the High Court, as suggested by Deputy Colley.  These cases are dealt with perfectly well and perfectly adequately in the District Court; they have been for many years.  The district justices are perfectly capable of handling these cases in a proper and efficient manner.  They are trained and I hold them in the highest regard.  The reasons that brought about this situation are not at all such as would warrant the introduction of this motion, or the passing of it by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue on extradition under the 1965 Act, as amended, is relatively simple.  It has been pointed out in the High Court and in the Supreme Court that there are two issues to be determined by the district justice or whatever court may have seisin of the case: first, that the warrant is valid and in order; and second, that the person named in the warrant is the person who now stands before the court.  There is no matter of major legal complexity involved there.  It may be that some people, when they do not get the right result from a court, seek to change the court.  It is strange, when one thinks of the case, that I referred to when we were debating the matter of a court case, where Mr. Justice Gannon of the High Court discharged an extradition warrant which had been granted by the District Court.  Nothing is sought to be done about the decision of Mr. Justice Gannon.  Apparently that is perfectly all right.  The question of identification of a person who stands before the court as being the person named in the warrant is a matter of the law of evidence.  Any judge, whether a district justice or a Circuit Court or High Court judge, will apply <Col N="2063" /> the law of evidence as it is to the case. Any British judge in a Crown Court or a Magistrate's Court would go about the matter in precisely the same way.</P>
    <P>It is up to us, to the Oireachtas, to set whatever standards of evidential proof of identification we regard as adequate or proper.  It is a matter for us to decide what degree of evidence of identification we want the courts to apply.  If we set that marker and those guidelines down for the courts, the district justices will loyally apply the law, as they do in all these cases.</P>
    <P>The standard which has been set in identification in these cases, set and established now by Mr. Justice Gannon's decision, is that identification is required from the British side to confirm that the person who stands before the court is the person that they want.  That is a standard of evidence.  People may think that it is too high a standard of evidence and perhaps it is; I do not know.  That is a matter to be debated here and decided upon.  An alternative possible standard of evidence would be to say that it will be sufficient if a senior Irish Garda officer says that, in his opinion, this is the person named on the warrant from his knowledge or that an official from the Attorney General's office would say so.  That could be imposed by law as the standard of evidence which would be sufficient.  If that is what we want, let us do it.  If we are to decide that the opinion of a Garda officer on the identification question is to be acceptable, why does the Minister, with the consent of the House, which I am sure he would get, not bring in a short amending Bill to deal with the matter of evidence?  The problem is one of the law of evidence and the standard of proof which is required in a matter of identification. That is the real issue here and the idea that one would change anything by moving the venue to the High Court makes no sense.  Any judge will apply the law as he finds it and any decision of a district justice at present is subject to review by the High Court.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Attorney General took the decision to appeal the McVeigh <Col N="2064" /> case by way of case stated to the High Court.  That should not have been done because the district justice in the McVeigh case gave the correct decision in accordance with the law.  Perhaps some people do not like it: that is too bad, but judges very often give decisions which people do not like.  However, you do not respond by saying that the matter should be taken out of the realm of the District Court.  It casts an appalling reflection on the District Court and on the district justices who practise there which is totally unwarranted and doubly outrageous because district justices may not respond to the implications of the motion before the House, which is that District Courts and district justices are not competent to apply the law.  I reject that suggestion because they are capable and well qualified&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are perfectly qualified to do so and if law reports are required, cases can and frequently are reported.  Many of the District Court cases are reported in the journals and there is no rule which says that you cannot provide for written judgments in District Court cases.</P>

      <P>Is that a reason for taking the matter out of the venue of the District Court?  If that is the only problem, the matter need not be transferred to the High Court, just supply the reports to the district justices.  However, it seems that the district justices are not the only people who are not supplied with them. Maybe the Attorney General is not being supplied with material because it appears he did not know about Mr. Justice Gannon's decision in a High Court case.  If the implication is that High Court <Col N="2065" /> decisions are supplied and District Courts decisions are not, the Gannon decision gives the lie to that.</P>
      <P>This motion approaches the problem from the wrong angle.  The problem is one of evidence and, for some strange reason which I do not understand, we do not want to face up to it.  Maybe we want a very high standard of identification on this issue, I do not know but if it is the case we should say so.  Let us call a spade a spade and be above board.</P>
      <P>If the Minister realistically wants to tackle and simplify the law of evidence dealing with this issue, the Labour Party will facilitate him.  If he introduces a Bill it could go through the Dáil and Seanad in one day because it would be a very simple one.  If he comes forward with a lesser standard of evidence of identification as being adequate we will assist him in every possible way.  There will be no obstruction and no difficulty.  At present the whole system is not working, which is unsatisfactory.  Recently at Question Time, the Minister for Justice said that there had been no extradition since the 1987 Act was passed.  That is not acceptable.</P>

      <P>Quite clearly, the Act was not working when applications were made and, for one reason or another, nobody has been extradited.  The system is not working.  Why argue about what is obvious to anyone?  The issue is embroiled in litigation in the District Court and High Court.  Deputy Barrett's solution is not the correct one but at least he attempted to solve the problem. However, his solution is born of frustration and it will not make any difference to the efficiency of the system whether it is in the High Court or the Circuit Court. Where will the great merit be in putting it <Col N="2066" /> in the High Court?  After all, Mr. Justice Gannon discharged the warrant in the Cork case.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be repetitive but the District Court is the proper venue for extradition warrants to be dealt with. There is no major complexity involved and to say that district justices are not competent to deal with it casts a reflection on all the work they do.  The way to deal with the matter is to set the standard of evidence by law and make ir clear so that there will be no difficulty for the District Court in all cases or on appeal to the Circuit Court and the High Court.  Maybe there should be an appeals procedure to the Circuit Court rather that by way of case stated.  Whatever court it come to, standards ought to be laid down and a short Bill on the evidential point is required to meet the problem.  For these reasons, we will be opposing the motion and the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commence, a Cheann Comhairle, by saying that I am quite prepared to take on board what you said about not commenting on any specific extradition case that is before the courts at present.</P>
      <P>Extradition in one form or another has been with us for over 100 years.  Arising out of the Quinn case in the Supreme Court in the sixties, the Extradition Bill, 1965, was introduced by the Taoiseach who was Minister for Justice at the time. Part III of that Bill, which subsequently became the 1965 Act, referred specifically to extradition arrangements between this country and Britain and Northern Ireland.  That part of the Act continued to some extent the special relationship which had existed previously whereby warrants from one jurisdiction are backed in the other.</P>
      <P>By and large, it can be argued that the Act has operated well since it was introduced.  The vast majority of extradition cases which come before our courts are dealt with in such a manner that ensures that extradition takes place where appropriate.  The same is true of extradition from Britain to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> For example, it is relevant to say here that Deputies and the public in general should realise the beneficial effects to both countries of extradition.  For instance, the number of perpetrators of serious crimes involving robbery, drugs, fraud and even murder who have fled this jurisdiction to Britain hoping to lose themselves in the large population there and who have subsequently been returned for trial here is quite large.  These are the routine extradition cases and, as I said earlier, such extradition arrangements work well.</P>
    <P>I would like to echo some of the sentiments expressed here both last week and tonight about some foreign comments on our courts and extradition arrangements, particularly in some sections of the British press.  There is no shortage of amateur lawyers who claim a knowledge and expertise of extradition arrangements.  It would be fair to say that there has been a great amount of ill-informed comment written about the subject over the past year of two.  Such comments do nothing to encourage the climate of co-operation which should exist between civilized countries in combating international terrorism.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specifics of the motion by Deputy Barrett of Fine Gael and the amendment by Deputy Colley of the Progressive Democrats, I would point out to the House that the Government are already committed to reviewing our extradition procedures and are quite prepared and willing to consider these proposals in the context of that review.</P>
    <P>Deputies should also recall that section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act 1987 provides that the Government shall make a report to each House of the Oireachtas in each year, beginning in 1989, on the operation of the Part III of the Extradition Act 1965.  That section provides a mechanism for a review of the extradition arrangements we operate with Britain and Northern Ireland.  That review must be undertaken before the end of the current year in order to enable the Government to fulfill their statutory duty to submit the report to each House <Col N="2068" /> of the Oireachtas &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; after 1 January 1989 in accordance with the terms of the section.</P>
    <P>The provision which was made in the 1987 Amendment Act for a review of the operation of Part III stemmed from the Government's desire to ensure that the new arrangements provided for under the Act were carefully monitored by the authorities here.  That monitoring is being undertaken with a view to ensuring that extradition continues to operate in a fair and proper way.  That desire was evident in the Taoiseach's speech in introducing the Extradition (Amendment) Bill in the Dáil on 27 November last year when he stated at column 2129 in the Official Report:</P>
    <P>...it is our intention to institute a new regime of monitoring and observation, and to give that process a statutory backing.  The legislation will provide that in future the Attorney General will have a statutory obligation to prepare and submit to the Government an annual report on the operation of extradition arrangements and the cases that have taken place under the arrangements in the previous twelve months.</P>
    <P>That review was originally to be confined to the operation of sections 44A and 44B &mdash; those new sections empowering the Attorney General to direct that a warrant would not be endorsed unless satisfied of certain matters &mdash; and to take place in the context of a report to be submitted by the Attorney General to the Government.  The extent and nature of the review was subsequently widened as a result of a Report Stage amendment to embrace a review of the operation of the entire arrangements under Part III of the Act and to provide for the report to be made by the Government to each House of the Oireachtas rather than by the Attorney General to the Government. Those changes represented the Government's response to Opposition amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil which I accepted in principle as being in keeping with the Taoiseach's earlier undertakings in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> The review that is to take place later this year will therefore consider our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland in their entirety.  It has also been the Government's intention from the start that the review would identify any shortcomings that may exist. In this connection I would refer Deputies once more to the Taoiseach's opening statement on Second Stage of the Extradition (Amendment) Bill 1987 where, in the context of the new arrangements being provided for in that Act, he stated at column 1987 of the Official Report on 27 November 1987:</P>
    <P>I also wish to make it clear that should it emerge after a period of twelve months that these arrangements are not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition is fully justified can evade the law, the Government will bring forward revised proposals to deal with such a situation.</P>
    <P>Neither the terms of the motion nor the amendment proposed to it have reference to the provisions of the 1987 Amendment Act.  The Government's commitment, however, to introduce amending legislation should that prove necessary, is not limited to the procedures introduced by the 1987 Act but extends to all aspects of our extradition arrangements.  I assure the House that should the review indicate the need for amending legislation, the Government will bring forward the necessary Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the terms of the motion and the amendment, the Government are certainly willing to consider these suggestions. It should be borne in mind, however, that the implementation of the suggestion to switch extradition applications to either the Circuit Court or the High Court would have implications for the workloads and the staffing of the courts and also, of course, have serious implications for the persons who are the subject of extradition applications which must be carefully assessed.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies on the Opposition benches suggested a two-tier system whereby persons who would acquiesce to their own extradition applications could <Col N="2070" /> be dealt with in the District Court and only those cases where the extradition application would be opposed would be referred to the High Court.  I cannot at this stage give a considered reaction to that suggestion.  It may have constitutional implications.  I am not sure that it is feasible to have one case dealt with in the District Court and to switch another identical case to the High Court merely because the person who is the subject of the proceedings is taking a different attitude to the application.  This is something which would have to be considered by the Government, acting on the advice of the Attorney General, but I can give the House an undertaking that the suggestions made in the course of the debate will be fully considered by the Government.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is no subject of a political nature to which we have addressed our minds over the last number of years which is more misrepresented and which gives rise to greater confusion than extradition.  There is an impression created both in this country and in others that there had been no extradition between this jurisdiction and <Col N="2071" /> the UK until the introduction of the 1987 Act.  That view is widespread even among sensible people who are citizens of this country.  It is certainly widespread in Great Britain and so widespread in Northern Ireland that an impression has been created that the Republic of Ireland is an extended safe haven for terrorists who wander freely through our jurisdiction. It is also a widespread perception there that there is no redress in the courts and no possibility of extraditing terrorists. It is also widely believed in Northern Ireland that the attempts of the previous Government to put extradition arrangements in place, in their opinion for the first time, were frustrated by the Government who are now in power.  This is to completely misunderstand the situation. It is also a misunderstanding which is deliberate on the part of many people, and many of the people who propound these notions of extradition are in a position to know that the views they express are incorrect.</P>
      <P>There has been movement of people accused of crime between this jurisdiction and many parts of Great Britain for a long time.  To my knowledge there has never been a national police force in Great Britain and because of the structure of the police force, organised into county police forces, the moving of a person accused of a crime from one county to another was always an issue. This was done by backing of warrants.  If the chief constable in one English county wanted a person who was in another county he sent a warrant and that warrant was backed by the other county police force.  That was the situation here prior to 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal Irish Constabulary police force for this country was, in effect, a county police force from the British point of view and warrants which were sent by police forces on the mainland were backed here and suspects were produced simply by the backing of warrants, without recourse to the courts.  This sort of arrangement lasted subsequent to the foundation of the State.  The arrangements for extradition between ourselves <Col N="2072" /> and Great Britain were not extradition arrangements at all.  They were simply a continuation of the backing of warrants procedures that predated 1922.  After the warrant was issued in Warwickshire and it arrived at Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park it was sent to the appropriate district here and the warrant was backed but there was no formal extradition proceedings.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out this informal arrangement came unstuck with a particular case in the sixties.  The present Taoiseach introduced the formal extradition arrangements with Great Britain as part of the Extradition Act, 1965.  I understand it was the present Tánaiste who put it through the House because an election intervened between the publication and the implementation of the Bill.  Speaking from memory I think both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were involved and eventually it was introduced by the Tánaiste rather than the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In those arrangements which were formalised, the tradition of making an exemption of politically related crime or politically related offences was continued. This was reasonable enough.  The tradition in liberal democratic countries in the 19th and 20th centuries was that one did not send political activists back to dictatorial regimes.  If someone was subject to a dictatorial regime in continental Europe and got as far as Great Britain or Ireland, in effect they were political activists who would be at risk of persecution if returned to a particular regime and one did not do it.  The political exception for extradition &mdash; or the backing of warrants in our case &mdash; was always maintained up to 1965 and was formalised in the 1965 arrangement.  There was nothing unusual about it.</P>
    <P>Unlike what certain spokespersons both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland say, this was not treating Great Britain as the least favoured nation.  This was quite normal around the world and remained normal up to the seventies. Then the Irish Judiciary moved in the same direction as judiciaries all over Europe and in the US and instead of <Col N="2073" /> looking at the particular motivation of an act they moved to look at the act itself. This is the big change which has taken place in the courts.  If one was parading for a particular cause in 1970 and one's extradition was sought, the court would look at the motivation behind the march: &ldquo;Why were you putting up the poster, why were you marching on the street, why were you handing out leaflets&rdquo;?  If the answer was that you were doing these things because you were supporting political activity then you could not be extradited. The courts looked exclusively at the motivation behind the political activity but they did not look at the nature of the political act.</P>
    <P>In a number of key cases in the late seventies and early eighties our courts decided that instead of looking at what motivated people involved in political activity they would look at the nature of the act.  In common with judges all over Europe, they decided that certain actions were so outrageous, were so dehumanising and were so callous that one could not deem certain activity as political in democratic countries.  It was by looking at the nature of the act rather than what motivated somebody that the changes took place.  In these cases which are being quoted widely here, people were extradited even though the defence on their behalf would have suggested that the activity in which they were involved was political.</P>
    <P>It was difficult to know from the initial cases how wide the new interpretation of the law would be.  It was difficult to decide whether the umbrella which sheltered those people involved in acts which were deemed to be political from extradition was removed completely.  What became clear very quickly was that certain terrorist activities involving the use of guns and explosives and murder &mdash; no matter what the cause &mdash; would no longer be deemed political in our courts.  Instead of looking at the motivation of the act, the nature of the act was looked at and consequently, the courts extradited.</P>
    <P>I think this House treated the courts rather badly for a long time because they left them to interpret the law and to keep <Col N="2074" /> in parallel with European jurisprudence but they did not give them the protection of amending legislation.  There was a responsibility on this House to do so and it took until 1986 to do that.  In effect, what happened with the Extradition Act, 1986, which became the 1987 Act, was that the kind of decisions which were made by the Supreme Court were enshrined in law for the first time.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, as well as the courts, now express the view and define the law to indicate that we consider that there are certain terrorist activities which cannot deem to be political and, consequently, will not get the protection of this jurisdiction because the actions are so heinous that they will not get any protection from our jurisdiction or from our courts.</P>
    <P>I think it was time we moved in that direction and by so moving we were in a position to sign the European Convention on Terrorism.  It was not before time.  I regret we had such difficulty in putting that legislation through this House.  I regret that eventually we got it through only on the basis of a bad compromise which deferred the implementation of the Act for 12 months. I regret there was change of Government in the intervening period which made the implementation of that Act far more difficult last December than it did the previous December.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the opposition of the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party to that Extradition Act represented their considered views. There is no doubt in my mind that the Taoiseach and the Government had no intention of implementing the Extradition Act, 1987, from 1 December of last year.  I have a clear memory of Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Fianna Fáil Ministers preparing the ground for that switch in public opinion during last autumn.  I recall hearing Ministers in the first and second official languages indicating clearly that the Government would not go ahead with the Extradition Act, 1987, and would not make it effective from 1 December 1987.  I remember clearly Deputy Blaney's claims that he had a <Col N="2075" /> commitment from the Taoiseach to allow the Extradition Act wither away.  I believe he had that commitment and that that was the intention.  Had it not been for Enniskillen, the Taoiseach would not have changed his stance once more and attempted then to pacify his backbenchers with the safeguard legislation on which we had such debate in the autumn session.</P>
    <P>The mood created by Fianna Fáil and by the Government in that period last autumn gave rise to great problems.  They created an anti-extradition mood among their own backbenchers and among their own supporters throughout the country and that has spread into the general public and has added and given rise to enormous confusion.  I suggest that that confusion is being represented in the kind of decisions which have given rise to this debate.  There is a responsibility on the Government to ensure that the new arrangements work.  It is not good enough to come into the House and say that while no extradition has taken place since the implementation of the Government's Act that no extradition has been prevented. It seems to me that no extradition will take place for the next 18 months or two years.  No matter which court starts the process, the first case, and maybe the second and third, will go all the way up to the Supreme Court and as all the appeal procedures are invoked I do not think we will see an extradition from this jurisdiction for a terrorist offence within the next 18 months or two years.</P>
    <P>I must say &mdash; and I exempt the Minister for Justice from this because I know he shares many of the views we are expressing here &mdash; there are people in his party who are delighted there will be no extradition made effective for the next 18 months or two years.  There is a deep suspicion of what motivated the Government when they brought in the amending legislation last December and when they spread and sowed confusion about extradition throughout the country.  We must remember this was done against a background of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, various programmes on <Col N="2076" /> television and the various articles in newspapers which cast doubt on the fairness of the British courts to Irish citizens who were brought before them.</P>
    <P>To put it at its minimum, the Government did nothing to ease the fears of the ordinary citizens of this country in that respect.  The anti-extradition stream of opinion in the population was channelled into the anti-British stream arising from these decisions and the two have been running fairly strongly ever since and there is no doubt in my mind that they are influencing attitudes to extradition. There is a responsibility on the Government when this review the Minister referred to in his speech tonight comes up to make sure that at long last things are put on a proper basis and unless and until serious questions arise extradition runs smoothly.  It was never intended that it would be the complicated affair it seems to be now.  It seems to us on this side of the House that as long as it remains in the District Court where worthy district justices doing their job are faced with a whole gallery of legal experts coming down from Dublin and descending upon them with all their reputation, expertise, wigs and gowns, we will not get it to run smoothly again.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago I would have said there was no problem in having the District Court decide this issue in the first instance and if there was an appeal procedure to be invoked, let it be invoked. I have serious doubts about it now, not because of the nature of the District Court or because of the district justices who man that court, but because of the atmosphere that has been created over there quite deliberately when the Taoiseach intended to undermine the 1987 Extradition Act and when his fullest intention, in my opinion, was to bring in amending legislation to ensure that it did not become effective on 1 December last. It is quite clear to me and many Members of this House that the legislation he brought in was really second-thought legislation, that the safeguards introduced were merely a compromise to satisfy the ire of backbenchers who had been stimulated within the party to <Col N="2077" /> oppose extradition.  While Cabinet Ministers may be able to switch off their emotions and turn their feelings around in a very short space, it is more difficult to calm down backbenchers once you have wound them up in the first instance and set them loose on the cumann circuit through the three months of autumn.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say, as the Minister said in his speech, that we have our difficulties but it is coming right.  It is not coming right.  Before we moved to provide the protection and guidance necessary for the Judiciary by writing what we meant into the law, it was going better. It was going better when we shirked our responsibility and it was solely a matter for the courts.  Now, when the Oireachtas has decided what should happen, because the signals from the Government have been so confused, there is confusion in the streets and in the courts and people do not know where they stand.  For the first time there is truth in the charge that it is not possible to extradite people from this jurisdiction if they are accused of terrorist offences.  There is beginning to be truth in that charge for the first time in the last seven or eight years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are issues other than the movement to the Circuit Court which arise here and are being discussed in the context of this motion.  Deputy Barrett is to be complimented on giving the House the opportunity to address those issues.  He has not put forward his views on the Circuit Court in a dogmatic fashion.  I heard him introducing the topic and he wanted to hear the views of everybody else.  There is a responsibility on us to ensure that extradition works, that our extradition laws are transparent and effective and not devices to spancel either the courts or the administration, to ensure that people who are guilty of the most heinous crimes are kept in this jurisdiction.  That is not the purpose of what we have all been at, but it seems that the kind of commitment given by the Taoiseach to Deputy Blaney <Col N="2078" /> that the 1987 Extradition Act would wither away is beginning to take on a certain slant in this House and many of us are beginning to have serious doubts about the motivation of the Taoiseach on extradition.  I would like the Minister, if he gets the opportunity, at the very end to comment again to tell us when he expects in the normal course of events that the first extradition case under the 1987 Act will be processed through our courts and when he expects the first person to be extradited will be in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  It seems to me that his Administration could be out of Government for quite some time before that has gone through the courts.  I pose the question: is this deliberate?  Is this the intention?  Was the intention to entangle the extradition procedure in technicalities so that it got nowhere?</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor argues very strongly that moving the consideration in the first instance to the Circuit Court will achieve very little.  That may be so, but anything which shortens the procedure, anything which works to surmount some of the delays which are now built into the system is worth looking at.  I support Deputy Barrett's suggestion, but I think there is also great merit in the suggestion made by Deputy Colley as I understand it.  The Minister has said he will look at this and I welcome that commitment.  There may be constitutional difficulties, as he says, in treating two similar cases in two different manners.  If somebody acquiesces to extradition it is disposed of in the District Court but if the person does not acquiesce it goes to the High Court.  I do not think there is a problem with that.  If one consents then the District Court can deal with the problem and if one does not consent, without looking at any of the merits or anything else, it goes straight to the High Court on appeal.  That is probably more effective than the present arrangement.  If there are serious rooted principle objections to what Deputy Barrett is saying, that is a very good option also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last point I make tonight is that the present arrangements under the 1987 <Col N="2079" /> Act as amended are not satisfactory. Nobody has been extradited.  I take the Minister's point that nobody has been prevented by acts of the Attorney General from being extradited either, but nobody has been extradited.  Worse than that, those of us who have any awareness of the legal system can see now it is unlikely anyone would be extradited for 18 months or two years.  I do not think that was the intention of this House when we put the amendment to the 1987 Act through this House last December, and I will be surprised if this House does not express that view very strongly when the Act is reviewed in 12 months' time.  It points again to the wisdom of Deputy Barrett that he moved that amendment last year so that after 12 months we could evaluate the effectiveness of the Act.  If we were to evaluate it tonight we would say it has been very effective in frustrating extradition but certainly has done nothing to facilitate it.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Noonan and to the Minister for their aid and for the opportunity to comment briefly on this issue.  I find it a remarkable turn of events that tonight we have so much time and opportunity to discuss the issue of extradition and issues relating to recent problems which appear to have arisen in the administration of the law, when tomorrow the House is being asked to take two motions without debate.  We are being asked on the Order of Business tomorrow to agree, without debate, to the terms of an agreement for extradition to Australia.  It may be late in the day because Mr. Trimbole is long gone and very few people know exactly where he is.  Nonetheless, it is important that we have an extradition agreement with that country.  However, it is equally important that the House knows the terms of that agreement and we should know what facilities will be made available should anyone be sought in Australia for offences alleged to have been committed there.  I have not heard a voice outside this House which is so vociferous about what might happen to a person extradited to Great Britain or Northern Ireland to face trial, saying anything about the rights of <i>prima facie</i> case of sufficient inquiry or whatever else might arise should anyone be sought in Australia.</P>
      <P>Even more interesting, tomorrow there is a very curious motion which, for the life of me, I cannot understand.  It says:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the European Convention on Extradition done at Paris on 13th December, 1957, as laid before the House on 27th June, 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the debates on amending <Col N="2081" /> legislation during the past year, I have always understood that Ireland has long been a party to the European Convention on Extradition, 1957.  When The Workers' Party advanced the cause of <i>prima facie</i> case as an integral prerequisite and the only effective means of addressing people's concerns as to why a person was sought on extradition abroad, we were told it would not be in keeping with our agreement on extradition of 1957 and that it would, of time and necessity, require this country to withdraw from that agreement if that idea was pushed in the House.  It appears from tomorrow's Order of Business that we are not a full party to that agreement and tomorrow we are being asked to take that Convention and accept it into domestic law without one word being spoken in this House.  I find that remarkable.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to commend Deputy Barrett for putting forward this motion if for no other reason than it gives me the opportunity to point out what I believe is a ridiculous situation which does little, if anything, to assist the public to appreciate what is going on in this House.  The motion is welcome because it affords us the opportunity to highlight and discuss some of the recent perceived shortcomings in the operation of extradition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan put the issue correctly when he said there is nothing wrong with the law.  The law is there, but it has been developed in an unsatisfactory way by the courts &mdash; almost abandoned by the Legislature &mdash; who were almost forced to legislate for us by bringing into domestic law by judicial pronouncements the terms of the European Convention Against Terrorism, with the Legislature, in time, coming to grips with that international agreement.  As I understand it, the law is satisfactory although it is achieved by a not too satisfactory mechanism. The problem rests with the political uncertainty, particularly that of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government. The weakness they have shown in the face of clear political demand culminated in the second amendment of the 1987 Act and did more harm to the law with regard <Col N="2082" /> to extradition than any other legislation. I am talking about the implementation of what we have described many times as a hybrid notion in extradition law, that is, the process of inquiry and collaboration between the Attorneys General of the two Administrations and the search for the notion of a sufficient case laid on some sort of documentary evidence.</P>
    <P>We believe that had there been consistency and strength of principle on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party in standing up to the campaign of Sinn Féin and of their allies and sympathisers in the Fianna Fáil Party, we would not have all this confusion or the introduction of hybrid notions into the law, nor would we have had the period of interregnum, or break, in the smooth administration which has existed between the two jurisdictions with regard to extradition.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made again that extradition has been there long before the 1978 legislation.  It has been a standard feature of the administration of justice in this country and in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It has run smoothly over the years and has worked effectively, and will continue to do so.  Unfortunately, the opportunity given by Fianna Fáil to the anti-extradition committee, the front organisation of Sinn Féin on this issue has been most regrettable and the break in the smooth operation by the introduction of hybrid notions has done more damage than anything else to the smooth running of the law.</P>
    <P>This motion seeks to address that fundamental problem by suggesting that the shortcomings and the difficulties lie with the District Court and the administration of justice in those courts.  We reject that for two reasons.  In regard to recent decisions, we have stated that the district justice made the correct decision on the evidence available to him.  This matter is subject to appeal and I will not go into it further.  We made that point previously and it must be restated here.  The district justice is not to be blamed.  The District Court is not to be blamed for the hiccups that exist.  The law is satisfactory and <Col N="2083" /> clearcut.  The requirement for identification, and proper and adequate identification is the fundamental first question posed to any court with regard to an extradition application.  We must ensure that the British authorities can prove that the person sitting in the dock is the person they want.  Identification should not be dependent on some prison officer from Portlaoise or Northern Ireland who says he knows Mr. McVeigh well and, yes, his name is Patrick McVeigh&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I slipped. Time is valuable and I appreciate what you are saying.  I should not have drifted. The court must be sure that the person sitting in the dock is the person named. It is not satisfactory to make the argument that there was a secondary mechanism. The rules are there, the evidence must be produced and the case can then proceed.  My argument is that we should be expanding the District Court because it is the tribunal which is most democratic, easily accessible, local and susceptible to public views and opinions.  It is a court which must be enhanced with more investment and more of them should be established rather than closed, as I understand the Government proposal. In addition, District Court officers who are in a position to serve the public who seek access to these courts, must be more accessible.  That is our approach. On the one hand, we do not seek to draw criticism on the court but to enhance it and improve its conditions and facilities; on the other hand, if more time and resources are put into the mechanisms at bureaucratic level, I do not think we will have any further problems in dealing with the question of extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extradition process must be allowed stand, as it has in the past, as a typical, normal judicial practice.  It does not require new amending legislation. We have tinkered enough with it.  Let it <Col N="2084" /> settle and get the administrative processes working properly and I do not think we will then have the difficulties which have bedevilled the system recently.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  Most of them endeavoured to be constructive but some, as usual, endeavoured to play politics with a very serious issue.  I put forward a motion which deals with a very serious matter and worded it in such a way as to allow for suggestions to come forward.  I was not dogmatic in my approach.  I was extremely annoyed on the first evening of the debate that the Government did not see fit to send in a Minister or a Minister of State to reply to me.  I accept that the Minister for Justice had to be away, but I felt it was an insult to me and to this House that Deputy Ahern, a backbencher, was lobbed in to play politics with what I regard as a serious issue.  I have to say that his contribution was contemptible in the extreme.  He continually misquoted me.  If he had gone to the trouble of reading my speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am replying to the debate.  Despite my attempt to outline various reasons for transferring the initial hearing of an extradition case from the District Court to the Circuit Court and my explaining in great detail that we were not casting any aspersions on the integrity or the right of a district justice to take a decision as he or she sees fit and that we were not criticising any decision taken <Col N="2085" /> by a district justice, some people have claimed that Fine Gael are having a go at district justices.  We heard it from Deputy Taylor tonight.</P>
      <P>Anybody who fools himself into believing that extradition is working must be going around with his eyes and ears closed.  Deputy Swift stated in his contribution that he would rather be before a district justice than the entire House of Lords.  I wonder if these responsible public representatives realise the effect of such irresponsible statements on the tens of thousands of young Irish people who have been forced to emigrate to find work in the United Kingdom and on the millions of Irish people who have settled there in past years.  Do they realise the antagonism being generated among British people, from the taxi driver to the magistrate, against Irish people because of this continual harping by irresponsible politicians on this side of the Irish Sea and on the other side of it about the administration of justice?  I do not accept that the courts in Britain are continually unfair to Irish people, nor do I accept that the courts here make decisions which are anti-British or that politicians are taking decisions because they are anti-British. I do not accept any of that rubbish. I warn against this irresponsible talk which is affecting the lives of ordinary Irish people living in Great Britain, earning a living and raising a family there and meeting their neighbours on a daily basis. Their lives are becoming intolerable because of this irresponsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsense for people to tell me that extradition is working well since the introduction of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Like Deputy Noonan, I must exclude the Minister for Justice from this.  Actions speak louder than words.  He has held that office since 1977, except for the period 1982 to 1987, and he has realised the damage this is doing. Unfortunately within his own party there is a different group who forced him and the Taoiseach to bring in legislation in December 1987 which was completely unwarranted.  There were in place at that time administrative arrangements <Col N="2086" /> between the British and Irish Governments which were working very well. There was no evidence whatsoever that these administrative arrangements had broken down.  There was no animosity between the law officers of the United Kingdom and the law officers of this country.  There was no shred of evidence of a need for this Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, which was forced on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice because of the wild men on the backbenches of Fianna Fáil.  Let us not fool ourselves.  They come out every so often to wave the green, white and orange flag but they are doing irreparable damage to this country and to the relationship we must have with our nearest neighbours. They are also doing irreparable damage to the Irish men and women in London, Birmingham, Manchester and elsewhere in Britain.  I appeal to people to be extremely careful in what they say about the administration of justice in Great Britain.  They are forgetting the millions of Irish people who are living there.</P>
    <P>If we have complaints, we have the Anglo-Irish Agreement, diplomatic relations and Ministers who meet their counterparts through the EC on a regular basis.  We have contacts which we can make to get things changed and we can make representations properly to see that Irish people get a fair crack of the whip. All these avenues are open to us and we should use them rather than bring in legislation to destroy the existing administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>I do not make any excuses for wanting to get out of this country people who committed crimes, whether in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain, of a nature that any civilised society would be ashamed of.  I make no apologies whatsoever about it.  Anybody who plants a bomb which kills five British soldiers after a &ldquo;fun run&rdquo; or kills ordinary men and women in Enniskillen or plants a bomb on a school bus is not civilised.  Such people do not deserve the protection of democracy.  People who tell me that we should fuddy duddy about whether these people should be extradited have a different attitude to mine.  If somebody planted <Col N="2087" /> a bomb in the middle of Dublin which blew off my daughter's legs and then skipped across the Irish Sea to Birmingham or Manchester or across the Border to Enniskillen, I would be as irate as are many people in Northern Ireland and Britain if that person was walking the streets and could not be brought back to face justice due to some technicality. If somebody raped my daughter and skipped across to Hull or Shrewsbury or some place I would be very irate if I thought they would not be brought back here to face an Irish judge in an Irish court.  If we want to live in a civilised society we have to have these arrangements that are seen to work and are capable of working. One cannot have a situation where somebody walks out of a courthouse on a technicality.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that all of these things would stop if these cases were shifted from the District Court into the Circuit Court.  But I am certain that the environment of the Circuit Court is a far better place to hear these cases than a crowded district court in some part of rural Ireland when every day of the week Deputies come in here to complain about the conditions district justices have to tolerate on a daily basis.  Does the world press hone in on some small town in Ireland and its broken down building with a district justice with a string of cases to hear and with, stuck in the middle, a serious extradition case involving some terrorist who has blown the legs off some unfortunate, innocent human being, whether in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland, who will walk out of that court on a technicality?</P>
    <P>That is no way to deal with civilised society.  It was summed up in an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 June, headed &ldquo;Savagery&rdquo;, where it said that while people get worried about what happened in Gibraltar or agonise over technicalities of extradition the provisionals murder or plan murders and that until they are rooted out of our system they will murder again, a murder machine out of control.  That is the reality.  Those are the people we are dealing with, common <Col N="2088" /> murderers in the majority of cases that I am concerned about in relation to extradition. These are people who do not respect democracy, who do not respect our laws who do not recognise our courts and whose only aim is to overthrow the democratic system which we cherish.  I make no apologies for getting those people before courts to face justice whether here or in Great Britain.  I make no apology for seeing to it that people have adequate safeguards against being shipped abroad without any evidence that they committed a crime; of course we need safeguards but those safeguards have been there and will be there in the future.</P>
    <P>The best advice I can give to this House when the extradition amendment comes up for review at the end of this year is to throw it out the door and get back to a situation where our Attorney General and the Minister for Justice can meet their counterparts in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain and work out an arrangement whereby safeguards are in place, safeguards that can be changed if necessary without having to face the interpretation of the law and whereby we can get people back to Great Britain and to Northern Ireland to face the courts there for dastardly crimes.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, for the sake of civilisation, for the sake of democracy and for the sake of our system I appeal to the Government to consider over the next couple of months whether the District Court is the best place to hear these cases initially and to consider the suggestion I have put forward in relation to the Circuit Court.  I listened carefully to Deputy Colley who was constructive in her approach to this motion and made a case for the District Court in cases where the person acquiesced in the crime they are purported to have committed.  There may be some merit in what Deputy Colley has said.  I would like the Government, in the course of the consideration of this whole problem, to take into account her contribution also.</P>
    <P>There has been nothing in this debate that has convinced me I was wrong to put forward this motion for discussion or that <Col N="2089" /> there is anything wrong with the suggestion I am making.  I appeal in particular to the responsible Deputies in this House that while we make speeches about Northern Ireland and about extradition and the whole problem of terrorism, we should remember at all times that we have also a responsibility to the millions of Irish men and women living in Great Britain today, earning a living there, who have to live under the British system and face the courts there and when they do, we hope they get a fair crack of the whip. We would hope that they would not be the subject of ridicule when they get into a taxi or when they go to their place of work because of the attitude being adopted by some people in this country towards Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by recommending to the House that it supports the motion I have put forward.  It is deliberately worded the way it is to allow for flexibility.  I would ask the Government in particular to take on board the suggestions I have made and also to take into account the suggestion made by Deputy Colley on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister we will not forget about this.  It is not a question that will fade away.  If the Government are not prepared to do something there is another route open to us which we intend to follow.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1988. - Release of Nelson Mandela: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann salutes Nelson Mandela, who is the focus of black aspirations for a just and democratic society in South Africa, and sends <Col N="2099" /> greetings to him on his 70th birthday on 18th July, 1988.  As an ageing man in ill-health, one who has spent more than one-third of his life in prison, he still remains a source of encouragement to all who seek a peaceful, united and democratic South Africa, freed from the evils of Apartheid.  Dáil Eireann therefore calls for the unconditional and immediate release of Nelson Mandela and all other political prisoners in South Africa.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I advise the House that in total 20 minutes remain in this debate, eight of which are Deputy Kemmy's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned at 7 o'clock I was saying that we have learned a good deal from sportsmen and rugby players who have gone to South Africa and played there and have seen Apartheid at first hand.  I have in mind players like Tony Ward who refused to go back again and who has spoken and written about the situation at some length here.  We can also learn a good deal from television programmes and from journalists. I do not always agree with journalists but there have been many brave journalists and television commentators who have gone to South Africa at a good deal of risk to themselves and have reported in a most objective way.  Nobody in this House or elsewhere can say that they are not aware of the facts of Apartheid.  In an eloquent phrase, the Minister said that the blinds have been down in recent years in South Africa.  That is true because of censorship but nobody should allow that to blind them to the reality of the situation. While he is right in saying that the blinds have been pulled down you cannot pull down the blinds on human progress, you cannot pull the blinds down on the march of the people of South Africa towards full civil and human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For more than 25 years, Nelson Mandela <Col N="2100" /> has been in prison.  He is a symbol not only in his own country but throughout the world, of a person who has stood up for civil and human rights in South Africa.  While I would not cavil at this motion before us &mdash; it is a very good motion and has the support of all sides of the House &mdash; there is one inaccuracy in it.  That is the reference to Nelson Mandela being an ageing man in ill health.  Nelson Mandela is not in ill health.  He is in good health and this motion as such could cause some difficulty in South Africa because of that wording.  I ask the Government and the Taoiseach, in processing this motion at a higher level, to delete that phrase because Nelson Mandela is not in poor health, contrary to what the motion states.</P>
    <P>It is right that we should honour him today, that he should be remembered on his seventieth birthday.  We must do more than pay lip service to the man and we must do much more than pay lip service to bringing about, an end to Apartheid. As to a small neutral country we must have a real and meaningful role to play at every international forum.  We must pursue vigorously the call for the release of Nelson Mandela and also for the dismantling of Apartheid at every possible international forum, at the EC and at the United Nations.  Apartheid can never ever be justified.  The continuing oppression of the majority in South Africa is an intolerable blot on mankind and is an insult to civilisation.  We must, therefore, continue to oppose South African policies and allow the call for a free racial and democratic society.  No temporary solutions or stop gaps will do. What is wanted is full human freedom and full civil and human rights for all people there.</P>
    <P>Let it be known today that the Irish people and, indeed, democratic and freedom loving people throughout the world salute Nelson Mandela.  Let it be known also that the Irish Parliament unanimously calls for his immediate release and for the ending and dismantling of the Apartheid system.  Twenty-five years is a <Col N="2101" /> long time to spend in prison especially in a South African jail.  Mandela has spent that quarter of a century in prison for human freedom.  It must be obvious to everybody, including the regime in South Africa, that they will not break his spirit, that they will not break the spirit of his people, because in the long term the aims of his people will triumph.  Let there be no mistake about that no matter how much money is poured into South Africa, no matter what quantities of arms are built up there and no matter how much terror, oppression or intimidation is applied, his aims will triumph.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start of this debate this motion is one of the most enlightened motions to have come before this House. It unites all strands of politics.  With the one exception which I mentioned, that is the reference to ill health, the motion has my full support.  I hope that the words of the Minister and the other speakers will reverberate not only around this country but around the world, including South Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the world the Second World War brought about the end of colonialism and racialism.  Yet in South Africa the racism of Apartheid has continued unabated.  It is no different from Nazism or the racism of colonial oppression.  Tonight Dáil Éireann salutes Nelson Mandela who represents the indomitable spirit behind the ANC today, a symbol of nationalism, human rights and of justice.  Nelson Mandela is one of thousands in jail in South Africa, half of these are children some as young as 11 years of age.  How can the South African Government say that these children are a danger to the State?  How can a government say they are afraid of these children?  Such a government, such a system cannot survive while the spirit of the people is alive.  Nelson Mandela represents that spirit.  This spirit will never be broken, it will only grow in strength.  That is why I am convinced that <Col N="2102" /> Apartheid will end, and it must end very soon.  Nelson Mandela is in prison now for over two decades.  He has emerged as a source of inspiration for all humankind. He is a man of peace and non-violence. It was only in the sixties when supporters of the ANC were tortured and killed that the ANC decided to resort to a military campaign due to the state of terrorism that existed then in South Africa and which still exists today.  The UN has rightly described Apartheid as a crime against humanity.  The Charter of Human Rights states: &ldquo;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights&rdquo;. The people of South Africa led by the ANC have made immense sacrifices. Women and children have become victims of a repressive government.  The Soweto and Sharpeville massacres are examples of this brutal regime.</P>
      <P>Despite his period of continuous incarceration Nelson Mandela has remained steadfast and unbroken.  He has rejected humiliating offers for his personal freedom. His resolve is reflected in his own words and I quote: &ldquo;I cherish my own freedom but care more for your freedom. I cannot sell my birthright or the birthright of my people to be free&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We must not forget tonight, Winnie Mandela, the embodiment of courage and conviction.  She has been banned, detained, persecuted and yet she continues her campaign for Nelson Mandela's release.</P>
      <P>It is fitting that this motion be passed by an Irish Parliament &mdash; representing a people who understand the true meaning of being freed from a colonial power. This has been said already tonight by other speakers.  We more than any other country should recognise the right of self determination of the people of South Africa and indeed the African Continent as a whole.  Those of us who have succeeded in achieving equality of freedom for ourselves cannot remain insensitive or indifferent to such aspirations elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that we have been very vocal on the question of Apartheid at international level and have worked within the Twelve to intensify economic sanctions on the import of goods into Europe from South Africa.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that the time is now right <Col N="2103" /> for unilateral action by Ireland on sanctions, a country that can readily identify with the struggle for freedom by the South African people.</P>
    <P>The time is now right, I believe, to introduce a ban on the importation of South African coal into this country.  Let that be our birthday present to Nelson Mandela.  This would be more than an economic decision, it would be a major symbol of our abhorrence of Apartheid. The ANC, SWAPO and trade union leaders in South Africa have called for increased sanctions.  The Irish Catholic Church has recently called for a ban on coal imports.  This is one of the concrete means available to this Government &mdash; and there are few &mdash; to show where they stand on this issue, and it should be availed of.  At the same time I believe that a strategic selective and united approach should be taken by the EC on sanctions. We must introduce sanctions where they hurt.  Pretoria will be forced to take note if we do so.  The reality is that the Apartheid system cannot be reformed, it must be dismantled &mdash; this can be brought about by the intensification of sanctions worldwide &mdash; in particular by western Europe.</P>
    <P>Let us remind the South African Government tonight that the release of Nelson Mandela &mdash; such is his stature internationally &mdash; would be viewed from outside as a major turning point in South African affairs.  His release, along with the release of other political prisoners who are the true voice of the African people, would show the world that the Pretoria Government were interested in negotiating with the black leadership and interested in the creation of a free, peaceful, non-racial South Africa.  It would bring peace to the frontline states of Namibia, Angola, Mozambique, and allow Black Africa with its own beautiful culture and heritage to grow economically, politically and socially at its own pace and, in its own African inimitable way, with the economic support of the western world.  I am proud to participate in this brief but highly significant debate.</P>

      <P>Some ten years ago in Nigeria I represented the then Government at a conference on Apartheid in the distinguished company of people like the late Dr. Seán McBride and Dr. Kadar Asmal who was recently instrumental on his own behalf and on behalf of the Irish anti-Apartheid group in asking all parties in the House to sponsor the motion now before it.  In that regard I am privileged to have been associated with it.</P>
      <P>To return to the Nigerian conference on Apartheid, it was significant even then that Ireland had an important moral role to play as a nation with a point of view on this particularly evil system.  It is evil because it seeks to discriminate against individuals in the context of their colour and their political beliefs, and any system that seeks to do that seeks to consign individuals to the role of second class citizens.  In those circumstances that system is basically evil and wrong.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Kitt speaking about burning everything South African but their coal.  That echoes our history in the sense that there was a cry many years ago to &ldquo;burn everything English but her coal&rdquo;.  There is a significant comparability between ourselves and South Africa historically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nelson Mandela has been in prison for the past 25 years for his political beliefs. Any system that confines an individual to that length of time in prison is a wrong, evil system that flies against the designs of both God and man.  I urge strongly those people who have spoken, who represent the strong views of this democratically elected Parliament, to get a message through somehow to Robben Island Prison where Mandela is now incarcerated.  Despite what the respected Deputy Jim Kemmy says, I believe Mandela is not in the best of health and I ask that in some way the message be got through from our sovereign Parliament to that place of detention to let him know that we on this island remember him on <Col N="2105" /> his 70th birthday and will continue to press for his release and the release of his colleagues as long as they are in prison.  I have no doubt but that Nelson Mandela's wife, Winnie, a woman of great courage, can receive a message from this Parliament to take to her husband during one of her visits to him.  I understand that the restrictions in that regard are appalling and again an affront to humanity.  Altogether as long as people like Nelson Mandela know this country, small and all as it is but with a very important moral role in international diplomacy, is aware of his existence and that we continue to press for his release it will give him hope at any rate, and that is all he can expect from the present South African regime of suppression.  If we can get this message of hope through to him it will do something for his morale in the meantime.  We assure the black population in South Africa that we support their legitimate peaceful aspirations to a multiracial society.  The motion before the House seeks the release of an individual who represents all that is good in the democratic process.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the motion because Nelson Mandela is a symbol to all freedom loving people in the world.  There is no doubt he is a beacon light of hope that lights up the darkest regime that mars this world, the regime of Apartheid.  If one issue unites all the parties and independent Members of this House it is the total, unified opposition to Apartheid and the total horror felt unanimously at the continued imprisonment of Nelson Mandela after 25 years.  I know as a former Minister for Justice that in this country eight years is considered the maximum life sentence unless a person is an absolute danger to <Col N="2106" /> society, so it could be said that Nelson Mandela has served three life sentences already, yet from within those prison walls the example, the feeling for liberty and equality emanates.  On this night when Dáil Éireann salutes Nelson Mandela and his wife, Winnie Mandela who has been such a courageous bearer of his message outside the prison walls, I can only express the hope that this horrible system of Apartheid is brought to a quick end.</P>
      <P>We have to face the fact that some of our colleagues in the EC seem less than enthusiastic in talking the fullest measures against Apartheid.  Sanctions are all right for Nicaragua and some other countries but there is excuse after excuse for not imposing sanctions against South Africa. We should not put up with those excuses any more and we should urge our Government to press harder and harder at EC level to get all the countries of the EC to accept the need for sanctions and to press ever more intensely for the dismantling of Apartheid.</P>

      <P>I thank all the speakers and you, Sir, for the opportunity to conclude on this very important, historic motion tonight.  It has been said, and I say again, that it is important and significant for this House to recognise the giant Nelson Mandela on his 70th birthday. It is a credit to us that we have taken the time and have in this House a number of Ministers in Government to listen to the debate carefully.  I hope that from this a clear message will go out not only to Nelson Mandela, his wife and the people of South Africa, but to our more immediate neighbours within the EC who have in the past been so reluctant, so slow to take any positive action with regard to the most effective demand upon us, that of sanctions against the South African economy.  I hope Dublin City Council will have the opportunity in the very near future to confer on Nelson Mandela, the freedom of the city.  I hope the all-party support in the debate here tonight will be followed through with equal unanimity on Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government in listening and taking on the unanimous view of the House tonight to take independent, <Col N="2107" /> strong action in regard to sanctions, in particular with regard to the coal industry of South Africa which now represents one of its most expanding and significant international exports.  We are unwittingly on a weekly basis allowing their coal to come in under various EC manoeuvres to Ireland.  I ask that we take the lead in this and proceed with a total ban on importation from wherever of South African originated coal, and I have no doubt that our partners in the EC will not be in a position to object but will have to take the lead from the Irish Government. I ask that we move to that position without delay.  I ask also that the Government circulate the text of tonight's motion to all our EC partners and have it lodged with the General Secretary of the UN for purposes of record there.</P>
    <P>Finally, a call must go out from this House tonight re-echoeing the unanimous view that those convicted and facing death who are known as the Sharpeville Six must be given clemency in the face of a ridiculous conviction in the most tenuous of cases and in a situation where the death penalty should never be visited in the circumstances surrounding that case.  We say tonight to Nelson Mandela, to all the people of South Africa, your struggle is ours, your victory will be yours.  To everyone we say, a Mandela.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the difficulties experienced in respect of seeking residency permits from the Department of Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  It might be a salutary experience for all of us, particularly those who were recently on the high bridge of moral rectitude on the independent ship of the Irish Republic, to come with me in the next 20 minutes into the engine room of our tardy and <Col N="2108" /> perhaps not so well run little vessel to see how we treat people of different races and to whom we give the title &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;. What I have to tell the House is not a happy tale, it is not a pleasant tale and it is not a tale for which the Minister opposite is directly, immediately or exclusively responsible, because the responsibility ultimately has to be shared by the elected representatives of this House.</P>
      <P>If the Irish emigrants about whom so much concern has been expressed in this House and outside by so many different people were to be subject to the delays, the indecisions, the evasion, the non-replies, the frustration and the downright degradation that the people we describe as aliens, or non-EC citizens, have to endure under our system of entry into this free and independent Republic, there would be an absolute outrage and uproar.</P>
      <P>What is this system of entry into the Irish Republic?  In a reply to a question to me on 23 June the Minister, Deputy Collins, stated that non-EC citizens coming to this State from a place outside Great Britain or Northern Ireland must present themselves before an immigration officer for leave to land.  The immigration officer may refuse leave to land on a number of grounds which are listed in article 5 of the Aliens Order, 1946, as amended by the Aliens Order, 1975.  That Aliens Order, 1975, lists under article 5 a range of reasons a person can be refused entry.  The main difficulty would appear to be in relation to a number of people coming from outside the European Community.  If, in the opinion of the immigration officer, the person intends to travel, immediately or later, to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and the officer is satisfied that the alien would not qualify for admission to Great Britain or Northern Ireland if he arrived there from a place other than this State, then he is refused entry.  That is an amendment of earlier regulations drafted in 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the background to this is the common passport union we have with Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I can appreciate the need to respect the entry requirements and regulations which <Col N="2109" /> our neighbour, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have imposed.  Frankly I do not agree with them because I believe in many respects they are racist.  Because of that, people wishing to settle in this country have been unfairly discriminated against.</P>
    <P>One of the glories of the human race is the great range of skin colour &mdash; black, brown, white, yellow &mdash; but we are distinguished by our racial features.  In this part of the world people coming from Asia are readily recognisable.  Unfortunately some people genuinely wishing to settle in this State, who have the means to settle here and do not want to be a burden on the State but who want to make a contribution to this country and think the Republic of Ireland is a place they would like to live in, are denied that right.  These people are alienated by the response of and their relationship with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter because of the intense frustration I feel about a particular constituent.  This case is just the tip of an iceberg and this iceberg has been documented by two separate sources.  A person of Indian origin living in Northern Ireland &mdash; for legal purposes part of the State of Great Britain but there are many people in this House who would assert it is part of Ireland &mdash; was refused a visa to come to this country.  I will quote from the letter I received:</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at not being allowed to enter into this country despite the fact that I have lived in Northern Ireland for a long time.</P>
    <P>A lawyer handed a case over to me after six months trying to get a reply from the Department of Justice.  He was told originally he would have a reply within a week.  The departmental officials said that the decision as to whether the Department would grant the person in question entry clearance would be made within one week.  The solicitor went on to state:</P>
    <P>In view of the length of time which has lapsed since we first contacted the Department of Justice on behalf of this person, we were surprised at the attitude adopted by the Department and <Col N="2110" /> found their whole approach unsatisfactory. After a long discussion with that person and her brother, we saw that there were two options open to us. The first was to continue writing to the Department of Justice, as we had been doing since November 1986, and the second was to appeal to court for a judicial review of the legislation in question.  The first alternative we felt would be a waste of time and the second alternative we felt would be expensive, lengthy and not necessarily successful.</P>
    <P>I received another piece of evidence from somebody who works with people who come to this country.  He said:</P>
    <P>In my experience this case is not exceptional.  There seems to be particular difficulties with this section of the Department of Justice.  I have found it quite impossible to get any information on what conditions people will be admitted to this country of ours. I have had inquiries from some of our overseas contacts, international church bodies, looking for the information booklet outlining the conditions of entry.  If such a booklet exists, it is well hidden.  It is as well hidden as the Government's policy on this matter.</P>
    <P>We should be honoured that anybody from another State would want to live in this Republic.  We should take it as a reflection on our quality of life.  Perhaps those people would make a contribution to our overall economy and to the cultural vitality of the State.  If in the past we had excluded immigrants &mdash; our ancestors &mdash; this would be a much poorer place as we know despite our frequently trumpetted reference to this State being of Celtic origin.  It is much more than that. Dublin's millennium is a testimony in part to the diversity of the richness of cultural pluralism that make Ireland what it is today.</P>
    <P>What we are doing now is to arbitrarily guillotine that constant enriching process, and in many cases it is happening without an adequate explanation being given to the people who wish to enter our State.  Of course, the Minister for Justice and his officials have to have some kind of regulatory system for people coming <Col N="2111" /> into the State, I am not challenging that. Of course, there must be conditions under which entry is allowed.  Nobody is challenging that, but people should get a clear and unequivocal answer, in a civil and comforting manner, without the most extraordinary Kafkaesue type of delays, evasions and frustrations.  That is the experience of people who have to sit in the waiting room in the Department of Justice.  Last Wednesday I saw one man going to the reception desk in total frustration, saying he had been waiting for hours and asking when he would see somebody.</P>
    <P>Every week we hear about the plight of the poor Irish in London, the difficulties of illegals in New York and the problems of Irish people in Australia.  If we can relate to that sense of alienation and distress, which I encountered in my own time, why can we not relate to that feeling among people who are aliens here?</P>
    <P>I have deliberately dealt with this matter on a general basis.  While there is a particular case with which the Minister will be familiar, I do not necessarily want to win that case at the expense of not changing the system.  The exposition I have made is just the tip of the iceberg. I have an entire solicitor's file containing about 40 letters which cite a horror story of alienation that would make Franz Kafka proud.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to change the lousy, rotten system which faces people trying to get information about whether they can stay in our free Republic.  Some minutes ago we heard Deputy Kitt and Deputy Andrews talk about the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela. There are people imprisoned in a bureaucratic cell of indecision in this island, not knowing whether they can come or go, not knowing whether, if they leave the country on a holiday, they will be allowed back.  Is that what Republican justice is about?  Is that what the independence adventure since 1916 has been about?  I put it to the House that it is not and that the Minister is perhaps not even aware of the extent of this problem.</P>
    <P>Effectively there are only four or five people working in that section.  In one <Col N="2112" /> response to a particular individual, a civil servant, whom I will not name in deference to the traditions of anonimity that prevail in this House, simply indicated that he was inundated with applications and could not give a reply any sooner.</P>
    <P>We need a clear system and a handbook available in every Irish Embassy which will enable people to find out precisely what is required of them.  In the case of planning permission, if a reply is not forthcoming within a given period, the applicant is deemed to have been given permission.  This system has worked spectacularly and I suggest that a similar system should be introduced in relation to this matter.  We also need a system of appeal so that somebody who is refused permission can assert his claim to enter the Republic of Ireland and refute any claim that he is using this country as a back door to the United Kingdom.  I implore the Minister to change the fundamentally arbitrary nature of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied to a number of parliamentary questions in relation to the aliens section of my Department over the last six or seven months.  In November last, in reply to Deputies Quinn and O'Sullivan, I set out the staffing structure of the section.  I also said on that occasion that I was satisfied that the operations of the section were both just and efficient within the resource constraints applicable to the public service generally.  I went on to say that the work procedures of the section were being studied with a view to determining the proper staffing structures of the section.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday I replied to a question from Deputy Quinn on the present arrangements and operations of the aliens section.  I again dealt with the staffing situation and said that the study of the section had been completed and that it was under examination in my Department.  I referred to computerisation in the context of that study and said that I had already given approval to a recommendation for an extension of computerisation of the work of the aliens section and that I hoped that as a result there would be a general improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2113" /> I am quite satisfied that there will be. Work has already started in this area.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday in the course of supplementary questions, Deputy Quinn asked if the Minister would agree that the outline of information which I had put on the record of the House in answer to a parliamentary question with its reference to the three sets of regulations was readily available to anybody going to the Department.  I was asked to consider a proposal to publish in a succinct and concise form the requirements with which people need to comply in order to obtain a residence permit if they are EC nationals or non-nationals.  I replied by saying I understood the point made by Deputy Quinn and that the importance of making such information available would have to be taken into consideration.  I said I was prepared to give his suggestion every consideration with a view to implementing it.  That I propose to do.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be useful if I gave some statistical background to the work of the section.  The most important statistic as regards the work of the section is the number of aliens registered in the State.  The number of those registered in 1987 was 22,594.  The number registered in 1981 was 16,966.  Accordingly, there has been an increase of 33 per cent since 1981.  Other important statistics in relation to the section are those relating to visa applications and naturalisation. The number of visa applications in 1981 was 6,292.  In 1987 this grew to 11,472 or an increase of 82 per cent.  In 1981 147 aliens were naturalised. In 1987 the figure was 529.  These figures give an indication of the growth in the volume of work in some of the areas dealt with by the section.  The volume of work in other areas has also grown and, in addition, there has been an increase in the complexity of the work in some areas. Developments in European Community policy in relation to immigration from countries outside the Community and applications for political asylum are two areas in which there has been a growth in the complexity and, indeed, sensitivity of the work of the section.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to questions last November, it is possible that individual <Col N="2114" /> applicants could have their applications for permission to stay here processed earlier if additional staff were available. However, as I also said on that occasion, I am satisfied that the operations of the aliens section are both just and efficient within the resource constraints applicable to the public service generally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made particular reference to the case of one British lady.  I presume he received a copy of the letter I sent to him on Friday last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is aware that I received a lot of information in this case.  I evaluated it carefully before reaching my decision.  Part of the information supplied to me was to the effect that the lady in question is a Briitish citizen and that an application was made to the British authorities for permission for her husband, an Indian citizen, to enter the United Kingdom.  That permission was refused by the British authorities and that refusal, again according to the information available to me, was upheld on appeal.</P>
      <P>I gave careful consideration to this case before deciding not to give the lady's husband permission to enter the State or to reside here, and a crucial point in the case, in my view, is that the lady is a British citizen and that the original permission for her husband to come to an EC country was sought from the British authorities.  As she was and is a British citizen they were the correct authority to consider permission for residency.  That was the case some years ago and, in my view, is still the case.  As the Deputy has been told in a letter written last Friday I gave very careful consideration to all the information available to me on this case and I am not prepared to change my decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the very heavy growth in the work of this section, I am taking corrective action with a view to making it more efficient.  It was not today or yesterday that the aliens section of the Department of Justice was criticised for the first time but, in fairness, it was the first time something positive and definite has been done about it.  I would like to <Col N="2115" /> see it being more efficient and perhaps with more staff it could be more efficient.</P>
    <P>I take the point that Deputy Quinn made last week when we discussed this matter, that people who are making inquiries about their position should be told as quickly as possible what the regulations are and what they need to do to comply with these regulations.  Something we should not forget is that those who are coming in here legally have certain restrictions stamped on their passports at particular times, so they know that there are certain restrictions on their movements as to what they must or must not do and if they do not comply with those restrictions they are breaking the law and are liable to be asked to leave immediately.  Of course, as the House knows well, many people come in here illegally.  They surface from time to time and it is a very difficult problem.  If I were asked, as of now, how many persons were here illegally, I could only guess at it. The same would apply to my predecessor and his predecessor, both of whom served in Government with Deputy Quinn.  It is because of the situation that exists that we want to streamline it in an effort to point out to people exactly what is expected of them if they want to stay.</P>
    <P>I should also say that I am satisfied that there are groups of people or organisations operating to get people into this country illegally or any way they possible can.  We have had difficulties in this area where organisations are working for big money on behalf of people who find themselves in this country not knowing what their future will be.  Having regard to our situation in Europe from 1992 it is important to put our House in order to deal with the situation from then because access to any one country within the common market will mean access to any one of the others.  There is a lot of work to be done and we are tackling it.  I am not pointing the finger at anybody because I was there myself in the late seventies.</P>

      <P>Finally, I take no pleasure whatsoever in refusing an application for anything.  It is because I had more than satisfied myself that there was not any other option for me to take that, with very great regret, I had to make that decision.</P>

      <P>Annual subvention for Bus Atha Cliath is allocated by the board of Coras Iompair Éireann out of the total Exchequer allocation to that body in accordance with EC Regulation 1107/70, which specifies that State aid may be paid in respect of losses on road passenger services which cannot be recouped by fare increases or eliminated by economies in operations.  The audited accounts of CIE for 1986 are the most recent available and show that in that year the subvention allocation for Dublin city bus services was £14.7 million.</P>
      <P>The accounts show that revenue from passengers amounted to £74.1 million, or 83.4 per cent of the total revenue.  The Exchequer subvention represented 16.6 per cent.  The total revenue of £88.8 million matched the total expenditure, including financial charges, for 1986.</P>

      <P>I have received some representations in regard to the present system of farmer taxation.  However, the Government believe that for equity reasons farmers should be taxed on actual income on the same basis as other income taxpayers, and not by reference to a special capital value criterion which was the basis for farm tax.  This is also the view of the main farming organisation.  The Government decided therefore last year to discontinue the farm tax for 1987 and subsequent years, to continue with the income tax basis for farmer taxation and to extend it to all farmers likely to have taxable incomes.  This equality of tax treatment involves a stability in farmer tax arrangements, and there are no proposals to introduce a land tax for farmers in the next financial year.</P>

      <P>The Commission proposals in the energy, <Col N="1904" /> water, transport and telecommunications sectors that is the so-called &ldquo;excluded sectors&rdquo;, are likely, it is expected, shortly to be transmitted by the Commission to Council.</P>
      <P>Draft versions of the Commission's proposals, on which there has been an initial exchange of views between the Commission's services and the member states, are at present being considered in the Departments and bodies concerned, with a view to an assessment of the overall policy implications from this country's point of view.</P>
      <P>The other ongoing Commission proposals in the public procurement field are (1)  the draft Directive on Public Works Contracts and (ii)  the draft &ldquo;Compliance&rdquo; Directive, which is designed to establish an effective system of administrative or legal redress for aggrieved contractors and provides for direct intervention by the Commission.</P>
      <P>In regard to (i), this proposal is at present being considered at Council Working Party level.  A small number of issues arising in the draft Directive were submitted last week to the Internal Market Council but were referred back to Coreper.  In regard to (ii), the opinion of the European Parliament has been delivered on the draft Directive and is at present being considered by the Commission.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply of 18 May last to a question by the Deputy, Ireland shares the underlying objectives of the Commission's proposals which, apart from the draft Works Directive, have not yet been considered at Council level.  In so far as public works contracts are concerned, the construction industry is regarded as being well placed to take advantage of any opening up of the market.  In regard to the other proposals, policy will be aimed at maximising the gains for Irish industry while ensuring that our particular circumstances and needs are taken into account to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>Procedures governing the award of public contracts were codified and published by my Department in July 1986 in the booklet <i>An Outline of Government Contracts Procedures.</i>  The booklet, with a view to reducing costs and maximising efficiency on public contracts, highlighted the importance of, <i>inter alia</i>, the forward planning and the monitoring of projects and, as well, the need to avoid cost overruns on public construction projects.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to the specific matters referred to by the Deputy is as follows.</P>
      <P>Fixed Price Contracts: the adoption of these on a much more widespread scale was advocated in the booklet.  They are now in increasing use in Government Departments, and the question of their obligatory introduction in further cases is being considered at present by my Department.</P>
      <P>Consultants' Fees: increasingly consultants are now being appointed following a competitive precedure and remunerated on the basis of negotiated fees rather than by reference to an established professional scale.</P>
      <P>Design-and-build Contracts: these have always been admissible on a competitive basis and their use is encouraged in appropriate cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Initiatives: it is proposed to review, as appropriate, in the near future the operation of the measures announced in the booklet referred to above.  The question of what further action may be needed in relation to the specific matters mentioned above, and of the need for <Col N="1906" /> fresh initiatives, will be considered in the light of the outcome of that review.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not the policy to agree to the provision of alarm systems linking the houses of individuals with Garda stations.  The gardaí, with the very heavy demands already being made on their resources, could not undertake the additional workload which would be involved in servicing a system of this nature.  There is already serious Garda concern at the waste of their time which is involved in responding to the very high number of &ldquo;false alarms&rdquo;, in all areas, from existing alarm systems.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the concern underlying this question might be met by means of the Garda neighbourhood watch scheme or some variation of it which would meet the particular needs of the person in question.  I understand that the question of setting up such a scheme in the area concerned is under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>Completion of the internal market does not imply that Community prices will be moved closer to world price levels. The strategy of allowing market signals to play a greater role in influencing producer decisions has, however, been adopted by the Commission and the Council in relation to agriculture in recent years. I am not opposed in principle to that strategy, but I would oppose any proposal to reduce Community prices to those prevailing on world markets for so long as prices on those markets remain distorted by the disproportionate effect of relatively small surpluses and consequently do not properly reflect production costs in many areas.  The position could of course change if arrangements were put in place on a multilateral basis to ensure that world prices could be maintained at levels which are remunerative for our producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has not yet made detailed proposals in all cases for the harmonisation of veterinary controls and <Col N="1916" /> procedures.  Our objective in the negotiations will be to ensure that our present high health standards are not eroded in the process of further harmonising intra-Community trade.  I would point out that up to now Community measures have generally contained provisions to respect that requirement and I have no reason to believe that similar provisions will not be included in future Community action.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was examined on 26 November 1987 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in nine months.  In the interim, in March 1988, the person concerned indicated that he wished to be transferred from disability benefit to invalidity pension. In view of the finding on 26 November a deciding officer decided that he was not entitled to invalidity pension at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the person concerned was dissatisfied with that decision arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee on week ending 1 July 1988.  His entitlement to <Col N="1925" /> invalidity pension will be further considered in the light of the report of this examination and if the outcome of the examination is the same as the first one then the person concerned will be invited to have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is employed as a temporary nurse.  Doubt arose as to whether contributions paid on her behalf during the contribution year 6 April 1985 to 5 April 1986, which governed her claim of 17 November 1987, were correctly paid.</P>
      <P>Clarification of the claimant's contribution record was delayed due to administrative difficulties on the part of her employer and details of the claimant's contribution record were not forwarded to the Social Welfare officer until last week.  When these details have been checked and the correct contribution class payable for each week of employment for the period since 1985, established, her entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined.</P>

      <Col N="1929" /> The returns from the Western Health Board do not provide separate figures for Galway City.  The information available relates to the Galway Community Care area, which comprises both city and county.  In the last week of March, 1988 a total of 263 persons in the Galway Community Care area received such supplements at a cost of £3,860.  Of these, 60 received payments of up to £10 and 203 received payments in excess of £10.</P>
    <P>Consideration will be given to the possibility of paying these supplements with unemployment benefit/assistance payments at employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>Contacts with the health boards indicate that difficulty on the part of applicants in getting rent receipts from landlords is not a significant problem and where instances of this nature have arisen, the community welfare officers have managed to overcome the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The question of a landlord's tax liability is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. Rent supplements, where due, are paid to the tenant, not the landlord, and the community welfare officers/health boards would not, therefore, be in a position to supply information on a landlord's income from their records.</P>
    <P>A leaflet produced by the Department gives detailed information on entitlements under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  It is available from the information offices of the Department in Dublin and around the country and from the Health Boards.  Consideration is being given to the publication of an information leaflet specifically about rent and mortgage supplementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>State mining facilities have not been granted, in Counties Mayo or Galway, to the companies listed by the Deputy nor have any such facilities been granted in respect of gold in any part of the State.</P>
      <P>While statutory notice of my intention to grant prospecting licences to them over certain areas in Counties Mayo or Galway has been published, prospecting licences have not, as of this date, been formally granted to a number of the companies referred to by the Deputy pending the completion of other procedures relating to the issue of the licences.</P>
      <P>Prospecting licences are granted in accordance with the provisions of the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979.  Prospecting licence holders are required to carry out their work in conformity with good prospecting practice and without unnecessary interference with the amenities of the localities in which licence areas are situated.  They are required to ensure that any trenches opened during exploration work are backfilled as soon as the programme of work no longer requires them to be kept open and to restore the surface as far as practicable to its original condition.</P>
      <P>Prospecting licence holders are required, as far as may be practicable, to inform landowners or surface occupiers of their intention to enter on properties to carry out work there.  Furthermore, they may be liable to pay compensation for any damage caused by them.  Licence holders are, also, required to apply for planning permission for any work which would require such permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> A prospecting licence does not authorise the holder to develop any economic deposits of minerals he may find.  For that purpose a separate State mining facility would be required.</P>
    <P>The question of the environmental impact conditions which would be applicable to any gold mining operations that may develop from current prospecting activity would be a matter to be dealt with under the planning permission procedures administered by the appropriate planning authorities.</P>

      <P>Neither Finglas nor any other <Col N="1950" /> part of the country was overlooked in the amenity grant allocations.  However, because of the very substantial number of applications for grants and the comparatively limited resources available for the scheme, it was not possible to make grants in respect of projects in each district. I should point out, however, that grants totalling £186,000 were paid in respect of projects in the Finglas area in 1986-87 when other areas did not receive any grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present level of pollution in Lough Sheelin, County Cavan; the way in which this compares with previous levels found in the past five years; whether the present level is acceptable; and the plans he has for further improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that water quality conditions in Lough Sheelin for the period January to May this year are marginally better than for the corresponding period last year.  Chlorophyll levels in the lake have reduced significantly, water clarity has shown some improvement, while nutrient loadings in the lake and entering via streams are significantly down on last years levels.</P>
      <P>Major improvement in the condition of Lough Sheelin occurred in 1983 and 1984 as a result of the special protection measures introduced in 1980.  However, the lake deteriorated subsequently, due in large measure to the poor summers of 1985 and 1986, which increased the loadings of nutrients reaching the lake in the June-September periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent improvement in water quality can be attributed to the action taken by Cavan County Council, the statutory water pollution control authority, in prohibiting the spreading of pig slurry in the catchment from November to February and restricting it in October and March to periods when ground and weather conditions were suitable for safe spreading. Restrictions were placed on the spreading of cattle manure during the winter <Col N="1952" /> months also.  I understand that improvements made to an industrial effluent discharge and the recent favourable weather conditions have also contributed to the better water quality.</P>
    <P>The future of the lake is dependent on the continued co-operation by all interested parties in the catchment in tackling all sources of pollution and disposing of wastes in a responsible manner.  I am satisfied that the Lough Sheelin Management Committee provide an adequate mechanism for this purpose and that Cavan County Council will act, as necessary, under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 to protect the lake.</P>
    <P>Recently I approved Cavan County Council's proposal to instal phosphorus removal facilities at the Ballyjamesduff sewage treatment plant.  I am presently examining a report by An Foras Forbartha on water quality in the lake and will consider the need for further action in light of this examination.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is an embargo on further recruitment into the social employment scheme which has discriminated against local authorities and will now lead to short-time working for full time staff in the latter even though there are many long-term unemployed prepared to participate in the projects; <Col N="1957" /> and if he will ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to switch appropriated funds since the State contribution to present participants is as low as £8.05 per week for workers.</P>

      <P>As I said in the Dáil last week in reply to a previous question on the social employment scheme, I am aware that FÁS have had to defer applications in order to remain within their allocation for the year.  I understand this means that recruitment to both new and existing schemes has been temporarily restricted.</P>
      <P>There has been no discrimination by FÁS against local authorities as the restrictions apply equally to all categories of sponsors.  I should point out that local authorities are the largest employers under the scheme, employing about 54 per cent of participants.  The implications for employment with the local authorities are a matter for the authorities and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Because of the value of the scheme to the long term unemployed, I am urgently reviewing the funding situation.</P>

Over the years the psychotherapy unit at Mountpleasant provided a central service for the Eastern Health Board area but following consultation with the clinical directors, this service will now be provided on a catchment area rather than on a regional basis.

      <P>The award of pensions and other superannuation benefits in respect of national school teachers is governed by statutory superannuation schemes made under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928.  Various amending schemes have been made over the years and a number of approved changes are currently being implemented administratively pending their incorporation into further amending schemes for approval by the Oireachtas. The provisions of the schemes are of general application and cannot be departed from in individual cases.</P>
      <P>This former teacher retired on grounds of ill-health on 18 October, 1976 and was awarded a pension and retirement gratuity based on his pensionable service and his retiring pensionable salary.  I am satisfied that his superannuation award is correct and fully in accordance with the provisions of the schemes and represents his maximum entitlements under those schemes.</P>
      <P>An arrangement now exists whereby teachers who are awarded a disability pension are credited with added years of service in addition to their years of actual pensionable service.  This provision applies only to teachers who retire on or after 30 June, 1977 and does not apply in the case of this teacher as he retired on 18 October, 1976.</P>

In 1988 under the scheme of annual grants to national governing bodies of sport a grant of £18,000 has been allocated to the sports section of the association to assist towards the costs of coaching, administration, equipment and special projects designed to increase participation and improve standards in wheelchair sports.</P>
      <P>A grant of £15,000 is also allocated by the Department to the Irish Wheelchair Association on an annual basis towards the cost of employing a sports administrator.</P>
      <P>A grant of £7,000 is allocated annually to the Irish Wheelchair Association to assist towards the cost of employing a development officer.</P>
