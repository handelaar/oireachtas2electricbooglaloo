      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will instruct each Minister and Minister of State to reduce the number of staff working exclusively on constituency matters in their respective offices by two; and if he will ensure that these staff are effectively deployed to areas of the greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the numbers of staff working on constituency matters in the offices of Ministers and Ministers of State are the minimum necessary to provide a courteous and efficient service to the members of the public who seek assistance or advice from the Minister concerned.  The numbers employed in constituency offices are already below the limits for the staffing of such offices, which were decided upon by the previous Government and applied in a circular letter to all Government Departments on 16 February, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of my Government's policy on Civil Service staffing, the levels of staffing in Departments and offices are constantly monitored and staff are being <Col N="990" /> redeployed, to the greatest extent possible, to areas of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Would it not be consistent with his own statements of recent weeks that reductions had to be spread across the board in the Civil Service if all areas of the Civil Service, including constituency offices, suffered reductions in staff?  It appears to me that all areas other than constituency offices have had staff reductions.  Will the Taoiseach consider staff reductions for these offices as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Staffing levels there are kept to a minimum and they are below the level decided.  There is an important aspect of parliamentary democracy involved here.  If Ministers did not discharge their duties to their constituents as public representatives it would not be too long before we would have a different type of outcry.</P>

    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, having regard to the impending completion of the restoration of the external fabric of the Custom House, Dublin 1 he will recommend that the entire building become the new home of the National Museum having regard to the present unsatisfactory arrangements for the museum and the fact that the internal office accommodation within the Custom House is below standard and will require substantial modernisation in the near future in order to have it comply with modern requirements; his views on whether in the context of the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks area the relocation to the Custom House of the entire museum collection would consolidate the use of the Custom House and reinforce the overall development of that sector of the city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="991" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Present plans for the Custom House centre around its use as the headquarters for the Department of the Environment.  The transfer of the Department of Health to Hawkins House and of certain sections of the Department of the Environment to Ballina will allow the relocation of several other sections of the Department of the Environment to the Custom House, thus improving the effective discharge of that Department's business.</P>
      <P>At present, the National Museum of Ireland is principally accommodated in Kildare Street and Upper Merrion Street with ancillary accommodation elsewhere. It is recognised that existing accommodation must be upgraded and additional space provided.  For this reason, a significant amount of additional space at the Custom House Docks has been allocated to enable the creation there of a Museum of Decorative Arts and a Folklife Museum.  In addition, an allocation of £360,000 is being provided from national lottery proceeds in 1988 to renovate the Kildare Street building and a further £100,000 is being allocated to renovate the Natural History Museum in Upper Merrion Street.  It is proposed to continue this work in future years as resources permit.</P>
      <P>It is considered that these initiatives will adequately address the accommodation needs of the museum and, in the circumstances, it is not, therefore, necessary or appropriate to consider its relocation to the Custom House.</P>
      <P>The developments at the Custom House Docks, including the establishment there of the financial services centre, the museum developments and the National Sports Centre, will obviously provide a major catalyst to sympathetic development in the vicinity, including the area around the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply and for the information he has given but I would draw his attention to the fact that in 1992 we will be celebrating the bicentennial of the construction of what is perhaps our finest <Col N="992" /> public building in the city.  In accordance with the minimum office standards required the entire inside of the Custom House will have to be substantially altered and a lot of money will be spent distorting the historical shape, internally, of a unique public building.  If the Taoiseach agrees with that brief description will he reconsider the long-term future of the Custom House?  I am not looking for an immediate response but there will be many alternative office buildings in the vicinity of the Custom House and there is only one Custom House.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the matter would be looked at in a more imaginative way than has hitherto been the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds possible. I will certainly think about what the Deputy has said.  I had an idea once for a different type of building not very far away becoming the artistic and cultural centre of Dublin but, of course, the Deputy will bear in mind that when Gandon designed the Custom House, he designed it as an office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that when Gandon designed the Custom House the working conditions of office staff were not at a level which is now required by law?  Indeed, if one were to seriously examine the standards now prevailing in the Custom House, they are probably technically below the minimum office standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no railway bridge in front at that stage and it does not add to the beauty of the Custom House.  Would the Taoiseach like to congratulate Deputy Quinn on his brilliant and imaginative idea, put before the House this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy means this afternoon?  I was not here this morning. What did Deputy Quinn do this morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Quinn did some time ago &mdash; the Taoiseach would probably be interested to learn &mdash; was to have a discussion on this matter with <Col N="993" /> Deputy Barry who is the originator of this idea and I acknowledge that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already acknowledged that there is imaginative merit in the Deputy's proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the proposed agenda for the European Council at Hanover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach take the opportunity at Hanover of attempting to retrieve some of the ground which has been lost in the farm price talks and try to ensure that, first, it will be on the agenda and, second, that some reasonably satisfactory arrangements, as far as Ireland is concerned, are arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is founded on an unrealistic and unacceptable premise and therefore the rest of his question does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unreasonable as far as the Greeks are concerned to play hard ball when it comes to seeking a reasonable solution in their interests. Would it not be in our interests to play a similarly tough game in trying to ensure that a solution which is reasonable is ultimately arrived at, whether at Hanover or elsewhere?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was any possibility of improving matters for our farmers of course we would be very glad to avail of any such opportunity, but the Minister for Agriculture and Food has indicated that the present settlement is the result of very long, hard and arduous and detailed close knit negotiation.  On the whole he has expressed himself as <Col N="994" /> satisfied with the arrangement as being the best available at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that what is envisaged here addresses a very real need, that of short stay accommodation for young Irish people who go to London and find themselves totally unprepared?  In view of the fact that it is envisaged that 35,000 people will emigrate this year, 75 per cent of whom will go to the UK, a considerable proportion of whom will go to London and statistics show that 17 per cent are on the streets after a two month period, would the Taoiseach agree that this is a very real need which requires urgent and immediate consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said the application is under consideration at present but the Deputy should be aware that there are divided views about the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the emigration of 35,000 people this year will save the Exchequer £16 million in unemployment assistance payments and, furthermore, in view of the fact that these people will pay £150,000 in &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; money, that is travel tax, surely we can find something more than £250,000 which is there by way of DÍON funding for this type of worthy project?  As a Mayo man could I say that the response from Mayo <Col N="996" /> people is one of immense let down unless there is a positive response in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I do not accept the figure of 35,000 but apart from that it is a question of allocating scarce resources as beneficially as possible.  We have to examine each project and each application on its own merits and on what its purposes are and what it is likely to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ambassadors are appointed by the President on the nomination of the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if they have considered this matter and if, as we encourage members of the public service to take career breaks and to broaden their horizons and experience should it not be a two way process of giving the members of the public and, indeed, established figures in business, in industry, in education or elsewhere opportunities of representing this country at the highest diplomatic level?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is something that is well worth considering and it is something that would have to be decided <i>ad rem</i>.  As the Deputy well knows, the tradition is that ambassadors are almost universally career diplomats.  That system has worked well but, as the Deputy pointed out, the whole scene is changing and we are into an entirely new position with regard to the preparations for the single market in Europe and in other areas.  I can do no more than assure the Deputy that this is something that will be kept in mind.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>Since Ireland's accession to the European Community in 1973, State visits to Ireland have been made by the Heads of State of six Community member countries. These visits were by the following: the Queen of Denmark in 1978; the President of Germany in 1980; the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1982; the President of Italy in 1986; the King of Spain in 1986; the President of France in 1988.</P>
      <P>The President of Ireland has also made State visits to five Community member countries.  These include one by President Childers to Belgium in 1974 and the following by President Hillery to: Germany in 1977 and again in 1984; Luxembourg in 1978; Denmark in 1978; the Netherlands in 1986.  In addition, President Ó Dálaigh and President Hillery visited the Institutions of the European Community in 1975 and 1987 respectively.</P>
      <P>In accordance with international practice, the announcement of any visit by a Head of State is agreed mutually between the two Governments concerned.  Prior to the issue of such an announcement it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any proposed visit by the President abroad or by a foreign Head of State to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the significance of the Aghalane Bridge and the inconvenience its closure has caused to people residing in the locality.  I am also aware of the detrimental economic effect which this closure has had on the town of Belturbet which has been cut off from its natural hinterland in Fermanagh.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree to give this matter the priority it deserves because the closing of the bridge has had serious consequences for the town of Belturbet and the people of the area? The bridge is located on the through road from Cavan to Enniskillen and a line of traffic that is important to the town of Belturbet has been cut off.

      <P>As to the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on 2 March last.  My colleague told the Dáil on that occasion that he did not intend to introduce a unilateral ban on the export of computers to South Africa.  He explained that such exports are allowed only under licence issued by him; that such licences are issued for only three months at a time, in order to allow continuous monitoring; and that, for the issue of a licence he requires, in accordance with the spirit of the relevant mandatory resolution of the UN Security Council, an undertaking from the consignee that the goods will not be used for military or police purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the second part of the question, it is Ireland's practice to accord formal <Col N="1003" /> recognition only to States.  However, the Government acknowledge the special status which the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity have accorded to both the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist Congress. We have called, together with our EC partners, for the ban on these and other organisations to be lifted, and we have maintained contact with ANC representatives in southern Africa.</P>

The purpose of my question is to press the Government to further that policy.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that such an undertaking from the South African Government can be accepted.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that computer and high technology equipment exported is not used in furtherance of the apartheid system for which computerisation is very important?</P>

In addition, will the Taoiseach agree that where opposition forces are struggling with the support of the vast majority of the country involved, it is rather vague to be saying that after the struggle is over such forces when in Government will be recognised?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of European Political Co-operation (EPC) and the nature of our involvement in it are not essentially changed by the Single European Act which codifies and formalises in treaty form the process of political co-operation in which we have been involved for 15 years.  The EPC process remains one through which the EC member states, operating on the basis of consensus, exchange information, consult together and seek to adopt common positions and to take joint action in the foreign policy field.  The co-ordination of positions on security questions which is part of the EPC process relates to political and economic but not to military aspects of security or to procurement for military purposes.  This distinction is spelled out in the Single European Act.  In its declaration at the time of ratification the Government made explicit their position <Col N="1007" /> that the provisions of the Single European Act do not affect Ireland's long-established policy of military neutrality. Irish neutrality is further safeguarded by the consensus rule on which EPC is based: no joint position can be adopted or action taken without the full agreement of all partners.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the draft resolution to which the Deputy refers and which is still under consideration in the European Parliament.  The proposal in the draft that there be political links between the European Community and the Western European Union is one with which, of course, the Government do not agree.  We cannot accept that there be any organic linkage between, on the one hand, the Community and EPC and, on the other, a military alliance such as the WEU.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a sort of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.  Different members come to all these international gatherings with different priorities.  For instance, there is a meeting of seven states taking place at the moment in Toronto.  Some of those states are members of the European Community and some are not.  The states at that gathering who are members of the European Community give expression to their own point of view, their own attitude and their own policy. The same applies in WEU.

Is the Taoiseach aware that the Reagan/ Gorbachev meetings are making the possibility of nuclear war recede, but that there is still the possibility of wars, even local wars, within Europe?  Is he aware that there is a renewed debate on EC co-operation for arms procurement <Col N="1011" /> and research and development &mdash; sophisticated weaponry, a military-type <i>esprit</i> programme, the successful programme in the civilian area &mdash; in the military sphere within the EC?

      <P>These are complex matters.  In broad terms I would like to reply by referring the Deputy to my speech to the Special Disarmament Conference in the United Nations when I gave my views very comprehensively on all these matters.  I have indicated that in my view while we welcome the progress made, there was no question that anybody could regard the danger as having been completely averted so far as nuclear warfare is concerned.  I also mentioned chemical warfare and war by means of conventional armaments.  I think I gave a reasonably straightforward outline of the possibilities and the dangers in regard to all those matters in that speech.</P>
      <P>In regard to EPC, with which we are concerned in this question, all I can do is reiterate the principles, which are, that we are prepared to discuss and co-operate in the economic and social aspects of security; we are not prepared to be involved in the military aspects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The Government were not consulted about the building of these installations or the equipment used in them.  The concern of local people on either side of the Border about possible health hazards has been raised with the British authorities in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  The British authorities have rejected charges that equipment in the installations emits harmful radiation as completely untrue. Mr. John Stanley, MP, Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office also made a statement to this effect in the House of Commons on 15 March 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it injudicious of the British authorities not to have informed his Government that they were erecting 24 observations posts and the possible health hazards posed by the emitting of radiation?  X-band radiation is used in these posts and there is deep concern on both sides of the Border because of the high incidence of reported skin cancer cases.  The use of X-band radiation was the subject of an international scandal when used by the Russian authorities to bug the US embassy in Moscow in 1970. Each member of the staff in that embassy was to some degree affected by radiation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>The Government are convinced that the only certain way of <Col N="1016" /> ending the cycle of repression and violence which for so long has afflicted the lives of those Palestinians living in the occupied territories is by means of a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Such a settlement should guarantee the right of all states in the region, including Israel, to exist within secure frontiers and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination with all that this implies.  The imposition of sanctions of the kind suggested by the Deputy would not contribute toward achievement of this objective.  Neither would it lead to a reduction in the present level of tension in the area.</P>
      <P>I would reiterate the Government's deep concern at events in the occupied territories.

      <P>The Government have not taken any specific action in relation to the Berlin Wall.

      <P>I consider the CSCE the most appropriate forum in which to raise the kind of concerns addressed by the Deputy.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Communities' programme for the completion of the internal market by 1992 involves the removal of barriers to free movement of persons, goods and services and capital within the Community.  As part of this process it is intended to reduce and simplify border controls on the movement of individuals as much as possible, and a draft directive to achieve this end has been under discussion in the council for some time.  It was accepted at an early stage, however, that member states would retain the ability to maintain at their discretion systematic checks for security purposes at their frontiers, including intra-Community frontiers.</P>
      <P>The Government will, of course, continue to impress upon the British authorities the need to operate all such controls in a sensitive and non-discriminatory manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are two separate matters.  One is the Community directive in which we are naturally participating fully in what has been decided and it is agreed there that the member states will have the authority to have security checks.  The other side of it is that we pursue bilaterally with the British authorities the position of travel for Irish citizens between here and Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears from the Taoiseach's response that it would be still permissible for the Prevention of Terrorism Act to operate in a discriminatory <Col N="1023" /> way against Irish persons entering Britain after 1992.  Could I have confirmation of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive is not finalised yet but, in regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the way forward there is for us to pursue that directly with the British authorities and to continually try to improve matters and avoid incidents of the kind that have happened. On the other hand, we must acknowledge that the British have their own security concerns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 27 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has followed the case of the Sharpeville Six with concern and the House will recall the reply the Tánaiste gave to a Private Notice Question on 15 March last.</P>
      <P>As soon as the rejection of the Sharpeville Six's applications for a retrial was announced, the Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, including Ireland, considered the situation and issued a statement on 14 June.  In it the Twelve expressed their deep distress and concern about the fate of the Sharpeville Six and urged that all legal options available in South Africa be used to prevent the death penalty from being carried out.  The Presidency's representative in Pretoria was instructed to make immediate representations on behalf of the Twelve to the South African Government in this matter.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that the decision of the judge announced on 13 June can be appealed by the Six in the period up to 19 July to both the Chief Justice of South Africa, and to President Botha. The legal process, therefore, is not yet totally exhausted.</P>
      <P>In view of the very serious concern which the Government and the people of Ireland feel about the case of the Sharpeville Six a number of representations were made to the South African authorities, including one with which I was personally associated, seeking clemency for the Six in March when their execution appeared imminent.  These were made through the Irish Embassy in London.  It remains the earnest hope of the Irish Government that these executions will not take place and it is to be hoped that the legal procedures still available will be used successfully on behalf of the Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will keep the question of making further bilateral representations to the <Col N="1025" /> South African authorities under consideration but I am satisfied that the South African Government is well aware of the views not only of Ireland, but of the world, in the matter and that the Twelve approach has reiterated adequately our deep concern.  If at any time a further bilateral approach by Ireland would appear possibly useful, the Deputies may rest assured that it will be made.</P>
    <P>Policy with regard to South Africa is kept under review.  However, the aim of Irish policy is to seek to bring effective pressure to bear on the South African Government peacefully to abandon apartheid.  It continues to be the view of the Government that concerted multilateral action is a more effective way of pressurizing Pretoria than any unilateral action Ireland might take.</P>
    <P>The African Group at the United Nations brought the matter before the Security Council in March last and would appear likely to do so again.  The Security Council has already appealed for clemency to the South African Government in the case, an appeal which we wholeheartedly support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his extensive reply and I should like also to acknowledge the appeal with which he was associated in his office as Taoiseach.  In view of the fact that the Foreign Ministers of West Germany and Holland have issued public statements in the last few days indicating that in the event of the executions going ahead they will reconsider their position in relation to unilateral sanctions, can I again ask the Taoiseach if he would reconsider the question of Ireland taking a unilateral sanction position on the importation of South African coal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we have already some limited unilateral action and I would not rule out further action of that kind.  On the other hand, I think the Deputy might agree that multilateral action is far more effective and compelling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, of course, that multilateral action is more effective than unilateral action but can I ask the Taoiseach if it would be appropriate at this time, going back again to the West German and Dutch position, to restate the Irish sanctions position and, that having been restated, to say that Ireland intends to give a lead in relation to imposing sanctions by announcing our position in relation to, for example, coal, making our position firmer and giving a lead to the Community, given that two members have gone in this direction already?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Taoiseach what exactly has taken place in relation to an all-party conference.  A number of commentators have referred to this and if the Taoiseach looks at Question No. 29 in my name he will see that there is at least some confusion in the media about <Col N="1027" /> whether documents were exchanged with the Official Unionist Party.  The Official Unionist leader said he had not received any documents; yet a spokesman for the Government is alleged to have said that a document was sent.  I hope the Taoiseach will avail of this opportunity to clear up that misunderstanding and also tell us precisely what he has done about getting this all-party conference off the ground &mdash; whether he has approached the British Government, individual leaders or parties in the North of Ireland or spoken to any parties here?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, if we were to judge by the public response of those Unionist leaders, the likelihood of that are at best remote?  Has the Taoiseach taken any steps to approach them privately to find out if there is a possibility of even having informal discussions with them at another location?  I think the Taoiseach would agree that too much expectation has been built into what has happened between him and the Unionist Party and that the ordinary work on behalf of the Nationalists in the North of Ireland has been ignored in the meantime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill I am recommending to you for approval is a short one, required for technical reasons, to facilitate payment of part of our budget contribution to the European Communities for 1988.  It arises under the terms of an undertaking given by all member states as a result of the agreement reached at the European Council last February on new funding arrangements for the EC budget.  This undertaking was required to provide adequate revenue for the 1988 EC budget pending finalisation of the detailed arrangements on a permanent basis for the operation of the proposed new own resources system.  The obligation to make this payment may arise shortly and accordingly it is necessary to have the appropriate legislative authority without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the system in operation up to now, the EC budget contribution of each member state has comprised customs duties, agricultural levies and a percentage of the VAT base.  From 1986, the <Col N="1099" /> maximum allowable percentage was set at 1.4 per cent but this percentage was already reached in that year, clearly limiting the scope for any further expansion of community expenditure.  In addition, the VAT system was not fully satisfactory as it did not represent fairly the relative wealth of member states, since the VAT base varies quite a lot between states as a proportion of GNP &mdash; from 42 per cent in Italy, to 62.5 per cent in Ireland and 70 per cent in Portugal.  GNP is generally accepted as a good measure of prosperity and ability to pay and the new agreed system reflects this.  It provides that the VAT contribution of 1.4 per cent will be retained, but with the important modification that the base on which it will be charged will be limited to 55 per cent of GNP.  Thus Ireland will be charged 1.4 per cent on a base of 55 per cent GNP rather than on the higher full VAT base. The balance of the contributions will be raised on the basis of the share of member states' GNP in total EC GNP.  As well as changing the composition of contributions under the own resources system, the European Council took a decision on the overall level of revenue which will be available to the European Communities: this will involve a new ceiling of 1.2 per cent of Community GNP for payment appropriations.  In the past we have experienced a succession of crises related to the EC budget.  There have been continuing shortages of funds to fulfil obligations and dire warnings of impending bankruptcy.  On reasonable assumptions, the new arrangements should guarantee adequate funding for Community policies for a considerable period ahead.</P>
    <P>While it is intended that the new system will apply for 1988, the procedure required to bring a new own resources decision into force at Community level is somewhat cumbersome and is unlikely to be completed until late in the year.  In order to provide adequate revenue for the 1988 budget in advance of the completion of the procedure, it was necessary for member states to give an undertaking to provide funds in advance of the coming <Col N="1100" /> into effect of the new own resources decision.  This was done through an intergovernmental agreement and it is necessary for me to seek specific approval for this extra payment for technical reasons. As you are aware, our normal EC contribution is made from the Central Fund under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  That Act provides that the EC Treaties and all other Community laws are directly binding in Ireland.  However, the undertaking given on 7 March 1988 at the ECOFIN Council is by its nature a voluntary undertaking and it is not possible to make payments under it without this new legislation.  Some of you may recall that similar legislation was required in 1984 to allow payments under undertakings given in 1984 and 1985.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (a) of the Bill covers payments to be made under the undertaking of 7 March.  However, the figures included in the undertaking were provisional pending the completion of the EC budgetary process and agreement on outstanding issues on the details of the new own resources system.  It is possible, therefore, that instead of seeking payments under the existing agreement of 7 March, a new agreement with the final figures will be formally agreed in the near future.  Section 2 (b) is included in this Bill to provide for this possibility.</P>
    <P>Ireland's net contribution to the EC budget in 1988 will be about £252 million. This latter figure reflects a £20 million saving as a result of the budget contribution being calculated under the new system as compared with the position if the old system had remained in place. The Bill before the House relates solely, however, to the payment of approximately £32 million out of our total contribution. This is the amount expected to be required under the intergovernmental agreement.  I want to emphasise that this is not additional expenditure and that it is already taken into account in our figures for 1988.</P>
    <P>The figure of £32 million is not finally settled yet but I have no reason to believe that there will be a significant variation on this.  Concern has been expressed from <Col N="1101" /> the Opposition benches that this Bill does not set an upper limit on the amount which can be issued from the Exchequer in respect of this agreement.  While I do not accept that it is necessary to specify a limit in this case, I am prepared, in order to allay any concern, to introduce such a limit by way of amendment on Committe Stage.  I propose to set this ceiling at £40 million to allow for the possibility, however remote, of an increase in the estimated contribution.</P>
    <P>Our contribution to the Community budget is substantial but it has to be seen in the context of the present and potential benefits of EC membership.  Ireland's net receipts from the EC budget after taking account of the contribution totalled £6,000 million in the years 1973-1987 or about £10,000 million in 1987 prices.  In 1986, the latest year for which comparable statistics are available, Ireland's net transfers from the Community budget represented 4.9 per cent of our gross domestic product, the highest percentage of all the member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland will, of course, continue to benefit substantially from the Community budget.  The package agreed by the European Council in Brussels on 11-12 February ensures that the Common Agricultural Policy will be broadly maintained with moderate real increases in expenditure and that the provisions for the Structural Funds will be doubled in real terms by 1993.  This agreement on the Structural Funds will make a significant contribution to cohesion.  I might mention that economic and social cohesion is now a Treaty obligation, to be taken into account in all Community policies.  This will be particularly important to Ireland when implementing the fundamental changes that are envisaged towards completion of the internal market.  While there may be a growing awareness that the deadline is 1992 and that this is no longer in the distant future, the evidence so far would suggest that there is not sufficient appreciation of this.  We are by no means an exception as the same problem is being encountered in other member states.  The Government will be taking steps shortly to create an adequate <Col N="1102" /> awareness of what the changes could mean for our economy and what is required to get the maximum benefit from the new order of things.</P>
    <P>Completion of the internal market will offer us substantial new opportunities provided we are adequately prepared to take advantage of the situation.  Some of the adjustments required of us will be difficult.  In an entirely open market we will stand to lose heavily if we fail to manage our affairs properly and we should be in no doubt about the importance of this.  The Government's approach to preparation for the internal market will be positive.  We will press ahead as soon as we reasonably can with changes to meet our new obligations.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will be aware of the importance of the provision of sufficient revenue for the continuation and expansion of Community expenditure programmes, not alone in terms of their financial benefits to Ireland but more generally in their contribution to the development of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My party have no objection to this Bill.  It is necessary to provide, before the recess, that Government expenditure obligations that arise from EC contributions are met. It would be imprudent of the Government to go into recess without passing the Bill.</P>
      <P>The legislation arises from an undertaking given by all member states as a result of an agreement reached in the European Council last February and new funding arrangements for the budget.  As the Minister pointed out, the undertaking was required to provide adequate revenue for the 1988 EC budget, pending the finalisation of the detailed arrangements on a permanent basis for the operation of the proposed new own resources system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a major beneficiary from the EC, the Minister had no choice but to introduce the Bill.  I was interested in the Minister's figures.  We are all aware, in <Col N="1103" /> general terms, of the benefits of EC membership but it is interesting to note that the overall net contribution between 1973 and 1987 from the EC to our economy was £6.6 billion.  If we update that to 1987 prices it is almost £10 billion net to the Irish Exchequer.  In terms of our GNP the contribution made by transfers from the Community now represents 4.9 per cent of our gross domestic product.  This is the highest percentage of all member states.  Against that background, pending the implementation of the new agreement, and the details of the new own resources system, it is appropriate that this temporary facility should be provided to the Government by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I know the total amount involved is approximately £32 million out of a total annual contribution of £252 million.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister had no real choice but to introduce this Bill today. The spokesman for the Progressive Democrats made a number of points about the legality and constitutionality of this legislation.  There is no need for that concern, but I am pleased the Minister has moved to meet at least one of the objections by circulating an amendment to set a limit on the amount of funds that can be disbursed under the authority of this legislation.  In the amendment the figure set is £40 million which I presume is sufficient against an expected expenditure of £32 million.  When the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, was Minister for Finance in 1984 similar legislation was introduced and I understand that payments were made on foot of that legislation in 1984 and 1985 and that these did not give rise to any particular difficulty. I accept that it is necessary for the Minister to get the authority of the House to pay this portion of our contribution to EC funds.  I presume the Minister is using the authorisation which is necessary for non-voted expenditure rather than voted expenditure under an Estimate or a supplementary Estimate when he is bringing this Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>The issues which arise on the wider question of the new method of funding <Col N="1104" /> the EC and of the difficulties and opportunities which will arise as we approach 1992 and afterwards can be left for a more lengthy debate on another occasion.  As far as I and my party are concerned, this Bill is a routine measure of a technical nature which is necessary because the ultimate provisions under which EC funding will operate are not yet in place, and it is necessary for the Government to remain in good standing as a contributor to EC funds.  It would be invidious of us who are major net beneficiaries, who are constantly demanding further expenditure at EC level, particularly expenditure in peripheral economies, not to meet our obligations to the EC as they arise.  This legislation will enable the Minister to meet whatever contributory obligations may arise over the summer months.  I welcome the Bill and the amendments now moved by the Minister.  We will not be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill arrived through my letter box I was surprised at the terms in which it was phrased.  Section 2 seemed to give rise to a right on the part of the Executive to pay out of the Central Funds in unlimited amounts, moneys not only on foot of existing guarantees made to the other member states of the European Community, but also on foot of future guarantees with no limit as to the amount of those guarantees or the circumstances in which they might be made.  Although I fully appreciate that it is not intended to confine our efforts, in relation to assisting in the temporary impasse in European finances, to a sum in the order of that suggested by the Minister, it is not simply a question of lawyers' pedantry that we should establish a fundamental principle in this House, that we never give a blank cheque to the Government in any circumstances, or introduce a Bill the purport of which is to give a blank cheque to the Executive so that they can resort to the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there was any bad intention on the part of the Executive because the Minister is an exemplar of <Col N="1105" /> fiscal rectitude and control, and parsimony perhaps, in the manner in which the public's moneys are applied.  That was not in the back of my mind at all.  What was in the back of my mind, and it is something upon which I place a considerable amount of importance, is the general principle that this House must be responsible for what moneys it votes and what authority it gives to the Executive from time to time.  Since virtually the Middle Ages that has been the essential doctrine on which parliamentary control of the vote of supply to the State is based. It is something which we cannot wriggle out of or withdraw from or abdicate from in any way.</P>
    <P>It would be a major mistake if we set a precedent of putting before this House measures which seem to permit the Government of the day to withdraw in unspecified unlimited amounts, money from the Central Fund without further recourse to the Dáil.  It was for that reason that I made the statement which I made yesterday.  I made it simply to re-establish the principle that this House is supreme in matters of voting money, and is responsible.  It is not simply a matter of asserting a kind of sabre-rattling supremacy over the Government.  That is not what I am worried about.  I am worried about the acceptance of responsibility every time we vote money or give authority to any Minister to apply any amount of public money.  We should know how much that money is and we should know how much it cannot exceed. We should accept responsibility in those circumstances for such payments.  We should measure such a payment in terms of its relative importance to other possible drains on public finances.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that this sum of money seems to be about £32 million.  It seems to be a figure which is hard to quantify with exactitude because the amount of money is expressed in ECUs and its exact value in terms of Irish punts can fluctuate from day to day.  Be that as it may, the Minister is saying he has committed this State to an expenditure of around £32 million in <Col N="1106" /> support of the European budgetary process. It is, as Deputy Noonan pointed out, a small fraction of our overall contribution to the European Community.  I accept that, but the Minister then says that he cannot with absolute certainty say what amount he intends to be committed to between now and the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (b) gives the Minister powers to make further guarantees and give further undertakings to the European Commission to help defray costs.  It is implicit in the Bill that the exact extent of our obligations by reason of the undertaking already made and those to be made in the future has not been quantified and cannot, by definition, be quantified.  In these circumstances a limit must be set in legislation and it is constitutionally proper, and proper in terms of the order of this House, to set in a financial measure an upper limit to which the Executive can have recourse to the Central Fund, without further authority from here.</P>
    <P>In 1965 the House adopted the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, and its provisions permit expenditures to take place without direct authority from this House on the basis of an implied authority to spend up to 80 per cent of what was voted for the same purposes in the previous financial year.  That is legislation which I would hesitate to say was unconstitutional but I would hesitate, likewise, to say it was constitutional in that some of the provisions at any rate seem to infringe on the Constitution so far as it purports to authorise expenditure on an ongoing basis outside the financial year to which the legislation in question relates. That puts a question mark over that procedure. At the very least, it must be said that it is limited by reference to some amount, that is, 80 per cent of what was voted by the House for the same purpose in the previous year.</P>
    <P>This Bill as originally introduced by the Minister was unlimited.  It was unlimited in two respects; in amount and in addition it was unlimited in terms of the basis on which the liability which it would create for the Central Fund was to be computed because it gave the State an implied authority to go to Brussels and make further <Col N="1107" /> undertakings which would be binding upon the Central Fund and payable out of the Central Fund and its growing produce, without limit and without further recourse to this House.  I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister in this matter but I also equally and vehemently reiterate my view that this House should never contemplate a Bill which is unlimited in terms of the authority of the State to bind this House or to draw moneys out of the Central Fund without further recourse to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that provision has been made in this year's budget for the £32 million in question.  That was something which I must confess slipped past the keeper on this side of the House. Accepting that that is the case, why then do we have the uncertainties about the amount going up from £32 million to £40 million?  Is it correct for us as a House to simply give authority for an upper limit of £40 million without thinking through whether we want to allocate an additional £8 million or give the State the authority to allocate another £8 million at its discretion for the purposes in question?  Is it right that this House should effectively say: &ldquo;We will vote you £32 million, but to be on the safe side we will give you authority to expend up to £40 million to save you the bother of coming back to this House again and getting the balance&rdquo;. There is not a huge anti-European feeling in this House, as it is confined to a very small group, if any, in this House at present.  Nor is there any difficulty in getting a Bill such as this, which is enabling legislation, passed if needs be, but it seems wrong to say: &ldquo;Look, here is a Bill for £32 million but to be on the safe side, give me authority to go up to £40 million&rdquo;.  What are we doing?  Why is it that we should give authority to the State to commit us further in circumstances where we do not know why they will commit us further or on what basis we are making further undertakings? I believe it is correct and proper for the Government, if they need more money, to come back to this House and to ask us for it and tell us why those £7 <Col N="1108" /> million or £8 million are to be expended. A sum of £7 million or £8 million, as we know from all the trenchant debate which takes place in this House, in some areas, could effect dramatic transformations.  I need only mention the Ombudsman's Office and other areas to point out that money does not grow on trees and that £7 million or £8 million &mdash; although small in terms of European budgetary considerations &mdash; is substantial in terms of its political implications on some issues within this jurisdiction.  A sum of £7 million or £8 million should not be simply voted by way of authority to the Government to play around with or to use as bargaining material in some process in Europe unless we are satisfied that it is proper to spend those moneys and that the Government needs to spend those moneys on our behalf.  The proper thing to do in those circumstances is to come back to this House and to say: &ldquo;Look, you voted £32 million or £33 million, we have had to make several further undertakings, please give us the authority to expend a further £7 million or £8 million or whatever to meet unforseen obligations which we now have&rdquo;.  Why do we have to say: &ldquo;Look, do your best but you can expend up to £40 million&rdquo;.  That is a slipshod way of conducting public finances. It is not right in principle that an unforseen amount should be loosely calculated and a little extra thrown in on top just to save the Government the bother of spending another hour in the Dáil giving an explanation as to why these sums are due.</P>
    <P>People can argue one way or another about what is and is not within the competence of the Dáil to do.  I believe it is not within the competence of the Dáil at any stage to pass any Bill, the purport of which is to allow the Executive without any limit whatever to have recourse to the Central Fund.  Bearing in mind the Government's duty under Article 17 of the Constitution to prepare annual Estimates and the right of the Dáil to consider those Estimates and the prohibition on unestimated and unvoted expenditure laid down in certain provisions of the Constitution, I believe it was entirely in <Col N="1109" /> breach of the general right of Parliament to supervise and to be responsible for the moneys that it authorises the Government to lay out, for a Bill in these terms to be put before us.  I understand from Deputy Noonan that a similar measure was produced by Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance.  The fact that there is a precedent of that kind does not impress me; it worries me all the more and it makes me feel it was all the more important that somebody should stand up in this House and say: &ldquo;No more blank cheques.  Every time you come to this House looking for a certain sum of money, you come to this House with an explanation for it and you justify every last halfpenny of what you propose to expend.  If you want to make more undertakings in Europe you come back to this House and tell us what you have done and why it was necessary to spend those extra moneys in the manner contemplated&rdquo;. I am not nit-picking, I am not being pedantic or obstructive but I am insisting that we take responsibility for our job which is to ensure that the taxpayers' money is applied fairly and squarely in accordance with a rational explanation and in accordance with our view of the priorities of the situation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the European Community is of such fundamental importance to this country that we should not be niggardly in any way in our approach to it, that we should play our part fully and shoulder fairly and squarely our share of the burden of a budgetary impasse such as exists now in Europe.  I fully accept all those propositions.  I do not want it to be thought for one minute that I am mean-minded or petty in relation to the European Community.  I believe this House would not take such a view of its moral as well as legal obligations under the Treaty of Rome.  I understand from this Bill that, although these are not necessitated obligations under the 1972 Act, therefore requiring recourse to this House for authority, they are considered by the Government &mdash; and correctly so &mdash; to be moral obligations in terms of making the system work and politically being willing to take <Col N="1110" /> the necessary decisions to keep the European budgetary process in being and in good standing.</P>
    <P>This teaches us yet another lesson.  I was listening to Deputy Bruton talking about the European Patent Convention a few moments ago and saying it was a sad day for this House when the necessitated obligations provisions were written into the proposal to amend the Constitution and that the original wording as proposed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, which was &ldquo;obligations consequent on our membership&rdquo; was taken out.  Many things, such as the European Patent Convention and the need to get special authority for special measures such as this, flow from the fact that we take a very minimalist approach to our willingness to undertake our obligations as members of the European State, that we undertook, only to bring into law and to give financial support to necessitated obligations.  That was a sad day and it was a mistake which this House made.  If we need to have a referendum on a Patent Convention, it will show how foolish we were to have been so niggardly at the time.  In the process of constitutional reform whatever shape that takes over the next ten to 15 years, I certainly hope we get to the stage that necessitated obligations cease to be the extent to which we are obliged to comply with the European treaties and that we take a more open-minded and positive constitutional view of our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come before the House with a Bill that is unacceptable.  I readily acknowledge that he has decided to amend the Bill to include an upper limit although he denies there is a necessity to do so but I do not accept the amount of the upper limit.  I do not think it is right to produce out of the hat, to conjure out of thin air a figure of £40 million and ask if that will please all concerned as if the point I was making was a legalistic and technical one.  It is not.  My point goes to the root of the issue, we are voting to the Government authority to spend either £40 million or £32 million and we should not vote such authority to them unless there is a pressing case made for <Col N="1111" /> voting £40 million as opposed to £32 million. I accept that the ECU/Irish punt exchange rate may fluctuate and that it is reasonable in those circumstances to provide, perhaps on a £32 million liability as at present conceived, a £33 million liability.  I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage for that purpose but I cannot see why we should say, &ldquo;let us go for a nice round figure of £40 million and give the Government authority in regard to it&rdquo;.  That to me is irresponsible.  It is an abdication of parliamentary responsibility to say, &ldquo;choose any old round figure and do the best job you can for us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is part of the thinking that raised a question mark in the minds of the Progressive Democrats about the Bill and the manner in which it was cobbled together.  I suggest that it was cobbled together, perhaps on the basis of Deputy Dukes' precedent, in a hurry without giving adequate thought to the implications of it.  Although it is now limited I suggest that it should be limited more substantially and that the figure of £33 million should be inserted instead of the £40 million as suggested by the Minister. I want to make it clear that the House is not in the business of empowering the Government in nice round figures to go off and do the best they can for us in some bargaining process.  If the Government want more money let them come to the House and explain why it is necessary that the House should give it.  On that basis I want to indicate oppositon to the Minister's amendment and to the substance of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We are not opposing the Bill but I shall be expressing serious reservations about the Government's attitude to the EC and developments anticipated between now and 1992.  It is significant that the Bill is being put through the Dáil on the day after the Minister for Foreign Affairs withdrew the conditional reservations which Ireland had expressed about the promised level of EC support we would receive under the social, regional and farm funds, as decided by the Heads of Government in <Col N="1112" /> February.  The Minister announced yesterday that Ireland's reservation was being withdrawn and he seemed to indicate some guarantee about a doubling of funds.  However, there was no such guarantee despite the promise in the course of the Single European Act campaign.</P>
      <P>Our decision to join the EC in 1972 brought about the most significant change in our history from an economic point of view.  The changes that will occur between now and 1992 will be as important. They will be traumatic for some and, possibly, give opportunities to others.  There is no doubt that those changes will have a great impact on us all.  In the past the EC was described as a rich mans's club and that was a correct description at the time.  However, with the addition of Spain, Portugal and Greece that description is not altogether accurate.  Nevertheless, the EC is clearly based on preserving the developing capitalism in Europe and establishing the area as a power bloc.</P>
      <P>In 1972 our party opposed the country's entry into the EC for a variety of reasons.  The Community then consisted of six members, five of whom were former imperial powers.  At the time we believed it would be possible to develop an independent economy based on association with EC states and non-EC countries who had association agreements with the Community.  However, 15 or 16 years on our economy is so inextricably linked with the EC, financially, economically and even politically, that it would be very difficult for us to withdraw.  In addition, the entry of countries like Spain, Portugal and Greece, has given a new dimension to the EC.  As a result of their entry there may be further expansion in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the impact of EC membership here has been very mixed. Many of the predictions we made at the time of our entry proved to be true.  We still have a worry about political developments and the threat to our neutrality.  In social areas, and in regard to such issues as equal pay for women and so on, the Community has proved a positive force <Col N="1113" /> but on the economic front the traffic has been almost one-way.  In other words, it was seen to be a farmers' EC.  The farming community obtained great benefits but it was a siphoning-off process rather than a development of agriculture.  While that was happening there was a huge loss of jobs here.  When we joined the Community in 1972 we had what we thought was very high unemployment 80,000 people, and we thought the EC would help us overcome that problem and bring us to full employment.  I should point out that we did not think that was likely to happen but full employment was the prediction of those who advocated membership of the EC.  However, 16 years later there are 250,000 people unemployed and emigration has risen to almost 30,000 annually.</P>
    <P>During the course of the EC referendum campaign, and at European election campaigns since, posters have drawn attention to the prospect of markets in Europe for our products and more jobs at home but, unfortunately, such statements have proved to be wrong.  The forecasts of those who were opposed to our entry into the EC have been more in line with what has happened.  The slogan of those who opposed entry, &ldquo;into Europe; out of work&rdquo;, has proved to be more accurate.</P>
    <P>Many of the claims being made about the completion of the internal market by 1992 are similar to those made by people who advocated membership of the EC in the 1972 campaign.  I have no doubt that many of those claims will prove as unfounded as those made in 1972.  The EC has not brought benefit to major urban areas.  Dublin is just one example and no doubt there are other towns that ask, as Dublin asks, &ldquo;what has the EC done for us&rdquo;?  All they can see is huge job losses and companies going into liquidation.  There were many job losses in the clothing and footwear industries and in the car assembly industry.  Thousands of jobs have disappeared and they were not replaced by the new companies who were invited to establish industries here.  Many of the reasons for our high rate of unemployment are due to the <Col N="1114" /> terms under which we entered the EC in January 1973.  Negotiations at entry took place under a Fianna Fáil Government and much of them had taken place under a previous Government but whatever Government were involved they must be faulted for the terms of entry which led to the collapse of so many traditional industries.  They then failed to produce the bonanza of jobs to replace them.</P>
    <P>Since our entry to the EC each Government have failed to confront the issue that faced us on entry, namely, the fundamental weakness of the Irish economy in this strong European industrial bloc. That is a fundamental weakness which we all saw, and I am sure the Government saw, on entry.  It should have been tackled from the beginning but that has not been done.  We still have the same fundamental flaws and weaknesses in technology, marketing and in every area of the industrial and commercial life of the EC and we are failing for that reason. That is what frightens me about 1992.  We do not seem to have used our 18 years' membership to develop the type of economy that will be essential if we are to have harmonisation under the Single European Act and if we are to face the competition on equal terms within an EC free market both abroad and at home.</P>
    <P>There is no sense of urgency by the Government, even half-way through 1988, to cure that fundamental ailment which we have had since we entered the EC.  Are we going to continually go around with the sort of begging bowl attitude of the IFA and people like that within the EC rather than face up to the challenges?  Everybody talks about what a marvellous challenge it is, but a challenge is no use unless you are able to defeat it.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position to meet and defeat the challenges as we should be.  That is the problem.</P>
    <P>We have always believed that at least a doubling of the Structural Fund was necessary to protect the country from the full impact of the completion of the internal market in 1992.  Given the failure of the Irish economy, capitalism and successive Governments to develop our <Col N="1115" /> economy and our infrastructure, particular measures are needed to ensure that Ireland does not fall even further behind the other more advanced European countries.  This need has been recognised by many other people.  In February last the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, speaking in Strasbourg, stressed the need for the Community to devote more resources to the poorer member states, warning that Ireland did not want to become the Appalachia of western Europe.  He said that economic and monetary integration would not necessarily improve the lot of poorer countries.  This is something we do not seem to have grasped.  Irish concern about integration represented a real fear that the achievement of economic and monetary union would result in the further impoverishment of the less developed countries at the periphery. This is a possibility, more likely as each year goes by, unless counter-measures are taken.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that The Workers' Party said that prior agreement on the extent of the increase in funding for the Social and Regional Funds should be a precondition for ratification of the Single European Act.  During the referendum campaign, we were assured by supporters of the Act that the total allocation for the Community's Regional and Social Funds would be doubled and that Ireland would be entitled to the same percentage of the enlarged fund as it had received in previous years of the smaller fund.  This was the proposal made by the President of the EC Commission, Mr. Delors, last year but since then consistent efforts have been made by the wealthier countries to water down the proposal.  If the commitment contained in the Delors proposal had been honoured, Ireland would have stood to gain more than £860 million.  It appears that Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Haughey have settled for less than £600 million.  It can be seen that the advice of The Workers' Party during the referendum campaign on the Single European Act that a firm, unambiguous commitment on the extent of increases <Col N="1116" /> in Structural Funds should have been a precondition of ratification of the Single European Act was sound political sense.  Supporters of the Act told the public that this was an unnecessary safeguard.</P>
    <P>What has been holding the fort since is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had a conditonal reservation imposed but that was withdrawn yesterday.  I do not think any guarantee was asked for &mdash; certainly it was not received.  It was made clear yesterday that there is no absolute guarantee that Ireland will achieve a doubling of our 1987 allocation by 1992. That was something we were all promised under the Single European Act but the Minister has now withdrawn his reservation and there is no going back.  The European Communities (Funding) Bill is now going through and we will just take whatever we are given.  The people who work hardest in trying to grab their share are the ones who will get it.  There will be an overall doubling of the funds available but who will get those funds?  No guarantee has been given that we will get them unless we scramble for them like everybody else in a rather ridiculous fashion.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing the Bill but we are sounding a warning note that we have not heard the last of this issue.  We are again going blindfold to the EC to see what we can grab.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When reading and listening to the Minister's speech what struck me most of all was his cumulation of the benefits which we are estimated to have received from the EC over the years since we have joined.  We have received £10 billion since 1973.  When one thinks of a figure like that and remembers that it represents the big end of an entire year's budget, one has to ask oneself where has all the money gone.  What has happened to that £10 billion?  How much of it is visible in increased investment, in widely increased industrial employment or in a much improved infrastructure?  I do not deny that there are visible improvements but they are almost all at, what I might call, the consumption level.  I do not <Col N="1117" /> despise that either because even the provision of goods and services for consumption implies employment and the spreading around of wealth but I am not sure we have made the most use of that £10 billion over and above what might have been there had we not been a member of the Community at all.  A great deal of it has seeped away in unproductive consumption and the fault for that must lie not with the European Community which is not in any way to blame for that, but in ourselves and in the defective leadership and irresponsible financial stewardship which Governments since that time have favoured us with.</P>
      <P>It is a sobering thought to ask oneself what has happened to all that money.  It certainly does not appear to have been roosting in the mattresses of the farming community to judge by their never ceasing complaints about this and that, and I am not so sure I can see it in any high profile around the country, if you except the very large increase in the number of prosperous one-off houses, many of them in areas which a good planning policy would have prohibited from being built. Unquestionably there are sectors, such as holiday tour operators, garden centres and so fourth, which exist in a level of prosperity which was unknown in 1972 or 1973.  Leaving these things aside, I wonder if we can put our hands on our hearts and say that that £10 billion has been laid out to the best advantage, in particular for the most productive advantage so far as enabling us to take off from a higher level is concerned.</P>
      <P>We are always lecturing the poorer nations and others about how our approach to them consists not in giving them a sack of potatoes to eat today but in training them to plant their own potatoes for tomorrow.  We have not applied that lesson to ourselves in the way in which the benefits of EC membership have been consumed, and in particular the benefits of a non-financial kind that have been as good as totally ignored here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some curious level of the Irish brain, connected with its history and infantile recollections of ballads and so on, a lot of words which, in the same <Col N="1118" /> language in other countries or in their linguistic equivalent in other languages, hold overtones of disparagement, like &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; or &ldquo;felon&rdquo; which in this country seems to mean something different and to be worth a cheer and raising a glass to. I do not want to belittle, or appear to make a small point or short work of what I read as the plight of our illegal emigrants to the United States, but presumably they went knowing their status. I know a travel agent who tells me that he has sold hundreds of tickets in the last year or so to people who tell him that they will not be using the return half of their ticket.  People who go to a foreign country in such conditions cannot expect to be dealt with otherwise than as illegal immigrants.  I am genuinely sorry for somebody stuck in that position through no fault of his own, but I know many people have left jobs in Ireland and travelled that way, and I know a very large number who are not in that category, but that will not save me from the imputation that I have said otherwise because I can never touch a theme like this without being misrepresented.  Nevetheless that is so.</P>
    <P>When I read about the plight of the illegals and the Government expecting gratitude for giving £250,000 to emigrant sectors in London for wretched, uninstructed, penniless people who arrive there without jobs, qualifications or a roof over their heads, what I would like to know is this: why have we not made use over the last 15 years of freedom of movement, the freedom of establishment, which membership of the EC is supposed to provide us with?  We have done nothing on that level and no Government have tried to encourage anybody to do anything on that level, and no Government have planned for use of that facility, educationally, industrially or any other way.</P>
    <P>When I say there are opportunities in Germany or Holland, people look at me as if I had two heads, as though it were in some way unreasonable to expect them to make use of an opportunity of that sort which requires, say, a linguistic capacity which no one has led them to suppose <Col N="1119" /> would ever be necessary.  That is an area in which we have not made use of our EC membership.</P>
    <P>All this talk about £10 billion does not impress me one bit.  It would have been far more to the point had the opportunities which the EC offer us of widening our horizons to the European continent been grasped with both hands, if it had been seen as somewhere open to us to conquer, as it still is.  We have a lot of work to do before that becomes a reality and there will be many a laugh at the expense of people who say these things before it is a reality.  That is what we have let go in our EC membership all for the sake of £10 billion, much of which I believe has been dissipated unproductively.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy McDowell talk about how unhappy he was at the niggling spirit of Fine Gael in 1972.  I do not want to make a personal jibe at his expense, but he may have been willing to sincerely defend the caution on the part of Fine Gael in those days.  Being a fair bit older than Deputy McDowell, I remember, probably better than he does, the original expression in the Fianna Fáil draft for the extra section in Article 29 which, as he said, spoke of measures which were consequent on membership.  This party, oddly enough, were as concerned about national sovereignty, repugnant though that proposition is to the national orthodoxy represented by gentlemen over there, were not anxious to give a blank cheque to whichever Government were in office and were not anxious to have it said we could do this in the sense that it was a consequence that ought to follow. We said &mdash; and I still think &mdash; that &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; is the correct expression.</P>
    <P>We also had to deal on our left with a conglomeration of parties, some of them constitutional and some of them slightly less so together with a ragtag and bobtail of every gunman and bully in the country, advising us to vote no.  As it happened, they only raked up 16 per cent or 17 per cent of the vote, most of that harvested by a very decent and rational campaign conducted by the Labour Party and by <Col N="1120" /> one or two non-political movements outside. One of the reasons which induced many people to vote yes was when they looked at the kind of people &mdash; I do not mean the Labour Party &mdash; who were urging them to vote no.  They were looking across the political field far outside the walls of this House, looking at gunmen and savages of every kind and description saying &ldquo;vote no, you will be destroyed if you go into Europe&rdquo;.  My feeling was that we would be destroyed if we did not go into Europe, if we were left at their mercy, and I still feel that way.  The more integration we can have with Europe, if for that reason alone, the better because it will give every last Dane, Italian and Dutchman a vested interest in maintaining civilisation on this island, something I would not have been confident of seeing happen had the people I am speaking about got their way, or should they ever get their way.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, necessary politically for this party not for short-term political gain but in the longer view as it seemed to us at the time, to tighten up that expression and to make it clear that the Constitution would only cover whatever, in the way of legislation or Government activity, was clearly obligatory on our signing of the Treaty of Rome.  I could not apologise for that now.  I know it is a nuisance, there are all kinds of nuisances in the law.  I could not apologise for having been a very small part of the machine which added that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell also spoke &mdash; and I have a lot of sympathy with his general position about this &mdash; about the need for the Dáil to have control over its expenditure. Although this is a proposition which has a very respectable and dramatic history in this part of the world and in the constitutional tradition to which we belong, going back to the 17th century and beyond, it is in very large measure something of a fiction in this country.  If we are going to have a review of the Constitution &mdash; I hope I will be believed in saying that this is not another cut at Deputy McDowell &mdash; I propose that we do not merely confine it to thinking up ways of flattering pluralist cranks, the <Col N="1121" /> kind of people who would be offended if the Angelus is played at 6 o'clock, before the television news.  It would be more important if we were to do it bit by bit as necessity dictated.  If it were being proposed by any party to look at those parts of the Constitution which bear on the State's finances, that would be a holy and a wholesome exercise.  We might find a lot of agreement among all sides in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is not rational that, in this House which thinks it has control over public expenditure, we cannot ask questions about large decisions made by CIE or by the IDA.  We can ask questions, but not in the same way as about direct Government expenditure, in relation to the disposal of lottery funds or things done by Telecom or An Post.  Where is the sense in talking about control over State moneys when this House is foreclosed from discussing the disposal of colossal sums of State money which the public have had to provide in whole or in part or money expended by concerns against the failure of which the public are regarded as being an insurer?  Even in the insurance industry, which is not in the public sphere, the public have had to step in and insure.</P>
    <P>Either we give up the fiction about the Dáil having control over public expenditure or bring practice somewhat more into line with reality.  The Dáil's control over past expenditure is very defective. By the time the Committee of Public Accounts get their teeth into some detail which has surfaced in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the damage has been done and the liabilities have been run up.  Somebody on the committee may get a headline or two by lambasting some official who has been drawn from the comfortable gloom of the office where he normally works and is spending an uncomfortable hour or two in Setanta Buildings with a lot of Deputies trying to make headlines out of his skin. That kind of control is extremely imperfect. The horse is gone from the stable by then.  For the Dáil to flatter itself that the Committee of Public Accounts, or <Col N="1122" /> the Committee on Public Expenditure which existed in an uneasy relationship with it during the last Dáil, represents an effective check on expenditure is to delude itself.  It may well be that a particular official will pay attention to some detail next time because he will not have forgotten the scalding he received the last time.  That is, of course, very salutary but it does not get the money back again or guarantee that there will not be some further loss to the public in the future through some different chink in the armour.</P>
    <P>This Bill apparently has a precedent in a Bill from our own side in 1984 or thereabouts.  I did not know this until I heard Deputy Noonan very fairly admit it.  I am sorry it has this precedent.  I accept that there is nothing in any way sinister in the intent which the Bill incorporates and I naturally accept every word the Minister has said about it.  In a general way it is undesirable to have the Dáil authorising an expenditure of which no detail appears in the Bill.  Admittedly the Bill refers to an undertaking by the Government but it does not give any explanation of what the undertaking is about, nor is there any hint that the expenditure is of a quite exceptional kind.  It is not altogether without precedent for the exceptional character of a measure enacted here to come through in the Bill's title.  This Bill might have been more properly titled had the word in parenthesis in the title read not &ldquo;funding&rdquo; but &ldquo;exceptional funding&rdquo;.  I understand it is an exceptional measure intended only to tide the Community over the technical difficulties which this year will present. The format in general is undesirable and I should not like it to be resorted to by State draftsmen in the future in some quite different context which might have nothing to do with the Eruopean Community.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember the history of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act of 1957 or 1958 introduced when Mr. Lemass was Taoiseach.  For some reason he had charge of the Bill in the House, to the best of my recollection.  I must <Col N="1123" /> confess my financial expertise is insufficient for me fully to understand the reason for its introduction.  It was designed purely as an emergency technical measure to combat some disastrous movement in Irish currency.  That measure is still on the Statute Book and can be resorted to this afternoon by the Minister if he so chooses in order to put an unlimited amount of extra taxation on people through the excise mechanism. The Act provides that the imposition of duty is valid and does not have to be authorised by this House until the end of the year next after that in which the duty is imposed.  In other words, the Minister could, by the stroke of a pen, impose a duty without any need to have it authorised by this House until New Year's Eve, 1989.  If I have misremembered any details of that Act, I apologise.  I believe I am correct in its substance.</P>
    <P>I remember such an imposition in the early days of Liam Cosgrave's Coalition Government when Richie Ryan as Minister for Finance put 15p on a gallon of petrol at the time of the oil crisis.  At least that Government did not leave it to be said that the Dáil had no opportunity of debating it.  A couple of days of Dáil business were given up to debating that measure, which instantly put tens of millions of pounds into the Government's hands.  That is an example of how a legislative technique or format adopted for an emergency or exceptional purpose became normalised, part of the scenery.</P>
    <P>The constitutionality of the Imposition of Duties Act is highly suspect.  I can see that there may be a necessity for such a thing but it does not appear to me to square with what the Constitution says about the Dáil's control over finance.  It might be well to look at the parts of the Constitution which deal with State finances, without causing any annoyance in this world or the next, to see if they could be brought more into line with the requirement of the present day.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to ask, not in any rhetorical or argumentative way, is whether there is before the Dáil a message from the Government signed by the <Col N="1124" /> Taoiseach recommending the purpose of this expenditure to the House.  Every Deputy will have seen such messages in his pigeon hole.  They are sent by the Government and signed by the Taoiseach in conformity with paragraph 2 of Article 17 of the Constitution, which states:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It may be the practice to allow a Bill to roll through this House and to produce this message at the last moment.  I certainly have not seen such a message today in my pigeon hole.  Perhaps other Deputies have.  I wonder if the practice is merely to circulate this thing at a later stage and whether that conforms with Article 17. As I read it, we are not even allowed to agree the motion for a Second Reading of this Bill in its absence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Deputies Noonan and Kelly have made the point that the European Communities (Supplementary Funding) Act, 1984, was a precedent for this Bill and therefore there is nothing particularly novel or unusual about it.  With the greatest respect, I would disagree with them because it is not a precedent.  The 1984 Act is different.  At first sight it looks very much the same because the drafting of it is the same, but the Bill before us talks about making payments to the European Communities and they are outright payments. What the 1984 Act dealt with and gave permission for was the making to the Commission by the Government out of the Central Fund of what are described as reimbursable advances.  In other words, in 1984 we were lending money to the Commission which the Commission were obliged to repay when they had the resources to do it, and which I hope and presume they did repay.  To lend money on the basis that it is going to be repaid, particularly where it is a major public institution like the European Commission where one can expect to be repaid, is totally different to actually making outright payments in this case, again to the Commission, with no expectation of repayment.  Therefore the 1984 Act is in no sense a precedent and the reservations expressed by Deputies McDowell and Kelly about the whole principle of a Bill like this allowing the Government to make unspecified payments without coming back to the Dáil is, in my view, wrong.  The reservations that Deputy McDowell had about it are perfectly valid and well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, entirely in response to what Deputy McDowell had to say yesterday, has partly mended his hand by putting a limit in.  I am glad he did it because if this Bill were passed in its original form without the major amendment &mdash; and it is a major amendment which changes the whole nature of this Bill &mdash; it stood a grave risk of being unconstitutional.  It may seem only a <Col N="1126" /> minor amendment because it is the insertion of only half a dozen words and a figure, but it affects the principle of the Bill enormously by putting a limit on it, and I am very glad it does.  The Bill is utterly different to the Act of 1984 which was making a repayable loan and does not talk about anything other than what it describes as reimbursable advances.</P>
    <P>This is quite different.  I am concerned about the whole principle of the Dáil being expected, or the Government being allowed, to undertake obligations of this kind and to come along in a Bill like this and say that it is a pure formality, that it is a technical measure or whatever. On the other side of the same coin, we had recently, in a Bill that was guillotined through this House in a couple of hours one night, a provision which was never debated at all and that I thought was extremely dangerous.  That was that in an ESB Bill it was provided that the ESB shall pay to the Minister for the Environment or to the Exchequer such sum as the Minister for the Environment may determine from time to time.  That was the most open-ended taxation that one could possibly imagine and it seemed to me to be an extraordinary provision. Unfortunately, we never got a chance to debate it.  This is the obverse side of the same coin.  This was open-ended expenditure at the whim of the Government without any limitation.  At least there is some limitation now.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Kelly was talking about in regard to the 1958 Act was wrong in the sense that what he was talking about there was taxation and an open-ended way of imposing taxation without the consent of the Dáil.  What we are talking about here in this Bill is expenditure.  I assume that when the new system referred to here by the Minister is implemented by a formal instrument of the Community it will then be regarded as necessitated legislation and it will not require any renewal of this type of legislation because of the fact that it will be necessitated and not optional.  I assume therefore that the opportunity to debate that particular aspect will not arise at that time and that the payments will be made <Col N="1127" /> under the 1972 Act as necessitated payments. So I would like to take this opportunity to say I welcome very much the change that is being made away from the VAT-related base to a GNP related base, which is fairer and more sensible and certainly beneficial to this country and, I think, unobjectionable to any of our 11 fellow member states.  I would hope that the new system will in fact be agreed and implemented at the earliest possible date. The voluntary interim system we are talking about here in this Bill is very unsatisfactory, both from the European point of view and from the point of view of our own legislation, because it is wrong that this kind of Bill should be brought forward even though a major defect in it has now been cured by the proposed amendment of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention again to what Deputy McDowell has said in relation to the rather arbitrary way in which a round figure of £40 million is plucked out of the air allowing plenty of room for manoeuvre &mdash;&ldquo;what about an extra £8 million?  Hopefully we will not need it&rdquo; but the Dáil is instructed to vote to allow it anyway.  That is the wrong approach and I would like an assurance from the Minister that when the new system is formalised it will be covered by the necessitated obligations clause in the Constitution and in the 1972 Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not particularly share the qualifications by Deputy O'Malley relating to the concepts of reimbursability because there is quite a similarity between what we went through in 1984 and 1985 and what we are currently ordaining in the House.  I am going on memory but I would be more inclined to dispute the <Col N="1128" /> prospect of the concept of reimbursement payments as outlined.

      <P>I welcome the proposal to set the ceiling at £40 million as I think that is a sensible and quite necessary move.  The only other comment I would make is on the change from using our VAT base as the basis for our contributions to using the GNP base.  Again, I think this is a wise and necessary step. If I may sound somewhat heretical, I have a healthy degree of scepticism about how we calculate our GNP.  I do not want to discuss this matter in detail now but I think our GNP is higher and larger than we have consistently reported or indeed managed to compile.  Despite a substantial degree of cross-checking I still have an instinctive, almost anecdotal, reaction at times to the manner in which our GNP base is compiled.  The more I look at it, the more I observe the economy, the transfer pricing system within our economy and the manner in which returns are made to the CSO from our manufacturing base and the self-employed, the more and more sceptical I get.  I think there should be a good deal of political analysis of this issue; but unfortunately, due to the various pressures which many of us are under, we do not undertake that task.  I believe that we can give more attention to this issue and I was very interested indeed in Deputy Bruton's questioning in relation to the manufacturing side in recent weeks.  I think the points he made are entirely <Col N="1129" /> valid.  But, be that as it may and not wishing to see Ireland pay any more than we can lawfully get away with, I welcome the Bill and I am glad that it will be enacted before the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are paying this extra money in order that the 1992 package will work to our advantage.  The most important thing we need if the 1992 package is to work is access to Europe and access to this country from Europe and the free movement of ideas, money and, above all, people.  How can what the Minister has said about our contribution be rendered consistent with the report which appeared in today's newpapers which stated that the Italian Government are blocking Aer Lingus from carrying passengers between Manchester and Milan, a right that the Irish carrier obtained following the laborious negotiations of an airline deregulation package? This gave the Irish airline, Aer Lingus and the Portuguese airline, TAP, the right to carry passengers between third country destinations.</P>
      <P>In this instance, Italy as it now boasts, has as large a GNP <i>per capita</i> as Britain. The Italians have got quite good at making this favourable comparison between themselves and Britain and of course this means that they have a GNP per head substantially larger than ours. While talking about the 1992 deadline they bar our airline from carrying passengers between Milan and Manchester.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are contributing this money to the European Commission and one of the responsibilities of the European Commission is to vindicate our rights in matters of EC law.  I contend that our rights are not being vindicated in this case.  Having said that, I will not pursue this matter any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make a few points on this Bill. I share the concern expressed by Deputy Desmond a few moments ago about anything based on our GNP.  This figure is a very elastic one indeed because of the <Col N="1130" /> large percentage represented by exports of certain large multi-national companies. As far as I am aware, the value of Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola essence exceeds the value of our dairy exports, yet the impact on our GNP is minimal. The number of PAYE taxpayers employed in the Cola industry who will contribute the money which the Minister will hand over to Brussels is tiny when compared to the number employed in the dairy co-ops and farms and so on.  The value of the Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola market &mdash; excuse me if I am advertising &mdash; is as big as the dairy market and there is nothing illegitimate, illegal or improper about any of this.  There are ways in which companies decide on the value of intra company transactions in order to maximise the size of the transaction in Ireland, which is a low profit zone, and thus minimise the tax paid by the company.  They pay their tax in Ireland rather than somewhere else where the tax rate on corporation might be 40 per cent or 50 per cent as against 10 per cent here.</P>
    <P>A very detailed article on this subject appeared in the March edition of <i>Business and Finance</i>.  I drew the attention of the Taoiseach to this article when asking a parliamentary question but he did not answer that question.  He said that our figures are perfect and that we work on our figures.  That is fine but the Taoiseach would say that, would he not, as a famous lady said on one occasion?  For the purposes of analysis one would need to go a little deeper than that.  To my mind, looking on GNP as a basis is not ideal.  I am not making this point in an effort to score points <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister or the Taoiseach.  This deal has been coming up the tracks for a long time and the Minister and his Government have had the good fortune to be able to set the seal on this deal.  I think it probably did not make much difference which Government were in power as this probably was going to be the deal.</P>
    <P>I agree that moving to a GNP base has some merits for a country such as ours which has a relatively low GNP, even if it is rather inflated.  At the same time we should examine our GNP, given that it <Col N="1131" /> is going to be used as a basis for our contributions to the EC to see whether or not it contains a degree of inflation for the reasons I have mentioned.  To put it at its crudest, it would pay the Minister for Finance to re-examine our GNP figure and the value of our exports in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried that we are moving away from the VAT base, which was a non-nationalistic way of determining who should pay &mdash; there was a VAT base across the whole of Europe and you took a certain share out of that &mdash; towards shares based on the GNPs of individual countries.  That is more likely to be the subject of invidious comparisons than the original, more neutral system.  I see some dangers in that in the long term from the point of view of Europe acting as a unit because its people are being taxed on the basis of their individual national GNPs rather than on the basis of some neutral European measure.  I ask the Minister whether he and his colleagues in the ECOFIN Council have considered that aspect as being of any long-term value.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the need for this legislation arises because of an undertaking given on 7 March 1988 at the ECO-FIN Council.  By its nature it is a voluntary undertaking and, therefore, the Minister cannot say he has to make those payments and that he requires legislation to pay them.  If he had to pay them under an EC regulation he would already have clearance to do so.  Given that the Minister faces that difficulty can I ask him why our Community partners are prepared to make a regulation for us which would put the voluntary undertakings that have been given in a legal form?  That seems to be a relatively small procedure.  The Community makes regulations every day so why can it not make a regulation on this?  I do not raise this question purely from the point of view of this case; on the Order of Business today I raised a similar matter with the Taoiseach, it was that we, as a nation, are faced with the possibility of having to have a referendum to enable us to ratify the Community Patent Convention.  If <Col N="1132" /> the European Community Council of Ministers would agree to make a regulation saying that all member states have to ratify the European Patent Convention we would not have to go to the bother of having a referendum.  The Council is not prepared to make a regulation and this will put the Minister, or the Government of the day, whoever they may be, to the trouble of having a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not exactly fair. It cannot make a regulation for something which is voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to compare my knowledge of EC law with Deputy McDowell's knowledge of it.  It would be a most hazardous exercise for me to engage in and I might not come out the better of it.  However, with respect to the expertise of everybody here, I believe that if the Community wanted to find a way around that problem it could do so by means of a regulation.  I hope the Minister will indicate why in this case, and in the other case I mentioned if he cares to refer to it, the Commission is reluctant to make a regulation which would get us out of the difficulty we are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something else which is totally contrary to the idea of a Community budget and, as such, the European Community &mdash; the famous British rebate, where one member state, because it does not like the way the rules apply, is getting cash.  Could the Minister give an indication as to what is the future of the British rebate?  Are we contributing towards it?  Is it in line with Community practice and what is the likelihood that it will be negotiated out of existence in the future?  The Minister said that, on reasonable assumptions, the new arrangements should guarantee adequate funding for Community policies for a considerable period ahead.  May I ask the Minister to be a bit more specific about that: how far ahead, and what are the reasonable assumptions he is making?  Is he assuming <Col N="1133" /> a rate of growth in Community expenditure below the rate of growth of Community GNP or above the rate of growth of Community GNP?  If, for instance, Community expenditure grows at, say, 2 per cent per annum in excess of Community GNP growth, how long, under these arrangements, would we be within the limits and when would we have a new budgetary crisis?  Perhaps the Minister could answer those questions as well.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to refer to.  The Minister said that social cohesion is now a Treaty obligation to be taken into account in all Community policies.  Social cohesion means the better off countries looking after less well off countries and people within the Community. We get something in the region of £1,200 million a year from the European Community funds, of which £900 million comes from the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Community, in its recent publication, <i>The Economics of 1992,</i> made it quite clear that it believes the reduction of agricultural prices in the Community to world market prices is inevitable.  It carried out an exercise in the same document to show the effect of a 10 per cent reduction in Community agricultural prices and argued, significantly for Ireland, that the Community would be better off as a result of such an exercise.  It says that consumers and taxpayers would be better off but that producers would be substantially worse off.  The word &ldquo;producers&rdquo; reads &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; because as I pointed out, three-quarters of what we get from the Community comes in under the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is social cohesion for us.  If the Community intends, as was clearly signalled in the document, <i>The Economics of 1992,</i> to try to move the prices of agricultural goods towards world prices that will mean very substantial drops in agricultural prices and in the transfers from the Community funds to Ireland, drops in both terms of support for intervention buying and in support for export rates on exports to third countries.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate, drawing on the document, <i>The Economics of 1992</i>, what the <Col N="1134" /> effect would be on the Community budget and on Irish receipts from the Common Agricultural Policy and Community budget of a 10 per cent reduction in agricultural prices as set forth by the Commission as an exercise in the document to which I have referred.  Would we not be substantial net losers in the Community as a result of such an exercise and, if so, by how much?  What effect would that have on Irish receipts from the Common Agricultural Policy?  These are questions which need to be answered on this occasion and I hope the Minister will be able to do so.</P>

      <P>Many points were raised in this debate. Many were relevant to the legislation before the House and others were in relation to the philosophy of membership of the EC, the possibilities that existed in the past which were not taken up and the potential for the future.  I will not have time to deal with all the points raised because I should like to leave some time, knowing that we are finishing all Stages by agreement of the House at 6 p.m. for some discussion on Committee Stage, especially as there are some amendments.</P>
      <P>I must start with what Deputy Mac Giolla has said, more or less condemning our membership of the EC, that it was responsible for huge unemployment, for business going bankrupt and general cost increases here.  Deputies who make such accusations are completely wide of the mark and have not spent one moment considering what it would be like if we did not have, as Deputy Bruton referred to earlier, something like £1,100 million or £1,200 million on gross transfers coming in here from the EC.  What would it be like in this economy under any item of Government expenditure if we were without those transfers or, even worse, if we did not have the markets for most of our produce, particularly agricultural produce &mdash; guaranteed markets and guaranteed prices?  It is most unfair and untrue for Deputies to make such accusations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it can be said, as <Col N="1135" /> suggested by Deputy Mac Giolla also, that we are going into the internal single market blindfolded.  This is absolutely untrue.  As I said in my opening remarks, an awareness campaign will be launched by the Taoiseach and members of the Government in a matter of weeks.  I said also that there needs to be this awareness of the problems which will arise and the opportunities which will be there and will present themselves to us between now and 1992 and from there on.  I must condemn Deputy Mac Giolla's remarks about the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his negotiations on the question of the Structural Funds last week and again this week.  The reserve he has imposed at the discussions last week, which was lifted yesterday, has in the intervening period contributed enormously to the ultimate agreement.  At the Council on Monday last, we obtained amendments to both the framework regulation itself and the associated declarations which will enable us to benefit fully from the doubling of the Structural Funds.  I shall not go into any more detail about that, but it was well worth the Minister's while, on behalf of the Government, to maintain that reserve until such time as he got greater guarantees, particularly in regard to the framework regulation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked for how long this new arrangement would apply.  It is very hard to be precise on this, but I think that it will take us at least as far as 1992.  He also raised the question of a directive on the question of GNP.  A directive is being prepared by the EC on further harmonisation of the basis for determining GNP.  It is already agreed in principle, but further discussion will take place on it.  In relation to the question raised by Deputy Desmond and Deputy Bruton about making payments or doing anything based on GNP, we can all say that that arrangement is not perfect, but it is the best approach we have.  In so far as it is concerned in this arrangement arising from this legislation, as I said, this new arrangement will save us £20 million alone this year.  We will wait and see how harmonisation of the EC continues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I want to thank Deputies generally for the contributions they made.  I will run through, in the limited time I have, the important or central points raised. Deputy McDowell argues that there should be a limit on the amount to be paid under this agreement &mdash; I have referred to this already.  I do not accept that there is a valid case being made by the Deputy.  An Act in very similar terms with no ceiling on the payments authorised &mdash; the European Communities (Supplementary Funding) Act, 1984&mdash;was enacted in 1984.  Payments were made under this Act in 1984 and 1985, without giving rise to any of the problems referred to by the Deputy.  I shall refer to the point made by Deputy O'Malley when he talked about its not being a precedent, that these were reimbursable advances. They were, in so far as section 2 (a) of that 1984 Act is concerned, but the Deputy did not go on to read and put on the record the position in relation to section 2 (b), which was an open-ended commitment of payments to be made under that arrangement.  It is just a question of having the thing right once these points were raised.  As Deputies Noonan and Kelly have said, this is a precedent for this type of legislation.</P>

      <P>I would have preferred to present a Bill to the House containing a specific figure to be paid to the EC in the context of our precise undertaking.  This was not possible as delays in the budgetary procedure at EC level and the time taken by negotiations on the precise form of the decision on the new own resources system meant that a final figure was not available.  The terms of this decision were agreed by the Council only on 14 June and the Commission has produced just today the amending letter to the EC budget which shows their proposed final figure.  I understand that must go to Council and be agreed by it, before we finally know the final figure. That is the position.</P>

    <P>I would like to put on record now the <Col N="1137" /> reason we are doing this and using the form we are using, even though there is a precedent there.  This House will be in recess for some time and we will have to make a contribution.  The undertaking agreed at EC level on 7 March 1988 was necessary in order to have a budget in place.  I am sure I will not have to point out to the Deputies the benefits received under the EC budget and the advantage to Ireland of having a budget with sufficient revenue in place.  Had I delayed presenting the legislation until the issue was crystal clear, this House would have been in recess and the necessary legislation would not have been introduced until the autumn.  Payment of these funds is likely to be required before the autumn and such a delay would have left Ireland in the embarrassing position of not being able to meet the Commission's request for funds.  We would possibly have been the only member state in this position. As a substantial net beneficiary of the EC budget expenditure, as one of the member states pressing for a substantial increase in revenue for the EC budget, it is important that Ireland be seen to be willing to pay its fair share of revenue as soon as this is required.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that funds paid under the undertaking in the legislation and by way of Ireland's normal contribution will total the same amount as if the new own resources system were in place in all of 1988.  If it had been in place, payments would have been made in the normal way under the European Communities Act, 1972, which has no upper financial limit.  The scope of this Bill was deliberately limited to 1988, in order that it would cover only the particular situation that arose in connection with the 1988 EC budget, rather than giving a general power in future years for any undertakings to the Commission.</P>
    <P>I am advised that there is no constitutional problem with the Bill as drafted.  However, as concern has been expressed on the procedural question of providing in legislation for this payment without a financial limit and as I am loath to see technical legislation becoming an issue for dissension I shall, as I said <Col N="1138" /> before, be putting forward an amendment on Committee Stage to limit the amount which can be paid under this legislation to £40 million.  I hope that will meet the concern of Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly thinks it is undesirable to have the Dáil authorise a Bill which does not give details about the proposed payments in question.  The essential point here is that we are not talking about extra or new expenditure.  We are talking about a technical means of making a residual part of our contribution to the EC budget.  The money in question is already incorporated in our national budget for this year.  For reasons outside our control we are required to go through a certain procedure for payment.  This, and only this, is what is in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell has, as I referred to earlier, an amendment down for £33 million which we shall deal with shortly. In reply to the point made by Deputy O'Malley, we must have some flexibility in this regard.  I mentioned £32 million in my speech.  If we are taking the amount to be determined in ECUs today, it would be £32.4 million.  We must wait and see how the letter that has come to us from the Commission is finally agreed by the Council; until then, we will not know the exact figure.  That is the reason for this upper limit of £40 million, the question of the flexibility that will be needed as between £32 million and £40 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell stated yesterday and again today that this matter should be the subject of an Estimate or a Supplementary Estimate.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that the Oireachtas cannot authorise expenditure except by Estimates or Supplementary Estimates. The Oireachtas has power to authorise expenditure &mdash; known as non-voted expenditure &mdash; to which Deputy Noonan referred for the reason that it is not required to be included in a Vote.  Such expenditure is authorised by way of specific Acts of the Oireachtas and there are ample precedents for this: for example, the Acts relating to various State-sponsored bodies, the European Communities Acts, the Bretton Woods Agreement Acts, the various Land Acts, <Col N="1139" /> legislation providing for the payment of salaries and pensions and allowances of the President, the Judiciary and the Comptroller and Auditor General and so on.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to Article 28.4 of the Constitution which requires the Government to prepare Estimates of receipts and expenditure of the State for each financial year.  The document containing these Estimates &mdash; the White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure &mdash; shows estimated Government expenditure, both voted and non-voted, and the 1988 White Paper included over £2.8 billion of non-voted expenditure which included, <i>inter alia,</i> sufficient funds to cover the payments envisaged in the Bill being considered.  Of course, all appropriations have legislative authority.  For this reason, the current Bill is before the House and it is clear, contrary to what Deputy McDowell suggests, that all expenditure is not required to be included in the annual voted Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have answered many of the points raised by the Deputies.  I cannot deal with the question of Aer Lingus flying from Milan to Manchester or the overall agricultural expenditure, which are matters for another day.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1 states:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;£40,000,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£33,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I fully accept what the Minister said in relation to the difference between voted and non-voted expenditure and I also acccept his proposition that it would be an over-simplification to say that all expenditure has to be the subject matter of an Estimate approved by the Dáil. However, in terms of non-voted expenditure which is authorised for payment by Statute out of the Central Fund, apart from the 1984 Act to which the Minister referred, I cannot think of any Act which has been considered and passed by the House which has authorised moneys to be paid out of the Central Fund without limit.  Perhaps one exists but I do not know of it.</P>
      <P>Even in cases such as Land Acts, semi-State bodies and so on, we always fix upper limits and that was the case in relation to the obligations of the State in relation to export credit guarantees.  We also fix upper limits in regard to the State's authority to capitalise semi-State companies.  We do so for a very good constitutional reason, that this House does not give unlimited authority to anybody to do anything.  Otherwise, at any stage in this House, we could authorise the Minister for Finance, without limit, to fund the Agricultural Credit Corporation as he thought fit.  If that principle was admitted, if the House could simply adopt measures of this kind, we could give up any pretence at control of public expenditure.  There is no such thing as non-voted expenditure under a Statute, with the exception of the 1984 Act.  There is no precedent generally for the proposition that unlimited expenditure can be paid at the decision of the Government from the Central Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the precedents suggest that even to guarantee the loans of a semi-State body, to guarantee the repayment of the ACC's loan to investors and to guarantee the borrowings of various semi-State companies, we always fix an upper limit.  If that is not necessary, why do we do it <Col N="1141" /> elsewhere?  If it is necessary elsewhere, why are we not doing it here?  To some extent this argument is futile because the Minister has set a limit.  I will not press my amendment to a vote.</P>
    <P>One of the irrelevancies to which the Minister's attention was drawn was the European Patents Convention.  Deputy Bruton spoke about asking the EC to make a regulation requiring us to become signatories of the Patents Convention. He thought in that way it could become a necessitated obligation and that we would not have to have a referendum. That is all very well, but he forgets one fundamental fact.  It is not part of the European Treaty and none of the other member states would ever allow the Commission to make a regulation of that kind because, if they got away with doing that once, making a regulation for the convenience of one member state to force them to take a step of this kind, then, in the last analysis, the British Government could be forced, for instance, to ratify a trade mark convention and someone else could be asked to ratify some totally different convention.  Once we get away from the proposition that regulations can only be brought in on foot of what is now agreed to be the basis of the treaty, effectively the regulation-making process is an entirely sovereign one independent of the treaty on which it is founded.  I am not lecturing Deputy Bruton on European law, I am giving him a lecture on basic politics.  Mrs. Thatcher will never accept the right of the European Community to make regulations outside the ambit of the treaties.  All the member states have a vested interest in making sure that no regulation is ever made outside the ambit of the treaties because, to do so, would be the slippery slope towards making the treaties themselves redundant.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have specified a lesser amount than £40 million.  In view of what he said in the intervening period about the letter coming from the Commission today specifying the final amount and that it is finally decided, I will not press the matter.  However, I should like to make the point that the precedent to <Col N="1142" /> which Deputy Noonan referred, the fact that it came from a Fine Gael Minister in the past, is no reason to make the same mistake twice.  Deputy Kelly, to be fair, said it was an unfortunate way of legislating. We should not regard it as a precedent but as an exception to an obvious rule.  In future, we should decide that, in whatever form it comes before us, there should be a limit on it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to comment on the Minister's amendment where he is imposing a ceiling of £40 million in the operation of this legislation in the expectation of the payment of £32 million.  Whatever the amount, it is clear that this is only a small percentage of the total contribution which we will make to the EC budget in 1988.  The figure given by the Minister is £252 million and I presume that is the ceiling in which we should be interested.  We should insist that there is no variation in that figure, apart from variations in computing and translating the equivalent amount in ECUs into Irish pounds.  If there is any variation other than the translation of the equivalent ECU amount into Irish pounds, will the Minister be back looking for the permission of the House to vary the £252 million upwards?  If there is a breach of the ceiling required through further contributions, the Minister may be put in a position to negotiate as the year goes on. Otherwise it is purely academic whether it is £32 million, £33 million or £40 million. A 25 per cent variation upwards to allow the Minister the flexibility which he requires does not seem to be extravagant. I accept the Minister's amendment but I should like him to comment on the point I raised about the sum of £252 million.</P>

      <P>On the question of the £252 million overall contribution, which includes the £32 million plus under this legislation, it is the best estimate we can make.  There can be marginal differences one way or the other.  In fact, since the beginning of the year because of these changes we have saved £20 million on the overall contribution.  Let us hope that that trend will continue.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> Deputy McDowell referred to other legislation which did not have ceilings. Section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, authorised the charging of all debt service payments on the Central Fund and on the growing produce thereof without imposing any ceiling on the amount of such expenditure and such payments are always paid without any further Dáil approval beyond what was given with the passing of the Finance Act, 1970.  There are other items of expenditure charged on the Central Fund on the basis of the Act of the Oireachtas without any overall limit on the amount of expenditure and included as part of the Central Fund Services. They are, issues to the land bond fund to make good any deficiency in the fund, issues to cover exchange losses on the ACC's foreign currency borrowing, issues to make good any deficiency in the Post Office Saving Bank fund and election expenses, that is returing officer expenses and the cost of free postage for candidates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase from £300 million to £500 million the aggregate amount of liabilities which I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, may assume at any one time in respect of export guarantees under the Insurance Act, 1953, as amended.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Act, 1953, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make arrangements for the giving of guarantees for the purposes of encouraging exports.  This is the legislative basis for the export credit insurance and finance scheme.  The principal aims of the scheme are to help maintain the competitiveness of Irish exports, to stimulate export growth and to encourage diversification into new markets.  The scheme assists and supports Irish exporters by providing them with protection against non-payment for either commercial or political reasons by foreign buyers.  It also provides access to export credit finance from the banks at preferential interest rates.</P>
      <P>The demand for export credit insurance has increased considerably since the ceiling of £300 million was set in 1981 and as a result aggregate liabilities have now reached £298 million.  Demand for export credit insurance is strong and I anticipate further growth in such demand in the years ahead with the continuing expansion which I hope and expect will be maintained in our overall exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> The export credit scheme is administered by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland plc, as agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The scheme is intended to run on a self-financing basis over time.  In other words, any costs borne by the Exchequer by the payment of claims should be made good by premium income receipts and recoveries on outstanding claims.  This is a very desirable commercial objective which this Government and previous Governments have pursued.  Despite a commercial approach, however, it is not possible to eliminate entirely the risks associated with international trade, particularly in the difficult economic climate which has prevailed in recent years.  The emergence of severe debt-servicing problems in many Third World and developing countries in the early eighties has compounded both the commercial and political risks in selling abroad.  At the same time, we have seen growing competition among national export credit agencies in the drive to win new business.</P>
    <P>Consequently, there has been a significant rise in the level of claims over the past few years and there was a cumulative deficit on the scheme of approximately £12.8 million to the end of 1987.  This does not mean, however, and I stress this point, that our objective of breaking even has failed.  The total value of exports insured since 1971 amounts to £4.5 billion which means that the deficit amounts to a mere 0.28 per cent of the value insured. It is my intention that the deficit which our scheme has accumulated will be reduced and eventually eliminated.  For example, every effort is being and will continue to be made by me and my agents to secure a maximum recovery of outstanding debts on which claims were paid. At present we are owed approximatley £9 million in respect of debts arising from foreign currency shortages in debtor countries.  These debts are really national or government debts of the countries concerned. While it would be unrealistic to expect a 100 per cent recovery there is a reasonable chance of recovering a proportion of these debts but possibly over a fairly lengthy period of time.  The main <Col N="1146" /> debtor countries concerned are Nigeria, Argentina, Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone.  The prospects of recovering debts from Nigeria have been enhanced by the signing, in December 1987, of debt re-scheduling agreement between Ireland and that country.  This agreement provides for a repayment of insured trade debts over the next six years.  Significant progress has also been made in recovering debts in Argentina.  Interest payments on outstanding debts were received from Argentina in the past few months; in addition, promissory notes have been received in respect of outstanding principal and some money should be recovered on these notes later this year. Prospects of recovering moneys from Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone are less encouraging, though it is intended to negotiate a debt re-scheduling agreement with Tanzania this year.</P>
    <P>A full recovery was made in March of this year in respect of a claim of some £1.7 million paid in September 1987, in respect of exports to China.  Two large claims amounting to over £6 million arose from defaults by two US companies. Negotiations in regard to recovery of these debts, which have been difficult and complex, are now reaching a critical stage and I am hopeful that some recoveries can be made.</P>
    <P>Claims are only one side of the equation. The other is premium income.  The premium income obtained from exporters using the scheme goes to offset the cost of claims which have to be paid from time to time.  Premium income in recent years has been insufficient to meet the cost of claims and hence the scheme is in deficit.  It is likley, however, that premium income will increase in the next few years.  Premium rates for the vast bulk of policy holders were increased by an average of 10 per cent at the beginning of this year, the previous increase having occurred in 1986.  Premium rates for certain medium term credit policies were increased by over 50 per cent from January 1988, but this was the first increase in these rates since 1971.  New charges for the provision of guarantees in respect of export credit finance took effect from <Col N="1147" /> 1 April 1988.  Notwithstanding all these higher charges, premium rates charged for export credit insurance in Ireland compare favourably with other countries. A recent survey carried out by the OECD showed that Ireland was ranked sixth lowest out of 20 countries in terms of premium rates for export credit insurance.  I am confident that we have managed to strike a balance between the need to operate the scheme according to commercial criteria on the one hand and the need to provide a competitive and attractive product for the exporter on the other.</P>
    <P>The deficit, as I have said earlier, must be seen in perspective.  It is quite small when compared with the total amount of exports insured under the scheme to date, approximately £4.5 billion.</P>
    <P>I mentioned briefly at the outset that the need for this legislation arises from an increase in the demand for export credit insurance for markets worldwide and that this trend is likely to continue in the years to come.  At present the export credit scheme is covering about £750 million worth of exports annually.  This is actually quite small relative to our total exports, which amounted to £10,700 million in 1987.  The reason for this is that the bulk of our exports are to OECD countries which many exporters consider to be reasonably safe markets and where they believe that there is little or no political risk.  The facilities available under the export credit scheme are relatively straightforward and easy to use.  If exporters are concerned about devoting too much time and resources in attending to export credit limits and other such details of insurance cover, they can employ a suitable insurance broker to handle all these matters at no extra cost to them.  Exporters should think about using the facilities under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Many exporters claim that it is difficult to get quick decisions from ICI on export credit insurance and claim that export sales can be lost as a result.  I agree fully that there is a need for decisions to be taken quickly, but often the problem lies with the exporter not providing sufficient <Col N="1148" /> information to enable a decision to be taken on the application.  In many cases the exporter approaches ICI at the last minute and expects to be given export credit insurance instantly.  Exporters must appreciate, however, that where information is not readily available on overseas buyers, credit checks need to be carried out by ICI before a decision can be made as to the level of cover which can be granted.  While ICI have many buyers on their files, they are installing, at my request, computerised facilities to enable detailed buyer information to be stored in a readily available format.  This should improve the speed of response within ICI to the benefit of the exporter. To conclude on this point, I would say that I recognise fully the need for a fast efficient export credit service to be available at all times to the exporter.  At the same time, however, this need must be balanced against the need for careful, judicious underwriting to minimise the risk to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Export credit insurance not only affords protection against non-payment from abroad, it also provides access to finance from the banks at preferential interest rates.  Access to such finance is made possible either by means of assignment of the exporter's insurance policy or the provision of a State guarantee to a bank.  For Irish pound financing the exporter can borrow at AAA interest rates.  Many small to medium sized exporters would not otherwise be able to obtain finance at such competitive rates. Small or medium sized exporters are often charged A or AA interest rates which involve significant additional interest costs.  Export credit insurance therefore has the added attraction of opening the door to otherwise unaffordable working capital to finance exports.  More importantly, this export credit finance should not normally interfere with other credit facilities or limits which may be available to exporters from the banks.</P>
    <P>There are two finance schemes in operation at present; the short-term finance scheme which normally relates to exports sold on credit terms of up to one year and <Col N="1149" /> the medium-term finance scheme which normally relates to credits of up to five years.  Both of these schemes can be of benefit to the exporter and can provide a further boost to export growth.  The short-term scheme is perhaps of greater importance to the majority of Irish exporters than the medium-term scheme which relates exclusively to capital goods. The level of usage of the short-term scheme by exporters has however been disappointingly low, and I believe there is scope for getting more exporters to use this facility.  With this in mind, my Department and ICI are carrying out a detailed review of this scheme, which has been in operation now since 1981.  Once this review has been completed, I will ask officials of my Department and ICI to discuss the operation of the scheme with the banks.  The banks have a major role to play in this area and I would like to see them taking on a more active, aggressive and supportive approach to financing exports.  They have made a number of suggestions as to how the scheme might be improved and these are being considered at present by the Department and ICI.  What I require, however, is for the banks to help share the risk involved and not simply rely on Government guarantees before releasing finance.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Government's special trading house scheme which was approved by the European Commission in February of this year.  The scheme is designed to promote the growth of exports of Irish manufactured goods though the establishment of centres of marketing expertise which will specialise in the exports of such goods.  I am pleased to say that in addition to qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation profits tax as well as benefiting from investments under the business expansion scheme, licensed trading houses will be eligible to avail of the full range of facilities under the export credit insurance and finance scheme.  This will certainly be a significant added asset to trading houses in their task of selling Irish manufactured products abroad.  So far special trading house licences have been issued to two companies and a number <Col N="1150" /> of other applications for licences are currently being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>Export growth is central to the Government's programme of economic recovery.  Last year Irish exports reached an all-time high of £10,700 million and the indications are that export performance in 1988 will be even better than it was in 1987.  We now expect total exports to reach a record of £12,000 million this year.  Growth in demand for export credit reflects the growth in our exports and also the diversification of Irish exports into non-traditional markets. For example, as a result of successful growth in business contacts in Iraq and in the context of the Irish-Iraqi Joint Commission, it was decided to provide export credit facilities in respect of Iraq. This is a positive development in terms of sustaining export growth in the long term.</P>
    <P>I believe that the export credit scheme has an important role to play in the Government's strategy of export-led growth.  This is particularly so in the context of improving the export performance of small indigenous companies.  The availability of export credit insurance and finance can in very many cases be the deciding factor in whether or not a company should proceed with an export contract. It can eliminate the risk which might otherwise be unacceptable and provide access to valuable working capital which might not otherwise be within the company's limited resources.</P>
    <P>All our major trading competitors provide Government supported export credit insurance and finance schemes to assist their exporters in winning valuable contracts abroad.  If the Irish Government did not operate a similar scheme it would mean that our trading competitors would have a competitive edge over Irish industry particularly in certain international markets.  We simply cannot allow this to happen.  I do not see this scheme as some sort of expensive luxury; it is a vital tool in encouraging continued growth in exports and generating industrial prosperity with, hopefully, more jobs for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> I am satisfied, that by increasing the statutory limit on export guarantee liabilities to £500 million, this Bill will make a valuable contribution to the further growth of Irish exports.  I therefore recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Export credit insurance operates basically as an insurance arrangement.  I understand that, generally speaking, in regard to trade in goods there is no element of subsidy but where capital equipment is being exported I understand the practice has grown up that the exporting countries give what is essentially a subsidy to the purchaser through the terms of the export credit insurance which it offers.  Ireland does relatively little export of capital goods in comparison with other European countries but we do some.  I understand there is a growing worry in international organisations concerning the OECD, in particular, about the increasingly fierce competition in the matter of subsidisation of capital exports by developed countries.  One might say this is something that is of benefit, in that countries which are purchasing are relatively poorer countries than those exporting and in a sense it is a chance to obtain resources from the rich countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear is that it is a kind of roller coaster which it becomes increasingly difficult to get off in that one country bids for a contract, then another comes along and has to do better and the third has to do better still.  The asking price on the next occasion a similar contract comes up is the best deal which was made the last time and it goes on in a similar fashion. I know the Minister is not directly involved in this to any appreciable degree other than as a member of the Council of Ministers of the European Community but I would like to ask him what his views are on this development.  Is he happy that it is in the best interests of the rational development of industry?  What it does is to distort the pattern of sales by capital goods-producing industries in the sense that they will tend to want to export to countries where they can get an export <Col N="1152" /> subsidy in the form of export credit insurance.  They will not export to countries, perhaps nearer home, where they will not get export credit insurance because they are in a better competitive position in the form of a better market.  As with all subsidies they distort the natural development of the industries.  I would like to ask the Minister if we give any export credit insurance in regard to capital goods and, if so, do we give any interest subsidies, or other subsidies, which would qualify as other than straight commercial insurance involving a subsidy element and what is the Minister's policy in that regard?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce I had the privilege of leading a number of overseas export missions. There are few people whose practical patriotism I admire more than exporters. In many cases they spend half the year cumulatively away from their families in exotic but far from comfortable locations trying to operate telephone and telex systems that do not work.  They live a life of hassle and uncertainty wondering if their flight will be cancelled, if they will get to meet the official in the ministry who was so difficult on the last visit, they wonder why they must wait for three hours for an appointment and if they must attach any significance to that, or if this means that the official will not buy any goods at all.  They must knock on doors for weeks and in many cases only get a decision one hour before the flight is due to depart for home.  The importer may play them out to the very last to see if he can get a better deal from them.  That life of hassle and anxiety is lived away from home in an unnatural environment for the people concerned.  It is important, when discussing exports in the House, to pay tribute to the personal qualities and sacrifices of those involved in making this country one of the greatest exporting nations in the world.  I say that after making the due discounts I made of the value of our exports.  They are not as valuable as the official figures indicate but they are very valuable and they would not exist without the type of dedication I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I do not have any objection to the Bill, <Col N="1153" /> which essentially is a natural result of increased trade in that the amounts of exports to be covered at any given time need to be increased.  That does not mean that the amount of losses is increasing or that the amount of State expenditure is being increased but simply means that the value of the amount covered is being increased.  That, in turn, could mean larger premium income to the Government. I do not see any problem about that.  However, I am interested to note that the main debtor countries who have not been paying, and in respect of contracts to whom the exporters have had to turn to the fund for money, are Argentina, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania and Sierra Leone.  Nigeria, which has substantial oil exports, is a country with which I believe the Government have been contemplating a major deal in regard to oil. Yet, the Government are having problems getting paid for goods we have supplied to Nigeria.  I have been pursuing this for some time.  A payment due from Nigeria was the subject of a question by Deputy Colley in the early days of this Dáil and I have taken an interest in it. I have repeated the question every six months.  It comes forward like clockwork on my BF system and the question is put on the Order Paper again.  The money has not been paid and the company is still waiting for the Nigerians to stump up on this contract.  I should like to ask the Minister why that is the case.  What is his attitude to exported credits for Nigeria? What is his attitude to the credibility of Nigeria as an entity with which to do business?</P>
    <P>That is fair question.  It is not an insulting one and I do not wish to cast any aspersions on Nigeria, but the fact is that they have not paid on that and other contracts.  Are we continuing to deal with that country?  Are we giving cover?  How has the premium been altered in the case of Nigeria to take account of the risk factor involved?  I do not have that much to say about Argentina and I note that the Minister has singled that country out from the list and stated that some progress has been made in regard to it.  Interestingly, Sudan and Tanzania are <Col N="1154" /> countries to whom we give an amount of bilateral aid.  Incidentally, bilateral aid has been cut back this year.</P>

      <P>I am not going to get involved in that in a debate about export credit insurance.  Have the Government used any leverage in regard to this?  Is the money due from public sources or private sources?  Do those governments have any influence over those who owe money to our exporters?  What diplomatic de-marche has been made with a view to getting the money back?  I can understand the problem in regard to Sudan because that country is in the throes of a most unfortunate civil war.  I am not certain how effective is the writ of the Government of Sudan in every part of their territory and presumably any money they have is devoted to the civil war.  However, that is not the case with Tanzania, a country with which we have had links for a long time.  In fact, the President of Tanzania was received here not so long ago.  It is regrettable that the country is not paying for goods we have supplied to them.  Will the Minister give us some indication of the nature of the goods supplied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give some indication of the type of export contract for which export credit insurance is sought by comparison with other routine exports.  We cover in the region of £750 million worth of exports annually and that is quite a small proportion of the total, which is somewhere in the region of 15 times as great.  How do those who look for export credit insurance select themselves?  What are the criteria which prompt an exporter to go looking for export credit insurance?  Is there a particular type of contract or export product for which insurance is sought?  How do other exporters cover themselves if they do not avail of this scheme?  Do they take out private cover and, if so, is there a need for a Government service at all?  If the rest of the export portfolio &mdash; the amount we are dealing with is only about one-fifteenth of the total &mdash; can be <Col N="1155" /> covered by ordinary commercial arrangements, do we need a State scheme?  I do not say that in the sense of asking for an abandonment of the scheme but on the basis that every area of activity should be questioned from time to time.  I am just questioning this area and perhaps the Minister would give a reply.</P>
    <P>How much of this is given in respect of non-EC countries, or is any of it given in respect of EC countries?  Are there any Community proposals, draft regulations, directives or even suggestions emanating from the Commission for the introduction of some limitations on competitive granting of export credit facilities by member states, either in intra-Community trade or intra-exports out of the Community?  It would appear that in the context of 1992, as the Community moves towards putting a limit on what member states may do in the area of aiding their own industries, since Ireland is one of the poorer countries it would be in Ireland's interest to get the Community to set rather strict limits on what sort of export credit insurance may be granted.  Take, for example, a fight over a contract, where a German and an Irish exporter are both getting export credit insurance from their respective Governments.  If the terms are approved by the Germans, in the final analysis we cannot go as far as they can because our purse is not as big as theirs.  It seems to be sensible therefore from an Irish point of view for us to try to get the Community to establish norms and limits, just as it would be sensible for us to get the Community to set rules in regard to capital grants for industry.  If the Community were to establish a rule that no member state may give any grants for industry that would suit us, because we are not able to compete with the bigger countries in that sort of area.  It would certainly suit us in the area of export credit insurance.  I would ask the Minister to indicate his policy in that regard or whether he has had any discussions on it with his colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I liked the tone of the Minister's speech.  I agree with him in <Col N="1156" /> underlining that what is a very important prerequisite for our economic recovery and the potential it offers in the future is an expansion in exports.  Any scheme that helps to further our exports should be encouraged.  I also agree that this type of scheme is not some sort of luxury.  In the main it is self-financing.  In that regard it is very important that this scheme be maintained and indeed it is obviously necessary to expand it.  I take it from the Minister that the reason for his need to expand the aggregate amount from £300 million, as I understand it is at present, to £500 million is due to the volume on hands generally at present in the export area.  If this is the case it is to be welcomed. Our activities in the export markets are improving and that is also to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has identified a number of countries which are the major problem areas at present in relation to the deficit. Deputy Bruton referred to that, but I do not know if he asked the Minister have we stopped dealing with these countries because they have been unable to repay their debts.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify if these debts are due to foreign currency problems within those countries. I would like an answer on each individual country and whether or not we will continue to deal with them.  In the context of the debt which the Minister has indentified, what portion of it is owed by Nigeria?  Are they the main culprits in this whole area or are they of equal culpability with the other countries which he has mentioned?  The Nigerian situation is a bugbear in this area.  As Deputy Bruton has said, we seem to be discussing possible oil deals and so on with this country at present.  It seems a contradiction that we have been unable over a period of time to get them to repay their debt and on the other hand that we are prepared to do business with them.  I agree that this matter must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about short term facilities not being taken up as much as he would like to see them taken up.  Obviously, there is some fault somewhere along the line, either with the exporters <Col N="1157" /> or with the Department and ICI. Exporters should be made aware of this scheme so that they could avail of it.  The Minister is right when he says that it is the small companies who would probably never be able to operate in the export market area who would be involved, particularly as most of the countries for which this scheme is used are countries which are not in Europe but in Africa and South America, which are great distances from us.  The Minister has said that he is reviewing this matter and is looking into how the message will be spread.  I would like him to elaborate on what the Department intend to do in this regard.  Will they take a more public profile in promoting the scheme?</P>
    <P>The Minister has listed a number of countries.  Are there any other countries that he has not listed in his speech that are defaulters in this area and, if so, would he identify them?  Will he say if all of these countries are classed as Third World developing countries or are there other countries who are for some reason not in a position to repay their debts? Many of the problems that arise are not the fault of the civil servants involved but of the precedent of bureaucracy that has grown in getting proper access to schemes and being able to expedite them.  Deputy Bruton has rightly identified the problems that we may be faced with in the context of the single market.  I agree with him that that should be looked at with regard to limits, because our purse is certainly not as deep or as wide as that of other EC countries.  In this whole area of operation we must be absolutely sure that we will not be put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-. vis</i> the other countries in Europe. That is very important in the context of the single market.  Ireland is a very open economy, the most open economy in the European Communities.  That poses problems but it also brings great benefits. The export area is essential and crucial in the overall development of our industrial base.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister is there a pattern in the type of companies who seek this insurance and, if so, could he identify what it is.  Have they done any <Col N="1158" /> analysis as to why it pertains to particular apsects of industry?  If it constantly pertains to a particular area, have the Department examined the reason for that?</P>
    <P>The trading house development is very much in its infancy in Ireland and is being held out by the Government as offering great things for the future.  The potential may or may not be there.  The Minister and in particular the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing have mentioned the trading houses.  Those involved in the trading houses should be made aware of this scheme.  The trading houses could be used as a forum for selling the scheme to the people who are using them.  They are the operators, the business people in the market place who can see the benefits. This is an opportunity for a selling vehicle and it would, of course, increase the premium income for the Department and the ICI.  That is one of the ways it could be looked at.</P>
    <P>The reason for discussing this Bill this evening is that there must be a knock-on effect in creating jobs.  The biggest curse in the country today is that we are not creating the jobs to match our exports.  I know this may be difficult, but are there any criteria set down for the companies applying under these schemes?  Is there any way we can ensure that these companies will be able to provide an increase in employment?  This should be looked at.  If it has not been looked at, I would like to see the Department try to link the two together.  There must be criteria which would relate benefits under this scheme directly to employment.  I do not want to say the figures are fictitious.  The value and volume of our exports do not relate to real employment on the ground. That is a tragedy.  I realise the Department are conscious of employment needs but they should be to the fore in trying to operate this type of scheme.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have no objection in principle to this Bill.  The Minister said these provisions are common to other countries, but in the years ahead we should be very careful in the market place that we are not put at a <Col N="1159" /> disadvantage when compared with other countries.  The Minister has identified that the banks are not prepared to share the risk.  This is a serious problem which, instead of getting better, is getting worse. In some ways they are maintaining a very hard view on what is a risk, almost to the point that when they get involved there is practically no risk.  We all know there is a great deal of money available in this country for viable propositions which would create exports and employment.  I would like to see the banks get involved in a more positive way in risk taking.  It would be a good partnership between the public and private sectors.  I am not one of those who sees the private sector as the saviour of all.  There are many opportunities for co-operation between the public and private sectors.  This point is well worth reiterating.  I hope the Minister will be able to achieve progress in this area which would be of great benefit in unlocking a great deal of capital.</P>
    <P>The Bill is short, we welcome it and I await the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for contributing to this debate.  They raised some very interesting questions and made very interesting remarks.  I join with Deputy Bruton in paying tribute to our exporters, the people who spend most of their time away from home, sometimes in not the best hotels because in many developing countries good hotels are not available. These people have to face many problems and, like them, I experienced those problems at first hand.  There is no question about it, they are the heroes of this country. We need their business, we need jobs and these people should be recognised for their great input, even though there have been many upheavals in their families as a result of their work abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very good scheme.  I looked at it soon after coming into office.  The fact that there was a deficit of that size prompted me to look at it immediately to see what was going wrong.  I looked at each country where debts were not being recovered.  I looked at the amount of <Col N="1160" /> business written off since 1971 and the fact that there was only .28 per cent of a loss struck me as being a good case for a private sector insurance company, or something like that.  We are pursuing that line, but we have not had any positive responses yet.  When one looks at other countries one sees the state is involved everywhere but that does not mean we have to stay involved.</P>
    <P>We are off-cover in Nigeria, the Sudan, Argentina and Sierra Leone.  We came off cover in Nigeria in 1987 and in the other countries as well.  I was asked what kind of debts there were.  In some countries, like Nigeria, there is money due from private companies or tribes or chiefs, who claim they have the money in local currency, lodged in their central bank but because of the shortage of foreign exchange currencies we have to queue up for our money.  We queued for a while and then decided to re-schedule the debts, underwritten by the Central Bank, to ensure that we would get our money over a period of years.  Most people will be familiar with having to queue to buy foreign currency in some of the developing countries.  As I said, we re-scheduled those loans where we could, and we are doing the same in Argentina.</P>
    <P>The Sudan is in very bad shape.  The question of linking it to our international aid is a separate issue.  I know that in business one thinks if one were paying money in one direction one could take it back, but I do not think the House would be in favour of that type of approach to the Sudan.  It would not be my approach and we are not into that kind of activity.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a link between jobs and the scheme.  If some small or medium sized companies were to incur very big debts in another country it could lead to the collapse of these companies.  If they could increase their exports it could lead to more jobs, but if they had too many bad debts the companies might close.  I was asked what kind of companies are covered by the scheme.  The scheme is open to all sectors of industry.  It is a question of what the customer wants. There are many reasons a company apply under this scheme.  If a small or medium <Col N="1161" /> sized company are going into a foreign market for the first time, they may feel they need the comfort of the scheme behind them while they are getting to know their buyers and seeing what their paying record is like.  Rather than take the risk, they pay their premium, ICI check them out and the Irish company feel more comfortable.  Some companies only take insurance cover for the first time and forget it for every other trip because it is an added cost.  In developing countries, particularly in the Far East, there is always the possibility of political upheaval, the political climate might not be as stable as it is here, and the companies might feel they would need cover when doing business in those areas.  The matter of getting money out of certain developing countries is a risk.  They might have to wait such a long time that cash flow would be affected.  We do not seem to provide much insurance cover within the EC or OECD areas, although it is available to them.</P>
    <P>We do not export capital goods to any great extent.  Some OECD countries provide aids and grants in addition to the agreed interest subsidy.  There is no divergence in regard to the agreed interest subsidy but there is divergence in grants and subsidies.  This would certainly hit us if we were engaged in the export of capital goods.  The stronger countries get stronger in relation to capital goods exports and the weaker get weaker because they cannot afford to meet the terms asked for them.  It is an ideal subject to be tackled by the Community as we approach 1992.  Other countries have more at stake in the capital goods area but we will be pursuing it on the basis that it distorts competition.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with Sudan and Tanzania.  The prospects of recovery from those areas are slim.  With regard to Nigeria, the debts have been rescheduled and underwritten by the central banks there.  A major case involving £6 million in the US has been the subject of investigation from many angles.  We may get some recovery from it.  The figure of £6 <Col N="1162" /> million puts the whole deficit into context. Half of it relates to a specific customer in a specific area.</P>
    <P>The meat market use it fairly extensively in certain countries.  They do not use it as much in other countries where they have long-term associations.  Small pharmaceutical companies use it fairly extensively in dealing with developing countries, usually in relation to small orders for markets with which they are not very familiar.  It helps them to become established over several years and sometimes they then withdraw.</P>
    <P>I would certainly agree with Deputy Cullen about the banks playing a greater role.  For too long the banks have been relying on fixed assets, whereas the future of this country has to depend on increased exports.  Two out of every three jobs here depend on exports.  I have been pushing the idea with the banks and will continue to do so.  I should like to see the banks become more actively involved on a &ldquo;share the risk, share the reward&rdquo; basis. They should gear themselves to making a judgment as to whether a product will be successful and companies will be only too happy to share the reward with them.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed. I have covered most of the points they raised.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to review extradition procedures in the District Courts and in particular, to consider legislating to transfer cases brought under the Acts from District Court to Circuit Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In putting forward this proposal it is only appropriate that I make a number of points clear at the outset The first of these is that I and my party wish to place on record the debt which we as a society feel towards our Judiciary, from the Supreme Court to the District Court.  Our society depends on the independence and integrity of our judges.  It is one of the foundation stones of our democracy.  It must be a cause of some pride for us as a nation that no judge or justice has been removed from office since independence as a consequence of any charge involving corruption, lack of independence or integrity.  There are few other nations that could make such a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think it is appropriate in the context of this proposal to examine the roles which the various courts have and which are permitted to them by statute and under the Constitution.  The kernel of the proposal which we put forward today is to amend the law so as to permit the preliminary stages of extradition proceedings to be heard in the Circuit Court rather than in the District Court.  It is fair to say that in many ways the District Court is the most important court in the country.  We have a full time professional judiciary on that court which is one of the reforms which was introduced after independence.  As was remarked by one High Court judge, Mr. Justice Gannon, in a recent case, Clune <i>v.</i> DPP in 1981: &ldquo;Our District Courts are now administered by fully competent and fully qualified lawyers whose independence as Judges, not only from the Executive but <Col N="1165" /> even from their judicial colleagues, must be respected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, it is only fair that we should recognise some of the constraints under which the District Court operates.  The first is that the District Court is, of its nature, a court of summary jurisdiction set up under statute.  This means that it is in many cases the court of first resort for the majority of our citizens and, as a consequence, there is a very considerable pressure of time.  The business before the District Court in a single day can involve applications under the licensing code, criminal proceedings, proceedings under the Road Traffic Act, cases of family law and the law of tort.  As a consequence of this there is a very considerable caseload pressure upon all district justices.  There is a constraint upon them to be fair and to apply the law in a summary manner.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable to point out however, that the District Court does not frequently engage in cases which involve the minute examination of points of law which might emerge in the Circuit Court or High Court.  While case law and legal texts are not infrequently cited, the vast predominant number of cases are dealt with in a reasonably expeditious manner while protecting the rights and liberties of the citizen.  It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that the jurisdiction to be exercised by the District Court of its nature must be both limited and local. There must be some limit on the gravity or nature of the cases that such courts can try.</P>
    <P>The proposal which we have laid before the Dáil today arises not out of one case but out of a number.  All of us recollect that there have on more than one occasion been instances where considerable legal and political concern has arisen from the outcome of extradition proceedings before the District Court.  In saying this I wish to make it clear that there is absolutely no reflection being cast on the manner or the methods which have been adopted by our district justices in making their adjudication on extradition matters.  However, there have been a number of cases which, from the stand-point of observers both here and in <Col N="1166" /> Britain have been the subject of some considerable concern.  The net result of some of these has been totally unwarranted and unjustifiable criticism by the British media of our Judiciary at District Court level.  This criticism is neither fair nor proper, but our duty as legislators is to deal not only with legal realities but also with political perception.</P>
    <P>In a sensitive area such as extradition there are myriad of possibilities of misunderstanding and misconstruction. Sometimes one can almost feel that certain foreign journalists and some of the more hostile elements to us in foreign political parties are almost hoping that controversy will arise out of our operation of the law in relation to extradition and rendition under the 1965 Act.  I am sure I am speaking for all parties when I say that it it would be entirely undesirable for us to allow, even unwittingly, any situation to arise which would allow a wilful misinterpretation of events to undermine or even tend to undermine the sensitive and vital continuing process of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Some of the comments that were expressed after the recent case would tend to suggest that there are plenty of people around to avail of every opportunity to suggest that the people here, whether the Judiciary or members of all political parties, are afraid to deal with terrorism in a realistic way. I would like to put on record that, while we regard extradition as being important to deal with terrorism, we also respect the right of the individual to safeguards and make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>However, the extradition process, the process of mutual rendition between Ireland and the United Kingdom, may not only have politically grave consequences but also involve, and has increasingly been seen to involve, a minute analysis of the law on extradition or rendition even at District Court level.</P>
    <P>This has been illustrated in a recent case.  What has happened in this case and in others raises the question as to whether the District Court is the appropriate forum for dealing with matters of such gravity.  I do not believe that I would be trespassing on the time of the Dáil if I <Col N="1167" /> were to enumerate some of the matters which now must be the subject matter of adjudication in the implementation of our law on extradition and rendition both in the District Court and the High Court. There are four categories of offence which may prevent fugitives from being handed over for this part of the Act. These are: (1) where the offence specified in the warrant does not correspond with a serious offence under Irish law.  (2) An issue may arise as to whether the offence is political or is connected with a political offence.  As all Deputies will know, there have been very recent developments in the law in this area.  It is one of the fundamental contradictions of terrorism that members of illegal organisations will seek to exploit certain democratic rights in this country while at the same time seeking to undermine and destroy them both here and elsewhere.  (3) An issue may arise as to whether the offence in question is an offence under military law. (4) An issue may arise as to whether or not the offence in question is a Revenue offence.</P>
    <P>Having surmounted that hurdle, there exists the issue as to dual criminality. Generally speaking, extradition arrangements permit extradition only where the fugitive is alleged to have done or was convicted of doing an act which was an offence, both in the requesting and requested states and usually an offence in both states, of a certain minimum gravity. Therefore, if the offence in question does not exist in the requested state, or is a very trivial offence there, the person being sought in respect of it will not be delivered up.</P>
    <P>This process of necessity involves a minute examination of whether or not the offence in question is of a certain minimum gravity and also whether it corresponds with an offence under Irish law which is of similar minimum gravity. Under Part II of the 1965 Act, certain requesting states must furnish various details about the offence in question which makes it possible to determine what the offence in stated circumstances would amount to under Irish law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The requirements placed on the United Kingdom authorities are somewhat different from this, although there may be adequate information on the warrant. As stated by the Supreme Court in one case, the State Furlong <i>v.</i> Kelly, 1971, the function of the District Court or the district justice involves, among other matters, and I quote:</P>
    <P>to examine the documents set before him and to see whether there is sufficient statement of the particulars of the ingredients of the offence alleged, to enable him to bring to bear on them his knowledge of the law of this State so that he may determine whether the acts alleged ... would constitute an offence under the laws of this State ... either the warrant itself must contain sufficient particulars of a factual nature setting out the ingredients of the offence alleged, or it should be accompanied by an affidavit by the Prosecuting Authority ... setting out the particulars of the facts complained of &mdash; somewhat as the particulars of offences appear in a Court on an indictment under our law.</P>
    <P>Issues arise as to the degree of similarity between the offence in the requesting country and that in the country in which the fugitive is found.  A minute examination may well arise as to the procedure which has been adopted in endorsing the arrest warrant.  It has been held by the Supreme Court that the actual procedure set out in Part III of the 1965 Act must be followed scrupulously.  This means, as a matter of necessity, that the party to be extradited is entitled to rely on technical points of law in his defence which to the layman might appear somewhat extreme. The procedure regarding arrest must be scrupulously observed.  Very grave difficulties have already arisen in certain cases under the extradition code regarding the nature of and purpose of the arrest.</P>
    <P>In the State Holmes <i>v.</i> Furlong, 1967, Mr. Justice Walsh dealt with the matters which the district justice must consider. These include (1) he must be satisfied as to the validity of the warrant and other <Col N="1169" /> documents as prescribed by the Act; (2) be satisfied that the person who has been arrested is in fact the person named or described in the warrant and (3) he should next satisfy himself that the offence in the warrant is one in respect of which he may make an order under the Act.  A Delivery Up Order may not be made where it appears to the district justice that the dual criminality requirement is not satisfied.</P>
    <P>Technical points have arisen in hearings regarding the admission into evidence of United Kingdom arrest warrants, summons, declaration of service and related certificates and also endorsements by the Garda Commissioner.  An onus is then placed on the district justice to consider the point of delivery and make his order in relation to the provisions of the Act.  He is then obliged to inform the prisoner of his right to bring an application of <i>habeus corpus</i> in the High Court and to inform him that he will not be delivered up during a period of 15 days except with his consent or while any such <i>habeus corpus</i> application is pending.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the procedures adopted by the district justice in some instances can be the subject matter of judicial review in the High Court.  Technical points of law regarding the proofs which have been adopted in the District Court may be minutely scrutinised. As I have already indicated, the political and legal consequences of a failure to extradite a person, be it to Britain or elsewhere, can have the most serious and grave political consequences.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to point out also, that it is unlikely that any district justice, prior to appointment, will have dealt with extradition matters in the course of his or her practice as a lawyer.  Such matters are not common.  They are dealt with by persons who as a matter of practice and experience can bring to bear a very considerable expertise arising from not one but numerous cases.  I do not believe that any district justices have had such experience in their legal practice prior to appointment.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on these matters, which <Col N="1170" /> are more fully dealt with in Dr. Michael Forde's textbook on the subject, in order to illustrate that the law on extradition has become increasingly technical.  It is only fair to point out also, that certain legal practitioners have, by virtue of their reputation and experience, an expertise in this area of law which may well not be matched by the district justices before whom they are appearing.  I say this not as a matter of criticism but as a matter of likelihood arising from the very wide and heavy caseload of the District Court.</P>
    <P>It is our proposal that rather than have the District Court deal with this matter, the issue should be dealt with in the Circuit Court.  Members of the Circuit Court must be barristers of very considerable experience.  It is quite probable that they will, in the course of their legal practices, have dealt with extradition cases or have come across points arising from them in other areas of law.  The procedures and the time allocation in the Circuit Court would allow for a fuller hearing which would allow for a full exploration of the matters which I have outlined and which would permit the protection of both the person whom it is proposed be extradited and also the rights of the State.</P>
    <P>While I recognise that the Circuit Court must also deal with an exceedingly heavy caseload, it seems far more appropriate for the reasons I have outlined that the matter should be dealt with in this way.  In conclusion, let me make one thing clear: there is no question in our minds of seeking to weigh the balance against the fugitive or any person who seeks to assert his rights under the Constitution. However, it is one of the requirements of justice that not only should it be done but it should be seen to be done.  This is applicable not only in this country but in the perception of our judicial system abroad.  If there is no trust or faith in our judicial system it is difficult for us to seek to persuade others to improve or ameliorate their system.  If we seek to protect the democratic rights of our people we must be swift to protect the democratic rights of persons living in other democratic countries.  The time and circumstances are such that democracies <Col N="1171" /> must support each other in the fight against terrorism and we must be seen to play our part in as full and appropriate a manner as possible.  In order to do this, we must build on firm foundations and ensure that our judifical system operates effectively and properly from the commencement of proceedings to their termination.  This involves ensuring that matters of complexity, such as extradition, are dealt with in the appropriate forum.  We do not believe that the District Court is the appropriate forum in these circumstances and it is for this reason that we have proposed this motion.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say that we have put forward this suggestion in good faith.  As I said at the outset, we are very fortunate to have an independent Judiciary and any remarks which I have made are not intended to cast any aspersions on any district justice who does his or her job in the way that they see fit and in the manner which they feel is the correct way of doing so.  If other constructive suggestions come forward during the course of this debate from any political party as to other ways and means of improving the position in which we now find ourselves, we, on this side of the House, will only be too willing to consider them.  I sincerely hope the spirit in which this suggestion is put forward will not be used by others to suggest that we are trying to put the blame on an individual or individuals for any decisions handed down in the past. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The reality is that whether or not we like it extradition cases now bring with them a very high political profile.  It is vitally important for the good of this country that we are seen to be prepared to deal with terrorism, with people who engage in acts of terrorism, that we will support other democratic countries which wish to help us in our efforts and that we, in turn, will be prepared to help other countries when perhaps they face similar circumstances.  I am confident that if the goodwill is there we can at all times protect the rights of the individual and, at the same time, be seen to bring forward <Col N="1172" /> those who should be brought forward before the courts to be dealt with so that all of us can defeat this terrible word &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>For centuries those whose function it is to fight crime and to bring criminals to justice have faced a problem with fugitive offenders &mdash; those who having committed an offence seek to put the maximum distance possible between themselves and the scene of that offence.  For centuries those whose function it is to fight crime have found in extradition an important and essential weapon.  Over the centuries travel has become progressively easier; it has moved from travel by foot to travel by Bianconi coaches, railways, cars, aeroplanes and inter-continental aeroplanes. Obviously that has required a response from those whose function it is to deal with fugitive offenders.  That response has been forthcoming in terms of international conventions, such as the European Convention on Extradition, and in terms of a whole myriad of bilateral treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a particular problem when we come to considering that which applies in relation to Britain and Northern Ireland. In the case of Britain and Northern Ireland travel is particularly easy.  For upwards of 20 years, if my memory serves me correctly, no travel documents or passports have been required for travel between Britain and Ireland.  In the case of Northern Ireland there is the additional complication of the existence of a <i>de facto</i> land frontier.  Obviously that requires a particular response.  It requires that our extradition arrangements be fine-tuned and streamlined.  That is so whether we are talking about a shoplifter in the High Street in Kensington who decides to seek refuge in Dún Laoghaire or whether we are talking about a cheque forger in Grafton Street who decides to seek refuge in Kilburn.  It is of general application but when we come to consider the situation which arises out of the campaign of terrorism this island has known then very particular considerations apply because together we are facing a common <Col N="1173" /> enemy, an enemy which has murdered gardaí, members of the Irish Army, kidnapped our citizens and murdered serving Members of the Oireachtas.  In those circumstances there is a particular obligation on us to be in a position to ensure that effective action is taken against fugitive offenders and that our jurisdiction is not used as a haven.</P>
    <P>It is important that we confront that situation and that there be no fudging on it.  That is the choice: there are either effective measures against fugitive offenders or there are none.  If we are not in a position to put in place effective measures, whether in terms of the operation of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act or some other Act that introduces and provides for extra territoriality or extradition, and put in place a workable system of dealing with fugitive offenders, then willy-nilly our territory will become available as a haven.</P>
    <P>The fact has been recognised from a very early stage of the present terrorist campaign.  The first response to this was the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act which had its origins in the Sunningdale Declaration. The belief at that time was that we had constitutional difficulties in providing for extradition for offences which might be regarded as political and that in those circumstances some alternative measure was required.  The alternative measure was found in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  Since then our courts in a series of cases, the McGlinchey, Shannon and Byrnes cases, have restricted the extent of the political exemption and have provided in those situations where the conduct complained of was such that no right thinking civilised person could regard it as political that extradition should follow.</P>
    <P>Our courts gave the lead but if they gave the lead the Oireachtas was not slow in following.  Once it became clear that there was no constitutional problem to extraditing in terrorist-type offences, the State adhered to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, legislation was put through this House to give effect to it and, as we know, subsequent amending legislation was <Col N="1174" /> introduced on points of detail.  It is important to say that on the two occasions when the Dáil and Seanad discussed at length the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism what essentially was at issue were points of detail, points of important detail certainly, but there was no substantial disagreement in this House about the desirability of extraditing those who were sought for terrorist offences.  There was, of course, an anxiety that there would be proper safeguards and there was a degree of disagreement as to what form those safeguards should take, but there was no disagreement whatsoever on the principle that there should be effective extradition for terrorist offences.</P>
    <P>If that question of principle is resolved, what is involved now is the question of the mechanics.  Of course, the mechanics are vital because in the absence of mechanisms that work we are not standing together in solidarity against a common enemy.  We have to accept that if the mechanisms do not work that has an impact not just within this jurisdiction but also on Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland.  Many of us know the extent to which the Anglo-Irish Agreement represented a shock to the Unionist community. They saw for the first time that the Unionist veto, the orange card, had been trumped.  Those of us who attempted to say to them that there was nothing in the Agreement that was inimical to their interests pointed to the prospects the Agreement held out for ever closer security co-operation against a common enemy.  Central to that security co-operation are effective extradition measures so, therefore, the question of the mechanics is vitally important.</P>
    <P>This is the third substantial discussion on extradition we have had in this House in 18 months.  We have also had a series of discussions by way of statements under Standing Order 30 and it has come up umpteen times at Question Time.  It has come up because there has been a series of unhappy cases.  Some cases have given rise to scenes of public disorder in places like Portlaoise, Dublin, Cavan, Longford and other towns and let it be said that in <Col N="1175" /> many of those cases the fault did not lie with anyone in this jurisdiction.  In many of those cases the fault very clearly lay with the requesting authorities.  If we are anxious to put our house in order and to see that no stone is left unturned by us that will see cases fall down improperly or unnecessarily in the future, it is equally appropriate that the message must go out to the British authorities that they, too, must do their part.</P>
    <P>One has to say that in a number of cases where requests have been made, including requests in cases of apparently great importance to them the attitude they have taken has been less than committed; frankly, it has been lackadaisical. They have sent photostats of warrants, warrants which on the face of them were clearly duplicitous and warrants which quite clearly were never signed by judicial officers.  Some of that comes from a certain lackadaisical attitude and some of it comes from a lack of a proper regard for our courts, a belief that somehow or other our courts are not entitled to expect and demand the same standards of proof and adherence to proper procedures as would be required in Bow Street Magistrates Court.  In many instances the fault lay with the requesting authorities; in other instances some of the blame rests on our collective shoulders.  Wherever the blame in an individual case lies, it is not good enough because the public of this country do not want to be sullied by being associated with the people who have committed many of the atrocities.  They are outraged when they see people who are wanted in connection with offences of the utmost gravity walking free on what appears to them to be the basest of technicalities.</P>
    <P>I have already said what the effect on Unionist opinion is bound to be.  They have been suspicious about our bona fides.  The Unionist community in Northern Ireland, who have been the subject of a campaign of genocide, are understandably suspicious.  If we tell them that we are serious, with virtual unanimity on the principle, that we have put legislation through this House, they will say &ldquo;That is fine, but where are the extraditees? <Col N="1176" /> Do not all of the cases break down?&rdquo; Who can blame them if they are suspicious in those circumstances?  We know, too, that those who entered into the Anglo-Irish Agreement did so from different motivations.  We were concerned essentially to have a forum through which we could advocate effectively the cause of the minority community in Northern Ireland.  The British Government saw the agreement as a means to more effective security co-operation. If, despite the passage of legislation, it does not appear that that is happening, if it appears that stumbling blocks still exist, obviously the British will be concerned and anxious and it will call into question the extent of their commitment to the whole Anglo-Irish process.</P>
    <P>It behoves us to make sure that the technicalities are right and the mechanisms work.  In this motion, because we do not have time to put forward a Private Members' Bill which we might have otherwise done, we have given the Dáil an opportunity to put suggestions to the Government which we hope they will take away and come back with in the autumn, suggestions that would provide for a more effective, a more streamlined system of extradition.  I want to put some specific suggestions.  The first thing that is urgently required &mdash; and indeed at this stage is long overdue &mdash; is that on both sides a definitive check list of the proofs in an extradition application should be assembled.  I find it extraordinary that that has not happened to date.  My collegue, Deputy Barrett, has indicated just what are the obligations on the State, as representative of the requesting authority, in the District Court.  That court is only concerned with three matters &mdash; the validity of the warrant, the question of whether it is a corresponding offence and whether the identification of the person in court has been established as the person named or described in the warrant. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man that such a check list be assembled and that it then be ticked off point by point whenever the request has been made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> The Anglo-Irish Agreement contemplated that the Conference established by that agreement would concern itself with policy questions of extradition. There is a secretariat in place.  There is apparently constant communication between the Attorneys General and their respective offices.  It must be possible for such a check list to be established.  Then, associated with that, it seems that, certainly in our Attorney General's Office and in the office of the British Attorney General or the Crown Prosecution Service &mdash;I never quite understood the chain of authority there, wherever it is appropriate in Britain &mdash; in each jurisdiction one person should be assigned whose function it is to take charge of all extradition requests, who would see to it that a request does not proceed until he has satisfied himself that everything is in order and that he has, at least internally, certified that fact.</P>
    <P>We have had a whole series of cases where different things have gone wrong and afterwards we have had people clucking around the place, one blaming the other.  Let us now, before there are any more requests, decide in future who is going to take responsibility for seeing this through, from the issue of the warrant to the delivery up at the port of wherever. Then if something does go wrong, at least it would be possible to ask how that could be, since the senior legal assistant, or whoever, in the Attorney General's Office certified that everything was in order.  The first suggestion was a check list and the second a certifying officer to take charge and see to it that there will be no further messing, or, at the very least, who will be responsible and identifiable if something else does go wrong.</P>
    <P>The next suggestion that I want to put is that in cases that arise from the 1987 Extradition (No. 2) Act &mdash; and essentially I am talking about any cases of a terrorist type &mdash; because of their sensitivity, because of the inevitability that they will be fought all the way, the State should be represented by senior counsel and by senior counsel drawn from among the small group who have held themselves <Col N="1178" /> out and have developed a specialist expertise in this field.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The fourth suggestion that we are putting is that cases involving extradition should not be heard any more in the District Court.  Again, as Deputy Barrett has said, this is not designed as a criticism of the District Court.  Our whole legal system operates on the basis that there are courts that are appropriate for particular kinds of offences.  We are saying that extradition cases, both because they involve very complex questions of law and because the implications of particular decisions are very wide reaching, are not appropriate for hearing in the District Court.  There is nothing new or radical about that.  In a whole series of instances, jurisdiction of the District Court has been confined over the years.  That court can deal only with minor criminal offences and there have been all sorts of challenges, on matters ranging from road traffic offences to butter smuggling, to decide how minor is minor.  The District Court cannot grant bail in certain serious cases &mdash; for example, in a murder case.  That court is specifically stated in the Constitution to be a court of limited and local jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate that cases of this importance should be sandwiched into the District Court list.  Frankly, it is unreal.  I do not know if this happened in the case that is uppermost in all our minds, but it is unreal that a District Justice with a long list interrupts his list, halfway through granting an extension of a licence to the local rugby club and about to take up the list of parking summonses from the local traffic warden, to deal with a case of somebody wanted in connection with a mass murder, with all the implications that will arise depending on the decision to which he comes.  It is just not the appropriate legal forum.  Such cases should be taken away from the District Court.  We have suggested that they <Col N="1179" /> should go to the Circuit Court.  There would, of course, still be the opportunity to go from there to the High Court and raise issues wider than those now open in the District Court and, with the change, open in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Since our suggestion was first put forward by Deputy Barrett during the statements made to the House on the McVeigh case, others have said that they see a certain merit in it, but have put forward alternative suggestions.  Deputy Colley, in the course of a radio programme at the weekend, suggested one set of proceedings in the High Court.  I do not close my mind to that possibility, but it seems desirable to operate some kind of two-tier system, a screening system whereby the large number of cases which are non-contentious can be dealt with at local level and those that are contentious can find their way to the High Court.  We do not hold ourselves out as being infallible on that.</P>
    <P>I toss out another possibility; that all cases would go to the District Court and the defendant would be asked whether he is consenting to extradition or not. A very large number of defendants do consent to extradition.  If they do not consent to their extradition, then without further ado the cases would be transferred for hearing in the High Court.  We do not pretend to have the last word on that.  There is a degree of public disquiet about the frequency with which extradition cases have broken down.  That requires a response from the Legislature. Because of the calendar, we are not in a position to put forward legislation tonight.  We have afforded the Dáil an opportunity to consider different options. We ask the Government to think about the matter and come back with proposals in the autumn, proposals that will involve the transfer of extradition cases from where they do not belong to places where they would more properly reside.  If that does not happen we are prepared to use our Private Members' time in the autumn to put forward specific legislation and, if necessary, to vote it through.  On the basis of the talk around the House it <Col N="1180" /> seems that the Government see a degree of merit in our proposals and that they will not oppose our motion.  That is welcome, but I hope that the Minister for Justice or the Government will not say that there is a certain degree of merit in our proposals, that they will think about it and that that is the last we will hear about it.  The Government will have the summer recess to consider our proposals and we want specific legislation introduced in the autumn.  Otherwise, we will be obliged to act ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The part of the motion which calls on the Government to review extradition procedure in the District Courts will not cause problems to anyone in the House because a review of extradition procedures under Part III of the 1965 Act is already laid down in section 6 of the most recent Extradition Act whereby the Government are enabled to organise a review of the extradition procedures under Part III of the 1965 Act on a yearly basis.</P>
      <P>Deputy Birmingham said earlier that he thought the Government accepted the motion, but I have a problem in regard to transferring cases from the District Court to the Circuit Court.  Having listened to Deputy Barrett and Deputy Birmingham, I am still not convinced that such transfers should take place.  Neither of them advanced any cogent reasons for taking extradition cases in the Circuit Court instead of the District Court.</P>
      <P>The Legislature should not get involved in a motion which was brought in very quickly after a problematical case in relation to extradition over the last week or so.  The Dáil is reacting to something which took place last week and the motion is a knee jerk reaction.  The House should not react to particular incidents, it should react to a general situation; and a motion like this is not the correct way to deal with the problem.  We often hear the maxim that hard cases make bad law and that applies in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Birmingham said that they were not casting any reflection on the district justices.  However, my <Col N="1181" /> reading of the motion leads me to believe that there is a reflection on the district justices&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barrett said that district justices should not deal with these cases, which, in effect, means they are not competent to do so.  They are competent because the vast majority of extradition cases have been dealt with quite well in the District Court.  Indeed, even when cases have been appealed to the High Court, the decision of the District Court has been upheld in the vast majority of them.  I do not accept that extradition cases should not be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
      <P>The extradition procedure laid down in Part III of the 1965 Act is probably the most simplified procedure there could be. Deputy Birmingham dwelt on this point and said that the procedure should be streamlined.  It is the most streamlined procedure possible in any extradition procedures and, but for the 1987 Act, it would be a backing of warrants.  The corresponding legislation in England is called the Backing of Warrants (Ireland) Act, 1965, which was brought in simultaneously with our 1965 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The District Court has a vast area of case law with which they can deal in relation to the procedure.  It was implied that the State should be represented by senior counsel expert in this area, but that is casting a reflection on the State solicitors who, day in and day out, process extradition cases and bring them to court.  Indeed, they may decide in some cases that they should not be brought to court.  Decisions in recent cases in the District Court may not have gone the way that some people in this House would have wanted, but it should be rememberd that these decisions are not binding on any subsequent extradition case, a point which seems to have escaped many people.  I know that the State is appealing to the High Court by way of a case stated in relation to that.  The 1987 Act came in for some cricitism in relation to the most <Col N="1182" /> recent case but that case had nothing to do with the 1987 Act, which has worked well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the most recent extradition legislation passed by this Dáil.  It is interesting that a portion of that has already built into it a mechanism whereby the whole extradition procedure under the 1965 Act, Part III, can be reviewed.  Apart from that &mdash; and this was a suggestion made by Deputy Birmingham &mdash; one particular person should be delegated to see that the extradition documents are in order.  In the 1987 Act it was specified that the Attorney General would certify that there was a case in relation to the extradition.  That is exactly what some people on the far side of the House found fault with in the 1987 legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the idea of the District Court not being a fit place, I have to disagree with that.  Deputy Birmingham said that some extradition cases might be intertwined with small traffic offences. That may well be the case, but it could also be the case in the Circuit Court.  One major point that should be made from a practical point of view is that in extradition procedures once the warrant is brought to a court and a person is brought to the court, he has to be brought as soon as possible to the next available District Justice in the area where the arrest was <Col N="1185" /> made or, if there is no District Justice available, to a peace commissioner.  I question how somebody could be brought to a Circuit Court in my area as the Circuit Court sits only four times a year. It sits in May and there is not a sitting then until September/October.  How can anyone be brought to the Circuit Court for extradition?  It is just not practicable. Speakers on the other side of the House talked about unhappy cases.  Surely there would be unhappy cases if they went to the Circuit Court or the High Court. Their motion &mdash; while there well may be a need for a review of the whole extradition procedure from time to time as laid down in the most recent Act, &mdash; their motion suggesting a transfer of cases from the District Court to the Circuit Court is totally misguided and I could not go along with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by saying that this debate is a sham, not to mention a shambles.  The Minister for Justice is absent, no doubt on business. We do not have a responsible Minister, or a Minister who is accepting responsibility in the House to answer the debate, and neither do we have the proposer of the motion due to an understandable anger about the way this motion is being treated.  It is a very serious issue.  I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to review the provisions of the Extradition Act of 1965 and in particular, to consider whether in any proceedings under that Act, where the person arrested does not acquiesce in the making of such extradition order when brought before the District Court, the hearing of all matters relating to the making of such order should be before the High Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion deserves a lot more consideration than is being given to it.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Ahern has stepped in, apparently to oppose the motion, but we are not certain.  We do <Col N="1186" /> not know, having heard the speakers from the Government side, the opinion of the Government on this issue.  That is disgraceful.  I will continue with my speech which I hope the House hears, giving it the importance that other motions in the House have been accorded previously.</P>
    <P>Extradition is that arrangement between civilised countries which allows for the pursuit of those who have been tried and sentenced or those who are wanted for trial by one state in the jurisdiction of another state.  It is a long-established practice which recognises that there is common case between civilised nations when it comes to defeating crime. The process of extradition operates by way of treaties between different nations or reciprocal legislation passed by the two states.  Many types of offences are dealt with under extradition law, offences from common theft to serious cases of kidnapping or murder.</P>
    <P>The Extradition Act, 1965, which was introduced following on the case of the State's <i>Quinn v. Ryan</i> that year, sets down the basis for extradition from this country firstly to the UK and secondly to other states.  Procedures laid down in Part III of that Act involve the endorsement of the foreign warrant by the Commissioner of the Garda and the arrest of the wanted person by a member of the Garda on foot of that warrant.  The person arrested must then be brought before a district justice or a peace commissioner who may remand him in custody or on bail for not more than eight days until the next District Court sitting. The proceedings then move to the District Court which under the Act must now make the order for the fugitive to be delivered up to the requesting State. Prior to the 1965 Act, the Garda simply arrested this person on foot of the endorsed warrant and delivered him or her up without any necessity to go into court at all.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of the hearing the district justice must inquire whether the person arrested is legally represented and may adjourn the proceedings if necessary if he or she wishes to be legally <Col N="1187" /> represented and a case prepared.  The district justice under the Act must be satisfied on a number of counts before he can make an order.  Controversy and a considerable amount of litigation has grown up over the last number of years around the three main elements about which the district justice must be satisfied. These areas are: (1) the validity of the warrant and other documents; (2) that the person arrested is the same person as that named on the warrant; and (3) that the offence is one in respect of which he may make an order.</P>
    <P>In recent times it has become clear that in cases involving political offences these issues which the District Justice must be satisfied with are being called into question on a regular basis.  What apparently was a simple procedure as laid down in the Act is now the subject of a great deal of legal argument in these cases.  Almost invariably where this occurs the person who is arrested on foot of extradition warrants exercises his or her right to state a case to the High Court or to apply for <i>habeas corpus</i> also in the High Court. This means that these issues are first of all discussed and argued about in the District Court and are then repeated in the High Court in most instances.</P>
    <P>On a number of grounds the Progressive Democrats feel that the District Court is unsuitable for the resolution of sometimes fine and complicated legal issues.  Despite what Deputy Ahern said, there is certaintly no reflection on my part or on the part of the Progressive Democrats on the capabilities and abilities of district justices.  If the circumstances and the back-up facilities were such in the District Court as to enable a distict justice to spend the time then the case could be regarded in a different light.  We should not confuse the competence of district justices and the suitability of a court of summary jurisdiction for extradition.</P>
    <P>The order in the District Court is, in <Col N="1188" /> effect, a preliminary order.  Extradition may not actually take place on foot of such an order without the person who is the subject of it being informed of his right to apply to the High Court within 15 days for <i>habeas corpus</i>.  The person in custody must not be handed over until at least 15 days have elapsed from the time of the District Court order unless that person consents to being handed over.  It is clear that unless the arrested person consents to the order the matter will almost undoubtedly be heard before the High Court.  It is, therefore, inefficient and a waste of time and money to have two similar hearings in different courts on the same subject.</P>
    <P>It was never intended that the District Court should have to grapple with fine points of law and hear lengthy submissions on the pros and cons of executing an extradition in this court of first instance.  The District Court is a summary court dealing with everyday issues such as petty theft, drunkenness, soliciting, road traffic offences, etc.  Summary justice is effected, which is not to detract from its fairness or its effectiveness.  It is also a court which is the point at which more serious criminal matters are initiated.  Defendents then move to a court of a higher jurisdiction for the substantive issues to be heard and decided on.  This procedure is very much akin to what we are suggesting in our amendment to this motion.  The same procedure is at present used in bail applications where decisions of a substantive nature are taken by the High Court.  It is important to remember that in all extradition cases the liberty of the individual is at stake and, even more importantly he or she is being delivered up to another jurisdiction. The court must be satisfied that the requesting state is entitled to extradite from Ireland for the offence concerned and that the judicial authority issuing the warrant is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Real concerns have been expressed over the last number of years with regard to some aspects of British justice and its <Col N="1189" /> particular impact on Irish people.  Reservations have been expressed about the conviction and confirmation of appeal of conviction of the Birmingham Six among others.  There has also been disquiet about the failure to prosecute members of the RUC implicated in an apparent &ldquo;shoot to kill&rdquo; policy.  That episode appeared to be more concerned with justice bowing to political considerations and seemed to many Irish people to indicate that British justice does not extend to an Irish context.</P>
    <P>The fact that these causes for disquiet have arisen should not, in my opinion, mean that the whole process of extradition should grind to a halt.  The two Governments, of Britain and of Ireland, share a common objective, that is to restore peace to the island of Ireland.  In order to achieve this it is essential that co-operation exists as regards the tracing and prosecution of criminals involved in terrorism.  It must be recognised also that neither Government can combat this problem on its own, no matter what efforts are made.  The two jurisdictions are, therefore, inextricably linked in this cause.  It is only right therefore, that we ensure that the extradition procedures which we have available to us are made effective.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of cases in recent years where extradition applications from the United Kingdom have failed at the District Court in this jurisdiction. These cases have failed for a variety of reasons, mostly involving a failure to provide proper proofs, or a failure to adhere properly to the requirements of the 1965 Act.  It has to be said that as between the UK and here, there seems to be some sloppiness in the approach that the British authorities take towards the District Court hearing.  Other decisions are, on the other hand, inexplicable, given the evidence before the court.</P>
    <P>In order to introduce some certainty in these decisions and proper responsibility for the results of them, I feel it is quite <Col N="1190" /> appropriate that any contested case should be transferred to the High Court for hearing.  This will have the effect of leaving in place the two layers of judicial responsibility that exist at present. However, it will acknowledge what is realistically the case, that is, that the District Court should not be expected to entertain difficult legal argument on which a person's liberty and delivery to another jurisdiction depends.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of extradition as between Britain and Ireland has become clouded by the political storm which was introduced into the issue by the Government when they brought in amending legislation last winter prior to our ratifying the European Convention on Terrorism. There was a carefully orchestrated campaign at that time to, first of all, whip up fears about the effect of our ratification of this treaty and, secondly, to play them down when it appeared that it would be very difficult for the Government politically not to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil backbench opinion, of the very green variety, was fanned into believing that vast numbers of our citizens were going to be at risk following on the ratification of the Convention on Terrorism.  They then found themselves in the situation where, due to a number of unfortunate incidents of a terrorist nature occurring at around that time, they were forced to ratify the convention. However, to put some kind of political gloss on their about turn, they introduced the Extradition (Amendment) Bill and rushed it through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The main feature of this Bill was the introduction of the Attorney General into the process of extradition as between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Following that legislation, the Attorney General, a political appointee, is an integral part of the procedures, having been given the responsibility of certifying that there is a clear indication to prosecute and that this intention is founded on the <Col N="1191" /> existence of sufficient evidence.  As the Taoiseach himself said, in the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the introduction of the Attorney General into the process was a new procedural step which would require the Attorney to &ldquo;exercise his function and form his opinion about the existence of, and the foundation for, the intention to prosecute in each and every case&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It was the Progressive Democrats opinion then, and it remains so, that this new function of the Attorney General is a quasi-judicial function at the very least, and is, therefore, constitutionally suspect. Sooner or later a case will be brought to the High Court and Supreme Court on this issue, which will, if it is found to be unconstitutional, put in jeopardy the whole extradition process between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The other direct result of the involvement of the Attorney General in the extradition process is that that process becomes politicised.  The Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and reports directly to the Taoiseach.  He is a political appointee who loses office with a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The close relationship between the Attorney General and the Government, taken together with his responsibility for consenting to the endorsement of extradition warrants, especially where many of these warrants concern people wanted for quasi-political offences, sets a very dangerous trend.  At the very least the Attorney General leaves himself open to allegations of political pressure, no matter which way he decides the matters. There is the added aspect that the opinion he forms, on which basis the consent is given or withheld to extradite, is formed behind closed doors with no reasons given and therefore no way of countering the information which he has considered.</P>
    <P>This is one of the major reasons why the whole extradition process as between Britain and Ireland has become politicised, <Col N="1192" /> and reaction, therefore, to a perceived failure on the Irish administration's part to extradite, is seen in Britain as being politically motivated.</P>
    <P>At the outset I omitted to say that I wished to share my time with Deputy O'Malley, if the House agrees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When an extradition case fails in these circumstances the fact that it is the District Court which has jurisdiction and makes the order, or fails to make it, is seen as further evidence of our lack of willingness to extradite persons wanted for terrorist offences.  The District Court is seen, nowithstanding the undoubted capabilities of district justices, as a court in which uncertainty on this issue reigns.  The procedures and discipline required in a High Court hearing would, I believe, inject a degree of care in the preparation of warrants and accompanying documents which has been recently so lacking.</P>
      <P>There are many cases of extradition warrants being executed over the years where the person arrested did not challenge the warrant and consented to his extradition.  These are the cases we do not hear about and which cause the District Court no problems.  There is no real reason to remove these cases from the jurisdiction of the District Court as it is fully competent to make such orders, which are then confirmed by consent of the person extradited, as set out in the Act.  However it is surely more appropriate for judges of the High Court to examine issues in an extradition case where a person's liberty is at stake and we are taking another jurisdiction, to a certain extent, on trust that the requirements of their law have been fully complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the court is required to establish whether the offence is one which satisfies the dual criminality rule, <Col N="1193" /> that is, whether there is a similar offence in this jurisdiction to that claimed to have been committed in the warrant which is also considered to be a serious offence here.  This examination may bring in claims that the offence was a political offence or committed in connection with a political offence, which is a matter that the High Court properly has jurisdiction to exmaine.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1965 the arrested person has a right to judicial review of the case under a number of headings. These include whether the offence is political, military or a Revenue offence and whether the person would be in fact prosecuted for any such offence even though extradited for another one.  The <i>habeas corpus</i> provision under the Constitution also allows questions regarding the validity of the original arrest in Ireland and general constitutional questions to be raised.  These all however are proper to the High Court jurisdiction alone.  Once more, I believe that the examination of these issues should be restricted to the High Court in the first instance.  Similar provisions exist in the law on bail in this jurisdiction and therefore it is not a new concept.  Our amendment also allows the possibility of appealing to the Supreme Court, which of course is there at present. This would not be affected by a change in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the particular proposal which the Fine Gael Party have made in this motion.  While I see merit in removing some of the responsibility from the District Court in extradition cases, I feel that the proposal to transfer the first instance jurisdiction to the Circuit Court is mistaken.  What is the purpose of this? It would seem that, in their rush to change the procedures urgently, Fine Gael have decided to, perhaps, throw the baby out with the bath water.  I take on board the comments of Deputies Barrett and Birmingham and their openness to other suggestions on this issue.</P>
    <P>To initiate all extradition cases at Circuit Court level would first of all introduce <Col N="1194" /> a greater amount of expense into the proceedings for all concerned.  Many of the cases, as I have already said, are unopposed and would be quite rightly dealt with in a District Court setting. This occurs in many other criminal cases where the defendant is given the option to have the offence tried summarily at District Court level or to opt for the Circuit Criminal Court.  In this case the arrested person would be given the option, by consenting to the extradition order, of having it dealt with at District Court level.  In the event of his not consenting the issue would then properly go to the court which already has jurisdiction in matters of the liberty of the individual.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court does not have jurisdiction in such matters in general at present.  Its jurisdiction in relation to the deprivation of a person's liberty is restricted to the trial of criminal cases in the Circuit Criminal Court, which itself must be initiated in the District Court.  It is therefore not a court of first instance in these terms.  However the High Court in fact often hears cases which are brought initially before it without going through any prior procedures.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting aspect of the whole extradition process that those judges who at present are expected to make extradition orders have no access to a library, are not officially circulated with law reports, and are therefore ill-equipped to deal with the nuances and finer legal points which may be presented to them. It is the case, for instance, that the most recent publication on extradition law published last December would not be supplied to district justices as a text of the issue.  Add to that the fact that the District Court is a court of summary justice and that the pressure is on the justice to make quick decisions, it can be seen that it is very difficult for the justice to give the matter the kind of consideration it would get at High Court level and which is necessary for the protection of citizens and the enforcement of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> The district justice is required to decide whether or not the offence claimed to have been committed on the extradition warrant is comparable to an offence in Irish law.  How can he or she, without the back-up of a proper library, be expected to do so?  The Garda are often caught in the middle of wrangles in regard to extradition.  Because decisions can, and sometimes are, altered within the space of an hour or two inside the District Court in extradition matters, the Garda, in whose custody the arrested person is, are sometimes made to look foolish and incompetent.  In the majority of cases that impression is unwarranted.  We should make every effort to ensure that that does not occur again, irrespective of which court has jurisdiction.  The credibility of our legal system is at issue when we see changes in decisions being made within the space of a couple of hours.</P>
    <P>The reputation which the country has around the world as being a nation of terrorist, or fellow travellers, is one which we can ill afford.  I believe that it is high time we took note of the trend in recent years in exradition cases, looked to the reasons for these incidents and took it upon ourselves to amend the law so as to avoid any confusion in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say a great deal in three minutes but I want to say that there are two potential methods at the two extremes of dealing with extradition and each of them is equally unacceptable. One is that it becomes an almost automatic administrative slot machine system, which is sometimes urged on us, and the other extreme is what frankly we have at the moment &mdash; something of extraordinary legal technicalities where people are able to avoid extradition by a reliance on extremely technical matters that do not go to the <Col N="1196" /> merits of the case at all and where, even if they are ultimately extradited, they are able to avoid that extradition for an abnormally long period of time.  I do not think that either of those extremes is satisfactory.  What would be satisfactory is something in between, something that is more expeditious than what we have but which is obviously fairer than just an automatic or administrative type system.</P>
      <P>The extradition of a person is not his conviction and it is because of the apprehensions in regard to cases in Britain that the House has seen fit to put in place a system that is extremely complicated. One can, perhaps, understand why that is so.  We are entitled to ask the question, why is there not such an extraordinarily complicated system in place in regard to extraditions to other countries?  The criminal trial process in many of the continental European countries is, to say the least, very unsatisfactory but we do not seem to have any great concern about people who might be extradited to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to simplify the system &mdash; a great many people would like to see it simplified &mdash; the Progressive Democrats, in their amendment, have made the suggestion that except in the many cases where the defendant acquiesces in his extradition, and he does in the great majority of cases in this country with the exception normally of the so-called or allegedly quasi-political cases, the actual hearing should be, in these quasi-political cases, in the High Court.  It is much more satisfactory than the Circuit Court.  The proposal in the motion to substitute the Circuit Court for the District Court is simply substituting one unnecessary layer for another.  The Circuit Court is not suited to this type of hearing.  It does not engage in summary hearings of first instance in criminal matters.  The obvious place where all the argument goes on is in the High Court.  Rather than have the case duplicated, it should start there except for a formal appearance in the District Court where the defendant says that he does not acquiesce in his extradition. <Col N="1197" /> If he is going to contest it, let him do so in the High Court.  That seems to make more sense.</P>

Some of us may have reservations or may wish to make points either amending, adding to or taking from what has been said before.

It is an entirely credible body of law, founded on the Constitution and the Acts of this Parliament. The Deputy then went on to say that this country has a reputation for terrorists and fellow-travellers of terrorists. Again, I take grave exception to that.</P>

      <P>If what I have just said is true, then I want to reiterate in the strongest possible terms that I take grave exception to those remarks.  I am sure a majority, not just of this House but of the people of the country, would take grave exception to what she has said.</P>
      <P>In regard to the motion and the amendment, in the 1987 Act there is a review procedure which is due to come up after 1 January next year.  This House is going to go into recess next week and will not resume until October.  To be quite candid, I honestly do not see the need for this motion and this amendment.  The review procedure is already in place and it has been enacted as a result of decisions of this House less than 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of points in favour of going through the District Court, <Col N="1199" /> which deserve to be mentioned specifically here.  The first point, which should be acceptable to people whether they be defendants, plaintiffs, people acting for them or the general public looking on at the procedure, is that the procedure is a relatively simple one.  Times out of number we hear commentators, especially politicians, saying that the law and its procedures should be simple. Here we have a relatively simple procedure and apparently, even though it has operated satisfactorily for quite a period of time, it is now being called into question.  The second point is in relation to the speed of the procedure.  We often hear people quoting that justice delayed is justice denied.  There is no quicker form of justice than to go into the District Court and have your case disposed of at the end of the week.</P>
    <P>The question of the venue also arises. If the matter is tried in the District Court it is tried in the defendant's home territory; He does not have to be dragged off to Cork, Limerick, Dublin or some other venue.  It is tried in his home venue, possibly less than fve or ten minutes walk away.  All these are practical considerations of justice.  There is the additional practical consideration of expense.  If we are going to bring people into the District Court, then we are going to involve barristers.  We have been debating in this House and outside it for some time about removing barristers from certain aspects of the legal scene, or at least cutting down on their numbers so that we can cut down on expense. Are we going to load expense onto the defendants who will be brought before the court?  If we beat our breasts and say: &ldquo;No, we are not going to load expense onto them&rdquo;, then are we going to load expense onto the Exchequer by creating additional fees, to be met out of the free legal aid scheme?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, nobody is precluded from appealing these decisions, either the State or the defendant.  If somebody says <Col N="1200" /> you can only appeal to the High Court, I presume that neither the motion nor the amendment would want to preclude an appeal to the High Court.  Instead of having two courts, the initial court which is the District Court and the court of appeal which is the High Court, we are now going to introduce a third court.  We will then have the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is a final practical consideration. I would throw this out as a very reasonable point of view to anybody who is familiar with the court scene at present, in particular the Circuit Court scene. There are a number of lawyers on all sides of this House at present.  The list in most Circuit Court areas is such that justice is often denied by being often delayed.  If we are to introduce extradition cases into the Circuit Court, as envisaged in the Fine Gael motion, then we may very well be over-burdening the Circuit Court, as it is constituted at present, beyond what it can stand.  That, again, is a practical consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said that the question of the British media was relevant.  He mentioned unjustifiable criticism and then went on to say that this was a matter of perception.  I would like to take this opportunity of agreeing 100 per cent with Deputy Barrett when he said that in many instances this is unjustifiable criticism by the British media.  That is a correct statement. I have made it from time to time and I am sure most other Deputies have as well.  I would like to commend him, as Fine Gael spokesman for Justice, for putting this on the record of this House. It seems that the chorus of unjustifiable criticism, as he calls it, or, as I would call it, an ignorant, ill-informed anti-Irish gutter press criticism, always emanates when some decision, as they perceive it, does not go their way.  It is time somebody said this was totally unjustifiable and to that extend Deputy Barrett is completely in the right.  I agree with what he said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday last, I sent a letter to the Minister for Justice outlining the details of an alleged assault on an innocent person by a number of members of the Garda Síochána.  The circumstances described in that letter constitute, in my view, one of the most serious cases that I have ever been made aware of.</P>
      <P>I have spoken personally to a number of witnesses to the incident and to the victim.  I have seen photographs that were taken at the time, and I have supplied copies of those photographs to the Minister. They leave no doubt that the young man in this case was brutally and viciously beaten.  The evidence available suggests two things very strongly: firstly, this assault was undertaken by gardaí whose identity is known to me and, secondly, it was both unprovoked and totally unjustified. The most important thing I want to hear the Minister say &mdash; in response to this set of circumstances &mdash; is that there will be no cover-up of this incident.  This House must get an assurance that it will be fully and publicly investigated.  In light of the circumstances I am going to outline, I believe it is also imperative that all the gardaí involved must immediately be removed from duty pending a full and satisfactory outcome to the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The name of the victim in this case is Derek Fairbrother.  Mr. Fairbrother is 24 years old and a graduate of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers.  He has no previous history of trouble of any sort with the Garda, and, in fact, is of such good character that he is considered fit by the <Col N="1202" /> gardaí in Finglas to hold a gun licence. He is employed in the family business of installing and maintaining refrigeration, washing and other equipment in the catering trade, as well as in the management and running of a family owned pub, the &ldquo;Ailesbury Inn&rdquo;, in Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 11 June last, after the pub was closed and tidied, Mr. Fairbrother remained behind to carry out a duty known as clearing the beer lines. This is a duty that can only be effectively carried out when the pub is closed.  It takes several hours to complete.  He left the pub some time around 3.30 a.m., uniformed gardaí got into the back seat and went to a friend's house.  After some time he left with some friends &mdash; five of them &mdash; and was driving them home in a Nissan Prairie Estate car.</P>
    <P>At approximately 5.30 a.m. he was driving on the main road approaching the dual carriageway leading from Finglas South to Glasnevin with a view to turning left towards Finglas.  As he approached the yield sign he slowed and stopped. Immediately an unmarked car with two male occupants in casual clothes pulled up in front of him.  One of them jumped out and directed Mr. Fairbrother to pull across the road as they wanted to check him for drunken driving.  He did as he was directed and then demanded identification from the people concerned.  One of the two men flashed identification at him, allowing him no more than a glance. The men said they were police officers, but their car was unmarked.</P>
    <P>Derek Fairbrother got out of the car. At no stage was he unco-operative.  He told them he was quite prepared to be breathalysed even though he had no drink taken.  He does, however, appear to have suggested that one of the men should try the breathalyser himself.  They did not have one in their own car, and radioed for the local squad car to come. While waiting for the arrival of the squad car, Derek Fairbrother and one of his friends, who had also got out of the Nissan, sat on a low wall chatting. <Col N="1203" /> According to all of the witnesses, nothing took place in the nature of a disagreement or argument.  No resistance of any kind was shown by anybody.</P>
    <P>After a few minutes, an official squad car and another unmarked car arrived. The official car had three uniformed officers.  It is unclear how many were in the other car.  The uniformed gardaí approached Derek Fairbrother who was identified to them by the two men who had originally stopped him.  They demanded that Mr. Fairbrother get into the back of the squad car.  There was no caution or any other investigation of the circumstances.  Notwithstanding that, Mr. Fairbrother immediately proceeded to get into the back of the car.  As he was walking towards the squad car, without any warning, he was suddenly struck several times on the head by batons.  His injuries later show four deep long wounds which clearly came from some hard instrument being brought down hard on the left top side of his head.  One of the photographs in my possession is a photograph of these injuries.</P>
    <P>Blood immediately poured from these wounds, and the gardaí continued to push Mr. Fairbrother into the back of the squad car.  He was thrown prostrate on to the back seat of the car; two of the uniformed gardaí got into the back seat also.  One of them sat on top of Mr. Fairbrother and they continued to beat him while the squad car was driving to Finglas Garda station, about three-quarters of a mile away.  A milkman and his helpers who were passing at the time, but otherwise were not involved, witnessed this incident and confirmed that there appeared to be no resistance by Mr. Fairbrother or any involvement by the others.</P>
    <P>During this short journey Mr. Fairbrother was bleeding heavily, with the result that he, his clothes and the gardaí, as well as the squad car, were saturated with blood.  Witnesses have confirmed that when the squad car arrived at the Garda station, he was physically dragged <Col N="1204" /> out of the car, thrown to the ground, and beaten and kicked again.  He tried to protect himself by crawling under the squad car.  Later, the sergeant in charge suggested that Mr. Fairbrother was crawling under the car in an attempt to turn it over.  He was then carried into a cell.  It appears that in the cell several gardaí continued to beat him.  No effort was made to treat his wounds or to clear up the blood.  No attempt was made by either of the two sergeants in charge to stop this brutality.</P>
    <P>Accordingly to my investigation, a ban-garda called for an ambulance when Mr. Fairbrother arrived at the Garda station. When this ambulance arrived, a Garda officer told them it was a false alarm and that they were not required. However, they saw enough blood, and heard enough commotion in the back of the Garda station, to make them suspicious. When the ambulance got back to base, they telephoned their headquarters for instructions in the circumstances. They were told that if a further call came in, they were to get the name of the person calling.  About an hour later there was a further call, apparently from the same source, requesting an ambulance to come back to the station.  The same team as on the first occasion went back to the station.  When they arrived, they were brought into a room where Derek Fairbrother was lying face down on the ground.  He appeared to have been dragged in from another room.  There was a person present who identified himself as a doctor, although he offered Mr. Fairbrother no assistance whatsoever.  The ambulance men treated Mr. Fairbrother's wounds as best they could, and helped him out to get him on a stretcher. He was taken to the Mater Hospital and held there until last Wednesday night.</P>
    <P>At the time that he was taken away, two of his friends hailed a passing taxi and followed the squad car immediately to Finglas station.  One of them remained at the station, and the other went on with the taxi to notify Mr. Fairbrother's <Col N="1205" /> family.  Within 15 minutes of Mr. Fairbrother arriving at the Garda station, members of his family had arrived.  They were not allowed to see him.  During the incident, his father, two brothers and several other people all arrived at the station. They were all treated with absolute contempt and abuse and given no hearing whatsoever.  In fact, his father was threatened that he would be locked up also if he did not get off the premises.  One of Derek Fairbrother's brothers managed to take photographs which show the condition he was in, the blood in the squad car and on the ground, and the efforts of the ambulance men to help him. Although they could hear Derek Fairbrother shouting for help in the station, they were unable to get near him.</P>
    <P>I have met Mr. Fairbrother since his discharge from hospital and I can testify to the trauma that he has suffered. Although I am not an expert, it appears to me that it will be a long time, if ever, before he gets over this incident.  Perhaps even worse than that, since I first became aware of this incident, I have been made aware of a number of incidents which all point to one conclusion &mdash; pressure is being brought to bear on the family involved, by sources within the Garda Síochána, to persuade them to facilitate a covering up of this incident.  It is to their eternal credit that they have stood firm against this pressure.</P>
    <P>An incident like this causes tremendous discredit to our gardaí, the vast majority of whom are honourable and decent people.  The only thing that could cause greater discredit would be any attempt to cover it up, and to protect any guilty parties.</P>
    <P>The evidence available to me leads me to conclude that seven officers of different ranks were involved.  I intend to supply the names of those officers to the Minister for Justice and I will be insisting that all seven be suspended until an investigation is completed.  It would be disgraceful, to put it at its mildest, if any of these officers was allowed the opportunity <Col N="1206" /> to continue to terrorise ordinary people.  A serious and grave wrong has been inflicted on an innocent victim by persons whose responsibility it is to protect citizens and maintain law and order. I am demanding that the Minister for Justice set about righting this wrong immediately and that he take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that an incident like this cannot recur in Finglas or in any other part of the country.</P>

      <P>I am representing the Minister for Justice who is on official duties outside the country.  Both the Minister for Justice and I are naturally very concerned about this matter. These are extremely serious allegations and they have yet to be put to the test of truth.</P>
      <P>I am informed that as soon as the allegations in question were received they were immediately referred to the Commissioner by the Department of Justice. The Commissioner has reported that a complaint in the matter had already been received by the local district officer and that a Garda investigation into the matter was already in progress.  That investigation has not yet been completed.  The Garda authorities have also brought the complaint to the notice of the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, the independent body established to investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the force.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that on the basis of the information available at present, the circumstances giving rise to this incident are likely to be the subject of court proceedings. Accordingly, it would be improper for me to make any further comment and indeed further comment could run the risk of prejudicing the court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of the suspension of members from duty, the position is that under the terms of the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations, 1971, <Col N="1207" /> this is a matter for the Commissioner, who would have to be satisfied, before taking a decision to suspend a member, that the facts justified such action.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are conscious of the need in the interests of all concerned to have the investigation of the allegations <Col N="1208" /> in this case completed as a matter of urgency and both the Minister for Justice and I have their assurance that this will be done.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer received a lump sum payment on cessation of his employment in February 1987.  The inspector of taxes was unable to deal with the taxpayer's claim for a refund of tax until the taxpayer's Form P.60 for 1986-87 (employer's certificate of pay and tax deducted) was received in the tax office.  This was submitted on 8 June 1988.  The inspector has now certifed a repayment, and a cheque in settlement will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the insurance supervisory authority my primary responsibility is to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements and, as such, I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  No obligation can be placed by me on an insurer to quote in respect of a particular risk or to quote at a particular premium.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by a limited number of jaunting car owners and pony-men in the Killarney area with regard to public liability insurance cover.  It is unfortunately the case that such activities do give rise to a particular risk of injury to, and claims by, members of the public.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurance companies if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risks involved.  In 1986, the latest year for which full figures are available, insurers sustained underwriting losses of £15 million on their general liability business.  Faced with such losses, insurers have had no option but to relate premiums to costs and to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
      <P>An arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist where difficulties are experienced in obtaining public liability insurance.  Before a case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market (including Lloyds) be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the Insurance Section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation. It must be emphasised that no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case referred in this manner to the industry representative body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing Irish law, if a person is ordinarily resident in the State and if an insurance risk arises in the State, the insurance contract must be taken out with an authorised insurer in the State.  I would point out that there are at present 13 <Col N="1062" /> branches of undertakings with their head offices in other EC member states carrying on liability insurance business in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I understand that the monthly meeting of the Southern Health Board, held on 7 June, was informed by the chief executive officer that both the city and the county managers had indicated that the existing water and drainage services together with the zoning of the area for amenity or agricultural purposes would preclude the grant of planning permission for residential or industrial development of the land at Clogheen.  The city and county authorities had also made this known in response to inquiries made to them by persons interested in tendering for the land. Despite this, some tenders were subject to planning permission.  Most tenders, however, were unconditional and the board, having considered these, approved the sale of the land in four lots.</P>
      <P>With regard to Lot 4, a parcel of about 21½ acres to which the question refers, the position is that the tenders included one at £45,000 without conditions and a higher one subject to significant planning permission. As the managers had already ruled out such permission the board concentrated on the unconditional offer and negotiated the higher price of £49,000 still without conditions (other than that the purchaser will fence part of the southern boundary).</P>
      <P>This information was given to the members of the health board before they took the decision to sell this property and I understand the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of the sale.  I am considering the board's proposal which has now been submitted to my Department and I will convey my decision to the board in due course.</P>

        <i>Limerick West)</i>: The pay rates of Air Corps pilots are determined in the context of their conditions of service and the pay rates of other members of the Permanent Defence Force.  In that connection an officer may, at a relatively young age, retire from the Permanent Defence Force with a substantial gratuity and pension and have the benefit of these payments in addition to the salary attaching to any civilian employment.  For this reason, the rate of pay he gets as a commercial pilot is not directly comparable to his pay (including pension entitlements) as an Air Corps pilot.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick West)</i>: It is not the practice to disclose details of the kind requested by the Deputy since these are regarded as confidential to the individual retired officer concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say, however, that under the Defence Forces pensions schemes an officer who retires with not less than 12 years' service qualifies for a pension and gratuity regardless of his age.  Pensions under the schemes are not directly pay-related as such but are based on rank, length of service in rank and overall length of service.  Maximum pension can be attained long before an officer reaches normal retiring age.  For example, a commandant with 23 years' service and six years' service in that rank would qualify for maximum pension as would a Lieutenant-Colonel with 25 years service and three years' in rank.  An officer with such <Col N="1085" /> service would be in the 41 to 43 years age bracket.  Because of their specialised occupation, Air Corps pilots qualify for a 10 per cent addition to the standard rates of pension.</P>
    <P>Examples of the benefits available under the schemes to retiring Air Corps pilots are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Lieutenant-Colonel with 25 years' service and three years' service in that rank &mdash; Pension, £11,756 a year (52.3 per cent of pay); Gratuity, £16,502.</P>
    <P>(b)  Commandant with 23 years' service and six years' service in that rank &mdash; Pension, £9,609 a year (49.6 per cent of pay); Gratuity, £13,284.</P>
    <P>(c)  Captain with 15 years' service and five years' service in that rank &mdash; Pension, £4,327 a year (25.2 per cent of pay); Gratuity, £9,357.</P>
