      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 May I announced that Kilkenny Design Workshops will be making arrangements for the sale of their shops in Dublin and Kilkenny as going concerns and that their remaining activities would be rationalised.  The factor giving rise to <Col N="1463" /> this Supplementary Estimate is the need to provide funds to Kilkenny Design Workshops to enable trading to continue until the shops are sold and other rationalisation measures implemented.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops were established by CTT in 1963 to provide a design resource for the improvement of industrial design in Ireland but in 1974 the direct link with CTT was ended and Kilkenny Design Workshops came under the direct control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>During the seventies Kilkenny Design Workshops were largely dependent on State assistance by way of annual grant in aid to support their activities but in the early eighties the move to achieve full commerciality by the early nineties began.</P>
    <P>To facilitate this Kilkenny Design Workshops were provided with a proper capital structure in 1982.  The Kilkenny Design Workships Act passed by the Oireachtas in December 1982, set the authorised share capital of the company at £1 million of which £500,000 was put into the company before the end of that year.</P>
    <P>The company then achieved surpluses on its overall activities in 1983 and 1984 with profits from its retail shops amounting to £11,000 in 1984.  At the same time income from design services was meeting 50 per cent to 60 per cent of expenditure in that area compared with 32 per cent in 1979.  In fact, in 1985 income from design services made up 88 per cent of the expenditure incurred in that activity.  In mid-1985 the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops presented a commercialisation programme to the Minister which was agreed at that time.</P>
    <P>This programme envisaged that in the period 1984 to 1987 the design practice would be developed and become self-supporting while growing profits from the design shops would facilitate new product developments and the provision of market information to manufacturers. The grant-aid would be concentrated in fulfilling Kilkenny Design Workshops <Col N="1464" /> primary responsibility for design promotion.</P>
    <P>In the period 1988 to 1990 the programme envisaged that Kilkenny Design Workshops would move towards total commerciality when profits on design and retail activities would be sufficient to replace grant-in-aid.  In line with that plan further capital of £262,000 was put into the company at the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>For some time past Kilkenny Design Workshops had been considering opening a Kilkenny shop in London and after detailed research including a consultancy study which indicated good commercial prospects the decision by the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops to open the shop at London was taken in mid-1985. Arrangements were finalised in May 1986 and the shop commenced business in November 1986.</P>
    <P>In March 1987 a further capital injection of £225,000 was provided to the company, bringing to £987,000 the total capital injection since December 1982. This was in addition to the annual grant-in-aid payable each year which amounted to a a total of over £3 million in the four years 1983 to 1986.</P>
    <P>In January 1987 the then Government had approved the phasing out of Exchequer grant-in-aid to Kilkenny Design Workshops over three years commencing in 1988.  In autumn 1987 when deciding the Estimates for 1988 the Government decided to implement this in three stages and the allocation for 1988 was fixed at £536,000, a reduction of £178,000 over the £714,000 which had been allocated in 1987.</P>
    <P>This decision reflected the realities of the budgetary situation facing the Government and the options available to them.  There was simply no justification for continuing high levels of State support for Commercial activities and services which were becoming increasingly available from the private sector at no cost to the State.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the Kilkenny Design Workshops commercialisation plan has failed.  In 1986, despite the provision of grant-in-aid of £740,000, the company had a deficit of £376,000 largely due to <Col N="1465" /> losses on retail trading in Ireland.  The final deficit for 1987 is expected to be even larger than this due primarily to losses incurred in the London retail operation. In addition, start-up expenses incurred in London will have to be written off following the closure of the shop at Ireland House in London.</P>
    <P>The deterioration in the financial situation of Kilkenny Design Workshops which was becoming evident towards the end of 1987 was a matter of great concern to me.  Kilkenny Design Workshops is a properly constituted company with its own share capital and responsibility for its operations and commercial decisions rest with its board.</P>
    <P>During 1987 Kilkenny Design Workshops had implemented some 29 redundancies and there was some optimism that the cost savings arising from these redundancies which was estimated at £270,000 yearly together with greater operational efficiencies could lead to an upturn.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid allocation for the whole of 1988 was £536,000 and this had to be paid to the company over the first three months of that year to enable settlement of pressing creditor claims.  By April 1988 it was clear that the company's financial situation was such that more radical measures were necessary and the Government asked the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops to present its rationalisation proposals.  The Government have accepted the following proposals: the closure of the London shop which has now been completed; the sale of the shops at Dublin and Kilkenny as going concerns; the sale and disposal of other assets, including properties in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Arising from the losses incurred over the past two years Kilkenny Design Workshops has accumulated substantial trading and other debts as well as very substantial liabilities in respect of bank borrowings.  None of these debts are guaranteed by the State and it would not be normal practice for any shareholder to give guarantees for trading debts incurred by a properly constituted company.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny Design Workshops also has <Col N="1466" /> substantial assets both in property and business, including trading assets and stocks.  It is not the policy of the Government to provide continuing support for loss-making commercial enterprises and Kilkenny Design Workshops must follow the only commercial way open to companies in its situation which is the disposal of assets to pay its creditors.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious of the very many small companies and craft enterprises which are owed moneys by Kilkenny Design Workshops and are anxious to safeguard their position as far as they can.  If Kilkenny Design Workshops were to be forced into liquidation, which might involve premature disposal of assets, its losses could be quite large. It is, therefore, essential that Kilkenny Design Workshops be afforded sufficient leeway to dispose of its assets in an orderly way so as to maximise realisations and come to satisfactory arrangements with its creditors.</P>
    <P>The Government, with this in mind, have agreed to make Exchequer funding to the extent of £250,000 available to enable Kilkenny Design Workshops to continue trading pending sale of its assets provided that its creditors permit it to do so.  The Government recognise the importance of the Kilkenny shops as outlets for high quality, well designed craft goods.  These shops are understood to be trading profitably and the Government are anxious that they can, under new management, continue to provide profitable outlets for such goods.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael McNulty of Ernst and Whinney, Chartered Accountants, has been appointed as acting chief executive to assist the board of the company in carrying through its rationalisation measures. In these circumstances, the question of arrangements with creditors as to the timing of payment of outstanding debts will continue to be a matter for the management of Kilkenny Design Workshops.</P>
    <P>Currently there are 85 persons employed by Kilkenny Design Workshops of which 56 are engaged in retail activities and 13 in design.  The board and <Col N="1467" /> management of Kilkenny Design Workshops will have to look at the question of staff levels in the light of the prospective sale of the shops.  I have taken up with the Minister for Finance the question of whether compensation will be available under the Government redundancy scheme for any redundancies arising.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my statement on 26 May 1988, the Government have decided that the design function, particularly the promotion of good design in crafts and industry, should continue and that the craft centre in Kilkenny city should be retained.  The optimum structure for this will need some further examination and suitable arrangements for this will be made in the course of the restructuring of Kilkenny Design Workshops.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Supplementary Estimates will be to increase the Kilkenny Design Workshops allocation for 1988 from £536,000 to £786,000.  While the additional amount now required for Kilkenny Design Workshops is £250,000 this has been offset by a projected increase of £249,000 in appropriations-in-aid.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá faoin obair thábhachtach atá déanta ag Ceardlanna Dearthóireachta Chill Chainnigh leis na blianta.  Ba iad a chuir tús le dearthóireacht thionsclaíoch in Éirinn.  Chuir said oiliúint ar dhaoine a chuireann seirbhísí dearthóireachta ar fáil anois san earnáil phríobháideach.  Tá caighdeán ard ó thaobh cur i láthair earraí Éireannacha ina gcuid siopaí, agus lean siopaí eile san earnáil phríobháideach a sampla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith an rud, áfach, athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar obair Cheardlanna Dearthóireachta Chill Chainnigh anois i 1988. Tá cuid de na fiontair a thosaigh said in <Col N="1468" /> ann leanacht ar aghaidh astu féin, gan chabhair ar bith ó Cheardlanna Dearthóireachta Chill Chainnigh.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios againn anois go mba léir don Rialtas ó thuarascáil bhliantúil na cuideachta i 1986 go raibh fadhb ag an gcuideachta &mdash; an fhadhb atá á plé anois. Cuirim milleán ar an Rialtas gur fhan siad bliain gan aon rud a dhéanamh faoin bhfadhb a léiríodh i dtuarascáil bhliantúil 1986.  Cuirim milleán orthu freisin gur fhan said ceithre mhí dhéag sular chuir siad an tuarascáil os comhair na Dála agus os comhair an phobail.  Cén fáth gur fhan said go dtí Bealtaine 1988?  Cén fáth go raibh post an Stiúrthóra Bainistí fágtha gan líonadh ar feadh na tréimhse sin? Ceist eile, an mbeidh gá le tuilleadh airgead Stáit, seachas an méid atá iarrtha orainn a cheadú inniu?</P>
    <P>The main question is why there was so much of a delay in dealing with this problem which was plainly obvious from the contents of the 1986 report?  Furthermore, is there a conflict between what the Minister said in reply to a parliamentary question to me on 31 May on this subject &mdash; I am referring to Question No. 99 of that date &mdash; when he said there was no worsening or reduction in the trading income of the company in 1987 over 1986 and what he said today in his speech, that the situation in 1987 was considerably worse than in 1986?  Will all of the trade creditors be paid?  Is this the last injection that will be necessary?  Can the Minister give a categoric assurance on this point?  I support the Estimate because of the necessity to ensure that creditors are paid.</P>
    <P>I might also ask the Minister, in regard to the sale of the shops, whether any convenants are being entered into or sought in regard to the continued use of those shops as a means of promoting welldesigned Irish goods which might have a longer requirement to remain on shelves than the quick turn-around, less high quality, goods that might be more attractive to a strictly private sector operation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am prepared to support the Estimate.  I hope my questions will be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy John Bruton for allowing me part of his time. I welcome the introduction of this Estimate as it will enable the Kilkenny Design Workshops company to continue trading. The Kilkenny Design Workshops was established in 1965 to actively promote good design particularly in the industrial sector.  They have achieved considerable success in this field, design having improved dramatically in the intervening years.  I was relieved to learn from the Government press release of Thursday last that they intend to retain the design function in their rationalisation plan.  Perhaps the Minister will inform the House, when replying, where this discipline will be located and to what extent it will be retained.  For example, will this vitally important function be expanded because, unfortunately, it has assumed a back seat in the activities of the company in recent years?  Furthermore, I hope the Minister will inform the House whether training of design apprentices will continue and be carried on in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, good design is fundamental to the continued expansion of Irish industry.  Furthermore, the introduction of free trade in Europe in 1992 will require Irish industry to further upgrade their product design.  While it is essential that the Kilkenny Design Workshops be critically reviewed I would suggest that the Government's intention to sell the Dublin shop, the Kilkenny complex &mdash; shop, design buildings and Butler House &mdash; is a panic reaction.  It is accepted that the opening of the London shop was an unfortunate development and that it should be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dublin and Kilkenny shops have provided a fundamental service nationwide, a design service, product advice, administrative assistance and a shop window for hundreds of craft businesses all over the country.  Crafts people in my area readily admit that they owe their commercial existence to Kilkenny Design Workshops.  These shops also provide a shop window for Irish products of excellence. The Kilkenny shops also provide a national consultancy service for foreign retailers wishing to purchase quality Irish <Col N="1470" /> craft which is not taken into account in consideration of their role in our commercial life.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion that the Kilkenny Design Workshops retailing activity has outlived its usefulness, its role now being filled by the private sector.  I am totally committed to the private sector but I am convinced it does not fulfil the Kilkenny Design Workshops' role in this instance.  We should remember that the private sector are geared to reaping maximum profit and it follows that the private sector will stock articles with a fast shelf turnover, a maximum mark-up. I am informed that up to 60 per cent of the products in these private sector shops are imported.  The Kilkenny shops constitute the anchor clientele of our craft producers, in some cases handling 30 per cent of home-produced craft products.  I am convinced there is a role for the private sector and the Kilkenny shops and that they should work in tandem.</P>
    <P>I am informed that as a result of rationalisation implemented at the beginning of 1988 &mdash; and I was glad to hear the Minister say this morning &mdash; the shops in Dublin and Kilkenny are trading profitably and that it is expected that this trend will continue to the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I should like to inform the Minister that retailers in Kilkenny have no objection to State involvement in retailing as at present undertaken by the Kilkenny Design Workshops.  However, I would inform him of the very strong feeling in Kilkenny that the Kilkenny Design Workshops' buildings should not be removed from public ownership.  These buildings form an integral part of the Kilkenny Castle complex, are a focal point in the city, and their removal from public ownership would be quite emotive. It is imperative that control over the future use of the buildings remain in public hands.  The complex is unique, the name Kilkenny Design Workshops projecting an image of excellence; a visit to the complex and purchase of their products being a must for visitors, native and foreign.  The people of Kilkenny wish to have the Kilkenny Design Workshops complex retained in public ownership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> I appeal to the Minister to postpone the disposal of both the Dublin and Kilkenny shops.  I contend the whole of the company's operations can be run profitably because there is enormous interest on the part of the local authority and the public in the development of Butler House which could also be rendered profitable and would not constitute any drain on State funds.  Taking all of these considerations into account, I appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with the sale of any of the Kilkenny Design Workshops buildings but rather have the overall position examined with a view to converting their operations into a profitable commercial enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad that the Government are intervening to ensure that wages and trade creditors' interests are safeguarded, my fear would be that they might not be fully taken care of and in that respect I share the sentiments of Deputy John Bruton.  I question whether there is sufficient money being made available.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed to note, yet again, that the taxpayer is being forced to pay for the consequences of gross mismanagement. I am pleased the Government have decided that the design functions of the Kilkenny Design Workshops will continue.  Some of my constituency colleagues have condemned the sale of the shops.  In the circumstances we must recognise that we cannot have it both ways.  Indeed, there are people who would like to see public expenditure increased further but I do not share that view.  If we are to get our national finances in order we must make some sacrifices. There appears to be a common perception here that where there is State involvement it is not imperative that operations or activities pay or be profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the position has reached this stage but one must be realistic in all the circumstances.  The Government cannot continue to prop up operations losing money.  I fail to understand how the board of the Kilkenny <Col N="1472" /> Design Workshops allowed their financial affairs to reach such a crisis point. One may well question what they have been doing in recent years.  It is regrettable that they allowed matters become so acute.  The over-ambitious plan to open a shop in London, off the beaten track, is an example of a regrettable decision on the part of the board.  It is my belief that such a decision would not have been taken had the venture been in private ownership.  This whole episode emphasises for me the potential benefits of privatisation.</P>
    <P>It will be important to retain the internationally-recognised Kilkenny Design Workshops name as a condition of sale, so that local craft and design people will have access to the markets they have enjoyed to date.  I should be glad if the Minister would inform the House whether he or the IDA has any suitable purchaser in mind so that the high standards of the company can be maintained. If possible, the Minister should give suppliers an assurance that their interests will be guaranteed.  Most importantly, the Minister must insist that these premises are not turned into a fast food joint or into some other downmarket enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity this debate is so time constrained but I hope we will have another opportunity to debate some aspects of the problem relating to the Kilkenny Design Workshops in some detail.  I will devote my time to making an earnest appeal to the Minister to retain in State ownership the properties in Kilkenny, and to reconsider the Government decision to sell or lease the Kilkenny Design outlets.  the crafts, the workshops and the outlets depend on each other for success.  This has proved to be the case down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot overstate the concern of people throughout the country about the future of the Kilkenny Design Workshops. The concept of the workshops was always regarded as one of the brightest gems to come out of what has been described as the Lemass era, an era which encouraged new ideas and industrial <Col N="1473" /> development.  No other State or semiState body was as successful as this design centre.  A lot of thought and research went into the setting up of this centre.  If it was important in the sixties to set up such a centre, it is even more important now.  What is now being proposed has not been given anything like the degree of consideration that was given to the original concept of the design centre.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this whole area.</P>
    <P>The decision of the board, whether or not prompted by me in Government, to present a commercialisation programme in mid-1985, was a turning point in the fortunes of the Kilkenny Design Workshops. Coupled with that was the Government decision followed through by the present Government to reduce grant aid to the centre.  The Minister in his speech mentioned that for some time the Kilkenny Design Workshops had been considering opening a shop in London and that after detailed research, including a consultancy study which indicated good commercial prospects, the decision was made by the board in mid-1985 to open a shop in London.  I do not know who the consultancy firm were but from the first day this shop was not a commercial success.  The whole aspect should be further examined as it is the London shop, coupled with the withdrawal of State aid from the centre, which has brought about this problem.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from the Minister's statement that all the properties, including Butler House in Kilkenny, will be up for sale.  Over the years there have been massive financial allocations from the Government for the building and renovation of buildings such as Butler House which has been used to accommodate foreign students and others who come to study and avail of EC Social Fund grants. Butler House has proved to be a tremendous asset in the whole area of development and design and to sell it off would be a retrograde step.  It was the intention, and I hope it is still the intention, to provide there something similar to a third level education facility for student designers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> The design facility is a service to this country and its benefit cannot be measured in profit and loss terms.  I know it is important that it pay its way to a certain extent but it is difficult to quantify in terms of profit the success of the Kilkenny Design Workshops.  Their work may not have generated profits for themselves but they generated profit for many other businesses both in the manufacturing and service areas.  They generated profit and employment in the manufacturing and service areas and also in the tourist area because of the development of craftwork. The tourist spin-off in the Kilkenny area and in the surrounding counties has been immense.</P>
    <P>The cold figures detailing losses, the amount of State money invested and the amount now required to rescue the project do not show the true picture.  We would be doing a disservice to the project and anyone who worked in it if we looked at it in that way.  We should look at the tremendous benefits that have accrued to the whole country as a result of the setting up of the project and I appeal to the Minister to give this matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>This project was set up in the sixties by dedicated people, some of whom have gone to their eternal reward.  There are now similarly dedicated people involved and they are available to give advice and direction at this stage.  I do not know what experience the acting chief executive officer who was recently appointed has had.  I have no doubt he is expert in the financial area and expert in the area of these difficulties.  We need people who have knowledge and expertise in the specialised areas of design, craft, the relationship between the student, the craftsman, the product and the outlet for the product.  Those areas need an input from a committee of people, which I am sure the Minister could put together, to advise him on the best way forward.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Deputies who gave their deliberations on the question of Kilkenny Design Workshops and I thank them for their support for the Supplementary Estimate.  It is generally recognised in the House that people must get their wages, that this business must be carried on until such time as it can be disposed of in an orderly fashion and that we must ensure that we get the best return for the State's assets. I will deal with the individual comments as they arise.  Deputy Bruton raised the question as to why it took so long to deal with Kilkenny Design Workshops. Deputy Pattison, on the other hand said: &ldquo;Do not rush it, do not be in any hurry, and take plenty of time to consider it&rdquo;. In this House one cannot win and I recognise the reality of that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton raised the matter of a reply to Question No. 99 on 31 May where I responded by saying that the accounts for 1986 which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 21 April 1988 showed that the trading income from the retail shops had declined by £388,124 in 1986 over 1985.  The accounts for 1987 have not yet been presented to me but the indications from the company are that a similar decline did not take place.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the London shop the sales started to come in 1987, and if you want to analyse it properly there would have been a decline, if the London sales were taken out.  When one looks at the sales revenue coming in, because of the additional London sales, that is the reason there was no decline.  That is not to say that a profit was being made or that the financial situation is not deteriorating; sales are one thing but a financial situation is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1986 accounts which were held up <Col N="1476" /> by the Comptroller and Auditor General were qualified in a number of areas and that is the reason they were not available as early as they would normally be and as they should be.  Deputy Crotty, as Deputy Gibbons said, wants his loaf and eat it, but he cannot have it both ways. There is a position which must be faced up to and it must be faced up to in the best possible way.  The fact is that Kilkenny Design Workshops are deeply in debt with large amounts of money owing to both banks and trade creditors.  Continuation of retail trading by Kilkenny Design Workshops would require a large injection of capital not only to pay off the debts which have already been incurred, through massive retail trading losses in the past two years, but also to provide future working capital.  There is no guarantee that Kilkenny Design Workshops would not incur trading losses in the future let alone provide a return on the additional investment.  I could not, therefore, justify seeking the approval of the Oireachtas for extra capital for Kilkenny Design Workshops for that purpose. I would also point out that Kilkenny Design Workshops main objective is design, promotion and development.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years the resources of Kilkenny Design Workshops, both financial and management, have been overly concentrated on retail activities which allowed the design function to be run down.  Kilkenny Design Workshops in effect lost their way.  It was never the intention that Kilkenny Design Work-shop's retailing activities should be supported by way of grant-in-aid nor could such support be justified.  The retail business is a commercial activity in the commercial area but could not be seen to be putting State funds in to compete in a retail area.  I note what Deputy Crotty said in relation to the interest of retailers in Kilkenny.  They now say that they would be quite happy to see the State go in.  Would they be quite happy to see the State go in and subvent their activities?  I do not know.  I was in Kilkenny last night and I heard views expressed.  When I go back to the files it is strange but the opposite views were expressed when <Col N="1477" /> Kilkenny Design Workshops were not able to retail the first day.  I take what the Deputy says.  There will be time for plenty of submissions in relation to what is the best way to put it together at the end of the day.  I think I have clarified the position.  I would remind the House that these are recommendations which came from the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops and that their rationalisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> That is how I view the position.  Kilkenny Design Workshops Limited are not being sold, they are being held on.  I am fully conscious of the great contribution that design has made towards the improvement of craft and skills in the whole area. The workshops where that work is carried out will be retained.  I am also aware from what Deputy Crotty said, and I was told again in Kilkenny last night and indeed from the deputation I received, who were very positive in relation to how the whole matter should be handled, that they will have an opportunity at local authority and local level of having an input into Mr. McNulty's proposals for the future. We all want to see the best result at the end of the day.  That is all I am interested in.  I have told the board that and I have also told Mr. McNulty.</P>
    <P>In relation to his expertise, as mentioned by Deputy Pattison, he is acting chief executive.  He works with the board of Kilkenny Design Workshops in the best manner and in the most orderly fashion in which to do this job.  I will be kept informed of developments.  I am interested in seeing that the best results are achieved.  I recognise that the operations in Kilkenny were part of a tourist trail and that they make a major contribution to the tourist industry in Kilkenny.  I can assure the House that there will be no fast food joint allowed into the shops.  Whatever convenant needs to be inserted will be inserted.  This is not a situation where fast food joints, noisy shops or otherwise could be accommodated. I will instruct them to have that type of convenant inserted because it would be the view of everybody in this House that it should be done.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept what Deputy Pattison says, that the turning point came with a reduction of State grants.  That is ignoring reality.  The turning point came with the disastrous failure in London&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the main reason. The reduction in aid was in line with the three-year commercialisation programme instituted by Deputy Bruton and carried on by me, which plan failed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate why the post of managing director was left totally vacant, not even filled on a temporary basis as it is at the moment, for a long portion of the period of the difficulties of Kilkenny Design?  Were the board prevented from filling that position, having selected a candidate for it, even temporarily?  Finally, I asked another question in the course of my contribution. Will any more funds be needed?  Is this the final matter in dealing with the liabilities of the retail operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first question, Kilkenny Design's chief executive resigned some time around October. The board held the interviews in the normal fashion.  They sent a name in to me for my consent to the appointment <Col N="1481" /> around December.  At that stage by October-November I was beginning to ask serious questions about it and I did not consent to the appointment of a chief executive.  I do not think it is insinuated in the Deputy's question, but it has been peddled about that the collapse and the serious financial problems of Kilkenny Design arose because of my not consenting immediately&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is not saying that but it has been suggested by others.  I want to put it clearly in this House that any organisation functioning in the commercial area who would put up a silly excuse that they had not a chief executive for a few months is insulting to the intelligence of anybody.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If any organisation who want to get a chief executive put an advertisement in a paper, do their interviews and the chief executive has to give normal notice, they can expect to have to carry on for at least six months without a chief executive.  If the structures of that organisation were so weak that they could not do that, do not try to sell me a simple excuse that that was the reason for the collapse of Kilkenny Design.  It was not. I did not approve it and I told the board so.  They were beginning to come apart at the seams at that stage.  I would not appoint any chief executive to a job where the whole future was in doubt and maybe it would be a different size operation by the time you would be finished with it.  I think Deputy Bruton will accept that.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1988 is for a net sum of £1,627,299,000.

Of the remaining expenditure, almost £700 million is met by employers and about £335 million is met by employees and the self-employed through PRSI contributions.  When account is taken of this and other minor sources of income, the total social welfare bill comes to £2,674 million or 15 per cent of GNP.</P>

    <P>The Government have made significant progress in our 15 months in office.  1987 was a year of substantial achievement. We restored order to the public finances. GNP grew by over 4 per cent, which was one of the best growth rates in the EC. Exports rose by 15 per cent in real terms and we had a balance of payments surplus for the first time in 20 years.  The volume of manufacturing output increased by over 10 per cent and investment in plant and machinery rose by over 4 per cent. Interest rates have fallen by 5.5 per cent and inflation is down to a record annual rate of 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> set an annual target of 20,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry.  In the first quarter of this year some 4,000 such new jobs have been created and I am confident that the target for the year as a whole can and will be achieved.  We have succeeded in a short time in creating an environment conducive to increased investment which is an essential prerequisite for establishing new jobs.  Good progress has been made in the establishment of the international financial services centre.  There has been considerable interest in the centre and 22 projects involving about 1,000 jobs have so far been approved by the Minister for Finance. The way is now open for those who have a responsibility for job creation, whether in the public or private sectors, to take advantage of the opportunities created.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we have also undertaken to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits and provide additional increases for those in receipt of the lowest payments within the resources available.  This Estimate provides the necesary funds to meet this commitment.  I am providing for:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" />  (i) a general increase of 3 per cent for all social welfare payments from next month.  With inflation running at 2 per cent this will more than maintain the real value of social welfare payments;</P>
    <P>(ii) a special provision to give from next month an 11 per cent increase in the basic rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance with a 6 per cent increase for child dependants.  This is a major improvement for those on the lowest payments.  </P>
    <P>In addition, a general streamlining of rates for child dependants from July will mean further increases for larger families and will have the present number of rates.</P>
    <P>The effect of these special increases will be that, for example the personal long term rate of unemployment assistance in urban areas will now be £42 per week, an increase of £4.20 per week.  A married couple with three children will get £6.70 extra per week, bringing their total to £98.80.  These larger increases for those on the lowest payments are in line with the thrust of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and of agencies involved with the poor.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of the present improvements in social welfare (including health) is £44.8 million this year and £101 million in a full year.  Of this the special additional increases for those on the lowest payments will account for some £30 million in the full year.</P>
    <P>One of the commitments in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was to carry out a detailed study of the workings of the family income supplement scheme. The objective of this scheme was to overcome certain disincentives for low paid workers, but the take-up was lower than anticipated.  The study is designed to identify ways in which the scheme could be improved and developed and to examine the question of take-up.  This review has now been carried out by an independent evaluator.  A draft report was received in my Department in the past few days and is currently being examined. <Col N="1485" /> The draft report indicates that the potential beneficiaries under this scheme total some 15,000, and not 35,000 as originally estimated.  This review will of course form an integral part of the future development of this scheme.  At present there are 5,200 recipients of FIS of whom 73 per cent 3,800, are in the private sector and 27 per cent 1,400, are in the public sector.  The majority of these are labourers, 68 per cent in the public sector and 51 per cent in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The extension of social insurance to the self-employed is the most significant development in the social welfare area since the early seventies.  Up to 20 per cent of the workforce have, since April, been brought into the social insurance system.  They are now in a position to acquire an entitlement to a guaranteed basic pension in old age and, in the case of those who are married, for their survivors.</P>
    <P>Since the legislation was enacted many of the self-employed are now coming to realise the advantages of this scheme. In endeavouring to make a living and a success of their enterprises many self-employed people did not make adequate provision for their survivors or for old age.  Over the years it is estimated that up to 70 per cent of self-employed people have had to fall back on means-tested social assistance in their old age.  The self-employed are no longer in this position and it is clear that many now recognise that it is in their best interests to be covered by a scheme that requires them to make basic provision for their survivors and for old age.  I am also pleased to say that despite the relatively short period since the introduction of the scheme the complex administrative arrangements involved are being put in place according to plan.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are proceeding on five main fronts.  First, in the case of certain directors whose remuneration is liable to PAYE, the collection process has already begun.</P>
    <P>Second, my Department have now received from the Revenue Commissioners basid details of some 180,000 Schedule D taxpayers &mdash; shopkeepers, <Col N="1486" /> farmers and professional people.  About 60,000 of these are already registered with the Department.  Registration forms are being issued to the balance.  A total of 120,000 forms are being issued in stages over a number of weeks &mdash; about 80,000 forms have already gone in the post.</P>
    <P>The third group consists mainly of small farmers who have been advised by Revenue that they do not have a current tax liability.  These cases, about 20,000 in all, will be subject to a collection system to be operated directly by my Department. Under this system they will receive special bills in October, and they will be asked to pay their contributions in quarterly instalments.  For this contribution year, arrangements are only being made for payments through post offices.  In the light of experience of the system, alternative paying arrangements will be considered from April 1989.</P>
    <P>The fourth group consists of recipients of unemployment assistance with some self-employment.  While these persons are not liable to pay any contribution, they must be registered within the scheme and the arrangements are proceeding at employment exchange level to allot RSI numbers to all the unemployed who do not have a tax number at present.</P>
    <P>The fifth group consists of people who are not registered at present with either Revenue or the Department and who are self-employed.  An advertising campaign is being arranged to ensure that they can register.  It is expected that the majority of these people will be either exempt on income grounds or liable only to pay the flat-rate contribution of £104 per annum.</P>
    <P>The collection system for those outside the income tax system will not be operational until October mainly because registration of those concerned will not be completed before then.  The total income included in this year's Estimate for the scheme is £15 million.</P>
    <P>In April of last year the National Pensions Board presented their first report. This contained a series of detailed recommendations for the regulation of occupational pension schemes.  I invited the various interested organisations to <Col N="1487" /> submit their views on the report and I was very heartened by the speed with which they responded and the detailed consideration which they had given to the various implications of the report.</P>
    <P>The views received have now been fully considered and I hope to be in a position shortly to submit proposals to Government with a view to introducing legislation in the autumn.  My Department are responsible for the administration of 11 means-tested schemes.  I have undertaken a review of the various means tests with a view to simplifying and rationalising them.  There are two major constraints on the rate of progress which can be made in this regard.  First, rationalisation may involve modifying certain concessionary features of the means tests in some schemes.  Secondly, rationalisation may also require easing the more restrictive features of certain other schemes.  Such changes, however, would have significant cost implications.  Given present budgetary constraints the progress that is possible in this area is necessarily restricted.  However, I intend to begin the process of rationalising and simplifying the various means tests with a view to arriving at a situation as soon as practicable where there are uniform means test criteria across all the social assistance schemes administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>An examination is currently being finalised by an inter-Departmental working party which was established by my colleague, the Minister for Health, on the scope that exists for reducing and, where possible, eliminating duplication of means testing by various State agencies. Significant progress has already been made in simplifying the administrative arrangements in the Department of Social Welfare by, for example, the introduction of one-stop shops and the making of interim payments pending comprehensive means tests.  The final report of the inter-Departmental working party should be ready by the end of the summer.  Careful consideration will be given to the recommendations made in that report with a view to their <Col N="1488" /> implementation as rapidly as possible later in the year.</P>
    <P>The national Jobsearch programme, which was introduced by the Government in April 1987, is specifically designed to help the long-term unemployed. It has given a new direction to the work of my Department and that of the NMS and AnCO.  The resources of these agencies were directed as a priority to assist the unemployed.  I am glad to say that the national Jobsearch programme was a major success last year and this success is continuing in the current year.  Up to last week over 23,000 have been interviewed by FÁS already this year.  To date over 2,300 long-term unemployed have been placed in jobs as a direct result of the Jobsearch programme. Over 13,000 have been placed in Manpower schemes and training programmes. In addition, over 2,500 commenced the special Jobsearch courses. The targets for 1988 envisage that a total of 56,000 places will be provided on mainline FÁS courses and schemes including Jobsearch courses.</P>
    <P>A by-product of this massive effort to help the unemployed is that so far this year almost 9,700 claimants left the live register voluntarily following an invitation to participate in a course, job or scheme.  In addition since January almost 600 people have had their cases reviewed, resulting in disallowances.  Savings to date as a result exceed £4 million.  That is purely as a result of people leaving the register.  There were, of course, other savings from the courses which are taking place.</P>
    <P>For many years the charge has been made that our unemployment payments system is inflexible and unresponsive to the needs of the unemployed.  Indeed, I would have to agree that in some respects that charge is justified, particularly for those unemployed who want to adopt a positive approach to their enforced inactivity through, for example, furthering their education or taking up part-time employment.  Fear of losing their basic income from my Department can be the deciding factor for many unemployed persons in rejecting opportunities to <Col N="1489" /> improve their employment prospects.  I am fully committed to introducing flexibility into our systems and with that in mind a number of schemes have been launched.</P>
    <P>Only a few weeks ago, I launched the part-time job incentive scheme on a nationwide basis.  This scheme is an example of what I want to achieve in terms of breaking away from some of the more restrictive rules of the unemployment payments system.  At the same time, it can also provide those out of work with another option.  The objective of the scheme is to allow those who can obtain part-time work the opportunity to do so while still retaining entitlement to a basic payment or income supplement from my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the more notable changes in the pattern of working in the labour force has been the increase in the extent of part-time working.  I believe that we need to be able to respond to such changes and I am convinced that the part-time job incentive scheme will go a long way to meeting that need.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme gives unemployed persons over 25 years of age the opportunity to go back to school and complete a certificate-type course.  At the same time, participants receive a weekly allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.  In this way the missed opportunities of youth in the education area can be recaptured by means of a second chance.</P>
    <P>This scheme is a particularly worthwhile one and is being piloted in Limerick and Tallaght for the second year.  I am examining the scope for extending it within the limit of available resources to other areas, to persons over 25 and to cover languages.  I hope to be in a position to announce details of an extended scheme in the near future.</P>
    <P>The voluntary work scheme is important in the context of community response to the problem of unemployment. It allows an unemployed person to carry out voluntary work without infringing the conditions attached to the receipt of unemployment payments. Its objectives are twofold.  First, to <Col N="1490" /> encourage unemployed persons who may have a lot to offer the community to get involved in voluntary work without any interference with their basic weekly income; and second, to encourage voluntary organisations to involve the unemployed and to create new opportunities for voluntary work.  I am at present considering how this scheme can be improved and promoted.  I recently met a number of voluntary organisations to get their views on the scheme and I hope to announce details of a revamped scheme shortly.</P>
    <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme is intended to provide more flexible arrangements for older unemployed people.  The necessary procedures are being prepared and the scheme will be fully operational by the autumn.  Initially, the scheme will be confined to persons over 60 years of age who are entitled to a maximum rate of unemployment assistance. This new optional scheme will relieve claimants of the necessity of attending the local office to sign on and collect their payments.  Those who qualify for the allowance will be paid by pension order book which can be cashed weekly at their local post office. However, they will be asked periodically to confirm that they are still, in fact, retired.</P>
    <P>In further fulfilment of my commitment to introducing flexibility into the unemployment payments system, I announced recently that unemployed athletes representing their country abroad could continue to receive their unemployment payments.  This facility is also being extended to cover a two-week visit or holiday abroad in certain circumstances. This would enable many unemployed people, who could not have done so up to now, to travel abroad for family and other reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that I have undertaken a major programme to tackle fraud abuse in social welfare.  This has involved action on a number of fronts and has been a major success in achieving unprecedented savings.  This programme is continuing this year and extra staff have been committed to this work.  The current <Col N="1491" /> estimate includes allowance for anticipated further savings of some £20 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>The principal elements in this programme are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The special investigation unit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The external control unit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The joint revenue and social welfare investigation unit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Control measures on disability benefit claims, including inquiries to employers and increased medical referee activity and</P>
    <P>&mdash;PRSI surveys of employers. </P>
    <P>Savings to date are well on target and in the five months to the end of May 1988, 317 cases were sent to the Chief State Solicitor for prosecution, of which 26 relate to employers.</P>
    <P>This year's Social Welfare Act provided that regulations may be made giving entitlement to pensions at a reduced rate to those who, having earlier left the insurance system because of the operation of the remuneration limit, came back into insurance on 1 April 1974 when the limit was abolished.  These people found themselves adversely affected when they reached pension age, because of the intermittent nature of their insurance records prior to 1974.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned about the plight of this group of people for some time.  The provision in this year's Act will allow me to make regulations providing <i>pro rata</i> pensions for them from October next in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  A sum of £600,000 has been included in this year's Estimate for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister some 15 months ago, I have been very conscious of the need to improve further the quality and speed of delivery of the service to the public.  Much progress has been made through a combination of intensive computerisation, new management systems, revised working procedures and reorganisation of functions.  I believe there is a need to localise the service to provide a more comprehensive, integrated, streamlined and secure service to social <Col N="1492" /> welfare clients and to the taxpayer.  This conclusion has been reached after taking account of a wide range of views.  These include the views of the Commission on Social Welfare, the views of the clients obtained through market research studies, the views of public representatives, the views of the security consultants who carried out the major study of the Department's main payment system and the feedback and insights from the Department's own staff who operate the schemes on the ground and who have daily contact with the public.</P>
    <P>I am working towards a situation in which my Department will provide a service which is both comprehensive, covering all schemes, and local, that is claims and queries accepted and processed locally.</P>
    <P>The introduction of modern payment systems is a vital aspect of the new service delivery strategy.  My Department operate a wide range of payment systems, cash, cheques and payments by vouchers at post offices.  By European standards payment systems in Ireland are outmoded and rely too heavily on cash. Apart from the inconvenience involved, cash-based payment systems by their very nature are an attraction to criminals and a security risk.  I am examining methods of reducing the amount of cash used at employment exchanges and how we can quickly move to alternative payment systems. Cheques, payable orders and electronic fund transfers (EFT) are options being considered.  Our current programme of computerisation of employment exchanges will make these options possible.</P>
    <P>Unemployment payments are the last area of the Department's operations to be computerised.  The Dublin and Cork areas are now fully computerised and we are extending this service.  A further 12 local offices will be computerised in 1988. This programme when completed will give much greater flexibility in regard to the method of payment at the local offices.</P>
    <P>The redesigned central records system will play a major part in our plans to localise and improve services.  Among the <Col N="1493" /> objectives of the new system will be the ability to decide claims, if only provisionally, at a much earlier stage than was possible under the old methods.  This will reduce the requirements on many of the less well off clients to have recourse to supplementary welfare allowance. Overall, it will increase the dignity of the service to the clients themselves and this will confer advantages on the staff who will be freed to devote more time and effort to assisting claimants.  In addition, a central index is being developed to allow for quick and easy identification of clients and a major development programme is underway to provide for the registration of the self-employed.</P>
    <P>The system to be used to provide computerised facilities at local level known as INFOSYS is used currently for inquiries concerning all of the Department's computerised schemes.  A more streamlined inquiry facility is being developed and will be implemented on a phased basis during the year.  The new system will, in addition to providing faster and more reliable information relating to individual clients and claims, include a feature which will assist local offices in determining eligibility.</P>
    <P>All of the child benefit renewal books will be issued this year using the new personalised paying order system which I launched last year.  This new system will be used for the issue of all pension books from July.  In addition, all pension books will be issued using this system.  This is a major breakthrough in terms of having a more efficient and secure payment system.  For the first time we will also have full reconciliation of pension and allowance orders and greatly improve control.  A new system for the free fuel scheme is also currently being developed and will be implemented for the next heating season.</P>
    <P>I believe we are making good progress in making the social welfare system more responsive to the needs of its clients.  I have referred particularly to the measures we have taken or have planned for unemployed people, and particularly the long-term unemployed because I believe that our main effort must be directed at <Col N="1494" /> helping this sector of our population at this time.  We are significantly improving the levels of payment to the unemployed, we are also improving the system of payments to them and we are trying to give them greater flexibility and as many opportunities as possible to improve their situation, through priority in Jobsearch allocations, through the part-time job incentive scheme and by encouraging unemployed people to become involved in voluntary work.</P>
    <P>I am trying to bring about an integrated approach under which the efforts of Government, statutory agencies and voluntary and community organisations will be co-ordinated to give an integrated response to the needs of the unemployed, and indeed of other people in need.</P>
    <P>The need for an integrated approach to solving the problems of groups and categories in need has also been highlighted in the context of the EC poverty programme.  Nine Irish projects are participating in the programme with the assistance of the Combat Poverty Agency.  Through their participation in the programme these projects have the capacity to identify new and innovative approaches to tackling the problems of poverty and the success of the programme will be determined by the practical solutions which emerge from the participating projects.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency are also actively involved in community development. This year the agency have provided core funding to several projects.  These include projects dealing with the problems faced by residents of new housing estates, providing learning opportunities for young mothers who have difficulty coping with their responsibilities, the selfdevelopment of women affected by poverty generally and a project specifically aimed at the travelling community.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the agency have also undertaken, at my request, a research project on the question of moneylending.  The main purpose of this study which is to be concluded by September next is to develop a set of measures aimed at combating the problems of moneylending and indebtedness.  The <Col N="1495" /> project is already at an advanced stage. I will be very interested in the findings which emerge and in particular those which relate to families dependent on social welfare.  The agency are also engaged in research in a number of other areas including community development issues, malnutrition and homelessness.  I might mention in this context that I have allocated a total of £63,000 this year towards various projects for the homeless from the scheme of grants to voluntary bodies in the social services area.</P>
    <P>One of the major developments taking place this year in the poverty area will be the publication this summer of the initial results of a major survey on poverty carried out by the ESRI as part of the second EC poverty programme.  This is the first occasion on which a study of this magnitude on poverty has been carried out in this country.  I have no doubt the study will make a substantial contribution to our understanding of poverty and will be of immense value in the development of policies in this area.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants to voluntary bodies is being continued again this year. The organisations assisted are generally engaged in providing services for deprived or disadvantaged persons.  This year £750,000 is being made available, funded by moneys from the national lottery. About 500 applications for grants have been received and £420,000 has already been allocated to organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, an additional £100,000 has recently been allocated from national lottery funds to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for personal development and home management courses.  This will provide practical advice and assistance, including financial advice, to over 5,000 families this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that Social Welfare is an active and vibrant Department.  I am determined to provide the best possible service to people who rely on social welfare payments.  I would like to pay tribute to the staff of the Department, those dealing with the public, those at senior <Col N="1496" /> management level, and all those staff without whom it would not be possible to deliver a service to such a large segment of the public.</P>
    <P>We are changing rapidly to meet the needs of the present time.  I am particularly pleased that the Government have protected social welfare recipients in this difficult time and have given extra to those on the lowest payments.  I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again it is good to be here in the House and to hear a progress report on this most important matter.  I am sure all the Members of the House recognise that the Minister and his Department are attempting to perform a mammoth task, commenced by the last administration, in trying to turn an incredibly overloaded system into an effective, efficient and non-wasteful one. As I have only 15 minutes I will be able to comment on just a few areas and perhaps the Minister might respond to some of them when concluding.</P>
      <P>The word that leaped from the pages with regard to the whole reform of the social welfare system is &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  That is one of the headings in the Minister's speech.  It is only with flexibility that we will bring about a social welfare system that dignifies the human being who has recourse to it and ensure that people on the social welfare system, either temporary or long-term, are not marginalised. They should be made to feel as valued a part of the community as the rest of us.  The whole thrust of our social welfare reform has to be based on that. To this extent I welcome very much the flexibility that is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the part-time job incentive scheme which will give those who can obtain part-time work the opportunity to do so while still retaining entitlement to a basic payment or income supplement from his Department.  The Minister said that participants in the scheme may work up to 24 hours a week and that earnings are subject to tax and PRSI in the normal way.  One of the concerns of all of us in the past has been <Col N="1497" /> the attempt by employers to use part-time workers.  This affects women in particular, because over 80 per cent of part-time workers are women, a great number of whom have been deliberately kept below the eligibility level at which they are entitled to the same sickness and holiday benefits as those on full-time employment.  I know that also comes under legislation from the Department of Labour.  It is a glaring discrimination and gives great insecurity to part-time workers.  We are moving into a future when part-time work will become more and more the norm.  I would ask the Minister to keep that very much in mind and to extend the flexibility so that nobody who works formal hours is denied that type of contribution and cover.</P>
    <P>All of us would welcome very much the flexibility offered to allow unemployed persons to go back to school.  The Minister said that unemployed persons over 25 years of age will have the opportunity to go back to school and complete a certificate-type course.  A pilot scheme is in operation in Limerick and Tallaght for the second year.  I take it that the Minister is monitoring this scheme closely so that it will apply nationwide.  He said he intends to extend the scheme.</P>
    <P>One matter that is of concern to me is with regard to the research into adult education and the returning of people to work, particularly those over 25 years of age.  There seems to be a far higher motivation for women to return to work. They may have dropped out of education at an early stage, raised a family and have completed courses of development and personal growth, leading to employment. The research shows that men who have been made redundant should have the same educational opportunities but unless they see a definite job at the end of it they are very reluctant to avail of them.  We are all concerned about the long-term unemployed, particularly men who consider that all their worth was based on the job they had.  Something should be done to encourage men who have been made redundant, who find themselves in early retirement and in <Col N="1498" /> long-term unemployment, to take advantage of this type of educational opportunity without feeling that there should be a job at the end of it.  In itself it is an enriching experience.</P>
    <P>The voluntary work scheme is of tremendous importance to the community, particularly as we have more and more people who would be able to give that kind of voluntary contribution and there are great numbers of communities who need it.  Flexible arrangements have been made for older unemployed people under the pre-retirement allowance scheme and I welcome that.  The Minister also mentioned the <i>pro-rata</i> pensions.  He said that this year's Social Welfare Act provide that regulations may be made giving entitlement to pensions at a reduced rate to those who, having earlier left the insurance system because of the operation of the remuneration limit, came back into insurance on 1 April 1974 when the limit was abolished.  We would welcome the provision of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions for those people who were adversely affected.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a point with regard to one group of people about whom I have received representations, as I am sure have other Members of the House.  There is a certain anomaly with regard to employees of CIE who, when they reach supervisory grade, are automatically made ineligible for the full contribution. Some of them find that this affects their full pension rights and wonder if something can be done about it.  Can a person, on reaching a certain level of promotion within his job, who finds himself outside the full contributions but within reach of pensionable age be included under the <i>pro-rata</i> pension scheme or can he opt to remain within the full contribution?  This can be a tremendous disadvantage to the extent that people might think twice about accepting promotion.  That is a total denial of the encouragement that we should be giving to people in their jobs.</P>
    <P>When discussing the localisation of services, the Minister said that much progress had been made through a <Col N="1499" /> combination of intensive computerisation, new management systems, revised working procedures and the reorganisation of functions to provide a more comprehensive, integrated, streamlined and secure service to social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In a policy paper produced by a former Minister, Deputy Boland, he made certain proposals.  I am sure the Department have taken note of them but what progress has been made in those areas?  One of the recommendations was that very young and not fully trained members of staff should not be put into key sensitive jobs, such as meeting the public in employment exchanges and in areas where determinations have to be made. The staff should be very highly trained so that they will be aware of the sensitive nature of their work.  These staff members should at least be middle management and there should be a continuity of service so that people will get to know the officers involved who will be aware of the honesty and dignity of the applicants.</P>
    <P>Another idea was that there should be a room set aside in each employment exchange and social welfare office where a person might go to be questioned or to make a special submission and be able to do that in privacy.  That is one of the most important areas of reform we should look at.  I admit a great number of offices may be outdated and might not lend themselves to such a move, but this is one of the key areas where investment is need if we are serious about treating people with dignity and discussing their affairs in private.  People who go to hospitals or visit doctors are granted this privacy and the same dignity should be granted to people seeking social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that all the child benefit renewal books will be issued this year using the new personalised paying order system which he launched last year. I cannot let the opportunity pass without saying that not alone should the direct payment of child benefit continue to be paid to the spouse looking after the children in the home, but every effort should be made to increase that benefit since it <Col N="1500" /> is the only real economic value put on work in the home and child-rearing.  I also welcome the fact that the new system for the free fuel scheme is being currently developed and will be implemented for the next heating season.  We all hope this means nobody will be discriminated against because of where they live and that this scheme will be based on real needs.</P>
    <P>I read the summary of the reports on the review of payment systems conducted by Craig Gardner, management consultants. They have identified a certain amount of fraud, as did the Department. I welcome the proposal that employers should be held responsible for fraud, but it must be recognised that the number of fraudulent applications is very small.  The majority are honest people.  I heard on the news that the number of fraudulent applications in urban areas was about 10 per cent.  Even if it was 10 per cent, that means 90 per cent of those who are eligible and apply for social welfare benefits are decent honest people who have been forced by circumstances to apply for these benefits.  The focus must be on the honest people rather than on those who make fraudulent applications. All the training in the Department should be directed towards that end.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the combat proverty programme.  This puts poverty very high on the political agenda, where it should be.  I am sure we will be dismayed by the results of the major survey on poverty being carried out by the ESRI at present.  I ask the Department to pay special attention to the views from the Combat Poverty Agency to the European Community with regard to the integration of all EC poverty programmes. The Irish Combat Poverty Agency points out that there is very little exchange of information between national poverty agencies.  If there was greater integration and initatives in this area, if anti-poverty models which worked in other countries could be shared, it would serve a useful purpose.  Above all, research within the EC should be shared.</P>
    <P>As the Combat Poverty Agency say, work combating poverty should be based <Col N="1501" /> on the understanding that poverty is not a residual problem but is directly linked to social and economic policy.  In the light of the fact that the European Social Fund and Structural Funds are being doubled between now and 1992, I would like to believe that with the integration of ideas and research between the Irish agencies and Europe, poverty would not be a residual problem but could be tackled and, hopefully, within the next few years we will not see the same degree of poverty that exists at the moment.</P>

      <P>I would like to begin where the Minister left off by complimenting two of the staff in his Department. In my short three weeks with responsibility for social welfare, I have found the staff with whom I had contact efficient, helpful and very courteous.  I think I speak for other Deputies when I say the Department of Social Welfare is the most improved Government Department in recent years.</P>

      <P>A couple of years ago when one contacted the Department it would take months to get a response. Now a response to a normal constituency representation, comes within a matter of days.  That is a very good thing and the new systems are obviously working very well.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister because he has genuinely sought to be imaginative in the way he has handled his brief.  He sought to bring about changes in areas which badly needed change. For too long we have allowed our social welfare system to develop on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with very little planning and co-ordination between schemes and very little rationalisation.  Many social welfare schemes have been introduced in response to social changes without adequate time and thought going into evaluating what we were trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this country improves its economic performance, we must redirect additional resources to the weaker sections of our community, the people on social welfare. <Col N="1502" /> We must carry out major reform and a total overhaul of the social welfare system.  With more than 30 per cent of the population dependent in some way on social welfare, and about 20 per cent of families totally dependent on social welfare, urgent reform must come about sooner rather than later.  Although published two years ago, the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which was the only real effort to reform the system since the foundation of the State, was never discussed in this House or in the Seanad.  That is a pity.  While I accept that the implementation of many of the recommendations in that report would be very costly, we should have had a major debate in both Houses on the findings in that report.  Reform in the area of social welfare has never been a major political priority of any party and that is a pity.</P>
    <P>The failure to change the system of social welfare and to restructure the welfare payment system has led to many anomalies in the present social welfare system.  For example, a deserted wife gets far more than a woman who is separated from her unemployed husband.  Why these two women should be considered worth very different sums escapes me, but that is the case under our social welfare system.  Children, too, are treated differently, some being considered worth much more than others.  While I welcome the efforts made recently by the Minister to rationalise the number of types of dependant payments, we must go much further and have one single rate of payment in respect of the children of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>In order to have a fair system we need to introduce a single, uniform manner of means testing for all State benefits.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister indicated that in his Department alone 11 different means tests were applied.  There are further means tests applied by the Department of Health and by various local authorities and different State agencies.  It is appalling that we have not been able to organise one system of means testing of applicants for State benefits.  One of the more obvious ways of doing so would be to follow the type <Col N="1503" /> of system used by local authorities to assess differential rents.  It is a very efficient system, one under which local authority tenants are assessed regularly. That kind of assessment could be used by the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health with regard to medical cards and other State benefits.</P>
    <P>The failure to compile a single system of means testing results in many people who do not require State benefits receiving them and doing so at the expense of the weakest and most deprived sections of our community.  For example, in matters like the free electricity scheme, or free travel for old people &mdash; and I shall probably be accused of political foolishness in saying this &mdash; very well-off people should not be entitled to these benefits on the same basis as the poorest people.  Child benefit allowances, also, should not be paid to every family, regardless of income.  Why should the wife of a very wealthy businessman receive the same child benefit as the wife of a social welfare recipient?  That is neither fair nor just and it means that our State benefits are not being targeted towards those who need them most.</P>
    <P>I must disagree with my colleague, Deputy Barnes.  It has been an accepted fact in this country that child benefit is a payment to the mother for being a mother.  That is an insult to Irish women. Does it mean that somebody who has married and has never had a child will not get this allowance because she had not the benefit of being a mother?  That is degrading and places a very low value on the women of this country.  Child benefits should be paid to help families to rear their children.  At a time of very limited resources that £213 million that we spend on child benefits should be given to the poorest in our community, to the recipients of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent days on the topic of fraud.  The vast majority of our people who claim social welfare from the State do so as a last resort.  They do so very reluctantly. Many grow up in an environment where, for pure pride or family reasons, they <Col N="1504" /> hate to have to admit that they must look to the State in order to provide food and clothing for their children.  It is a pity that far too often those who make fraudulent claims on the Department of Social Welfare get so much publicity and, as a result, cast a very poor reflection on all social welfare recipients.  I am delighted that the findings of the Craig Gardner report, which the Minister very kindly circulated to Deputies in the last couple of days, indicated that in the Dublin area only 2 per cent of unemployment payments were based on fraud and only 1 per cent of those claiming disability benefit were claiming fraudulently.  These are extremely low levels, indeed.  That must make us all realise that the 98 or 99 per cent of applicants for these benefits are honest people who are not in any way defrauding the State.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must be more vigilant in terms of policing the social welfare system.  We must deal more severely, in particular, with employers who allow people to work in their premises knowing them to be claiming social welfare.  We must put a much heavier onus on employers and make an example of those indulging in this practice.  I am pleased to note from the Minister's speech that 26 such employers are currently being prosecuted.  An example should be made of such people, because those who defraud our social welfare system are cheating the poorest and most deprived people in our community.</P>
    <P>With regard to unemployment, one of the heaviest burdens placed on the social welfare system at the moment is as a result of 20 per cent of our workforce being currently out of work.  For too long we have had a very conservative attitude towards the plight of the unemployed. We have told them that in order to qualify for State benefits they must exclude themselves from education, voluntary work, any work at all.  They must almost become useless persons.  That is degrading and insulting to the unemployed, the vast majority of whom want to make a useful contribution to their local community. They want to be involved in some <Col N="1505" /> kind of work and they deserve that dignity. In that regard, I welcome the scheme recently announced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  Many political opponents of his and many commentators have seen fit to criticise that scheme.  Like everything else that is new, if you want to, you can find things that are wrong but, equally, you can find many things that are right.  That scheme is going in the right direction.  I should like to see it extended and being taken up by the unemployed.  While I do not believe that people should have to work in order to live or to survive, all unemployed people should be expected to make some contribution to their local community, through a voluntary body, to give of their time and service in return for State benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the problem of money lending and said that he had asked the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out a survey in this regard.  As a Deputy who represents a constituency where money lending is often a major problem, I am pleased that that survey is being carried out.  I know that some moneylenders not only charge enormous rates of interest but that the manner in which they treat people to whom they lend money is absolutely despicable. They terrorise and frighten them.  I have often known very poor people to pay the moneylender before they buy the weekly food for their children, because they become so frightened.  Many people get into difficulties with regard to money lending in order to look after their children, for example, to buy First Communion and Confirmation outfits, school uniforms and such.  There is much pressure on families in the poorer communities to keep up with everybody else.  If you are living on social welfare, it is not that easy.  For a married couple with three children to have to live on £14 a day is certainly not very easy.  We need to take some of the pressure off these families and give them some help at times like that, to purchase the necessary requirements for the children.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system should be further decentralised.  In particular, in <Col N="1506" /> my constituency in Tallaght which has, according to a report published earlier this week, a 60 per cent dependency on social welfare, there should be a full social welfare facility available.  We need to co-ordinate our State services further. The dental, optical and hearing benefits scheme recently extended to the spouses of insured workers should be operated by the Department of Health.  The community welfare officers scheme is essentially a community scheme and should be co-ordinated fully by the Department of Social Welfare.  We need to separate the health functions from the welfare functions. Unless we do, we will not have an efficient service delivered fairly to those who require it.  The educational opportunity scheme &mdash; one of the pilot schemes is in my area &mdash; should be further extended.  That scheme gives a great opportunity to many of those who had to leave school very early without an adequate education to catch up and to have a better chance of finding a job.</P>
    <P>In relation to fraud, I saw an announcement by the Minister in yesterday's evening newspapers that everybody will have an RSI number.  It would be better to have an identity card system which would be useful in so many other areas apart from social welfare.  It would be a more efficient and convenient system instead of having a number of schemes for different purposes.  I know that the Minister for Justice introduced a voluntary identity card system but a compulsory system would help to combat problems in relation to fraud in the social welfare system and a whole range of other problems like the abuse of alcohol by young people.</P>
    <P>For a long time now we have left the problems of social welfare recipients generally to voluntary agencies, religious orders and nuns and priests, particularly in the urban centres.  However, their marvellous work is no substitute for political action.  All parties in the House must ensure that the reform and overhaul of the social welfare system becomes a major political priority.  Even if we do not wish to means test people for benefit, the structure of our population is such <Col N="1507" /> that in 20 to 25 years' time, we will not be able to continue to make payments to people who are currently entitled to them.  Unless we are selective, the population will not be able to maintain the kind of benefits we are used to.  We should withdraw State benefits from the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and target limited State resources to those in real need.  That will allow us to bring up the rates of those at the very bottom of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone a long way towards improving the plight of the long-term unemployed and the 11 per cent increase was long overdue.  It has certainly vastly improved the position for many families.  We need to go much further but our limited resources have to be spread thinly over too many people.  We cannot give people a reasonable level of income but we must target resources to those most in need.</P>
    <P>Recently, a party in this House said that they favoured the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, so that everyone would have a minimum income.  While that system is attractive to economists &mdash; and removes the poverty trap &mdash; it redistributes poverty among the least well off in the community. It keeps some people so far down the scale that they never get a chance of having more than the minimum income, which will probably be £25 or £30 per week.  It means that invalids or people who, through no fault of their own, cannot work will not be able to participate in the economic activity of the country and will always be much worse off than those who have an opportunity to participate because they are in gainful employment.  For that reason, I do not favour moving to that kind of system because it would be grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>In relation to those on a low income and receiving the family income supplement, the best way of helping them is to dismantle the PRSI system and to remove it from, say, the first £3,000 of income.  If you want to keep the same level of contribution it can be extended at the other end of the scale.  My party <Col N="1508" /> are committed to abolishing employees' PRSI.  However if it is kept, it should be extended at the higher income level instead of charging it on the first £2,000 or £3,000 because that means that somebody just starting work pays tax on the very first £1 they earn.  It is a tax on employment and causes many of the poverty traps which the family income supplement was introduced to try to combat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Barnes and Deputy Harney, I too have noticed a very positive and definite improvement in the services from the Department of Social Welfare.  The Order Paper of the Dáil each day is clear evidence of that because it can be seen that the number of questions tabled under Social Welfare has been drastically reduced.  At one stage, I headed the poll in the number of questions I asked about social welfare and I was publicly criticised for this.  However, I make no apologies for that because, eventually, many of the inefficiencies were highlighted as a result.  The Department needed to be restructured and reorganised. There has been a big improvement over the last two years and the service has improved.  Of course, more improvements are needed but they are making positive progress and I am grateful to the Minister for the way he responded to Opposition Deputies in relation to the whole subject of social welfare.  He is prepared to recognise a good point made by an Opposition Deputy and is not politically afraid to put it into operation and to give the party or Deputy concerned the credit for it.  It is a pity that the same type of approach does not prevail in other Government Departments, as Dáil Éireann would be all the better for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of points in the Craig Gardner report.  I was disappointed that we did not get the full, detailed report; we received only a summary. The information in the full report would be very useful in trying to improve the social welfare system.  I do not know if the Minister intends to give a copy of the full report to Members of the House or at least to party spokespersons.  The <Col N="1509" /> Minister referred to the family income supplement, and the current figures are much more accurate than the original ones.  The estimate of 35,000 was far too high &mdash; I do not know where it came from &mdash; and the figure of 15,000 is much more accurate.</P>
    <P>We must come to grips with means testing social welfare because a very substantial part of departmental time is wasted in this regard.  It also means that there are lengthy delays in payments because social welfare officers have to visit people's homes and often they are not at home.  This entails calling back two or three times before they can contact them.  This is creating an estimated delay of seven or eight weeks from the time of application.  Indeed, the delays can be much longer.  Deputy Harney's point that all local authority tenants should have to complete a form of means test in regard to differential rent each year should be looked at.  It would mean a person being means tested in regard to basic needs.  It is very unlikely that someone in a local authority house will have £100,000 in the bank if they are on the differential rent system.  The local authority are in a good position to judge that because the rent man, who calls on a weekly basis, knows the locality and the families very well and he will be a very good judge as to whether a person has been accurately means tested.  It would save an enormous amount of time if there was only one means test.  Spotchecks could be carried out at intervals in the various areas where social welfare officers are located.</P>
    <P>Let me bring to the Minister's attention another problem which is causing much hardship.  Initially this problem only affected a small number of people but this list is now getting longer.  I am referring in particular to the position of a married couple where the wife is working and the husband is unemployed.  If the husband is in receipt of unemployment benefit no means test is carried out but when he transfers to unemployment assistance he is means tested.  Prior to the new regulations coming in in 1987 all payments, such as mortgage repayments, were deducted from the gross earnings of the <Col N="1510" /> wife and the amount of unemployment assistance to be paid was determined on her net earnings, but now his means are assessed on her gross earnings.  In one case which I came across last week a wife was earning £130 a week gross.  Her husband had lost his job and could not find another.  They had to make mortgage repayments of £80 a week and following a means test he is now being paid £3 a week in unemployment assistance &mdash; which is an insult &mdash; because of the new method of assessment which was brought into effect by ministerial order and was issued to the deciding officers last year.  I ask the Minister to look at this problem as severe hardship is being caused in many cases.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the local offices.  I note that improvements have been made in the offices in Dundalk and Drogheda in my constituency.  The Minister visited these offices to see the changes which had been made but while we can make physical improvements I think the services provided can also be improved.  A large percentage of those who have to attend at local offices could be put on some type of cash card system. I do not see why these people have to queue up in the rain in queues which are now so long that they stretch way down the street.  They could be put on a cash card system which could be operated through the banks or, preferably, through the post offices.  Cash card units could be installed outside employment exchanges in the same way that they have been installed outside banks.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that the payments to a person in receipt of unemployment assistance are going to change unless, of course, he goes back to work or manages to get a part time job.  As the payments are fairly consistent all that would be required would be an annual review of the payments.  After all, the vast majority of social welfare recipients are now in receipt of unemployment assistance and this is not going to change.  It is unlikely that men coming up to the age of 50 will return to employment.  A large number of those who have to attend employment exchanges could be given cash cards <Col N="1511" /> carrying their RSI numbers.  Reference was made in the Craig Gardner report to using such a system.  It referred to the use of electronic fund transfers and I presume that this is similar to what I am talking about here.</P>
    <P>The report also made reference to the use of post office warrants.  As I have said, I think we should go further than the issuing of post office warrants and install cash card units outside post offices in consultation with An Post.  I do not see why old age pensioners should have to go to a post office before 9 a.m. to queue up in a lengthy queue waiting for payment. I cannot see why a cash card unit could not be installed outside post offices, particularly as the payments are fairly consistent and which are only likely to change if one or other of the partners dies or, alternatively, there is an increase in the payment.  Therefore, we are really only talking about an annual review.  If cash cards were issued to old age pensioners they could draw money at whatever time of the day or night they wished and this would avoid delays in the payment of benefits at post offices.  It is not fair on old age pensioners for them to have to queue up in a post office to receive money which is rightfully theirs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with you, Deputy.  I was also pleased to see reference in the Craig Gardner report to community welfare officers.  Deputy Barnes and Deputy Harney also referred to these.  As far as possible the decision as to whether payment should be made should be taken out of the hands of community welfare officers.  I have said this every time I have spoken on the topic of social welfare.  It is ridiculous that a person who has been refused payment at the employment exchange has to trot up to the health office to queue up once more.  This is very degrading for many reasons which I do not have the time to go into.  There could be 100 different reasons why a person may not be paid benefit such as delays in <Col N="1512" /> the employer returning money.  On being refused the person must receive a letter from the social welfare officer and, as I have said, trot all the way up through the town with cap in hand to the health office to see what he is going to be paid there.</P>
      <P>No one can tell me how community welfare officers arrive at their decisions. One community welfare officer will grant payment of £30 while another will grant a payment of £60.  There is no consistency in the amount of payments made.  I believe that the social welfare officers are in the best position to make the decision because they know what they are entitled to receive and the reason why benefit is not being paid &mdash; either because the employer has not returned the social welfare contributions or there has been a mix up in RSI numbers, or some other reason. They are in a much better position to make a decision and make temporary payments.</P>
      <P>The funny part in all of this, as the Minister is well aware, is that when the payment finally comes through, be it DB, UB, or UA the Department of Social Welfare have to receive information from the Department of Health.  The information is passed from the community welfare officer to the Department of Social Welfare.  This is an utter waste of time, it amounts to duplication and is most inefficient to say the least.  It constitutes the largest, single problem Deputies encounter in their constituencies. I know it has been the experience of all colleagues to whom I have spoken, and I see Deputy Monica Barnes nodding in agreement.  Rectification of that problem would not warrant a major decision and I can see no reason for its not being taken.  It would eliminate a huge volume of inquiries to the Minister's Department.  In those circumstances a Deputy may well have to go to the Department of Health once or twice and perhaps three or four times to the Minister's Department working his way through the different sections dealing with pay-related benefit or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Harney had to say about pay-related benefit.  I would <Col N="1513" /> contend that pay-related benefit has outlived its usefulness, from the point of view that it has been reduced from 30 per cent to 12 per cent.  It is my belief that it should be incorporated in the standard benefit rate.  I will not suggest how that should be done but the stage has been reached at which it is well nigh farcical to maintain a system of payment that no longer operates properly.  It would be much better to initiate an agreed additional contribution or one flat rate contribution.  Its administration creates problems and there are also delays involved in the processing of documents.</P>
    <P>Last week I heard of an incident in which two employees were brought to court on a charge of social welfare fraud and fined.  I was told that, when the employer learned of the fine, he dismissed them.  However, when I investigated the circumstances I discovered that that employer was bringing employees to the employment exchange to draw the money.  Yet he got away scotfree while his two employees, in addition to being heavily fined, lost their jobs.  I contend that it is people like that employer who should be nailed by the Department of Social Welfare, that it is he who should be spending a couple of months in Mountjoy, which would cure him.</P>

      <P>I am pleased at the unanimity voiced this morning in relation to this Estimate.  The Minister has received just praise from all sides of the House on the approach he has adopted in his two years in office.  In the economic climate prevailing he can be forgiven for concentrating on the containment of the budget on social welfare.  Indeed he might well have got away with a number of cutbacks within his Department.  Instead he has adopted a positive, definite approach which has been welcomed by all Members and people in general.  I welcome the fact that all Members recognise that the Minister is making such a <Col N="1514" /> positive contribution to the operations of his Department.  I might join other Members in complimenting his staff. Those with whom I deal in that Department I have found to be very approachable and helpful.  It has been my experience that one receives speedy answers to queries.</P>
      <P>Over the past couple of years the Minister has introduced a number of new schemes welcomed by everybody in the House.  He has also increased the general rates of benefit in line with inflation and, this year, went a step further, by increasing some benefits by 6 per cent and others by 11 per cent, in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's latest initiative in allowing unemployed sports people travelling abroad to draw unemployment assistance or benefit is to be commended and will be welcomed by all concerned.  I also welcome the fact that he said this morning he has had a study conducted into the low levels of take-up of the family income supplement.  I agree with Deputy Bell that probably the figure he mentioned this morning of there being 15,000 potential beneficiaries would be more realistic than the original figure given.  This is an excellent scheme whose benefits should reach its real beneficiaries.  Quite frankly, I cannot understand the low level of take-up of its provisions.  It appears there are just over 5,000 people availing of its provisions while the estimated take-up group would be approximately 15,000.  There must be something wrong when the other 10,000 are not availing of its benefits. This time last year I asked that the Minister would make a special effort to publicise its provisions.  That was done.  Yet there has not been any great increase in applicants, despite its increased benefits last year.  It is possible that its potential beneficiaries are not aware of its existence or that the message is just not getting through to them.  In addition to improving the provisions of the scheme itself we should examine how the message can be brought home to its potential beneficiaries.  Voluntary organisations, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul <Col N="1515" /> or others, with nationwide offices and committees, could be involved in the publicity campaign which might lead to a greater uptake.</P>
    <P>I might also commend the Minister on the positive action he has taken in various areas warranting attention.  There has been much reference to fraud and its detection.  Here again the Minister's efforts in attempting to reduce fraud and general abuse of the system must be commended. As other Members have said, it should be remembered that we are talking about a minority only although public perception is that there is widespread abuse of the system.  That perception comprises part of the problem.  All public representatives meeting people hear much talk about the huge abuse of social welfare and the fraud being perpetrated. However, we should remember it is difficult to pin that abuse and fraud down. The summary of the recent report from Craig Gardner highlighted that the general notion that there is, say, 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent of people abusing the system goes a long way to refute the argument that there is widespread abuse.  Nonetheless, it must be acknowledged that there is abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has managed over the past two years to crack down on some of that abuse.  Henceforth possibly he should enlist public support somewhat more in the crack down on such abuse. Public perception is that there is widespread abuse of the system, but I do not believe the incidence is as great as is generally believed.  There is a dichotomy in the attitude of people to the idea of widespread abuse.  When people talk to me about widespread abuse they list individual cases but when I ask them if they have contacted the Department or the health board to make them aware of the facts they say it is nothing to do with them.  No one wants to report anyone else; if fact, they want Deputies to report people.  If there is abuse of the system it is the business of everyone to report it. Our attitude is probably excused by our <Col N="1516" /> history and people will not report neighbours to official Departments.  People should realise that those abusing the social welfare system are depriving other people of their entitlements and are certainly reducing the amount of money available to help those genuinely in need. The Department of Social Welfare and other Departments should launch a public awareness campaign to change our attitude and make people aware of their responsibilities and of the consequences of abuses of the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken positive action in a number of areas relating to social welfare but more improvements could be made.  I strongly support the idea that an RSI number should be issued to everybody on, for instance, their 16th or 18th birthday.  The issuing of RSI numbers would be of help not just in relation to social welfare entitlements but in relation to the tax system.  Seeing that almost every child is registered in the Department of Social Welfare under the child benefit scheme or as dependants of social welfare recipients, the requisite information is already in the Department of Social Welfare, so that job should be done by the Department of Social Welfare. At the moment a person leaving school cannot get a tax-free allowance until he is employed.  If RSI numbers were automatically issued it would mean that a tax-free allowance certificate would be issued as soon as a person left school.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what Deputy Bell said but I agree with what he said in relation to the supplementary welfare scheme and the involvement of the community welfare officers.  Generally speaking, the people who go to the community welfare officer have for one reason or another been refused unemployment benefit or assistance.  Deputy Bell described the rigmarole involved in going to the community welfare officer.  Because of the system people have a perception of widespread abuse.  People will say that a person had been down to the employment exchange and had then been to the community welfare officer getting money from both places, from the State.  Over <Col N="1517" /> the next year, in the interests of efficiency will the Minister concentrate his efforts on bringing all these schemes under the Department of Social Welfare?  This would cut out duplication and waste.</P>
    <P>A single system of means testing is something that deserves serious consideration. The Department of Social Welfare is the obvious choice to deal with means testing.  A single system of means testing could be used not just for social welfare schemes but for differential rent schemes and so on.  I know more manpower would be needed in the Department but it would be worth it.  It is very difficult to explain the position to people who seek a medical card, to explain why their differential rent is so high or why they cannot get a waiver in relation to their local charges.  There are different systems for medical cards, for rates, for rents and so on.  It is all very confusing and it leads to duplication and waste.</P>
    <P>In relation to widowers, particularly widowers with young children, I again appeal to the Minister to try to help widowers with young families.  I referred to this before in the House.  Widowers seems to be the forgotten people in the social welfare system.  I know the Minister is aware of the problems and would like to do something about and I appeal to him to do something sooner rather than later.  The fact that widowers are not entitled to a State payment causes distress, worry and hardship for them. When introducing a social welfare Bill at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year, will the Minister include something for widowers?  I commend the Minister on his work and would ask him to continue with the attitude he has adopted over the past two years, towards change in the Department and towards getting the services of the Department to people who are most in need of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I thank the Chair for the opportunity to comment on the proposal of the Minister that his Estimate for the current year be approved by the House. It gives an opportunity to review in some <Col N="1518" /> small detail the workings of the Department and to make some comments of a general nature on the things yet to be done.</P>
      <P>The major buzz interest at present relates to this Department and its unrelenting campaign against the major abuses which are perceived and presented to the public at large at regular intervals. This strategy of campaigns against the unemployed and those who are forced to look to the State for assistance &mdash; because jobs cannot be provided for them &mdash; is one devised and utilised as a means to deflect people away from addressing the fundamental and important issues that have yet to be dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister in pursuing the many promises made by successive Fianna Fáil manifestos at election time.</P>
      <P>I hope that the publication of the Craig Gardner report will put an end to this campaign or strategy and that the findings will be properly addressed.  The major findings of the report are that 99 per cent of people who are seeking disability benefit through the Department of Social Welfare are entitled to it and are legitimately receiving it.  Equally, 98 per cent of those seeking unemployment assistance are entitled to it and are legitimately receiving it.  I hope that the case which was so often put before by successive Governments that there was massive fraud on the Exchequer and the taxpayer has been nailed and the realities now exposed for the benefit of us all.  The Workers' Party believe we should stop this campaign against people who are forced to go on to the dole for assistance, because work cannot be provided for them, that they are a burden on the State and that they are some part of a massive organisation of fraud on the Exchequer. They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years when I worked in the area of criminal law, before coming into the Dáil, I got a fairly good impression of those who were &ldquo;found out&rdquo; or shown to have taken money from the Department of Social Welfare to which they were not entitled.  It is worth making the point that <Col N="1519" /> the vast majority of those people did so out of desperation and not out of some sinister, organised crime motive.  I think the Minister will have to concede that most of the frauds that are perpetrated on his Department arise initially by accident. There is the case of people who are on unemployment assistance on a temporary basis, perhaps, going on to sick benefit and when they return to unemployment assistance find that they are in receipt of double payment and allow it to continue, or, they find that their brother or sister has emigrated without notifying the authorities and they continue to collect on the double again.  That money, in the main, which props up what is a fairly paltry sum, helps families meet the unbelievably high costs imposed on them. They are not skilful crooks.</P>
    <P>A feature of the whole system is that on a weekly basis they must either present themselves at the counter of the employment exchange or go to the local post office or bank and endorse their cheque. They are, on a weekly basis, putting themselves in the hands of the investigators within the Department, the Garda Síochána or the officials.  Eventually when the system wakes up to the fraud they are inevitably caught.  There is inevitably an unanswerable case presented against them.  A high percentage of the cases are dealt with on a plea basis before the District Courts and they rarely go beyond that.  When the full facts are put before the courts it has been the comment of many people in this House, who are so ill-informed, that the courts treat them leniently.  Invariably when they come to the courts it is on the basis that they have already settled a scheme of repayment with the Department and that their right entitlements are deducted.  Once the fraud is exposed the Department over the months and years will recoup in full the moneys that have been taken.  I do not for one moment suggest that what is happening is right. No one should have to and no one should defraud or take what he or she is not entitled to receive.</P>
    <P>I want to make a plea to the Minister <Col N="1520" /> that this campaign of vilification against social welfare claimants stops on the basis that the scale is not anything like what people are suggesting it is and that the people who are actually involved are not the skilful, organised fraudulent people that it is often claimed they are.  They are unfortunate people who, through no fault of their own, are obliged to rely on a very poor scheme of welfare and who, in my view, often cannot be blamed if a Godsend is landed on their lap and they avail of it.  They do so in the interests, not of their own personal gain, but of their families and their dependants.  This issue has been flogged enough by the Department and the Minister and it is time to stop it.  The opportunity now presents itself for the Minister to address some of the more fundamental and important issues that his Department should be dealing with.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, in his reply, to tell us what was the cost of this investigation. What did his Department pay to these outside consultants?  I am glad that they have come up with such revealing information for us all but do we not have within the Department, or elsewhere in Government, the expertise, the knowledge and the capacity to carry out this type of investigation?  I believe the accountants' auditors who reported on this problem to the Minister told us nothing more than he and his officials would know from their own cursory investigation of their own system.  I hope the Minister, either through his officials or, if he is so impressed by Craig Gardner, would employ them to carry out the other important side of this issue: to look at the scale to which claimants are not being advised of their entitlements and are not collecting their full due under the system, given its complexity, the large number of different rules and regulations, forms and requirements.  Perhaps he would tell us to what extent his Department are making savings in the area of non-payment of entitlements to people who otherwise would be entitled to them.</P>
    <P>I believe there are much more important issues that the Minister should address in his area.  The one single report, <Col N="1521" /> that of the Commission on Social Welfare, is still there and has not been properly addressed by this Government or by the previous Government in office.  It carried out a comprehensive overview of the Department of the scheme of entitlements, of people's needs and has made very concrete and very positive recommendations to Government.  Many of these would involve very little, if any, cost if implemented.  Even in those areas there seems to be no movement on the part of the Government to respond.  In relation to the basic recommendation that concerns us all &mdash; everyone's entitlement to a basic pay &mdash; the response has been to confuse the issue, to suggest that the cost is far greater than it would be if implemented.  That is something to which the Government must respond, not just in the piecemeal percentage, year by year incremental increase of welfare payments, which appears to be the approach of this Government but in a direct and honest way whether they accept, in principle, and unreservedly seek to implement the basic minimum wage concept contained in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>The other area very dear to the Minister's heart when it comes to talking about what is in being is the Jobsearch scheme.  It is suggested that in the previous year it has been a resounding success. I and The Workers' Party do not go along with that view.  The Jobsearch scheme has been a job handing scheme to the long-term unemployed.  There is very little point in pushing people into the street and the workplace when there are no jobs there.  The Jobsearch scheme can be successful only if taken in the context of an expanding economy where jobs are being provided in the real sense. People are being brought in under the threat of losing their social welfare entitlements and are obliged to go through with what could well be useful and meaningful courses of training in the FÁS centres and then moved on to no job at all or jobs that simply do not last. Oftentimes one gets the impression that employers are providing short term, non-viable work for these schemes as a means <Col N="1522" /> of ingratiating themselves with the Department or training centre so that they will stand in a good light when it comes to applying for all the various grants and supports that are available from Government.</P>
    <P>No serious analysis of the scheme has been done.  The Minister simply picks a figure of 9,700 people who left the live register and says that is the achievement of Jobsearch but no serious analysis has been done of those people.  Whether they went into employment, whether they stayed in employment or left because they emigrated or for all the other reasons a person might leave the live register at any time has not been stated.  I am not convinced that Jobsearch as a scheme is doing anything concrete or serious in the overall complex picture of a quarter of a million unemployed.  Figures of 2,300 or 2,500 are having very little impact on the overall scheme of things.</P>
    <P>That is not to say those who have benefited are not to be congratulated.  Obviously, to that extent we cannot take away from the scheme but we must address it on an occasion like this and in the overall scheme of things and put it into the context of the scale of the problem we are trying to deal with.  As a serious effort, one pushed by the Minister as a major effort of Government, it falls far short of what was originally intended.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has called off the hounds who stalked our constituency from the Department of Social Welfare, in particular the North Cumberland Street employment exchange.  There was a time when the figures simply could not be understood beyond indicating a very calculated witch hunt of people on unemployment assistance in that constituency.  By a comparison of figures, 8,000 people were signing on in North Cumberland Street at any one time and in January there were 247 appeals compared with only 20 in the next comparable exchange in Gardiner Street.  The Minister has never explained that.  Why was it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have only a minute left.  Let the Minister tell us in the ten minutes he will have.  I ask him to address the matter of putting the Combat Poverty Agency and their programme on a long-term basis beyond the year 1989 when many of the current projects funded by the EC will come to an end, and to work on the very excellent report prepared and presented to him here in Dublin within the past two weeks.  The Combat Poverty Agency are to be congratulated for their research and work and I ask the Minister to undertake that they will see a very clear future mapped out for them in his proposals in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy McCartan said, this is a very brief debate and I do not intend to take too long.  Deputy McCartan mentioned the Jobsearch scheme and he has one view of that scheme.  While the scheme may have had teething problems it has worked out in my area to be quite useful.  Obviously, people are not too happy at having to be called up for maybe four weeks to do the course, but I have spoken to a number of people involved in and managing the scheme and they felt it was of benefit.  A number of people when they went to the Jobsearch scheme found that they did not even know what a CV was.  Obviously, they were told.  The scheme has had an effect, even if not the effect Deputy McCartan and the rest of us would like of providing jobs for everyone.  I do not think that is possible.  It has been a small source of education to people long-term unemployed.  A factory in my own town, S &amp; S, went to the wall about three years ago.  Most of the employees were middleaged and their prospects of ever getting a job again were remote but Jobsearch helped them at least to be re-educated in how to apply for a job.  The Jobsearch <Col N="1524" /> scheme this year is progressing and indicating that there are a number of vacancies to be found.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department in relation to that.</P>
      <P>I refer now to the Combat Poverty Agency.  The Minister said that under an EC directive we will be carrying out a major survey on poverty.  This should be a major step forward in that area in the next year or so.  Recently I represented this Parliament at an inter-parliamentary conference in Guatemala.  We talk about poverty in Ireland but what we have here is nothing like the poverty in places like Guatemala.  I listened here yesterday to the debate on the Housing Bill &mdash; indeed, I tried to get into it and but for the filibustering tactics of some Deputies I might have succeeded.  However, I hope to get into it next week.  They went on at length about poverty and lack of housing in this country but you have only to go outside this country to see what other countries are enduring where thousands are living in makeshift polythene shelters. This major survey will at least show us the situation in this country relating to poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned flexibility in relation to the social welfare system.  In the last ten or 15 years politicians have been criticised by people who said that the social welfare system was totally inflexible.  However, the moves by the Minister represent a small step on the road to introducing some flexibility into the system.  I appreciate that almost £7 million is paid out daily by the Department of Social Welfare and that there may not be much room to manoeuvre.  I do not think the Government were given sufficient credit for relaxing the rules in regard to the long-term unemployed who make visits abroad.  The Minister, and Members who pressed for that change, were congratulated by a correspondent to <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  I can recall making representation on behalf of a number of constituents in regard to that rule.  It is unfortunate that Deputy Bell is not in the Chamber to hear what I have to say in regard to a story carried on the front page of this week's issue of the <Col N="1525" /><i>Drogheda Independent.</i> That newspaper claimed that Deputy Bell was responsible for pressing the Minister to relax that rule.  That is unfair to the other Members, including myself, who made representations to the Minister before Deputy Bell tabled a parliamentary question about it.  The paper indicated that it was as a result of Deputy Bell's parliamentary question that the Minister agreed to relax the rule.  That is a load of nonsense and I will tell Deputy Bell that when I meet him.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing many schemes to help the unemployed.  The part time job incentive scheme has generated a lot of interest in my constituency.  Many people have asked me for details of the scheme.  Those people are in a position to get a certain number of hours of part time work each week but are afraid that they will lose their social welfare entitlements.  The part time job incentive scheme is designed to help such people boost their weekly income.  It is disappointing to hear commentators and politicians criticising the Government for introducing that scheme.  I have heard it said that because of it we will become a nation of part time workers.  Those criticisms are unfair.  As the Minister said, there is a trend for people to take part time jobs and they will be helped by this scheme.</P>
    <P>The pilot schemes under the educational opportunity scheme in Limerick and Tallaght are proving very successful. The Louth VEC have applied to participate in the scheme and I should like to appeal to the Minister to treat their application favourably.  We have a very good adult education officer and the VEC are ready, willing and able to get such a scheme off the ground.  Many people in my area could benefit from it.  I hope we will not have to wait too long before the scheme is extended to the rest of the country to help the long term unemployed who are anxious to pursue education courses.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for helping our VEC sort out a number of problems in regard to those pursuing adult education courses.  When those <Col N="1526" /> people were finding it difficult to continue the courses the Department were quick to smooth out their problems.  The officials in Dundalk did not think they had authority to make a decision in regard to those courses but we got a speedy response from the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>Another matter of interest to me is the pre-retirement allowance.  I understand that the scheme will be in operation by the autumn and I welcome that because many people in my constituency have expressed interest in it.  I can understand why people in the latter years of their lives do not want to be travelling to social welfare offices weekly.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy McCartan had to say about abuse of the social welfare system but I was not impressed.  I was interested in the report on social welfare fraud published by Craig Gardner. It was important to get an independent view of the system because the Minister and his Department are often accused of being soft on those who abuse the system.  There is widespread abuse in the system but when one thinks of the fact that the Department pay out £7 million daily one can understand how there can be abuse.  I hope the report will be a textbook for the Minister and the Department in their efforts to eliminate abuses of the system.</P>
    <P>Ultimately all taxpayers have to pay for any fraud that occurs in the system. The Minister will have to be vigilant to ensure that it is as watertight as possible. I should like to commend the Minister on computerising the system.  Contact with our local offices is more fruitful since computerisation in the Department.  I have a parochial hobbyhorse about the facilities in the Dundalk exchange.  I was pleased to hear of the improvements carried out at the Drogheda exchange and it is unfortunate that Dundalk is still lagging behind.  It is wrong that people should have to queue in the rain outside the Dundalk office.  I accept that the building is very old but I appeal to the Minister to carry out renovations as soon as possible to relieve the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> I should like to congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in his Department in the last year.  It is pleasing to be able to report that the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare has not been hit by cutbacks and I hope that in the preparation of next year's budget the Minister will be able to fight his corner at the Cabinet table to ensure that those who are on the breadline, the poor and the elderly, are cushioned against any cutbacks that may take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed for the constructive suggestions they put forward.  I may not agree with them all but it is important that they should be discussed in the House.  One would get the impression from the debate that abuse of the system was a very narrow thing.  It is important to make it clear that the investigations mentioned related to what we call hard core fraud, cases where there was a definite fraud involved.  There is a big difference between fraud and general abuse, malingering or unwarranted claiming.  It is the fraud cases that end up in court and this year, up to last month, 317 cases were dealt with by the courts.  Those cases involved 26 employers.  There is an onus on me as Minister in charge of a Department expending £7 million per day to ensure that this money is directed to those most in need and that abuse and fraud are tackled.  The system must be reasonably tightly controlled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Craig Gardner were looking at much more than the question of fraud.  They were mainly concerned with the effectiveness of our system, the way in which they might be open to abuse and the possibilities for improvement through the use of modern technology.  One Deputy asked about the cost of this survey.  It amounted to £280,000 approximately over a period of 18 months.  It involved major examination of most of the systems. Some elements of that report are purely technical and are not for general publication.  They deal with the control systems operated by the Department and <Col N="1528" /> obviously it would not be wise to publish this information.  Some people would be very happy to make use of this information to abuse the system.  They estimated that 2 per cent of claims were fraudulent but they also pointed out that another 7 per cent gave rise to suspicion because the facts of the case did not check out at the initial interview.  That 7 per cent of cases has been pursued and two-thirds have been found to be bona fide. Officers dealing with social welfare have a difficulty because a fair percentage of initially recorded information does not work out to be accurate, although there may be no abuse or fraud intended.  A question mark still lies over another two per cent.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Barnes that the vast majority of claimants are bona fide claimants.  There is no question about that.  I make a point of stressing this fact but the newspapers usually do not include that sentence and certainly do not highlight it.</P>
    <P>I am certain that we will achieve a further saving of £20 million in eliminating fraud, unwarranted claiming and abuse, but the savings made last year are built into our basic Estimate for this year. Deputies will appreciate that I have to go after figures of that size and the money is being saved at present.  There is a problem about the use of the terms fraud, abuse, unwarranted claims and so on. If unwarranted claiming is cut out, no money is returned to the Department.  It simply means that further payments are stopped.  Deputy McCartan was not present when I spoke earlier and may have taken some things out of context.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan sees no point in the Jobsearch scheme and does not see any benefits in it.  He is absolutely wrong. Surveys carried out showed that the long term unemployed were not getting the benefit of the various courses and schemes available to help them.  Now a substantial number of these schemes have been directed particularly to them. That is the main benefit, together with the fact that some of them are getting jobs.  I want to stick to the direct benefits. The linkage between FÁS and the <Col N="1529" /> Department of Social Welfare is very important in that respect.  It has enabled us to identify the real needs of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the fact that women are more inclined to take educational courses without someone saying &ldquo;if you take that course we will give you that job&rdquo;.  She is probably right but it applies to a large number of men as well. Many people on the Jobsearch programme know that it increases their confidence and helps them to take up some of the courses and participate in the schemes.  A small percentage do not want to take courses.  Some people have no faith in education or in courses.  Many of the long-term unemployed have a low level of skills and a lack of education. That is as plain as a pikestaff.  We are finding out much more information about this problem and directing resources towards solving it.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to North Cumberland Street and the large number of appeals made to that exchange in comparison with other exchanges around the city.  There are 13 exchanges in the city as a whole.  I explained this matter to Deputy McCartan in reply to a parliamentary question but perhaps he has forgotten it.  All the postal claims are dealt with in North Cumberland Street and this puts an extra load on that centre. He talked about calling off the hounds in North Cumberland Street.  The postal claimants who had not been interviewed for years were called in for interview at the exchange.  That is what gave the impression that something special was happening.  Certainly if a person has not been asked any questions for a couple of years he will be somewhat surprised if invited to come for an interview.  It is part of the normal process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes made a helpful speech. She was anxious that child benefit should be increased and that the free fuel scheme should be based on real need.  I am happy to say that from this year it will be based on need and we hope it will be much more efficient.  She also emphasised the importance of the work done by the <Col N="1530" /> Combat Poverty Agency and the necessity to bear in mind the changes which will occur in 1992.  This is important and although it is not included as part of the directives it should be considered in parallel with them.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Deputy Harney, Deputy Barnes, Deputy Bell and others for their tributes to the staff and the work they are doing at present.  Deputy Harney said there should be more means tests for the free ESB scheme.  That scheme applies only to invalidity pensioners and elderly people living alone and on social welfare, or living with another qualified person who is normally a dependant or another social welfare beneficiary.  That scheme has criteria which are reasonably tight.  The free travel is available to all people over 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney said it is wrong that people earning a good income should receive child benefit and that it should be cut off from these people.  She said that the resources saved should be used for the poorest and the lowest income groups.  One has to bear in mind a number of points here.  The number of people in that situation who are on high incomes is relatively very small and therefore the amount of money saved would be very small, unless we dig deeply into the middle income group.  If we take the people on our records &mdash; we have very detailed records about many people &mdash; 1.71 per cent of all those on PRSI earn over £20,000 per annum.  We will have more information on the self-employed very shortly.  We are in the process of including them at present.  I do not think that what the Deputy suggests would result in any real savings.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about the Craig Gardner report. I do not think there is need for me to say any more about it at this stage.  As far as moneylenders are concerned, I have ideas on that matter.  We are carrying out a study which will be ready by late summer.  I agree entirely with Deputy Harney that they terrorise and frighten people and that the interests rates are excessive.  The Deputy was not at a function in Tallaght on Monday last at which <Col N="1531" /> I announced that we intend to set up a one-stop shop social welfare office in Tallaght.  The planning for that office is beginning at present.</P>
    <P>If we were to implement the further recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare that would be necessary it would cost an extra £409 million.  Most Deputies recognise that we have gone a long way in this Estimate towards providing extra money for the lowest paid people.  If we were to provide extra money for everybody it would cost a lot of money.  The exploitation of part time workers was raised by Deputy Barnes. That is a matter which we will be considering. I am examining the whole question of insurability of part time workers and the question of whether there should be an earnings threshold will also be examined.  It is a complicated matter and not something on which you could make quick decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell welcomed the various improvements in the scheme.  He, too, mentioned the Craig Gardner report.  He welcomed the work towards rationalisation of the means tests.  As I indicated in my speech, it is not that simple because there are concessions built in intentionally for particular groups of people.  If you rationalise it you would have to give everybody those concessions and that would cost a lot of money.  I know Deputy Harney would be concerned about that.  If we built in special concessions for people in particular circumstances we would not want to take them away from them again.  We are examining the rationalisation of the means tests and there will be further developments in that area.</P>
    <P>The question of Bank Link was raised by Deputy Bell.  I was very glad to hear this because he often tells us how strong a trade unionist he is.  I hope he will encourage all the parties involved to support us as we move towards electronic fund transfers.  It is something that we would like to be able to do because there is a great deal of risk and inconvenience in having so much cash, particularly unemployment payments.  There are <Col N="1532" /> many elements to this matter and we can discuss them on another occasion. Surveys of the unemployed have been carried out to see how they feel about it. A certain percentage of them do not want it and that is another problem that we will have to overcome.  The problem of understanding how it works also arises. Someone mentioned the old age pensioners and asked why they could not be included in the Bank Link system.  They would be less inclined to go along with that because they are not familiar with those systems.  That is also a problem that will have to be overcome.  There is considerable scope for moving in that direction and we are anxious to do so.</P>
    <P>The question of privacy was raised.  In all the buildings that we are developing we provide facilities for privacy.  We are providing private screens for people who wish to make claims.  In new offices we are providing separate rooms for interview. We are conscious of the need to provide such facilities and we will be extending them throughout the country as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The question of training was also raised.  I would like to assure Deputies that the need for training is accepted and recognised by the Department and is carried out as a routine.  We try to ensure that persons who are dealing with the public are highly trained and are sensitive to the issues which were raised by Deputy Barnes.  Many of the officers in the Departments are young, as the Deputy said.  Because of that, older people feel a little awkward when making claims and I understand that.  We try, in the training programmes, to deal with that and to make the officers aware of people's feelings, especially those of older people. The training is provided by our staff development unit.  Emphasis is placed all the time on a sensitive, informative, helpful approach to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey talked about enlisting the help of the public in relation to abuse.  In the last year many people have come forward and anonymously made allegations.  These have been followed up and we have been successful with regard to many of them.  The Deputy also raised <Col N="1533" /> the question of RSI numbers.  At present the Revenue Commissioners issue them. We have been having discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and we are anxious to clear up the whole question of identity.  I recognise the problems which Deputy Dempsey mentioned in relation to widowers, especially those with young families.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan came out with strong language about the campaign against abuse being designed to deflect attention from other matters.  He called on us to stop the campaign of vilification. There is no such campaign.  He has suggested that this has been flogged enough at this stage.</P>
    <P>The reason the media tend to pick up that side of our work is that they are aware there is a good deal of abuse and fraud throughout the system.  Even though it is small in proportion to the total it has a very bad effect on those who are paying taxes and PRSI when they see people malingering or abusing the system and nobody taking action.</P>
    <P>We have made substantial savings, real savings in money terms, and there will be further savings this year because we are already well on target.  I have no doubt we will reach the target of £20 million extra savings which we predicted would be made this year.</P>
    <P>Even more important than all that is the development of the system as a whole.  In developing, modernising and making the system more secure, with more effective controls and more cross references, we can in a more natural way reduce the opportunity for abuse.  That is the direction in which we have been going.  This move has been welcomed by all Deputies because the system is more effective and is cutting out a lot of delay and waste of time, as well as reducing the scope for abuse.  That makes everyone happier.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their very constructive contributions to this debate.  I am very pleased the Government have supported me in maintaining the position of all those on social welfare while, at the same time, providing something extra for those in greatest need, particularly those <Col N="1534" /> on supplementary welfare and unemployment assistance.</P>

    <P>I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil an gnó poiblí a thagann faoi mo chúram-sa mar Aire Comhshaoil thar a bheith leathan.  Mar sin, ag féachaint don mhéid ama atá ar fáil againn inniu, is léir nach mbeidh sé ar mo chumas déileáil go a nochtadh sa díospóireacht a bhí sa Dáil Mheastachán seo.  Ach beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.  Agus, dár ndóigh, bhí.  Mar shampla, bhí deis ag Teachtaí a dtuairimí a nochtadh sa díospóireacht a bhí sa Dáil inné faoi mBille Tithíochta.  Agus beidh deiseanna eile acu nuair a bheidh siad at plé le reachtaíocht thábhachtach eile atá <Col N="1535" /> tugtha isteach agam cheana nó a bheidh á tabhairt isteach agam go luath.</P>
    <P>The Estimate is nearly £264 million less than the 1987 outturn.  The reduction is due for the most part to the ending of the direct Exchequer subsidies to local authorities which assisted them in meeting in full or in part the loan charges payable in respect of past expenditure on their capital works programmes.</P>
    <P>There is another major change in the Estimate this year with the inclusion for the first time of most of the local authority capital expenditure which was formerly financed by local loans fund loans.  These changes follow from the enactment of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987.  This legislation enabled a range of circular payments which had arisen over time to be terminated.  Overall, expenditure by my Department and local authorities, both capital and current, in 1988 will be £1,300 million or 7 per cent of GNP &mdash; £520 million of which local authorities will raise from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Arising from the measures taken by the Government to rectify the public finances, 1988 is a transitional year for expenditure by local authorities and my Department.  This transitional period presents an opportunity to rationalise and revitalise the functions and services provided. In this connection, local authorities were authorised to offer the Government's voluntary redundancy/ early retirement scheme to their staff after exhausting measures to maximise savings on manpower costs through natural wastage, redeployment, career breaks and job-sharing.  At this stage nearly 2,500 applications for the scheme have been accepted by the local authorities. Financial assistance is available from the Exchequer to local authorities to meet in full the cost of all lump sum severance payments under the schemes.</P>
    <P>Like all other areas of the public service, local authorities must continue to play their part in the present programme of adjustment in public spending and this is reflected in the level of Exchequer subvention being made available this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> About one half of all local authority expenditure on current account this year will be funded in one form or other by the Exchequer.  A sum of £264 million of this funding comes in the form of grants and recoupments for specific services while the balance of £196 million comes as rates support grants, to be applied at the discretion of the authorities themselves. The rate support grant provision announced in the Abridged Estimates last October has been reduced by £39 million to reflect the reduced debt burden on local authorities following the implementation of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>There are two other adjustments to the rate support grant this year.  The former Vote for Rates on Government Property is now included in the grant and £3 million were transferred from the grant to the Vote for Agriculture and Food as local authorities do not have to contribute to the cost of committees of agriculture this year.</P>
    <P>Over the past year I have been examining options for reforms in the methods of financing local authorities and as soon as this examination is completed I hope to introduce measures aimed at restoring an appropriate degree of stability to local finances.  Much of the necessary ground-work has already been done and I expect to be in a position to report to Government with reform proposals at an early date.  Work on the development of proposals for the structural reorganisation of local government is also well advanced.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I have on numerous occasions referred to the need for a more enlightened attitude by public authorities and individuals to the care of the environment. I have taken action to strengthen my role as Minister in order to provide better co-ordination and closer links between research, policy formulation and implementation.  Care for the environment is a major priority and it must influence the development of national policies and programmes.  Good environmental conditions are now more highly valued than ever before and it is my intention that environment policy will continue to be developed and extended <Col N="1537" /> to reflect the needs and importance of this area.</P>
    <P>The Dublin smoke situation is by far the country's most serious air pollution problem.  The need to remedy it was one of the main reasons for the enactment of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, which this Government actively promoted through the Dáil upon assuming office.  The Act enables local authorities, subject to ministerial approval, to declare &ldquo;special control areas&rdquo; or smokeless zones.  Dublin Corporation have already completed a survey of some 800 houses in Ballyfermot and have made a special control area order for the area concerned.  As objections have been made to the order, I am now arranging for an oral hearing to be held and will make a decision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope to announce shortly the details of a scheme to provide financial assistance towards the cost of the adaptation of domestic heating systems in areas where smoke control measures may be necessary.  This scheme would apply to all suitable appliances, whether for gas or solid fuels.  The estimate includes for the first time a provision for grants of this kind and expenditure of up to £250,000 is envisaged this year.</P>
    <P>On my initiative, the budget included a concession on the excise duty applying to unleaded petrol.  This removed the price disadvantage caused by the additional costs of producing and distributing unleaded petrol so that it now retails at the same price as premium leaded petrol.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to press the distributors of petroleum products to expand the number of outlets for unleaded petrol to ensure that a balanced distribution network is put in place by late 1989, as required under the terms of an EC Directive.  I am pleased to acknowledge the efforts to date of Esso, Shell and Texaco.  My Department have already prepared literature containing information on the subject of unleaded petrol, and later this year I intend to launch a promotional campaign, aimed particularly at the owners of modern cars, <Col N="1538" /> to stimulate greater use of unleaded petrol.  I have also established a steering committee, which will be chaired by my Department, to develop and oversee a comprehensive action programme.  The motor trade and the oil distribution companies are being invited to participate and I will be addressing the first meeting on 9 June.</P>
    <P>An extension of the number of outlets selling unleaded petrol will contribute to the current campaign to promote Ireland as an attractive tourist venue.  Growing numbers of continental motorists are now using unleaded petrol and the wide availability of outlets for such petrol will help Bord Fáilte to attract more motorised tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>Following a number of serious water pollution incidents last summer, a Cabinet committee under my chairmanship developed a comprehensive and integranted programme of measures to combat water pollution.  A programme of farm surveys has been carried out in recent months and work on the implementation of the various other measures in the programme is in progress. I hope to present the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1988, to the House shortly.</P>
    <P>A provision of £1.75 million is made in subhead R for research, analytical and other services concerning environmental and infrastructural matters.  This replaces the specific provision for a grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha which was included in the Vote in previous years.  Details of the revised arrangements for the provision of essential research and related services were announced last December. They include the establishment of a new environmental research unit in my Department and the transfer of certain functions of An Foras Forbartha and the staff involved, to local authorities and other public bodies.  I intend that these arrangements will be fully in place shortly.</P>
    <P>About £280 million is being spent on road works this year, as part of the process of bringing our roads, particularly our national roads and the principal access routes to our ports, and airports, <Col N="1539" /> up to the necessary standards.  I have carried out a comprehensive review of the road development programme and work on a draft Blueprint for Road Development is practically completed. The Government have also approved my proposals in relation to the setting up of the National Roads Authority.  I will be making a detailed statement in relation to the draft blueprint and the National Roads Authority later this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of my concern about the state of the county road system, I have taken special measures to increase the level of State funding for works on such roads.</P>
      <P>In 1987, a total of £15 million was allocated to local authorities for strengthening county roads, compared with £5 million in 1986.  A further £15 million has been allocated in 1988.  I have also decided that, in future, local authorities can use the block grant for roads on surface dressing and repair of potholes on primary county roads.  Local authorities can also adopt a more flexible approach to the grant for strengthening county roads, which should be spent on primary county roads as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>Detailed information has been received from all county councils, in response to a departmental circular issued in May 1987, about the condition of the network of county roads, together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.  This information was considered in the context of the preparation of the draft blueprint for road development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are keenly conscious of the difficulties facing the construction <Col N="1540" /> industry.  We believe that these difficulties will be overcome as order is restored to the economy.  Activity in the construction industry depends on the demand for construction services.  A healthy economy will foster a vibrant building sector.  The substantial falls in interest and mortgage rates and the boost in business confidence stemming from the Government's assault on the imbalance in the public finances have laid firm foundations for recovery.</P>
    <P>The prospects for private investment in construction activity this year are encouraging, particularly in the commercial sector.  Output in the commercial and retail sectors of the industry last year recorded its first increase since 1981 and a further increase is expected this year. The redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site will have a significant positive impact on the industry and should create a knock-on momentum for development and recovery.  The special scheme of financial incentives for urban renewal now operating in 14 urban centres is beginning to spread commercial development activity throughout the country. The section 23 incentive reintroduced in this year's budget to encourage investment in the private residential sector should provide a distinct stimulus to construction activity and generate increased output and employment in the housing sector within the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>Arising from a complaint by the European Commission related to alleged encouragement of the use of Irish cement, I wish to take this opportunity to clarify the reply given by the then Minister for Education to a Dáil question on 9 July 1985.  Deputies will know that it is Government policy to ensure that the maximum level of indigenous materials are used throughout the economy. However, I wish to make it clear that this policy is contingent on such use being consistent with our EC obligations, under which we are precluded from taking any action which discriminates against products and materials manufactured in other member states of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Economic recovery demands the best <Col N="1541" /> and most intensive use of all of the country's resources, including the important resource of land.  This Government have made a specific commitment to rationalising the difficult question of planning compensation.  Work on this is well advanced and, as I have already indicated, I intend to have the relevant Bill circulated before the summer recess. Optimum land use is also frustrated by problems of dereliction.  I also intend to bring forward proposals for tightening and improving the law on derelict sites.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am optimistic that as the beneficial impact of the Government's policy measures work through the economy, the construction industry will see a return to stability and growth.</P>
    <P>In October of last year I announced proposals for a radical new legislative framework for building societies to enable them to survive and compete in a rapidly changing financial services sector. My proposals in this area have been widely welcomed and I can assure the House that I am working to have the Bill presented to the Dáil at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>There has been a reduction in the public capital programme provision this year for local authority house purchase loans following the agreement of the banks and building societies to make available an additional £70 million for house purchasers of modest means.  The arrangement includes a limited State guarantee in the event of a loss being incurred in the case of repossession and resale.  A token provision is included in the Estimates to allow for the recoupment of such expenditure, if the need arises.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with these arrangements, the Government also decided that a variable interest rate should be introduced for annuity and convertible loans with effect from 1 December 1987.  The interest rate now being charged to local authority borrowers is 1.75 per cent less than the fixed rate of interest obtaining prior to December last.  I welcome the recent announcements of further reductions in interest rates by two banks <Col N="1542" /> and I am hopeful that there may be further reductions in the mortgage rate shortly.  This further reduction would be additional to the 3.75 per cent reduction in the mortgage rate since the Government took office.  The cumulative reduction to date represents a monthly saving of £63 on a typical £25,000, 20 year mortgage.  This, indeed, is a significant saving for house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The capital provision for local authority housing in 1988 is £49 million. Though this is a reduction on the capital provision in recent years it must be viewed against the reduced level of demand for local authority housing and the tight budgetary situation which we are now facing.  I expect that some 4,500 households will be provided with first time lettings by local authorities in 1988, of which about 1,600 will be accommodated in newly built houses.</P>
    <P>The provision of adequate suitable accommodation for travellers generally is a matter which local authorities have been asked to deal with as an integral part of their housing programmes.  Substantial progress has been made over the last few years.  Through encouragement and 100 per cent funding by my Department, we have reached a stage where 37 proposals to provide serviced caravan parks for travellers are either at construction or advanced planning stage.  I have expressed my concern at the tardiness of some local authorities in providing the necessary accommodation and my Department are monitoring progress on a quarterly basis.</P>
    <P>I had been concerned for some time at the low take-up of tenant purchase schemes in recent years and on taking office I was determined to do something positive to redress this situation.  I introduced the 1988 tenant purchase scheme in order to extend home-ownership to as many local authority tenants as possible and thereby help to create and restore stability to local authority housing estates.  The scheme has been generally welcomed by both local authorities and tenants and I am confident that with the generous discounts now on offer, up to 50 per cent off the market value, together <Col N="1543" /> with the other favourable terms, it will provide more tenants than ever with the opportunity of home ownership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about the Minister's speech is that with an Estimate which has been so radically changed in several different ways through the alterations in the method of providing loans to local authorities for capital works earlier this year, he managed to make an entire speech introducing it without explaining to the House the extent to which the provision for the Department of the Environment to the operation of local authorities has been substantially reduced this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to establish, because of the various changes in the method of compilation of the Estimates &mdash; one could be forgiven for saying it was like the old adage of doing it with mirrors because enormous amounts have been taken from one side and put back on the other &mdash; the loss of income but the local government system, local authorities and the Department of the Environment are all suffering a substantially reduced allocation this year over last year which, in turn, was substantially reduced over the previous year.  It will become increasingly apparent over the summer that it has been a year of environmental neglect.  It seems odd that a Minister can, in introducing his Estimate, talk about improving and providing better co-ordination and closer links between research policy formulation and implementation in the <Col N="1544" /> year when he abolished An Foras Forbartha, the organisation charged with providing independent research and advice to his Department and local authorities generally.  To put it charitably, it is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that he has improved the facilities for research and policy formulation having abolished the organisation specifically set up to carry out that task.</P>
    <P>The fact that there has been a year of environmental neglect is clearly evident from the appearance of our towns and countryside.  The works formerly done by local authorities on environmental improvements and maintenance has come to a standstill because they no longer have the facilities or the resources and, in many cases, the staff to enable them to carry out basis maintenance, never mind improvements.  Local authorities are starved of cash, forced to shed staff, unable to continue services, prevented from imposing charges and denied the promised reform of the financial structure and financing of local government which the Government promised during the election campaign 16 or 17 months ago.  The Minister spoke about providing a new system of local government finance which is identical to the commitment he gave in the Estimates speech exactly 12 months ago.  However, there has been no sign of a proper new system for realistically financing local authorities except on several occasions when the Minister of State, with or without the Minister's permission, floated some daft ideas which got dafter responses and, eventually, even more daft denials by the Minister.  It is time, for the sake of the local government system, the authorities were clearly told what the future holds for them, what level of financing and autonomy they can expect and what is expected of them.  At present it is being demanded of them at local level that they provide the services which people had traditionally enjoyed. They are not being given the resources to provide those services by the Government and the promised reform of the system has not materialised.</P>

      <P>That pre-supposes that a person has particular powers, skills and talent.  The incumbent may imagine he has these but the rest of us know that he is painfully short of them.</P>
      <P>Let me now turn to deal with the general question on how to protect the environment and the more important question of how to improve the level of public awareness of the importance of their environment.  In 1986 I initiated the enormously successful &ldquo;Clean Up Ireland Week&rdquo;.  It was quite remarkable the way in which the local authorities and the general public responded to that campaign. There was much favourable comment in both the national and local media about the work which was done during the course of that week.  Having been run in a half-hearted fashion last year the Minister has now abandoned the &ldquo;Clean Up Ireland Week&rdquo; entirely in favour of taking on the appearance of some public salesman of dishwashers which is a sorry and poor alternative to the &ldquo;Clean Up Ireland Week&rdquo;, which was successfully launched in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the talk and all the promises and commitments the Minister only devoted one paragraph of his speech to what was supposed to have been done in eliminating the dreadful problem of pollution of our inland lakes and waterways which resulted in so many fish kills last year.  The Minister proudly pointed out that he chaired a sub-committee but he omitted to tell us what the results of the work of that committee were, beyond suggesting that some surveys were carried out.  Already there have been fish kills this summer and I regret to have to say that I am certain as the summer progresses the number of fish kills will be as high as it was last year and that nothing is being done to find a remedy to that <Col N="1546" /> problem.  Promising a new Water Pollution Bill is a waste of time and in any event such a Bill would be unnecessary in view of the extensive powers which the Government and the local authorities already have under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that the Minister realises that if we are to eliminate fish kills we will have to improve dramatically the method of disposing of effluent.  In order to do this, grants will have to be made available because it will be extremely expensive to switch over to a new system.  On several occasions the Minister has spoken about the possibility of providing such grant aid under the western package &mdash; long promised but not yet delivered.  The Minister must realise that this is a nationwide problem and grant aid must be made available to farmers to encourage them to undertake this extremely expensive work.  In many cases they would be replacing systems which they put in on the technical advice of the agents and officers of the Government. It is now unreasonable to expect these farmers to spend between £10,000 and £20,000 to replace systems which they put in on the technical advice of the officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Minister will not solve this problem through promising a western package, which I presume will arrive at some stage.  He should remember that there is an Ireland outside of the west.</P>
    <P>I was baffled when the Minister said that a sum of £218 million is going to be spent on road works this year.  Even from a cursory perusal of the Estimates one will see that the Minister has reduced by 10 per cent the amount of money which will be available to the local authorities for road building, from £166 million to £150 million.  It would only take the minimum number of excursions throughout the country to bring people to realise that the road system is steadily breaking down.  When in Opposition the Minister constantly spoke about the road system and he promised that on taking office his first priority would be the elimination of potholes.  It is clear that not only have they not been eliminated but the road <Col N="1547" /> system, especially the local road system, has deteriorated sharply during the last 15 months.  In fact, I heard a story in recent weeks that farmers in west Mayo, in the Minister's own constituency, are using the potholes as watering troughs for their cattle.  Rather than the Minister claiming credit for eliminating potholes I think the appellation he has been accorded in west Mayo of &ldquo;pothole Pádraig&rdquo; is an indication of his lack of interest in this problem.</P>
    <P>We have also seen a winding down of the progressive programme for the building of new sewage treatment plants throughout the country.  As a result, the level of pollution is increasing in certain areas around the country and will increase dramatically as time goes on. There is no point in trying to encourage people to eliminate the pollutants which they discharge into the waterways when the public authorities are polluting many lakes and rivers and are unable to eliminate this pollution because of the winding down of the programme for the building of new sewage treatment plants in many parts of the country.  We had a plan to carry out that programme but it has now been dropped as has much of the road programme.  It was ironic to read during the week of the Taoiseach opening a major bridge in Limerick and the Minister for the Environment yesterday absented himself from the debate on the Housing Bill in order to open a fly-over in Cork city.  The money to complete both of those projects was provided by the previous Government and it ill behoves the present incumbents to suggest that they are carrying out improvement schemes when the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>We have also seen the housing grant scheme being would down with unfortunate applicants being hand tripped at every turn in their efforts to be paid the grants which they were promised.  It is now taking up to six months for grants to be paid to applicants which they had applied for on completion of the work. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> The Minister also referred to the construction industry, for which he is responsible, an industry which was promised a £500 million injection by the Taoiseach on assuming office.  That industry is now on its knees in a way never seen before and this can be seen clearly from the figures which I quoted yesterday during the course of my contribution on the Housing Bill.</P>
    <P>It is now some time since our late colleague and my adversary, Mr. P.J. Burke, accused the Department of the Environment of not having the price of a bag of cement.  Whatever about the veracity of that remark it is a fact that if the Department of the Environment had the price of a bag of cement they and the local authorities do not have the buckets to put the cement into.  The local government system has been brought to a standstill over the past 15 months with services being eliminated, others deteriorating and the road system breaking down.  Our lakes and waterways are increasingly becoming more polluted, our countryside and the towns are becoming more tattier and shabbier and the Minister is engaging in a series of public relations exercises in order to congratulate himself on presiding over this demolition of the local government system.  This is not good enough and it will not redound to the credit of the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In a debate like this there may be a suggestion that because of national financial constraints, the Government are hampered in doing a whole range of things which have no major financial implications or which are not about assigning major amounts of money at all.  The broad thrust of what Deputy Boland has said is accurate financially but there are other areas of legislative initiative which are essential and which would not cost this Minister or Government any money and in respect of which I believe action is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Department is entitled the Department of the Environment.  Unfortunately, much of the thinking that permeates the Department goes back to the days when it was a Department dealing <Col N="1549" /> merely with local government administration. There are specifically environmentally-orientated actions and initiatives which are vital at present if we are to make any kind of progress in protecting the slender edge we have currently in environmental terms.</P>
    <P>I regret very much to note that a recent international Protocol to freeze and reduce the use of aerosol sprays and other manufactured products which cause very serious damage to the atmosphere and which lead inevitably, as reported by experts, to a higher than heretofore incidence of skin cancers &mdash; though signed by 50 other countries, including EC states &mdash; has not yet been ratified by this Government.  Rather than lagging behind, as we so often do, we should be showing initiative in this area.  We should be showing that we are concerned about protecting our environment and the health of our citizens.  I should like to see us not just signing that Protocol, which the Minister may very well be thinking of doing, but giving a lead and banning the sale of such products.</P>
    <P>I contend the Minister should go further, requesting consumer and house-wives' associations to inform themselves sufficiently to make very careful choices in the range of products purchased so that there is not a tendency for us all to be involved in practices which are degenerative of our environment, leading to inevitable and irreversible decay.  The use of what are called chloro-fleurocarbons in this area if stopped immediately worldwide would involve a lapse of the order of 100 years &mdash; the experts tell us &mdash; in which to undo the damage already done to the protective layers of the earth's atmosphere.  That ecological abuse is echoed in a variety of other actions within our competence and jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Last year saw over 120 very serious fish kills in this country alone.  Unfortunately, before summer is properly under way, we are already on the road to similar abuse simply because we have not the courage to tackle the polluters, those engaged in environmental vandalism, and treat them in the same way as any other person <Col N="1550" /> who makes an assault on property or life should be treated, that is as a criminal. It is appalling to note the degree to which this House has been unsupportive of inspectors and local authorities in their reasonable efforts to tackle these abuses. All over this country at present there is seeping into rivers and lakes effluent and pollution of various kinds.  Indeed, the Minister's Department were unable to give me recently the names or other details of the number of local authorities engaged in disposing of untreated sewage into the seas around us.</P>
    <P>If that is the lead from a Department, self-styled the Department of the Environment, then what can we reasonably expect from the industrialist or small entrepreneur who is endeavouring to create some form of enterprise for himself or herself?  The Department must give a lead.  They must be very rigorous with all of those engaged in those actions, but they have not done so.  Not merely that there has also been the dumping of toxic waste.  I know and the Minister knows that nowhere is there a record of where those wastes are being dumped.  In various publications and literature on this topic it is evident that perhaps as much as half of such waste is being dumped, presumably furtively, in unknown locations throughout out the country.  Certainly there is no record available either of the nature of such wastes or where they are being disposed.  One can only conclude that they are being dumped in the nearest convenient location.  There is evidence already to indicate that that, too, is taking its toll in environmental terms.</P>
    <P>Staggeringly, from my point of view, earlier this year there was a survey undertaken in Cork by Cork County Council in co-operation with the farm development services of 1,100 farms embracing some 1,000 acres of land.  The outcome of that survey showed that pollution-free farms accounted for approximately one-third of those farms surveyed.  That was a survey carried out by what might be loosely called establishment bodies, not people engaged in any kind of scare-mongering or any desire for propaganda but rather <Col N="1551" /> responsible officials engaged in a scientific survey.  I must say this, if I were Minister presiding over circumstances in which arguably two-thirds of our farms had a pollution problem, I would feel deeply ashamed and would be acting immediately to do something about it.  If that is not accurate I will be pleased to be corrected by the Minister.  There is an immediate obligation on him to convince his colleagues, to ignite, in the public consciousness, a campaign of environmental awareness to ensure that people are clear on what are the implications of the constant degeneration of our environment.</P>
    <P>I could develop that theory.  Our fishermen will tell us privately of the increasing numbers of deformities in fish-life they are dredging up from the seas.  We know that the most radioactive stretch of water in the world is the Irish Sea, due to its constant pollution by Sellafield. Despite the protestations of the Minister's colleague, we are still not convinced that every rigour of the law, internationally, every opportunity for highlighting the problem, every forum available to us, has been used to ensure that the British Government realise that the constant ecological assault on this country is not acceptable.  No amount of diplomatic nice talk, no amount diplomacy, will take the place of a frontal assault on the British Government, publicly and at every opportunity, to ensure that the constant seepage and disposal of wastes from Sellafield ceases.</P>
    <P>Worse than that, it is now clear in the light of recent evidence form workers in that area, from the Greenpeace organisation &mdash; whom I had the pleasure of meeting recently &mdash; that the information on which the Irish Government base their self-assurances about conditions at Sellafield is based on nonsense, that in many cases work practices and procedures at Sellafield leave not just a great deal to be desired but, in fact, are deliberately so contrived as to maximise profits for individuals within the company to mask the real workplace practices that take place there.  Those assurances which our <Col N="1552" /> Government receive, presumably from Departmental colleagues in the British Cabinet, which presumably emanate from British Nuclear Fuels Limited &mdash; which in turn, presumably, emanate from the operations manager himself at Sellafield &mdash; are worth very little in the light of those revelations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, taking all of that together, we have a very comprehensive list, unfortunately, a very depressing jig-saw of environmental abuse.  In the wake of that I have to say that all we seem to be getting are many promises.  Indeed every page of the Minister's remarks contains a promise for future action.  What is needed to be done is clear.  I can understand there are financial constraints but in many cases it is not about finance.  For example, it does not take finance to sign international conventions, to introduce legislation, for example, to ensure that every industrial or commercial proposal put to the IDA has an attendant environmental impact statement so that the full cost to the Irish economy and society can be gauged. There are costs involved in some of those proposals and therefore, difficult choices will have to be made in that area.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that those steps which should be considered and taken are not economically or financially intensive. More than that: I was particularly perturbed recently to learn what was, for me, sinister news, that a Government Department had decided to keep to themselves the news that containers of a food product had been refused entry some two years ago by the Dutch Government because of excessive radioactive contamination, though in my book any radioactive contamination is excessive.</P>
    <P>Above all, I believe people have a right to know and to be informed.  Accordingly, it is the view of my party that there should be introduced in this House a freedom of environmental information Bill whose provisions would make available to any interested party the kind of access to the environmental impact statements to which I referred a moment ago, which would render them capable of evaluating <Col N="1553" /> the full costs of such proposals.  It is certainly wrong that a Government Department, acting on behalf of the people, decide to keep key information to themselves. I was also very disturbed to learn that the Minister's response, in terms of trying to assuage public opinion and assure people about the destination of these container loads of food product was to blithely tell them, that it had been insinuated into the animal food chain. There is, of course, no such thing as an animal food chain as distinct from the food chain.  It is very disturbing that a Minister of State in charge of food will tell the public that it is acceptable and defensible to insinuate radioactively contaminated material into the food chain. Any rightminded Government would immediately take action to ensure that that kind of educational deficiency was corrected.</P>
    <P>Underpinning this whole approach should be the need for us to make the polluter pay the full remedial costs of rectifying damage wherever possible.  It is not unreasonable and it would not cost much for the Minister to engage in urgent dialogue with RTE to ensure that where possible there will be a massive and sustained advertising campaign, at minimal outlay to the Exchequer, directed towards environmental awareness and improvement.  Surely there are few things more important than getting that view to the public.  A gentle approach, in the context of a dialogue with RTE would be helpful in that respect.</P>
    <P>Also, the Minister for Education could at no cost to the Exchequer decide that environmental awareness should be a fundamental element of the school curriculum. That could have immediate and long-term fundamental positive repercussions.</P>
    <P>Related to our concern for our ecology is the whole area of local government.  A radical reform here is necessary.  I note with interest the Minister's repeated promises to introduce a Bill.  I hope that that Bill will wipe away some of the plethora of bodies which encumber this area. I am talking about irrelevant local authorities in some cases, urban councils, <Col N="1554" /> school attendance committees, eastern regional development organisations and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but we are hoping to rectify that in the near future. We have a growing number of councillors, as Deputy Boland knows. However, we need a radical root and branch reform in local government.  We should have a small number of local regional organisations with developed power and with autonomy and greater powers than they presently have.  They should have managers or mayors who are publicly elected and accountable.  There are Ministers at the Cabinet table who have less power than some of the managers who are not directly accountable to anyone.  That is a fundamental reform which I look forward to seeing in a Bill which I hope will be before this House soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major challenge for the Minister to reshape the Department of the Environment away from the Department of Local Government administration, and to use it to launch, nationally and internationally, a campaign to awaken environmental awareness among people, and to take the necessary steps to ensure that the precious and in many cases non-replaceable environmental resources we have are protected as much as possible.  I hope the Minister will respond and tell us what he <Col N="1555" /> intends to do in those areas, especially where there is not a vast amount of money needed to bring about such a change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons he will be promoted is because of his manifest ability to cut everything and anything in front of him.  I suggest that Members should read the Minister's speech of last year on the Estimates in which he proudly boasted that the Estimates represented 10.5 per cent of GNP.  This year the Minister boasts, without reference to last year's speech, that his Estimate represents 7.7 per cent of GNP.  This Minister is willingly presiding over a massive reduction in allocations to our local authority, environmental, housing, construction and planning system.  It is not surprising therefore that the local authority system has effectively broken down and that there is a major crisis in the finances of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 15 months the Minister has been making promises in a manner that has been immortalised by Winston Churchill in the words &ldquo;never has so much been promised to so many&rdquo;, with so little result.  At present there are three Bills of the Minister's on the Order Paper.  The first Bill was promised in the Minister's Estimate speech last year a speech which, if the date were changed, would serve as well today.  By the autumn <Col N="1556" /> of last year the Minister promised a housing Bill.  We got a first run at it yesterday, when the Minister was down in Cork.</P>

      <P>If the Minister had come forward a bit sooner there would have been enough time.  A very good Bill was on the Minister's desk when he came into the Department of the Environment and it was not brought forward, although there have been few changes made since the Minister got the Bill.  Now that the Bill is finally here the first thing the Minister wants to do is to restrict debate. For the interest of Deputy Ahern, the proposal is that all stages will be taken by next Thursday, and this relates to a major social measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to local authority houses, that marvellous script writer, who should really take a career break and work with &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;, talks about the fact that for the first time 4,500 households will be offered local authority accommodation.  However only 1,600 of them will actually get into local authority houses.  Decoded, what that means is that, whereas previously as far as records go back we were providing 5,000 local authority dwellings, this marvellous Minister for the Environment in presenting this Estimate is announcing 1,600 dwellings in a sort of reverse thrust. I do not know what the Gaelic opposite to <i>Glasnost</i> is, but this is a sort of murky looking glass and through that murky looking glass we are being told that local authority completions in 1988 will be <Col N="1557" /> 1,600.  That is, if I have correctly interpreted the &ldquo;Gaelnost&rdquo; implicit in the speechifying of this Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues in Opposition made great noises in the direction of the construction industry, and well they might because the construction industry made out great cheques in the direction of Fianna Fáil in Opposition.  With a great fanfare last year a construction industry committee was set up and the Minister in his speech last year referred to it as being a highpowered committee.  It was high-powered in more ways than one, because the chairman was Mr. Robin Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the contribution of this committee other than getting section 23, applied indiscriminately across the country, reintroduced &mdash; a measure which I welcome.  Nothing else has come from this committee.  The Minister referred to it in his speech but there is no tangible evidence of any concrete proposal coming from that committee which has been so identified and labelled on the floor of this House and yet we are being asked to pay £40,000.  This is £40,000 for a committee which as far as I can see, has delivered little or nothing.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to illuminate what precisely it has delivered.  I should like to say to him that any local authority &mdash; even those which Deputy Keating wants to abolish &mdash; could happily do with the miserably small amount of £40,000.  I think that that was a sop to the building industry at the time.  It is quite clear now that Fianna Fáil in Government have been converted to the economic logic and the economic observation which they consistently and persistently rejected over the last four and a half years that construction demand was a function of economic demand within our economy and that it could not be artificially stimulated. During the last time it was artificially stimulated in 1977-79 &mdash; as Deputy Flynn will recall &mdash; the construction industry was grossly distorted and seriously undermined as a consequence. At least in Government the Minister has finally arrived at the end of the road to Damascus although the <Col N="1558" /> meanderings which he took along the route in the last four and a half years were quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>We have been promised a national roads authority.  With the assistance of the public relations people we have been promised miles and miles of a national roads authority.  The frequency with which that announcement has been repeated would give the impression that this body was permanently up and running and was in the business of constructing miles and miles of roads.  As recently as 12 weeks ago the Minister told the committee of the General Council of County Councils that within six weeks the details of the national roads authority would be announced.  We are now told in his speech today that it has finally been agreed by his colleagues in Government but he has not indicated whether legislation is required.</P>
    <P>I have no problem in regard to the establishment of this body provided local authorities retain the power to determine the alignment of a particular road because the engineering and construction lobbies desperately want &mdash; and have desperately wanted in the city of Dublin since 1971 &mdash; to construct an eastern bypass along the route from Merrion Gates across through East Wall and up to Santry, despite repeated democratic rejections by council after council and councillors group after councillor group. Instead we have asked for &mdash; and I am glad to see that the Minister is making finance available &mdash; the keeping of the commitment which was entered into by the previous Administration to build a western bypass which would link both sides of the city, east and west, and which, being built on firm ground, would cost far less than the construction of an eastern bypass.  This may or may not be the appropriate occasion but in the context of announcing the establishment of a national roads authority &mdash; and I can see great merit in an NRA &mdash; the alignment and location of a road should remain vested at the local level.  That is where the impact affects most of the people involved.  That was promised last year and frequently during the year but <Col N="1559" /> not yet delivered and we now understand that it is cleared with the Minister's colleagues. However, we do not know whether legislation is coterminous or conditional upon it being established.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech devoted much time and energy to the question of the environment.  He started off with local authority finance and as Deputy Boland said we have had three or four balloons launched courageously up into the air and on some occasions the unfortunate Minister of State at the Department of the Environment did not have the wit or the temerity to let go the balloon and was in mid flight when they were eventually shot down.</P>

The Minister has not, even at this stage, given it the <i>coup de grace</i> as they still reside in St. Martin's House.  The environmental research unit was announced in December and yet not one single person is on the payroll of the environmental research unit.  Nobody in An Foras Forbartha on this 3 June 1988 knows to whom they are working, upon what projects they are working and what they are doing.  What they do know is that they should not talk to anybody.  We also know, through the chair to Deputy Keating, that environmental information is something which the public will never get from the environmental research unit.</P>

    <P>This is a sad Estimate from a Minister <Col N="1561" /> whose promises can no longer be taken seriously.

It was ironic that when I got home last evening I opened my post and found a bundle of letters from the Simon Community in Dundalk berating the Dáil in general for the lack of progress in relation to a housing Bill.  I decided to put pen to paper and reply there and then because I felt so strongly.  I refer to the fact that while the Government and I wanted to get this Bill passed as soon as possible a number of other Deputies in the House did not see that and chose to speak at length.

      <P>Any of our frequent visitors in the public gallery will have seen the type of Coalition we had in the four and a half years prior to this Government coming into power.  Yesterday two people from the parties to the Coalition adopted completely different attitudes to the Housing Bill.  Deputy Boland agreed more or less with the thrust of the Bill and Deputy Quinn went the other way and said it was not a Bill at all.  I say to Deputy Quinn they had a 1985 Bill and nothing was done about it in two years <Col N="1562" /> until February 1987 when this Government came into power.  I wonder why they talk about rushing through Bills or getting housing Bills passed.  It took them two years to bring their Bill forward and even then they did not get their chance to have it debated.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week we had an unseemly dispute between two former Coalition Ministers on the Courts Bill, each adopting a different approach.  I know, Sir, that I am digressing and I hope you will permit me to do so.  I am making the point that that was the type of Government we had before this Government came into power.  Deputy Quinn and the other speakers are slightly unfair in saying this Minister is responsible for the local authority system as it is at the moment.  Generally the problems were created while they were in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming back to local authority finance, the Minister said he is bringing forward proposals in relation to this and I agree that the sooner this is brought forward the better because my local authority have been £4 million in <Col N="1563" /> the red over the last six or seven years. It has a cumulative effect.  We had a three-day working week for the outdoor staff there in the last month or so, but thanks to the Minister for the Environment who made a special grant to the local authority, we are now back on full time.  How long that will last I do not know, but because of the good offices of the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State Louth County Council are now back on full-time work, and long may it last.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, in County Louth in particular, the county council are sandwiched between two very powerful and fairly well off local authorities, Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk UDC.  The problem is that Louth County Council, for a number of reasons, have been denuded of their financial base and have absolutely no way of collecting money other than in service charges, the rate support grant and moneys from Central Government.  The urban authorities have a tremendous base by which to collect money.  The Minister will have to address this.  I have no doubt it is happening all over the country, but it is most apparent in my county because of the two large urban areas on either side of the rural areas represented by Louth County Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the national roads authority and a blueprint for road development.  This again is something we all welcome because, as the Minister knows well, in my constituency there is a great deal of agitation regarding various road schemes.  County Louth is the gateway to this country in that the vast majority of traffic coming from the Six Counties comes through my constituency. We have the highest proportion per head of population of national roads.  The blueprint and the roads authority will be welcome if and when they come forward, which I understand is to be later in the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of county roads is close to the hearts of all people on local authorities. I have to welcome the fact that the Government each year in the last two <Col N="1564" /> years have reallocated £15 million to the strengthening of county roads.  The vast majority of our population are traversing these day in and day out.  There are bad stretches on some of our roads but generally not as bad as some commentators make them out to be.  For instance, on the Dunleer to Collon road we had a major problem in the last year or so. Quite a number of people from outside the constituency wrote to me pointing out that this road was so bad and they did not realise the cutbacks were going so far.  I had to point out to them that it was not the cutbacks, it was the fact that the roads were put down just after it had rained and just did not hold.  Again, the Department, through the good offices of the Minister, made a grant of £69,000 available so that that road could be repaired. I travelled along it today and an excellent job has been done there.  I thank the Minister for making that allocation to us.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned planning, and I feel particularly strong about this.  We have heard a great deal about reform needed in compensation.  That has to happen, but the Minister should address his mind to the fact that because of the time limits written into the 1963 legislation and the amending legislation of 1976 some local authorities can hold up planning applications for ages.  This is not in the interest of development or job creation.  The Minister should look at it to see if anything can be done to put an onus on local authorities or other allied agencies to respond to various queries. We know all about additional information and how that delays the response and the planning application.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which I feel very strongly is mortgage finance.  I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Boland, for the building society regulations he brought in shortly before his exit from office.  They were excellent regulations.  Unfortunately, while they may be in place the various agencies are doing their level best to try to get around the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken up this matter <Col N="1565" /> with my Minister on more than one occasion.  As a solicitor, I know only too well that these regulations endeavoured to do away with a third solicitor in conveyancing transactions.  That has not happened and something will have to be done urgently about it.  Extra unneeded expense is being occasioned for someone buying a house and taking out a mortgage. The Minister will have to look at this.</P>
      <P>Another matter regarding the building society regulations is the question of insurance.  Some building societies have been getting away with blue murder.  The regulations provided that if borrowers wanted to use their own insurance company they were entitled to do so, but I have seen circulars from a number of building societies and in one there were about 17 conditions the persons had to comply with before the society would agree to allow them to use their own insurance company.  A number of these cases have been referred to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the sooner some action is taken the better.  I should like to ask the Minister to use his good offices in regard to this because the regulations are being flouted and that is not right.  We should remember that the regulations, which were prepared by the Department of the Environment, were adopted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on the Housing Bill next week I hope to deal with the plight of travelling people.  On behalf of the people of Dundalk I should like to thank the Minister, and his predecessor, for allocating money to Dundalk UDC to erect a halting site in the town.  In my view it is one of the best halting sites in the country.  The facility was recently opened by Cardinal Ó Fiaich and I advise Deputies who are interested in the plight of the travelling people to make a trip to the town to view it.  I have no doubt they will be impressed.  Next week a scheme of ten sheltered houses for travelling people will be opened by Cardinal Ó Fiaich &mdash; he is a frequent visitor to our county &mdash; and that scheme received a 100 per cent subsidy from the Department of the Environment.  I should like to thank the <Col N="1566" /> Minister for his help on that scheme.  For many years that plan gathered dust in the Department of the Environment and we are grateful to the Minister for dusting off the cobwebs and proceeding with it.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister and the Government for bringing forward the tenant purchase scheme.  There has been a tremendous response in my county to the scheme.  The Minister will have to put an onus on local authorities to ensure that they adhere to the phrase, &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  In my view if some local authorities get their way they will inflate prices to such an extent that the scheme will be beyond the reach of many people. I accept that the Minister is anxious that the scheme be availed of and I should like to impress upon him the importance of ensuring that local authorities do not put inflated prices on their houses.  In my home town of Dundalk it appears the local authority are putting an inflated price on some houses.  We will have to take up the matter with the officials and try to get them to see the light.  I will deal with it in detail next week.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in the past year.  He has done an excellent job with the resources available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party, I should like to make a number of comments on this Estimate. Many points can be made on this Estimate but with so little time available I will only be able to headline the concerns of The Workers' Party in regard to the programme of dismantlement of local authority administration.  As a member of Dublin City Council, the premier local authority, I am concerned about the way the Government, in mimicking the Government across the water, are systematically moving to dismantle local authorities in all their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that Fianna Fáil are bent on centralising power and administration in the hands of the mandarins in Government to the exclusion of the operations and power of local authorities.  This process was set in train in 1977 in the disastrous manifesto which proposed the <Col N="1567" /> abolition of any local capacity to raise finance.  We have witnessed a slow bleeding process since.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council went within an ace of rejecting the budget imposed by the Minister when it was considered at the estimates meeting in January.  We were tricked on that occasion by three so-called community councillors who abstained from voting on the basis of a promise made to them by Fianna Fáil members of the city council.  That promise, to bring in outside monitoring in the form of advisers, has not been delivered. After the crucial vote was taken the Fianna Fáil members were asked when this would happen and they replied that it was not budgeted for in the current year.  I should like to issue a clear warning to the Minister that Dublin City Council will not tolerate the same type of unilateral cutback in funding in the current year.  The city council will tell him they will not accept those cutbacks.  They will demand a level of funding in accordance with the taxation paid by the people of the city to central Government on the understanding that it will be passed on to the local authority to ensure that there are proper services.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government, particularly in regard to water charges and so on, is not acceptable.  Fianna Fáil undertook to repeal the relevant legislation and abolish service charges.  In the local election of 1985 they agreed with the basic premise that local services and water charges represented a double tax on working people and they agreed to abolish that legislation when returned to Government.  Where does the Minister stand in regard to that promise?  Another matter that concerns us is the rate of job losses at local authority level.  It is horrendous. We often forget the extent of job losses when we are debating the cuts in services.  I understand that 800 jobs have been or must be shed in Dublin by the corporation over a two-year period.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government have not sanctioned any house building in Dublin in the current year means that one of the most expert teams in Europe, assembled <Col N="1568" /> over decades by Dublin Corporation, is being dismantled.  Officials are demoralised and their departure will be a loss to the corporation.  It is unlikely that we will be able to replace them.  It will take us decades to build up such a team again. Their work has been applauded throughout Europe but because of the narrowminded and short-sighted approach of the Government they are being let go.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to give adequate funds to local authorities he should look at the <i>ultra vires</i> rule which makes it impossible for local authorities to engage in enterprising projects.  Local authorities could adopt many schemes to raise finance, create jobs and make them more relevant but they cannot because under the law they are prohibited from engaging in outside financial activities.  A classic example of this was the prospect of Dublin City Council getting involved in waste disposal for Leinster as a business enterprise.  That was a missed opportunity. I hope the Minister gives serious consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed concern about the pollution of Dublin Bay and the Irish Sea and I welcome that.  The people of Dublin will applaud him for his initiatives in regard to that problem but a very disturbing fact emerged during Question Time yesterday.  It appears, from a reply by the Minister for the Marine, that the only aspect of the problem being addressed was sludge dumping off Howth Head.  I should like to remind the Minister that Dublin City Council, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council are dumping raw untreated sewage at a horrendous rate into Dublin Bay and its environs.  The Government in their concern for a clean environment must put a stop to the practice of dumping raw sewage into any of our waters.  When one considers that substantial funding for such projects is available from the EC, it is unbelievable that we have been so slow in getting on with the job.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council will be hosting in October a major conference on the management of the Irish Sea.  I hope the <Col N="1569" /> Government will make a major contribution in working towards an intergovernmental scheme of management for the Irish Sea, along the lines of the North Sea Conference.  This is something we hope will emerge from our conference in this Millennium year.</P>
    <P>The fish kills are starting again due to pollution and there have been two major incidents this week.  I should like to hear the Minister's respose to the recent IFA proposals which seem to indicate that the farming community are not prepared to do anything about this until they get massive Government grant aid.  The second proposal from the IFA is that the Government should go easy in implementing the law.  They want the law suspended and they continue to break it on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>I have written a submission to the Minister regarding the house purchase scheme, pointing out the very grave disparities between the 1986 scheme and the 1988 scheme.  Those who are in the business of selling local authority houses welcome the new scheme, but The Workers' Party have grave reservations about selling off these houses.  Major disparities and inequities are developing between the three schemes now in operation. People who opted for the 1986 scheme are paying double the amount being paid by their next door neighbours under the 1988 scheme.  I know there must be a start up date and an end date, but something must be done to alleviate the sense of injustice being felt by people who responded earlier on more unfavourable conditions.  There must be some amelioration.</P>
    <P>I refer to the road project for the Grange Abbey area of my constituency. This scheme has been standing for almost 20 years but the local authority cannot get funding to finish the roads.  There is no point in building highways while leaving housing schemes unfinished for lack of very small sums of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about his care and concern for travellers.  Dublin Corporation have a scheme with the Minister for the past 18 months for the housing of nine travelling families at Grove Lane.  I <Col N="1570" /> understood that everybody wanted the scheme but I am beginning to think a little differently about the attitude of the local Fianna Fáil representatives. Despite the Minister's espousal of the cause of housing travellers, he has merely given permission to build the perimeter wall.  I am at a loss to understand what is going on.  The housing of travellers cannot be linked to the overall housing programme of the local authority in an area as big as Dublin.  It is a vast problem. Surveys are being prepared on the housing needs of Dublin but the specific needs of travellers must be taken in isolation.  I would urge the Minister to look at the Grove Lane scheme and not to leave it lying any longer in his Department.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the problem of local authority-owned ground rents.  The Minister has a function in this area.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, promised the 750 householders in the Donaghmede area of my constituency that this problem was being considered by a sub-committee of the Cabinet.  I have yet to find out the membership of that committee or whether it even exists. There is no reason the Government cannot introduce legislation to abolish ground rents owned by local authorities. I understood the matter was being looked at.  Has the Minister a role in the area and has anything been done?</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to reform the planning laws and the obligation to pay compensation.  This is a major problem which has an incredible impact on financially troubled local authorities.  They are being held to ransom by developers and planning permissions for schemes which are not deserving are being bludgeoned through because of the threat of compensation claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the laughable suggestion that the construction industry is of particular concern to him and to the Government.  It is one of the great myths that Fianna Fáil are the friends of the builders.  They have not sanctioned one local authority house this year in the area which has the single biggest concentration of people, namely, Dublin city <Col N="1571" /> and county.  I cannot see how the Government propose to deal with the emerging housing problem in the city area.  How can they suggest they are doing anything to solve this problem or to encourage the building industry while maintaining an absolute embargo on funding for local authority housing?  This matter will have to be addressed by the Minister or his successor &mdash; I am not privy to Deputy Quinn's information that the Minister is moving to a different office.  If housing in the Dublin area is not put back onstream and if the expertise in the local authorities is not retained, we will be faced with a housing crisis and will be forced to consider the kind of schemes we had in the sixties to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons and all the problems unaddressed by the Minister, and especially because of his attack on the existence of local authorities, The Workers' Party will not be supporting this Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's record of misrepresenting things in this House is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused at any suggestion from The Workers' Party that I misrepresent anything.  Several speakers have touched on a number of the issues I intended to take up, particularly the tenant purchase scheme.  The 1988 tenant purchase scheme is undoubtedly one of the most imaginative schemes that has ever been introduced.  I have already congratulated the Minister on it and I do so <Col N="1572" /> again now.  I agree with the last speaker that there are disparities beginning to show between the 1988 and the 1986 schemes.  That is an indictment of the Minister who introduced the 1986 scheme and it indicates how progressive the current Minister has been in the most recent scheme.  Notwithstanding that, the matter needs to be examined because people are buying local authority houses next door to each other which are identical in value, but one party are making considerably higher repayments.</P>
      <P>The 1988 scheme is very welcome but I have some problems with the way the scheme is being implemented at local authority level.  I would urge the Minister to address these problems.  For example, in the county council housing area in County Wicklow, 600 indications of interest in the scheme have been received to date from council tenants.  The council have adopted the approach of using their own engineering staff to draw up valuations and, as a result, 300 notices of valuations have issued.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Ahern, I am not happy with this approach to valuation.  Current market valuation is relatively easily established in any housing authority area. There are very few housing estates where the ordinary individual house owner or house renter would not be able to give a good estimate of the current market valuation.  It is not necessary for local authorities to set up some sort of bureaucratic function to establish current market valuation.  It will undoubtedly impede the take-up of the scheme if this is allowed to progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I am fearful that some of the valuations that are being produced &mdash; I am not speaking about my own local authority alone but I have heard this from discussions with other Deputies &mdash; are undoubtedly inflated and that will inhibit people's enthusiasm for the scheme and their take-up of the scheme.  I know that Deputies from all sides of the House have approached the Minister on this issue.  I suggest to him that it would be worth his Department's while to urge the local authorities to speed up the process of valuation, to make valuations for all <Col N="1573" /> local authority houses automatically available so that tenants will not have to come looking for them.  In that way tenants can see what sort of deal they can get under the 1988 scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme is a very valuable one.  It is generally welcomed in this House.  It is seen as progressive.  It will not cause the problem caused by the first-time buyer grants which were introduced by the previous Minister in the last regime, that of denuding local authority housing estates of the most progressive elements in those estates.  It is a welcome scheme but disparities are beginning to show, particularly the disparity in regard to people who are purchasing houses under the 1986 scheme.  I would also urge the Minister and his Department to address the problem of local authorities taking their time in drawing up valuations.</P>
    <P>The question of roads has been addressed by a number of speakers.  I was amused when listening to Deputy Boland's contribution when he was at his normal vitriolic best.  He was speaking about the Minister and gave him the title &ldquo;pothole Pádraig&rdquo;.  I suppose the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is a big enough man to take that on his shoulders.  He has taken many other appellations and he arises smiling from them all.  When I look at the record when Deputy Boland was in office it brings a wry smile to my face. When the Department of the Environment were in Deputy Boland's tender mercies they gave the magnificent sum of £5 million to road stengthening and repairs.  Last year the Minister, Deputy Flynn, assigned £15 million to those purposes and this year he is assigning a similar amount.  He was given the name &ldquo;pothole Pádraig&rdquo; or whatever name Deputy Boland chose to call him.  Parliamentary rules and procedures here, plus a stern up-bringing, prevent me from putting on the record what motorists said about Deputy Boland during his period in the Custom House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not.  I have been in enough trouble as regards parliamentary <Col N="1574" /> language on other occasions.  On the general issue of housing, there has been much craw-thumping about the housing starts.  I would be the first to admit that the question of housing starts is an important one.  At present we are in a transitional period with regard to housing. The best way of helping the building and construction industry is not the way suggested by Deputy McCartan, of building more houses to stand idle.  In many local authorities there are houses idle and that is an indication of where housing policy went wrong.  In the past two years, as in this year, there has been a welcome increase in moneys allocated for important elements of the housing schemes such as the housing refurbishment scheme.  I would like to extend my personal gratitude and the gratitude of the constituents in Bray, Greystones and Kilmacanogue to the this Minister for his very far-sighted approach with regard to funding of the refurbishment schemes.</P>
      <P>A major housing problem in my area has been with what are sometimes called the Bobby Molloy houses.  In the last couple of years there has not been any real commitment to the refurbishment schemes.  Last year Deputy Ger Connolly came to Bray at my request and had a look at the scheme there.  He almost doubled the amount of money put into that scheme.  I thank the Minister for the £700,000 which was allocated last year to refurbishment of houses in Bray and the £450,000 which has been allocated so far this year.  It is very welcome.  Any Deputy who cares to travel along the Boghall road and look at the Oldcourt scheme will see that the direct labour scheme employed there by the local authority has produced great value for money.  I hope the Minister can squeeze a few extra shillings for that scheme this year.  I have already gone to him with the begging bowl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme at Kilmacanogue is a credit to the Minister and to Wicklow County Council.  Houses which were literally falling down &mdash; it was a mistake to build them in the first place &mdash; have now been converted into first-class modern homes.  I would like to thank the Minister <Col N="1575" /> in particular for the additional £200,000 which he allocated, in spite of straitened circumstances, for the completion of the refurbishment scheme at Kindlestown Park.  That was the flag-bearer of refurbishment schemes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland raised a point about housing starts which was picked up by another Deputy.  I am not sure that simply building three-bedroomed, semidetached houses such as we have been doing up to now is the right way to provide for the current housing need.  We need to re-examine the whole thrust and direction of housing starts and the present situation allows us the opportunity to do that.  I would like to see more money going towards small family units.  There is not enough money being allocated to that area.  I will take this opportunity of reminding the Minister that I am still going around with the begging bowl for Fáilte Park in Bray.  We should be putting more money into small family units.  Most Deputies probably have experience of an increased demand in that area.</P>
    <P>The major thrust in the discussions has been the thorny issue of local government finance and financial reform.  This is one of the most jaded issues in political life. The Minister in his contribution pointed out that half of all local government funds this year have come from central Government. That is slightly down on what it was in the recent past but it is still far too high.  There should be a system of local funds available to local authorities.  With the benefit of hindsight many of us would regard decisions taken a decade ago as being the wrong ones.  We would all agree that the present system of local finance is wrong and unhealthy.  At present substantially more than half of central Government money is passed on to local government in the form of specific grants. This ties the hands of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The best way to pass funds from central Government to local authorities is to allocate it in block and let the local authorities, which are after all democratically responsible in their own areas, determine <Col N="1576" /> how the money is spent.  One of the problems with the current system of transferring money from central Government to local government is that it requires a degree of supervision and examination and a whole bureaucratic structure which does not contribute anything.  If the taxpayers are going to have moneys taken from them to be passed to local authorities it is wrong that that money should be wasted in arid transfers in the deserts of administration in central Government or at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The means by which we transfer funds from central Government to local government is not the real issue in the whole area of reform of local finance. When listening to contributions from people like Deputy Quinn you would think they had lived on the far side of the moon for the past 25 years.  It strikes me they have not had even the most passing, minuscule interest in the operation of the local government finance system.  I am not allowed to call anybody a liar in this House but to see the financial crisis of local government being laid at events in 1977-1978 is twisting the truth in an extraordinary way.</P>
    <P>The facts are that problems began to emerge with local government finance in the early fifties.  As far back as 1949 papers were being circulated in the Administration about a potential crisis in local government finance and throughout the fifties this was the subject of a reasonably heated debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the subject of debate throughout the sixties.  In 1961 two ESRI reports were produced on this subject.  From 1965 to 1969 there were not fewer than four separate reports produced by interdepartmental committees arguing that we had a wrong valuation system.  Everybody accepted that the valuation system was daft and Justice Barrington found it to be unconstitutional. Those reports found that the remissions and exemptions system had got out of <Col N="1577" /> hand and everybody accepted that.  The argument was made that the grant system was wrong and that we needed to look at alternative systems of local finance.</P>
      <P>The contents of those four reports from the interdepartmental committees and the two ESRI reports were condensed in the White Paper of 1972.  I would be the first to admit that the White Paper produced by the then Fianna Fáil Government was hardly what we would call a radical step forward in local government. It was lambasted by Fine Gael and by Labour.  They went out and beat the Lambeg drums on the streets of Dublin and Bray to the point where the two local authorities fell on their swords and committed hari-kari.  The local authorities were dissolved, commissioners were put in and local government went into a downward spiral in both areas.  That is an historical fact.</P>
      <P>The White Paper proposals, modest as they were in 1972, were thrown out in the general election of 1973.  The Coalition emerging at that time decided there were fruits to be plucked from toying with the rates: Deputy Kelly was around at that time and he knows what I am saying is the truth.  The first Dutch auction on the rates occurred in 1973, offered to an electorate who were already screaming that the local government finance system was wrong, and rightly so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the first of many offerings, and rightly so.  Thankfully, that day in politics has gone.  Between 1973 and 1977 the Coalition made a marvellous contribution towards local finance. Rather than have the guts to take the decisions which everybody knew needed to be taken, what did they do?  They went to the ESRI and commissioned another report, the Copeland Walshe Report. That report was produced for the Coalition Cabinet in July or August 1976 and the Cabinet record shows it was discussed <Col N="1578" /> in 1976.  The facts are the Coalition shirked their responsibility in this area.  Like cowards they shied away from it because Copeland Walshe said a property tax was needed.  Copeland Walshe gave advice but they chose to ignore it.  That is a fact.</P>
      <P>In the first Cabinet meeting in September 1976 what did these brave people who are so interested in local finance do? They decided to duck the issue again. They decided it was about time they washed their hands and walked away from the rates.  The interesting fact is that there is a Cabinet decision dated 1976 to abort the rates.  That proposal was offered to the electorate in 1977.  They accepted it and in 1978 domestic rates were abolished.  I would accept the argument, with the benefit of ten years hindsight, that that was probably not the right decision, but the cowardice we have seen since then and the continuous hypocrisy which is trotted out here is an irritation to me and to anybody who is interested in local finance.  This bluster, avoidance of blame and the passing of blame downgrades politics.  All we need to do is to make decisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that decisions are to be taken shortly.  I have confidence that he will take these decisions.  I hope the people on the benches opposite, who sometimes crawthump about local government, will have the courage of their convictions and support this Minister when he takes his decisions.  He has my confidence and the confidence of anybody who cares about local government.</P>

I will resist, however, the temptation to take him back over the years 1973 onwards and remind him of three-quarters of the very comical history he has forgotten.  That would take me more time, by the time I had embroidered it, than I will be allowed for my whole speech.  I will leave that for another occasion but I will not forget it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> The Department under consideration today has as one of its charges something which has very little to do with the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in its ordinary acceptance. Newer Deputies might be puzzled when they hear me say that the Department of the Environment was rechristened for an old reason.  A very new, beardless Deputy might be inclined to ask what was the reason, and I would have to remind him that the English rechristened their Department the Department of the Environment and Pat had to do so as well.  He did not think he would be taken seriously by his colleagues abroad unless he, too, had a Department of the Environment with a Minister and a couple of parliamentary secretaries.</P>
    <P>Oddly enough the Department of the Environment still occupies the same old lino-covered corridors, the same people pushing the same pens on the same files, carrying out very much the same range of functions as before.  There is just a change of letterhead and an excuse for a new logo, otherwise no change.  The old Department of Local Government were responsible for the election law, and are still responsible for it.  There is a reference in the Estimates to electoral expenses and, therefore, I hope the House will allow me to say a few words about that.</P>
    <P>It is only about ten days or less since I heard Deputy Quinn imply during Question Time that he hoped any electoral amendment which the new census might make necessary would involve an increase in Dáil numbers to bring the number of Deputies up to the maximum constitutional number, which is one for 20,000 of the population.  Deputy Quinn also said he thought it had always been the rule to increase the Dáil in step with the population in the ratio of one to 20,000.  Deputy Quinn is wrong.  He was a member of a Government which rightly resisted the suggestion that such a move should be made.  In the 1980 Electoral Act provision was made for the return to the next Dáil of 166 Deputies.  In the 1983 Act &mdash; there having been an intervening census, the broad results of which were <Col N="1580" /> known &mdash; although the population had grown to an extent which would have justified a further four seats, the then Government &mdash; and Deputy Boland was in the seat now occupied by the Minister &mdash; resisted the temptation that the number should be increased and it remained somewhat below the constitutional maximum.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing on which the general public seem to be agreed &mdash; I admit it is simply a Pavlovian reflex of hostility towards politicians, and I have to accept my share of the blame if that exists &mdash; no matter what their political or partisan sympathies may be, it is that there are enough Deputies and we do not need any more.  I share that opinion.  It is non-sensical to talk about cutting the number in half.  A good reason for not doing so was given many years ago by the late Seán Lemass when he said, quite rightly, that assuming the House is roughly divided down the middle, a Government can count on only about half the Members of the House, and they must be able to recruit a presentable front bench team and a second row team.  The latter were not as numerous in those days as they are now, they are as numerous as a nest of mice and you cannot really see them because they are running in and out so fast, and their posts are just as redundant and as useless to the economy.</P>
    <P>At least 15, or 16, or perhaps even 20, presentable officeholders have to be found and it is not easy to do that in a small House where many people, for reasons of their age, capacity or lack of it, or business commitments, or whatever, or the fact that they are geographically bunched too close together, do not offer a Taoiseach a sufficiently wide choice.  There must be a certain minimum level in the Dáil and I would think that for that reason the number could not go much below 150.  Something like that is the number at which we should aim.  It certainly should not be allowed to balloon merely because the population has increased.  Constitutionally, the number could go down to as low as about 110 but I think that about 150 is right.  I hope that this Government will do what <Col N="1581" /> the last one did, which is to resist any temptation to increase the number.</P>
    <P>The Estimates contain a reference to the cost of conducting elections.  I should like to say a few words about the system of holding national elections here and of the expense attached to them.  The expense of a national poll nowadays&mdash;&mdash; the Minister will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;&mdash;is approaching £3 million, no matter what the issue is, whether a referendum, a Dáil election, or anything else.  It may be that there are minimal differences in the cost as between a referendum and a Dáil election, no doubt the count does not take so long and probably is not as expensive from that point of view, but all the other expenses, payment of the returning officers and staff, Garda overtime and so on tot up, every time we hold a national poll, to about £3 million.  That is not chickenfeed.  We ought not to despise money like that.  We should try to economise on these outings.  We had a terrible rash of them over the last five or six years, more than we needed.</P>
    <P>There is also the disruption of the school week which the holding of polls in the middle of the week, on a Wednesday or Thursday, causes.  I know perfectly well that sooner or later we will get around to having national polls at weekends, on Saturdays or Sundays, but that day will not come until the British do it.  As soon as they do it, there will be somebody in here within a week asking why could we not have legislation of the same kind.  Since the people across the water are seen now to have satisfied themselves that the reasons for it are not good, we too must do the same thing, although the reasons that speak in favour of that change now are just as visible, as loud and as cogent for us at this moment as they would be across the water.  We should make that change now.  There are very few Sabbatarians left in the country so strict that they should imagine that exercising their political duty in the shape of putting a ballot paper in a box would breach proper observance of the Lord's Day.  Although I respect anybody's opinion, no matter how much in the minority it is, there is a limit beyond which <Col N="1582" /> minorities' susceptibilities ought not to be a bar to what most of us would regard as a rational reform.  It may be that the implications of a financial kind are greater than I have taken into account, possibly overtime problems would be greater at a weekend than during the week.  Admittedly, I have not reckoned that up.  It may also be that a day would be required on either side of the polling day for cleaning the place up.  I cannot believe that it really takes 72 hours, not just the polling day itself, but the day before and the day after, to rearrange the school desks and sweep the place.  It could be done far faster than that.  A poll could be held on a Saturday or Sunday and the children could still have their schoolday up to ordinary closing time on Friday and be there again on Monday morning.  It is not beyond human wit or capacity.  Just because a different system still obtains across the water is no reason why we should not make the change, at least experimentally.  If it turns out to be a disaster, we can go back to the old system and I shall not have any further complaints about it.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister present has no departmental responsibility for this except in the organisational sense, and I do not want to get on to a large subject of a kind which will make me regret having embarked on it, but the Irish Presidency is an office so purely ceremonial, almost entirely so, and representative &mdash; as they say on the Continent &mdash; and so little concerned with the day-to-day making of State policy, that the full panoply of a national poll is not justified for the election of a President.  I would like this, or any other, Minister who is anxious to save a few pounds and produce a more rational system, to study what the President does.  I am not, needless to say, talking about the present incumbent, or any past one, but about the Presidency as an office.  He should ask what are the real, independent functions of that office and how often they are exercised, how important it is that for these very marginal and very rarely exercised functions the full panoply of a national poll should be resorted to?  He might also ponder <Col N="1583" /> whether seven years is the appropriate time.  I feel that the Chair is going to tell me that I am straying off the Department of the Environment and that is true, but I do think that it is an office so devoid of serious content for the holder that anybody who has ever occupied the office must have been heartily bored by it.  I would think that two or three years would be a sufficiently long term and that the office, which is of marginal importance in the running of the State, important though it is ceremonially, and representatively, could easily be filled by a simpler selection, perhaps by the Council of State.</P>

If we are again having a referendum, it might be that whatever Government is in charge would think to look at this system and ask whether we might have a more rational and cheaper Presidency by making the change which I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to local government reform, a couple of speakers here have mentioned the lack of it.  One of the failures of the previous Government was in this very regard.  The previous Government promised local government reform when they were returned to office at the end of 1982 and the only reform that we actually saw was a redivision of the Dublin council system, a large expansion of the number of persons entitled to wear gowns and call themselves councillor or alderman and so on in the city of Dublin and the uptitling of the chief citizen of the city of Galway to lord mayor &mdash;&mdash; this, mind you, in a republic.  Mayor was not good enough, it had to be lord mayor.  The grand old Saxon title of alderman is <Col N="1584" /> respected just as much west of the Shannon as it is over here, more so if anything. That was the only reform that we saw.</P>
    <P>I consider the whole structure of local government here as scandalous and an anachronism.  We have dozens of councillors running up expenses of all kinds, attending meetings, their own and committee meetings, going on trips, making decisions, or appearing to make decisions, which for the most part could be far more simply and easily made in some other way, and having no responsibility with regard to raising finances for their own operations, or only minimal responsibility.  I heard Deputy Roche saying a moment ago, if I understood him correctly, that block grants to local authorities should be administered at the pure discretion of the elected representatives who are democratic representatives. He said something like that. That is not democracy &mdash; to be elected to a position for which you receive only the benefits.  It is not democratic to be put in a position purely to dispense favours or benefits.  What is democratic is to dispense the benefits after you have endured the odium of collecting the wherewithal to pay for them.  When I find the councillors, who are now so good at speaking up for their own privileges and their own character as democratic representatives, also insisting on being themselves permitted to have the privilege of imposing and collecting taxation, then I will take seriously the claim that they are a democratic structure.  At present, they are an expensive farce.</P>
    <P>Courage seems to elicit such great admiration on the Fianna Fáil benches today, where they are all talking about guts, that I would like the Minister to have the courage to wrap up the whole lot and see whether the system could be replaced by a system of genuine local government, whereby people would be elected with no expenses, no attendance at redundant meetings, no nomination to boards when they can have scarcely anything more than a decorational function, but to have a responsibility for the economic development of their own district. If this or any other Minister is <Col N="1585" /> anxious to have my detailed opinions on this, I have submitted them to two Governments of my own colour in one shape or form.  I have lost all partisan feeling in regard to this matter which seems to be so scandalous.  I would gladly make whatever thoughts I have on the subject available to a Fianna Fáil Government, as well as to any other sort. Certainly, the local government system which we have here, and which was wished on us by the British in 1898 originally as part of their campaign to kill Home Rule by kindness has minimal responsibility and maximum uselessness.</P>
    <P>That was recognised by no less an authority than Eamon de Valera when, in 1940, he decided he had had enough of their inefficiency and incompetence &mdash; and in some cases their corruptness.  He emasculated the whole lot of them and transferred the greater part of their functions to non-elected officials, namely, the county and city managers.  Naturally, the whole panoply of the elected representatives was allowed to continue &mdash; God knows why.  de Valera must have had his reasons but I do not know what they were.  I should like to be told in simple form &mdash; as Churchill used to say, on a half sheet of paper &mdash; what injury the country would suffer if, tomorrow morning, the councils as at present constituted were abolished and replaced by commissioners.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche mentioned the problems which have existed for a number of years regarding the financing of local authorities and seemed to attribute them to this side of the House, which is extraordinary.  We all accept that there have been problems in <Col N="1586" /> the local authority system for a number of years but they were dramatically compounded by ridiculous decisions before an election, giving people a holiday for four or five years in terms of abolishing domestic rates and motor taxation.  Only someone who was very anxious to get into public office could have thought of that.  He mentioned U-turns and hypocrisy on this side of the House which is insulting as the information was available to everybody.</P>
      <P>Despite what some Members said, the morale of the staff of local authorities and local authority members has never been lower because they feel inept and unable to do anything.  They are rubber stamps for a higher administration.  They feel they have no function and, because they have been cast in that role, they talk in circles about things that do not concern them.  The Minister, as a former member of a local authority, must be aware of the problems.</P>
      <P>Most of the Members who spoke in the House have some experience of membership of local authorities and we all know that power and authority should go hand-in-hand with responsibility.  I do not always agree with my learned colleague. Deputy Kelly, but I agree that responsibility must be exercised in handing out the accolades, whatever they may be. However, a number of serious problems need to be addressed, indeed they should have been looked at 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of Deputy Kelly and Deputy Boland, no Member said that power, as far as local authorities are concerned, is money.  If they get their money directly from the central Exchequer naturally they will spend it freely, easily and regularly.  They will have no responsibility because the money will have been raised by another body which will have direct responsibility to Dáil Éireann.  The Minister knows that there must be an effective system and a study of the various local government Acts will show that when the system was first introduced it was on the basis that local authorities, when formed, would largely be autonomous. With the autonomy would go the <Col N="1587" /> power and the responsibility to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister publicly declared war on potholes.  As I said before, if this is a war I hope he will soon win a battle because, if not, in spite of his great height he is likely to be submerged in a pothole and people will scarcely see the top of his head.  Travelling through any county immediately adjacent to Dublin, one cannot but see the dreadful condition of the main and county roads.  I have said this on countless occasions here.  We have all spoken about it at local authority meetings and I am sure the Minister will refer to the extra sum of £15 million which he allocated for roads and so on. The money is welcome but it is insufficient to meet the requirements at present.  I wish to refer specifically to County Kildare.  Unless something dramatic is done and unless there is a realisation in the Department of the gravity of the situation, the roads will disintegrate and the kind of funding now required to repair them will be minuscule to what will be required in a couple of years.  It is a question of making our minds up and deciding what to do.  How much time have I to conclude?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take another look at the roads in County Kildare?  One should not speak for other counties but I know that the same applies to County Wicklow and County Meath. They are close to the most densely populated area in the country and that is why they are in such bad condition.  The heavy volume of traffic has caused havoc on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> I wish to make a small point in relation to housing, to which the Minister might address himself.  Probably only 50 local authority houses are unserviced in County Kildare with no water or sanitary services.  Many of the people living in those houses cannot finance improvements as they are living on social welfare or are elderly.  It would not take much to put right and I ask the Minister to look at it again.</P>
    <P>Water pollution is an issue which has come to the fore recently.  Kildare County Council suffered the indignity of being mentioned in court for polluting the water supply.  It was unfortunate but central Government have a role to play in that regard because the council can only update the sewerage treatment plants in line with the finance they get from the Government.  We suffered a great deal of bad publicity last year because of one or two incidents.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make is dear to my heart.  Will he please answer it today and put us out of our agony?  Will the Minister approve the N4 motorway scheme from Leixlip to Kilcock?  It is only a matter of the Minister putting pen to paper.  He should give approval to this scheme as it has been sitting there for two years.  I know the Minister will say that is was also on the desk of the previous Minister but it has now been on his desk for the past 18 months or so.  Unless something is done in the very near future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for giving me a few minutes of his time.  I admire the courage, the style and the panache of the Minister in the way he has presented this Estimate before the House.  His speech is full of intentions and desires but I am still trying to find references to what action is taking place at present.  On looking through the Estimate all that I can see are minuses; having done a quick addition I find that there are 14 minuses and nine pluses which I think accurately reflects what is happening within the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the work of local authorities all over the county is grinding to a halt, particularly roadworks.  Many local authorities have finished their roadworks for this year as they do not have the finance to complete any more.  I ask the Minister to act on the submissions which have been made to him by the various local authorities, and in particular the submission which he has received from Clare County Council for special aid.  We in <Col N="1590" /> Clare County Council have received no confirmation to date as to what is happening in regard to that submission and I ask the Minister to act on that submission before County Clare becomes an island county surrounded on one side by the Atlantic and on the other by the Shannon, with no road network apart from the main road system running from Limerick to Crusheen.</P>
    <P>The Minister's counterpart the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, with his particular style and bravado, has been promoting tourism and telling us about all of the great things which are happening but all we need to do is to look at the standard of signposting around the country.  The roads to Dublin Airport, Dublin port and the ports in Cork and Waterford are well signposted but the standard of signposting in the rest of the country is diabolical.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to ask his Department to urgently examine the quality of signposting at airports in regard to places outside the Dublin area.  Perhaps this is a problem which the Minister has not noticed.</P>
    <P>All of the previous speakers have referred to the roads infrastructure.  All roads apart from the national primary roads are in very bad condition and in some cases they are impassable.  I do not think the Department of the Environment are aware of the extent of the problem.  The amount of money made available this year for improvements in county roads is a very poor reflection on the Government.  An extra £15 million has been provided for structural works but that is only chicken feed.  An assessment carried out in County Clare has indicated that £25 million would be needed to make the roads passable.  The officials in the Minister's Department are aware of this.  It is ironic that on the one hand the Minister for Tourism and Transport is promoting the tourism industry while on the other the Minister for the Environment is not providing the facilities which should be provided.</P>
    <P>With the condition of the road network at present, particularly in the west, I <Col N="1591" /> think we can look forward to more emigration. Industrialists cannot be attracted into the more remote parts of the west because of the very bad condition of the roads.  The Government, and in particular the Minister for the Environment, must address this problem.  The Minister has ability and a certain style and I wish he would use that ability in getting something constructive done in areas which very badly need development.  Once again, I thank Deputy Durkan for giving me some of his time to enable me to make a contribution to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all of those Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  My only regret is that we do not have more time to deal with the issues which have been raised and I hope that those Deputies to whom I do not respond will understand when I say I have taken due note of all of the points which have been raised.  To put it politely, I think I have enough here to keep this debate going for many hours. This is an indication of the interest which is taken in local authority matters and in environmental matters.  I wish we had more time to be able to deal with all of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>A few of the points need to be clarified. First, I would like to respond to Deputy Boland who said he had difficulty in understanding the figures which I have given.  I recognise there is a change in the way the Estimates are being presented on this occasion but this is simply because the abolition of loan charges on the local loans fund means that there will be a saving to local authorities this year of £305 million.  Consequently, the subsidy in the rates support grant provision in the Estimate has been reduced by £305 million.  Local authorities will not lose one penny as a result of this change and that has to be made very clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland also referred to An Foras Forbartha.  I can tell him &mdash; and Deputy Quinn may also be interested in this &mdash; that the arrangements in regard to the new environmental unit which will be attached to the Department have now <Col N="1592" /> been finalised and these arrangements were agreed on amicably with the unions. The arrangements will enable the Department to appoint staff to this unit and this is programmed to commence next week.  This will enable the Department &mdash; as has been referred to here this afternoon &mdash; to deal with environmental matters in their own way and with their own resources which they have not able to do up until now.  Deputy Kelly and others were quite right in saying that the old Department of Local Government simply changed its name but did not change its emphasis or staffing arrangements in so far as control of environmental matters was concerned.  That has now been changed and I think history will record me quite favourably in that regard when it comes to be written.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a great obsession with history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Not overly so.  I think this is a change which will be welcomed.  With hindsight the unions have recognised that this is the right way to proceed in so far as developing the expertise and knowledge available to the Minister and his Department is concerned.  The unions have always known that An Foras Forbartha only carried out the Minister's instructions and directions anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was much soft talk about the disadvantages in what I was endeavouring to achieve.  It is beginning to dawn now that there is huge advantage for the Department, the Minister, whoever he might be, and the Government in so far as these changes are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is very concerned that Deputy Boland's Clean-Up Week Ireland should be portrayed in the way he seems to have seen it.  This Minister does not believe that a seven-day response to what is a 365-day a year job is sufficient in so far as cleaning up Ireland is concerned.  Whatever the former Minister <Col N="1593" /> might think about the success of his little campaign for cleaning up Ireland for a week, it was patchy to say the least of it.  I have adopted a different attitude. I have spoken to the county managers and local authorities generally in this regard.  We now have a programme of works in hand that will deal with the whole year, that will deal with the problems that arise on a day-to-day basis throughout the entire year, not just a flash in the pan response for a couple of days, then good-night Maria.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is wasting time by raising such issues, because I could be dealing with other matters.  Let me put on record that I do not see it the protection of our environment as a matter for the Minister alone or for his Department alone.  I see it as a matter for every single individual.  I foresee commercial interests, financial and educational institutions all playing a part in that campaign. What I am trying to do is entice commercial interests to recognise that an awareness programme is necessary.  The Deputy will be delighted to know that other institutions also have indicated their willingness to co-operate in putting together a proper awareness campaign that will last throughout the entire year and for years afterwards.  That cost a lot of money; I do not have it, but I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that, in the very near future, he will be hearing an announcement indicating that my concerns in that regard are shared by other institutions who are prepared to contribute and to do something positive in that regard.  Therefore, the Deputy should not take the attitude he has in so far as that environmental arrangement is concerned.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I might point out also that local authorities will be spending this year £1.178 billion.  While Deputies might not think that that is sufficient to do the job in local authorities, at the same time it is not true to say, as Deputy Boland suggested, that they have no money at all: £1.178 billion on current and capital expenditure is a fair amount of money for local authorities to have available to them for their purposes in difficult times.</P>
      <P>I accept that there were some fish kills last year in so far as environmental matters are concerned.  We would hope that the same would not recur this year.  Plans have been put in place to deal with that matter.  We have been quite successful already in so far as identifying the areas of greatest concern, by way of the farm surveys carried out over the past few months, with the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture and Food, their officers and those of the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>To speak about plants installed by farmers on the advice of the technical officers of the Department of Agriculture that did not take recognition of the need for proper effluent disposal comes a bit thin from the former Minister.  Much of the storage facilities put in place were done on the advice of his former colleagues during a period in which silage making was needed as a matter of urgency and was applied by his colleague, his former Government.  He should recognise that that comprises part of the difficulty we must now endeavour to eradicate.</P>

      <P>All Deputies who spoke expressed difficulty as far as the roads are concerned.  I agree that there is a problem to be addressed there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At least there could have been recognition, in so far as county roads are concerned, that my trebling the 1986 allocation in 1987, and continuing that trebling in 1988, constituted a fair response.  It might not satisfy Deputies Taylor-Quinn or Durkan as being sufficient but it is a great deal &mdash; £30 million in two years &mdash; than £5 million and less per year before that on the part of the former Government.  I still think it is not enough but it is as much as was available to me at this time.</P>
      <P>I also effected an improvement in so far as the block grants are concerned and local authorities can utilise that money to deal with the problems Deputies raised.</P>
      <P>I changed the distribution of the money available to me on the mileage of county roads, as distinct from using some peculiar yardstick the former Minister used in dealing with these matters.  I introduced equity into the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Durkan might think, in so far as his wee county is concerned, let me point out to him that it is not just a question of the numbers of vehicles that traverse a road that must be taken into consideration. One also has to take the geography of the location into account.  While roads that have been constructed in his county have been constructed at least on good substructures, there are other parts of the country that have very poor terrain to cross.  Consequently, they render road-making that much more difficult.  Therefore, taking the checks and balances, I feel that the distribution I have undertaken <Col N="1596" /> constitutes the fairest way, and is seen to be the fairest way, to deal with the matter.  If one had an enormous amount of money for distribution, then one could do things differently.</P>
      <P>In so far as the National Roads Authority is concerned I should say yes, I am pleased to note that Deputy Quinn is supportive of it, in principle, and sees its function as being a good thing.  I expect and hope that its establishment will get the unanimous support of this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not expect miracles from Deputy Boland every day of the week but perhaps we might have expected that much from him on that occasion.  There is a need there; we have a difficult problem to be resolved.  As far as I am concerned, our roads constitute the most deficient part of our infrastructure &mdash; national, primary, secondary, the overall network giving access to ports and airports.  Especially with the completion of the internal market by 1992 there will be greater pressure on us to get a better roads transport system in place.  But it must be recognised that it will cost a lot of money.  I estimate that it will take not less than £3 billion to bring our national roads network up to European standard.  Hopefully we will be able to gain greater access to and draw down greater amounts from the new structural funds to accommodate that project.  It is my belief that the National Roads Authority will be able to achieve that goal by means of a better system of working in so far as the design, construction and financing of such roadworks are concerned.  The Government have cleared the project and it will commence in the very near future.</P>
      <P>I was anxious that, in tandem with that project, the blueprint for roads development over the next 15 to 20 years would also be available.  That accounted for the delay involved.  That blueprint has been virtually completed as well, so that they will both run together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the total amount of money required to bring all our roads up to the required standard over the period, in so far as the blueprint is concerned, will be £8.3 billion.</P>

      <P>There is a Government commitment that something special has to be done to gear ourselves so that we can match the best transportation system available in other parts of the Community. For that reason, the National Roads Authority will address themselves to that business.  I eagerly expect that there will be across-the-board support for my proposals in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating raised a matter about aerosols, the Ozone Layer in so far as health matters are concerned.  I should like to draw his attention to the fact that the Order Paper contains a motion in regard to the protocol arrangement for consideration at as early a date as possible. Hopefully we can get the Whips to allow it to be dealt with in this session.  I am perfectly happy that everything possible will be done to reduce the difficulties attached to the use of aerosols.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating, who was not present in the Chamber when Deputy Kelly made his contribution, will be pleased to know that Deputy Kelly supports his point of view, that it be recommended to the Minister that we wipe out all irrelevant commissions, committees of that nature. There appears to be a growing opinion among certain Deputies that local authorities serve no useful purpose, that they can be got rid of by some wave of the ministerial wand.  I do not share that point of view.</P>
