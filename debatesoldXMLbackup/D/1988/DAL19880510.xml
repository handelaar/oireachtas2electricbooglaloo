Tá sé fíor chomh maith go bhfuil brú an-mhór ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus go bhfuil sé níos deacra dóibh an t-am ar fad an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>

Go príomha tá feidhm á tabhairt don pholasaí sin sna hAchtanna faoinar bunaíodh Roinn na Gaeltachta, Bord na Gaeilge agus Údarás na Gaeltachta (a bhfuil tagairt iontu go léir don teanga mar mheán cumarsáide) agus sa bhéim a leagtar ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.</P>
      <P>Léiríonn Leabhar na Meastachán an cúnamh atá á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas trí Roinn na Gaeltacha i mbliana agus ar ndóigh baineann cuid suntasach de chaiteachas na Roinne Oideachais le múineadh na Gaeilge.

Baineann sé sin leis an Roinn Oideachais, ar ndóigh, ach ní fheicim go bhfuil aon pholasaí athruithe ansin maidir le ceist na Gaeilge.

Is cinnte <Col N="689" /> mar sin go bhfuil suim an-mhór ag tuismitheoirí i ndul chun cinn na Gaeilge. Maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna, is dócha gur fíor a rá gur tháinig laghdú beag nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis na coláistí ullmhúcháin; ní raibh oiread daoine a tháinig isteach go dtí na coláistí oiliúna go raibh an cumas Gaeilge céanna acu agus a bhí ag na daoine a tháinig isteach ó na coláistí ullmhúcháin. Bíonn an argóint sin ann i gcónaí, nach bhfuil múineadh na Gaeilge chomh maith sna scoileanna anois ó rinneadh an t-athrú sin.  San am céanna, ní thagann múinteoirí ar bith amach as na coláistí oiliúna nach bhfuil oilte go leor le Gaeilge a mhúineadh in ár scoileanna.

Mar a dúirt mé i dtús ama ansin, is é an rud is mó atá ag teastáil ó thaobh na Gaeilge ná muintir na tíre in a n-iomlán a spreagadh le níos mó úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge.  Ní bhaineann sé leis na scoileanna.  Tá a gcion féin déanta ag na scoileanna leis na blianta ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán, ach baineann sé le muintir na tíre ar fad níos mó úsáid a bhaint as an Ghaeilge agus iarracht níos fear a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the concern of parents of mentally handicapped children at the lack of employment and care facilities for those over 18 years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>For many years I have been aware that the current level of mental handicap service provision falls short of meeting all requirements, particularly for adults.  A comprehensive review of mental handicap services is being carried out by my Department to identify the shortfall and to draw up guidelines for the future development of the service.  The review will cover all aspects of the mental handicap services including adult services and is being carried out by way of consultation with persons and organisations involved in the service, including parents' associations. It is expected that the review group's report will be completed this year.</P>
      <P>However, without prejudice to the conclusions of the review, discussions are taking place in many areas about the development of services for people with mental handicap.  As in the past, it is my intention to protect and develop mental handicap services through the redeployment of resources and the provision of additional resources where possible within the present financial climate.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that handicapped persons, in common with other sections of the community, are experiencing difficulties in securing employment, every effort is being made to ensure that handicapped people get their fair share of employment opportunities. In this regard one of the most recent measures aimed at promoting employment of handicapped workers is the development by the National Rehabilitation Board in agreement with the Departments of Health and Labour, FUE, ICTU, the Institute of Personnel Management and the Union of Voluntary Organisations for the Handicapped of guidelines on the employment of disabled persons.  I am confident that these guidelines will improve the employment opportunities of handicapped people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that much of our health services seem to be eternally under review.  My question relates to the grave concern of the parents of mentally handicapped children.  Can <Col N="691" /> the Minister indicate to the House the number of such handicapped persons in the country who are not in a caring institution, or are not in any way usefully or gainfully employed?  Can he give the House an indication today as to how many opportunities or places for handicapped people will be made available this year and what plans the Government have to ensure that adequate places are provided for these people?  It is a matter of distressing concern to the hundreds of parents throughout the country not knowing what will happen to their children when they reach the age of 17 or 18 years and have to leave the institutions they grew up in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the figures the Deputy requires but they are readily available.  I accept that there is a problem and, indeed, has been a problem for many years, particularly in the placement of mentally handicapped adults.  One of the reasons I am anxious to have this review completed is to see how we can move rapidly towards finding some solution to that problem.  Much has been done in the last year to facilitate mentally handicapped adults, including allocations from the national lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the employment element in this question, would the Minister accept that the public service has failed to meet its commitment under the 3 per cent quota scheme that was worked out in 1977?  Would the Minister agree that the present figure of 1.3 persons employed in the public sector falls very far short of that agreed 3 per cent? Does he not think that the time has now come to make a fresh attempt within the public service to meet that target of 3 per <Col N="692" /> cent, which was a very modest target, and that each department within the public service should look to themselves to meet the obligations already worked out in advance of any review body that the Minister has set up?  Would the Minister have a word with the Departments in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that every Department should make an effort to employ the 3 per cent.  The guidelines which I have referred to are designed to encourage all enterprises in both the public and private sector to adopt a more positive policy towards the employment of handicapped persons and to provide them with advice and information for this purpose.  The guidelines are in two parts: the first part sets out the elements which should go to make up company policy on the employment of handicapped persons and the second part gives guidelines and information to assist in the implementation of that policy.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a short question with regard to the plight of mentally handicapped persons whose parents are elderly.  There are increasing numbers of cases where elderly parents are caring for handicapped sons and daughters.  In the review that is being carried out, will the Minister ensure that specific attention is paid to that problem?</P>

      <P>My question is similar to Deputy De Rossa's.  Would the Minister not accept that this is a critical area, the older mentally handicapped persons in their forties or fifties under the care of ageing relatives who have no future mapped out for them on the death of <Col N="693" /> their parents?  Has the Minister any plans to address this problem in a particular way?  This is particularly critical because, since the mentally handicapped are living longer, this will be a growing problem.

      <P>I accept that there is a particular problem in relation to the placing of the adult mentally handicapped. One of the functions of the review committee will be to look at all the services that are available and try to co-ordinate them so that the necessary service will be available to the mentally handicapped.  I am glad to see a number of organisations already provide respite centres.  Aged parents have no need to be concerned that, after their death, their adult mentally handicapped dependants will not be catered for.  I am not aware of any instance in this country where a mentally handicapped person was neglected because there was nobody in the community to look after them.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 17 together.  I am aware of the report referred to by Deputies Flaherty and McCartan.  The Government have been concerned since taking office, at the problems of disadvantaged youth and in particular those of young people out of home.  A sum of £4 million <Col N="695" /> was accordingly set aside last November out of the national lottery fund for major developments for youth groups particularly at risk, such as young homeless, young travellers and substance abusers. Last week the Government announced grants totalling over £3.7 million to development services for young people at risk.  The allocation included a sum in excess of £1 million to assist voluntary and statutory bodies, in particular health boards, dealing with young people out of home throughout the country.  I am confident that such a substantial allocation will make a significant contribution to the provision of appropriate services at local level.  A number of the organisations affiliated to the Streetwise National Coalition, which produced the report referred to by the Deputies, will benefit from the additional funding.</P>

This group have been allowed fall through a gap in our services.  Will the Department take on board the statutory responsibility, in the context of the Children Bill in particular, for that group about whom the report was so concerned?</P>

It is hoped in the new Children (Care and Protection) Bill to change the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; to include those up to 18 years of age.  This will put the onus on health boards to make provision for young people out of home up to 18 years of age.</P>

      <P>The number of cases of measles reported to my Department and the incidence of admissions to Cherry Orchard Hospital, has been falling dramatically in recent years.  In 1985 there were 9,903 cases of measles reported but this figure fell to 201 cases in 1987.  The number of admissions to Cherry Orchard Hospital, the major centre for the treatment of serious cases of measles, fell from 283 cases in 1985 to four cases in 1987.</P>
      <P>This dramatic reduction in the incidence of measles arose from the introduction of measles immunisation in October 1985.  Measles immunisation is available free of charge to all children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 19 together.  The development of the psychiatric services along the lines recommended in the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> remains the policy of my Department.  The major recommendations of the report relate to the development of a range of services in the community so that people may receive treatment without admission to hospital and the rehabilitation of long-stay patients so that they may return to normal settings.  The inevitable result of this approach is that large psychiatric hospitals will not be required.  In-patient numbers which have been falling for years continue to do so.  When the study group which prepared the report was set up in 1981 there were 12,500 patients in the public psychiatric hospitals.  The number at present is 8,900.</P>

Is it not a fact that community-based services have been cut back?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent to which the services have been developed depends in part, on the level of services at the time the report was published in 1985.  In some areas developments were already taking place much along the lines recommended in the report while, in others, they were moving more slowly.  I would be concerned at the lack of commitment in some areas to implementing the recommendations of the report.

      <P>The Eastern Health <Col N="703" /> Board have been quite diligent in pursuing this policy which I support.  Can I ask the Minister if there is any in-built review process in place in light of the fact that there is a concern that a number of people have been discharged into the community without being ready to cope adequately?  There have been reports from within the profession of suicides which have occurred as a result of this. Perhaps there should be a review to ensure that a balance of service is being provided.  We might need to review also the numbers proposed.  Can I ask the Minister if there is any review ongoing or would he anticipate the need for such a modification of the plan?</P>

The number now stands at 8,900 so there has been a gradual reduction in the numbers during the past 20 years.  I will certainly send the Deputy the statistical information.

The Minister is aware, from representations I have made to him and his predecessor, of an infant who was perfectly normal, had passed all the usual tests that take place after a birth and was growing month after month but after the injection, changes were seen in the infant.  In the case that I have brought to the Minister's attention on a number of occasions, the child involved is now a teenager and has the mental and physical capacity of an infant. He never grew mentally or physically and the parents are totally convinced that their child's condition is as a result of that <Col N="706" /> vaccination.

Many of these cases would not have come to the Department's notice until long after the occurrence of the illness from which they may have suffered.

      <P>The Minister said that the matter was decided on the balance of probabilities.  I take it that was the basic rule?  He went on to say that where any doubt existed the benefit of that doubt was given to the person who was alleged to have been injured by the vaccination. Are we to take it from that that the group operated on the basis that in all cases where they have refused compensation it <Col N="707" /> has been on the basis that they have no doubt whatsoever that the injuries were caused by the vaccination?  If any doubt exists and you give the benefit of the doubt to the injured person, it seems to suggest that where there is a refusal the experts have decided they have no doubt on the issue and there is no connection whatsoever.  That seems to be a million miles removed from deciding something on the balance of probabilities.  I ask the Minister to clarify which of these two criteria was used on this occasion.  I suggest to him that it was the former and not the latter and that the benefit of any doubt is not given to people.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept that reply. Will the Minister accept that the committee stated that they could not say for definite and without doubt that the condition of the children was due to the three-in-one vaccination?  There is surely a very big difference between that and stating that they were without doubt that it was caused by the three-in-one injection. They never said that.  Surely the Minister will agree that what was stated by his committee was that they could not be certain that the condition of the child was due to the injection.  Therefore, surely a doubt exists and surely there is a duty on the Minister and on this Dáil to protect parents whose children have suffered so tragically because of this State administered scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department have an established national programme on immunisation and vaccination.  The programme includes diptheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and rubella immunisations.  These immunisations are free of charge from public health clinics.  The latest development in the programme was the introduction in October 1985 of measles immunisation.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccination is under consideration.  However, the current uptake of measles immunisation is 55 per cent of the target population which is lower than the uptake of rubella which is 75 per cent of the target population. Therefore, one element in the assessment of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the possible adverse affect on rubella cover of introducing measles-mumps-rubella vaccine before an increase in the uptake of measles immunisation is achieved. I have recently urged health boards to make a concentrated effort to boost the uptake of measles immunisation.</P>
      <P>With regard to a national immunisation record card, a working group representative of the Faculty of Paediatrics, the College of General Practitioners and the Health Promotion Unit of my Department, have developed a Child Health Record Booklet.  This booklet includes an immunisation and vaccination record and is now being piloted in Community Care Areas 1 and 2 of the Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the National Maternity Hospital and a sample of general practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>The total cost of drugs prescribed and dispensed in the GMS is a function not only of unit costs, but is also dependent upon the particular formulation selected and upon the choice made by the prescriber in selecting a generic or branded product within that formulation.  The total cost of GMS drugs is most crucially related, however, to the total volumes prescribed within the scheme.</P>
      <P>Effective unit price control is maintained by an agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  The agreement controls the prices charged by manufacturers for drugs and medicines, by direct reference to the comparable UK prices.  The vast majority of drugs and medicines on the Irish market are imported from the UK.  The present agreement with the FICI also provides for a voluntary freeze on manufacturers' prices for drugs and medicines to the end of October 1988, regardless of currency movements or increases in UK parent prices.</P>
      <P>Participating doctors and pharmacists in the GMS are regularly circulated by the GMS (Payments) Board with detailed information on the relative cost of a standard course of treatment with various alternative versions of the drugs most commonly in use.  The current GMS negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation have, as one of their primary objectives, the development and promotion within general practice of a style of practice which is less reliant upon prescribing and drug therapy.  These negotiations are currently in progress and are being intensively pursued under the chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan of the Labour Court.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing mandatory generic prescribing in the GMS is one which is always under review.  As I have already pointed out in the reply, the GMS payments board regularly circularise doctors in the GMS with the prices of various drugs and certainly, all things being equal, general practitioners should prescribe the generic preparation if they are satisfied that that preparation is as potent as the proprietary brand.</P>

Because the consultant sends a specimen for testing, the patient who is attending and paying the consultant has to pay the £10 out-patients charge.  That is outrageous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon:</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that in one particular hospital in this city certain services are not available in the private hospital, that such services are provided in the public hospital, and therefore in this case the patient is obliged under the regulations to pay the £10 charge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 50 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are continuing on a review of the common contract.  As I have explained previously, because of the importance being attached to the talks, it has been agreed that details of the proceedings would remain confidential. I can assure the House, however, that serious negotiations are taking place on the key issues in the review and a further meeting will take place later this month.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing on a new contract for doctors participating in the GMS scheme with the Irish Medical Organisation.  I reopened these discussions last July and following a series of meetings both parties agreed to appoint an independent chairman to facilitate progress.</P>
      <P>Mr. John Horgan, Chairman of the Labour Party, was invited to chair the discussions and since his acceptance the parties have met eight times and on occasions twice a week.</P>

      <P>In relation to the common contract the negotiations seem to be going on for 12 months at a time when our health services have been cut back <Col N="715" /> dramatically and dangerously.  Referring to the previous question outrageous things are happening in our hospitals throughout the country.  Abuses are taking place by certain consultants in the pursuance of their private practice in public hospitals.  Surely it is about time if the Minister is serious about cutting costs and eliminating inefficiencies that he would bring these talks to a conclusion. They seem to be wrapped in the most remarkable shroud of secrecy that I have ever come across.  These talks with a little goodwill on the part of his Department should be brought to a conclusion at this stage.  Has the issue of monitoring of private practice in our hospitals been raised with the consultants groups and, if so, what has been their reaction?  That is vital in view of the most recent report from the Southern Health Board where consultants are now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take these questions together.</P>
      <P>I and my colleagues in Government are very concerned at the effects which the UK seamen's strike is having on Irish trade and especially on exporters of perishable commodities.  I have kept in close and constant touch with the situation generally since the first interruption of services on the Irish Sea.  In particular I have maintained close liaison with the B &amp; I company who have confirmed to me that priority is being given at present, as far as is practicable, to the export of perishable products.</P>
      <P>Obviously, there are constraints arising from the industrial relations aspects of this situation of which we must be conscious.  I have arranged, however, to meet today at 4 p.m. with representatives of the ferry companies and of all the major parties affected to see what practical steps may be possible to alleviate the difficulties being experienced.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that my Government colleagues and I could not be taking this situation more seriously and that we will do all in our power to mitigate the effects of the present dispute on our splendid export performance this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this dispute has cut shipping capacity in the Irish Sea by more than half and that this affects a trade worth £12 million per day?  As this is the second time in the last few months that an industrial dispute in Britain has jeopardised this important aspect of Irish trade, will the Minister make arrangements with the EC to use its good offices to secure a solution to this dispute in line with the provisions of Article III (E) of the Treaty of Rome? Will he also ask the EC to provide Ireland with the necessary funds to enable it to diversify its trade and transport arteries to reduce dependence on transit through <Col N="721" /> Britain?  Will the Minister make arrangements to facilitate or provide alternative transport services direct to the continent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware that the capacity has been very considerably lowered on the Irish Sea as a result of this dispute in which we have neither hand, act nor part.  I am also fully aware of the value of our exports across the Irish Sea. My Department are exploring all methods by which we can alleviate the situation, including the one mentioned by Deputy Bruton.  In regard to Deputy Bruton's remarks about transit, a large percentage of these goods are directly exported to Britain so it is not merely a problem in relation to transit.</P>

      <P>Shipping companies unaffected by the strike have put on extra shipping and I should like to ask the Minister if there is any guarantee that the goods will be off-loaded when they arrive in Britain?  I understand that about 60 per cent of our exports are at present being transported in roll-on/roll-off containers. Is there availability of suitable shipping in the event of, say, the B &amp; I wanting to put on additional services of that nature to alleviate the difficulties caused by the strike?</P>

I am sure the House is fully conscious of the type of constraint to which I refer.  I hope that the meeting this afternoon with the representatives of the exporters and the transport companies will throw some light on the problem and indicate a way whereby we may alleviate it.</P>

We have been trying to find alternative ways for exporting mushrooms, meat and fish.  CTT say that there have been no losses so far but that the next few days are crucial.  There have been indications that there may be a breakthrough in the industrial dispute which is the source and origin of the whole problem.  I hope that will be so.

Will the Minister agree that it is a matter that he, the Taoiseach and other Ministers should consider raising at the earliest opportunity with all the relevant authorities in the EC so that alternative arrangements can be made to ensure that our trade is not interfered with within Europe by disputes occurring in another member state?</P>

I am very pleased and proud that the B &amp; I are giving a very good service now to Irish exporters to the limit of their capacity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 35, subsection (1), line 32, to delete &ldquo;47 per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;45 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to draw from the Minister the precise implications of the exchange, if I can use that word, between high rates of corporation tax on the one hand and on the other hand the new arrangements in relation to advance depreciation of capital allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been some recent comment in the media to the effect that the Minister is not giving away as much as he ought in view of the increased revenue that will flow from the new treatment of capital allowances.  Is this correct?  Has he not more leeway by reason of the reduction in the rate of depreciation which is allowed for and is there more money in the kitty which would finance a greater reduction in corporation tax? The Minister may be aware of the suggestion in the media that he is getting in more by reason of the change in the <Col N="808" /> depreciation rules than he is giving away in reducing corporation tax.  It is my understanding that, when the Minister mooted this change in his budget speech, he indicated that there was to be a parity of increased revenue arising from the change in depreciation rules which would compensate for the loss of revenue arising from a reduction in corporation tax. Could the Minister clarify whether a fair balance has been struck and whether he will gain more from the depreciation changes than he will lose on corporation tax reductions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments relate to section 30 which provides for reductions in the rate of corporation tax announced in the budget.  From a standard rate of 50 per cent, section 30 provides for reductions to 47 per cent in the year to 31 March 1989 and 43 per cent from 1 April 1989. These reductions are part of a package which combines reductions in the rate of corporation tax with reductions in the levels of accelerated capital allowances over the same period, that is, 75 per cent in the year to 31 March 1989 and 50 per cent from 1 April 1989.  Thus the increased liability to tax because of the reduced capital allowances is balanced by reductions in the rate of tax.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this package is to remove the bias in our existing system towards investment in fixed assets.  The package has been costed having regard to current budget requirements.  If the amendments now proposed were to be accepted, those costings would be upset since reductions of the rate to 45 per cent instead of the proposed 47 per cent and to 40 per cent instead of the proposed 43 per cent would add a significant extra cost in the region of £100,000 in 1988, £6.6 million in 1989, £18.7 million in 1990 and £20 million in a full year.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments. However, the rate of corporation tax and other elements of the corporation tax system will be kept under review and, to the extent that there is scope for further reductions, they will be considered in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> The proposed reductions of the maximum levels of accelerated capital allowances from 100 per cent to 75 per cent from 1 April 1988 and to 50 per cent from 1 April 1989 increase the yield from corporation tax but only temporarily.  As the aggregate amount being claimed by way of normal annual wear and tear allowance increases following the reduction of accelerated allowances, the initial gain is whittled away over a period of five to eight years after the reductions are introduced.  Therefore, reducing accelerated capital allowances is in itself insufficient justification for reducing the rate of corporation tax.  Rather two purposes are served by the reduction of the rate of tax and reduction of accelerated allowances.  The 50 per cent rate of corporation tax which applies to companies in service, construction and other labour-intensive industries is high, both by comparison with the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax which applies to manufacturing companies and by comparison with the standard rate of corporation tax in other countries.  In the UK it is 35 per cent, in the USA 35 per cent, in Holland 42 per cent, in France 42 per cent and in Belgium 43 per cent.</P>
    <P>Our current rates of capital allowances are an excessive incentive to investment in fixed assets in times of high unemployment. The tax relief we give in respect of investment in buildings, plant and machinery is now too generous in the light of international comparisons.  These two principal imbalances in the structure of the corporation tax code &mdash; a relatively high rate of corporation tax and excessively generous capital allowances &mdash; are directly addressed in the provisions of the Bill.  These twin reforms of the corporation tax code reflect an international movement towards lower rates of corporate tax coupled with a phased withdrawal of excessive reliefs in respect of investment in fixed assets.</P>
    <P>As competitors for internationally mobile investment we must respond to trends elsewhere towards a lower standard rate of tax applied to a wider income base.  In this context I would add that our 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for <Col N="810" /> manufacturing companies and certain other companies continues to be a very significant inducement to foreign investment. The 10 per cent rate of corporation tax is unaffected by the changes in the corporation tax code provided for in the Bill.  Even after the reductions provided for in the Finance Bill, the rates of capital allowances available to investors will continue to be very generous and as attractive as those available elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that we are not comparing like with like when talking about a tax reduction and a change in respect of depreciation.  I appreciate that the Minister is dealing with an income flow and is postponing some of the depreciation to subsequent years.  This House should be given an adequate quantification of the benefit to the Exchequer which the new regime in respect of capital allowances will give. Has the Minister material available to him which would indicate the benefit to the Exchequer this year and in subsequent years in terms of cash flow?  How will he go about the business of discounting that benefit by providing for depreciation in subsequent years?  While I appreciate that there is a postponement of the depreciation element, is there not a straight, once-off benefit to the Exchequer?  I should like to know what that is.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record my complete agreement with the Minister's general proposition that we give depreciation too favourable a tax treatment here which tilts the balance against employment of labour.  I fully agree that the balance must be in the other direction.  I am worried that we are not being told what industry will lose this year and next year in terms of the change in capital allowances and the basis on which a calculation has been made for subsequent years regarding the flow from corporation tax.  What is the benefit expected from non-corporation taxpayers, such as schedule D payers who are entitled to the benefit of capital allowances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The <Col N="811" /> points Deputy McDowell has made are very valid.  They must be another indication of thinking along the same lines since I had drafted identical amendments. I did not put them down because I think there is some net benefit to the Exchequer from the group of proposals here.  If there is a benefit which could be returned to manufacturing industry, it might be better to do something to reduce transport costs rather than swop the gains for lower rates of taxation.  My amendments as drafted contained the same figures as Deputy McDowell's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is extraordinary.  I am beginning to get worried about it.  There is a case to be made, if there is a net benefit to the Exchequer, for targeting the employment creation areas.  We should do something very quickly about transport costs in the economy. If there were net savings on the reduction of accelerated capital allowances and we were to apply those savings to, for example, excise duty on articulated trucks, or on hydrocarbons, particularly diesel, that might be a way of restoring the benefit which would be more efficient in terms of employment than simply reducing the rates.  I am not like Deputy Desmond who has a garage full of Government memoranda, but I have a memory of getting this proposal costed when I was in Industry and Commerce and, speaking from memory, the figure that I was given at the time, over 12 months ago, for the total elimination of accelerated allowances would mean something in excess of £300 million to the Exchequer.  On that basis, when this is fully in place in 1989, it seems reasonable to expect a once-off benefit of about £150 million, admittedly spanning two financial years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to Deputy McDowell, has couched his information rather ambiguously.  He talks in terms of the current budgetary requirement not <Col N="812" /> permitting a lower rate.  Could he tell us first, what is the benefit to the Exchequer from reducing the accelerated allowances and, secondly, what is the cost to the Exchequer of the move on corporate tax from 47 per cent to 43 per cent?  I appreciate that when accelerated allowances are eliminated normal wear and tear will apply over a longer period and the once-off effect can be reduced in subsequent years but there is, I believe, a significant net flow of revenue to the Exchequer from this package of moves.  Will the Minister quantify this for us?  I agree in general with what he is doing and I also agree with his remarks about our package of incentives for industry now favouring fixed assets rather than labour, capital rather than jobs.  If there is a net saving there, it is worth thinking how we should spend it and of spending it in ways other than reducing the allowances further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies are on the same line.  I now have the figures which I will give to the House.  Taking the last point raised by Deputy Noonan, the loss because of the reduction in rates would amount in 1988 to about £300,000, in 1989 to £12.6 million, in 1990 to £29.7 million and in 1991 to £31.5 million.  The gain because of the reduction in capital allowances is zero for 1988, plus £24 million for 1989, £47.7 million in 1990 and £43.9 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>To come to Deputy McDowell's point, the overall effect on corporation tax yield is £1.6 million in 1988, £17.5 million in 1989, £43.1 million in 1990 and £40.6 million in 1991.  From there on, it tapers off down to about plus £4 million to £5 million in 1995.</P>

If I am given 100 per cent appreciation as a schedule D taxpayer for certain plant and machinery, I do not fit into this equation because I am not getting the benefit of corporation tax reductions.  Is that being adequately dealt with?  It seems that self-employed people who do not fit into the corporation tax framework will suffer the disadvantageous aspect and will not get the benefit of the contra item.</P>

      <P>That is in addition to the net figures given for the Exchequer. Effectively, over a period of a number of years &mdash; and I take it that the figures will taper down to at least £3 million or £4 million as time goes by in the schedule D area &mdash; these people will contribute a huge amount of money to the Exchequer by reason of this change and are getting no compensatory incentives.  Arising out of that, I put it to the Minister that many schedule D people employ others.  The incentive to employ will not be given to those schedule D people because they will not get a reduction in their taxation treatment.  They are getting all the bad <Col N="814" /> news and none of the good news out of this transaction.  It looks as if over the next five years they will be contributing an extra £50 or £60 million to the Exchequer for nothing.  I wonder how that fits into the pro-employment remarks made earlier by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is, whether one is incorporated or not, the same economic laws apply.  There are not different rules of economics applying to people who are unincorporated.  Just because I run a coalyard without the benefit of a limited liability company, that does not mean that all the same economic pressures are not on me in relation to choosing to employ labour or choosing to capitalise.  The effect of this measure appears to give the corporate area, by reason of the artificial fact that there is incorporation in some areas of the economy, a compensatory benefit but when it comes to the schedule D area, the unincorporated traders, they are getting no compensation whatever and paying huge sums of extra taxation to the Exchequer.  In the budget we never heard about this &mdash; that the self-employed, the schedule D area, the unincorporated private enterprise area &mdash; would be giving the Minister such vast handouts.  We are only finding that out now.  The Minister should acknowledge the full extent of the contribution that the self-employed will be making to his budgetary strategy.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister in his budget last year announced his intention to reform corporation tax and said he had a working party looking into the matter.  I presume this is some of the fruits of the work. Does the Minister intend to proceed next year towards eliminating free depreciation completely and swopping that for a further reduction in rates?  If that is the Minister's intention, will he <Col N="816" /> consider looking at what I have suggested? If there is an intention to eliminate accelerating capital allowances which would result in extra revenue being at the disposal of the Exchequer, will the Minister consider targeting, for example, the transport costs in the economy rather than reducing the rates?  I am talking in particular about reducing the excise duties on lorry transport, whether on the articulated tractor unit or on the cost of the fuel.  That might be a greater benefit to industry than a further reduction in rates.  Most of the rates the Minister is reducing do not apply to manufacturing industry, because they are all on a 10 per cent rate.  It might be more conductive to job creation if the Minister did what I suggested.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposals in the section, will the Minister comment on the effect on building societies and small companies and on the interest on housing loans made by banks?  Would the Minister outline the implications of the changes for small companies?  I understand there is a 35 per cent rate at the moment which is being moved up to 47 per cent. Is the Minister taking the rates up to 47 per cent to bring them back down to 43 per cent, or is the Minister taking them up to 43 per cent and leaving them there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides for the abolition of certain lower rates of corporation tax with effect from 1 April 1989, the date from which the 43 per cent rate will have effect.  The rate of 35 per cent applicable to the investment income of the life fund of a life assurance company is being retained.  This rate is linked to the standard rate of income tax and represents the income tax at the standard rate which a policyholder would be liable for if he were to receive investment income directly.  The abolition of the lower rates of 40 per cent and 35 per cent will affect companies with annual profits of less than £35,000, certain public utility companies, the ACC, housing loan interest received by certain banks and the income of building societies.  Banks and building societies will then be on an equal <Col N="817" /> footing in respect of interest on housing loans.</P>

In relation to the Deputy's other point about the on-going review, the review is still going and now, with the items we are discussing here and <Col N="818" /> the changes that are taking place arising from this legislation, we have settled the scene until 1990 and it remains then to be seen what might be done thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the small businesses I accept that the gain for the first two years is negligible but then it gets to £9 million from small businesses. This calls into question whether or not we are going towards a single rate of corporation tax which does not give any leading or reduced rate for smaller businesses. In that respect we seem to be going against the international trend of corporate taxation.  To apply a 40 per cent rate as a first rate of taxation is very strong medicine for a company.  I know that the phrase &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo; does not apply to a corporation but it is a very high initial rate of taxation to apply to a company.</P>
      <P>In England the smaller companies pay a reduced rate of corporation tax.  They do not pay the rate paid by the biggest businesses straight off.  Is the Minister happy with the general proposition that there should be a single uniform rate without any reduction for people just entering into profitability and who are vulnerable companies because they are just teetering on the edge of profitability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures the Minister has given give rise to the question as to what is the situation in relation to the Government's overall strategy for the relationship between the standard rate of income tax and corporation tax.  Is there a general policy to make these figures converge, or is there a view that they should be independent and disconnected from each other.  There is an argument to be made, and the Commission on Taxation made that argument fairly strongly, for making the standard rate of income tax converge with the standard rate of corporation tax to get rid of all sorts of anomalies and incentives to incorporate and all the rest of it.  In relation to the small industries, by hiking up their first rate to 40 per cent we are, as a long term aim, going in the opposite direction to the recommendation of the Commission on Taxation and we are putting up a very severe <Col N="819" /> barrier which they will hit on the first occasion on which they make profits. What is the philosophy behind this?  I do not see the thinking that goes into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving in that direction in relation to the personal rates and corporate rates.  When we talk about picking out particular sections such as the income tax rates and the contribution of the PAYE sector &mdash; and we are all interested in seeing what we can do for them, though we know there is very little we can do because of the cost to the Exchequer involved &mdash; it is no harm to put on the record the yield from corporation tax.  In 1980 it amounted to £140 million and in 1988, post budget, it will amount to £280 million.  In 1980 it amounted to 5.3 per cent of the total tax take and in 1988 it will amount to 4.2 per cent.  The highest percentage it ever reached was 5.7 per cent in 1982.  Therefore, one can see the tax contribution from the corporate sector is very small in the overall context.  It will amount to only 4.2 per cent this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party are opposing this section of the Bill.  I am glad that the Minister is proposing to reduce the accelerated capital allowances. It has been recognised in Britain that there is no advantage to be gained by having capital allowances and the whole area is completely doubtful.  As I understand it, over a period of three or four years the Thatcher Government abolished capital allowances and I do not think there will be any arguments about what the Minister is proposing here, which is reducing the rate to 50 per cent. We will certainly be giving it our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section the Minister is proposing to give some compensation for halving capital allowances which we believe should be abolished and replaced by direct grants and subsidies.  The recommendation of the Commission on Taxation in the area of company taxation was that we should move away from the huge array of tax reliefs and allowances <Col N="820" /> but this Government are actually increasing those reliefs and allowances.  For example, what is the need for extending the 10 per cent corporation tax rate to the financial institutions who will set up in the Custom House Docks site?  As far as we are concerned, this is just a giveaway.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister said that capital allowances in 1987 amounted to £310 million, which at one stage amounted to £116 million, and he has just pointed out that the actual tax return doubled between 1980 and 1987, from £140 million to £280 million, even though there was a reduction in the percentages from 5.3 per cent to 4.2 per cent, this despite the fact that the allowances had almost trebled.  In addition, export sales reliefs amounted to £337 million; Shannon reliefs amounted to £29 million; manufacturing profits reliefs, a reduced rate of tax for the manufacturing area, amounted to £123 million; stock reliefs amounted to £11 million; reliefs for small companies through a reduced rate of corporation tax amounted to £8.5 million and section 84 loan reliefs amounted to £64.3 million.  In all, total tax reliefs amounted to £900 million.  The Minister should reduce the number of reliefs and should offer assistance by way of direct grants and subsidies for specific projects with specific returns and performance.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say whether the granting of these reliefs has proved to be of benefit to the economy because in the manufacturing sector, in which there is a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, in the seven year period from 1981 40,000 jobs were lost, which amounts to 20 per cent of the total number of jobs in the sector, this despite the payment of enormous tax reliefs and allowances.  In addition, a further £400 million was paid out by way of grants and subsidies.  When are the Government going to decide whether these tax reliefs are of benefit to the economy?  They are introduced and continue to be paid year after year, generation after generation, until the Government hear of some country which has got rid of them when they in turn will begin to reduce them.  At some stage we <Col N="821" /> will have to decide if they are of any benefit to the economy and the point I am trying to make is that I believe they are not.  Generally, those tax reliefs go into somebody's pocket and do not lead to the creation of more jobs.</P>
    <P>One headline which appeared in a newspaper last year read &ldquo;No tax is good for Guinness&rdquo;.  According to that report over a half year period in 1986 Guinness paid only £600,000 tax on profits amounting to £16 million and they did not pay any tax at all for the other half of the year.  In fact, Guinness estimated that they were unlikely to pay any taxes for at least seven years in Ireland because they had accumulated capital allowances in the region of £120 million.  They had accumulated capital allowances to the extent that they would not have to pay any taxes for a period of seven years.  I hope that as a result of the Minister's proposal to reduce the rate we will catch some of this before the seven years are out.  The idea that a company can accumulate capital allowances to the extent that they do not have to pay any taxes for seven years is unbelievable, particularly in the light of the high profits being made by that company and that is only one example.</P>
    <P>As far as Guinness are concerned, there will be no increase in the number of jobs over that seven year period.  Nor was there an increase in the number of jobs over the previous seven year period which, in fact, saw a reduction in the total number of jobs because a reduction in the total number of jobs meant higher profits for the company because of new technology.  Therefore, these tax reliefs and allowances are not of much benefit to the economy and there is no evidence to the contrary.  The Government have stated that a reduction in the national debt is only part of what they are trying to achieve.  Their primary objective is the creation of employment and to keep people at home.  All of the other things are just steps on the way to achieving that objective.  What I am saying is that the evidence does not indicate that the granting of various tax reliefs and allowances <Col N="822" /> will help the Government in achieving their objective.</P>
    <P>In this section the Minister is proposing to compensate for the reduction in capital allowances by way of a reduction in corporation tax in one particular area.  The Minister should decide whether the granting of capital allowances is wrong and reduce them and should not try to make up for it by giving away a bit somewhere else.  While the Minister could reduce the rate of corporation tax in this section of the economy to a rate of either 47 per cent or 43 per cent, he should increase the rate of corporation tax in the manufacturing sector because there is no evidence that a reduced rate has led to the creation of jobs.  If the Minister could tell us that a reduced rate of corporation tax has helped to create jobs and that if there had been no such reduction it is probable that 80,000 jobs would have been lost or that we would have no manufacturing industry at all, we would have to think again but that would be unbelievable and nonsensical.  Therefore, the corporation tax area should be taken on its own and should not be related to capital allowances. Capital allowances have been shown in many countries to be wrong, and of doubtful proportions from the very beginning.  In fact, instead of being reduced to 50 per cent, they should be abolished altogether.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This section deals with the post-1990 situation as regards Shannon Airport companies. The companies at present under export sales relief which are zero-rated will with the agreement of the European Commission be subject to the 10 per cent corporate tax regime.  Why is this done in the manner in which it is done?  Why will the companies not move automatically on to the 10 per cent rate and fall within the parameters of the 10 per cent regime immediately?</P>
      <P>It appears that all the section does is to remove the prohibition on the issue of 10 per cent tax certificates to companies in the Shannon industrial zone, but it does not positively entitle them to continue operating post-1990.  In effect, therefore, zero-rated companies which are at present operating in Shannon must reapply in 1990 for a new licence and it is entirely possible that new restrictions or conditions will be imposed on such companies to which they had not been subject previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Shannon companies are and will <Col N="826" /> continue to be in difficulty in dealing with third parties in so far as their continued existence in Shannon is now dependent on a new application to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to the Department of Finance and they have no idea what conditions or restrictions might be imposed at the time of the new application.  I believe this position is entirely unsatisfactory.  Shannon companies had been led to believe that legislation would be introduced which would automatically entitle them to operate under the 10 per cent tax regime post-1990 and that this move would end the uncertainty which has been a feature of their commercial life for some years past. Would the Minister consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage to bring about the change I am suggesting?</P>
    <P>The net point is that these companies will have to re-apply in 1990 and this is causing them concern.  There is no certainty that the Minister or his successor will actually accept the application and admit them to the 10 per cent regime.</P>
    <P>Companies at present in the Shannon free zone are obviously making plans and arrangements for the future and any company would want to be planning in 1988 for what will be done in 1990.  Some of these companies &mdash; and the Minister knows the type of companies I have in mind &mdash; are making plans for the mid-nineties. They need the certainty that no new conditions will be imposed either by the Department of Finance or the Department of Industry and Commerce when they apply for the tax concession.  I would prefer if the Minister would consider changing the section so that these companies would move automatically to the 10 per cent rate if they are operating at present under the zero regime and that they would not have to re-apply, with all the uncertainty that gives rise to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Noonan, very strongly in his plea to the Minister to introduce the amendment sought on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said before, I believe the bias in favour of financial services in Dublin is doing untold harm to the industrial estate <Col N="827" /> in Shannon where the off-shore banking idea originated.  Previous Ministers, including Deputy Noonan, have been at pains for some time to assure the companies in the industrial zone that the regime operating from 1990 would be the same as that which operated prior to that date.  This legislation which gives additional powers to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce puts the whole matter in doubt.  What amazes me is that the Department of Industry and Commerce who seem to be so caring about the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and gave them a new role, do not seem to have advised the Minister for Finance that these changes will have a definite effect on companies in the industrial zone.</P>
    <P>As I have said, superior grants and aids are being given to the Custom House Docks site in the financial services area. Maybe this word is being over-used at present but the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, has hijacked this whole idea for himself.  He said, as did the Minister for Finance last year, that Shannon would get the same treatment as the Custom House Docks site.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In this Finance Bill the Minister is seeking to give greater relief to companies setting up in the Custom House Docks site against those already in existence in the Shannon free zone.  As far as I can see the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will not rest easy until they have Guinness Peat moved from Shannon and into this infamous site, the Custom House Docks site.</P>
    <P>One thing came from the meeting in Killarney: we have a lot of confidence in the economy.  All the leaders of industry said that changes had taken place but one thing they were all agreed on was that the Custom House Docks site is not getting off the ground, that it is very slowly creeping into existence.  I am sorry to be so parochial about this matter but when you come from the west, and the Minister will understand it, you have to defend against the big boys in this big city.  Companies want to get into the docks site and <Col N="828" /> the Minister wants to put them there. Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not seem to be aware that he is taking onto himself new powers under the Finance Bill in order to give licences to the industries already in existence in the industrial estate in Shannon.  I support very strongly the appeal to the Minister by Deputy Michael Noonan to put down a suitable amendment on Report Stage.  Nothing will convince me but that the good companies that are in Shannon and the mid-west region will be transferred to this unholy docks site just to prove that it has the right origins, that it is 1,000 years old, and maybe poor Clare will be the sufferer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I cannot agree with that.  Under section 39A a company had to fulfil a condition with regard to initial investment, broadly new investment, expansion or substantial reorganisation of its business before the Minister for Finance could issue a certificate to enable the business to qualify for relief under the 10 per cent scheme. This condition is deleted by this section with effect from 6 April 1988.  All Shannon relief companies may now apply for manufacturing relief which will be available until 31 December 2000, in place of Shannon relief.  The old licences will be done away with in 1990 and companies will apply for the new 10 per cent licences.  It would be most unusual for anyone to be refused those licences.  All we are asking is that when that is being done we would review each company and <Col N="829" /> get them to agree to performance criteria, in the same way as is done with any new application in any part of the country, whether in Shannon or in the Custom House Docks site.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What the Minister has said is the difficulty.  Section 32 as drafted is a line and a half and simply takes out section 39A of the Finance Act, 1980.  In doing so it leaves the company in the position of a new company coming into the country.  The uncertainty that has hung over the existing companies has been as to what would happen post-1990.  Would they have to go from zero rating to 47 per cent or 43 per cent as it will be in 1990?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept it was quite difficult but having friends out there was a help.  Whether they will be there next year or who will be there is another question but we might have some friends there.  I would have thought that zero rated companies in Shannon would have automatically gone onto the 10 per cent regime once the Minister had concluded successfully the negotiations with the Commission.  That is not now to happen.  The manner in which this is being achieved now is by deleting the section.  Zero rated Shannon based companies will be treated like new applicants, like new industries being set up, and an application will have to be submitted to the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a licence before the 10 per cent tax regime applies to them. <Col N="830" /> The Minister has now indicated that the reason it is being done in this way is so that he can have the opportunity of putting performance criteria on companies. This is the net issue.  As soon as the Minister starts talking about imposing performance criteria on existing companies, on how they will operate post-1990, and making this a condition of the benefits of the 10 per cent tax regime, a question mark is put over the future of the company and over their relationships with their future customers and trading partners.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister, rather than just deleting the section, would not introduce an amendment on Report Stage which would positively state that all companies at present operating in the Shannon Free Zone that have the zero status would automatically be issued with licences to enable them to operate under the benefit of the 10 per cent tax regime. Instead of being helpful the Minister has confirmed the doubts that have been voiced and has made it more difficult for the companies to operate.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider an amendment on Report Stage and to be helpful about this matter.  Will the companies be in a position next week, when this Bill goes through the Seanad, to apply for licences?  It would be helpful if the Minister gave a commitment that licences would be issued over the next couple of months.  By doing so, companies would know now what their position would be in 1990.  If the Minister keeps them on the promise and takes them up against the wire in 1990 there will be a bit of a shake-out and there will be a real problem. They will not make any decision which involves expansion or further investment in the zone until the uncertainty is removed.</P>

      <P>The main problem, as the Deputy rightly referred to in his capacity as Minister in dealing with this issue in Brussels some time ago, was the difficulty about getting them to agree to drop this condition of initial investment. That is gone.  That is what we are doing here.  The performance criterion is that there should be at least 15 jobs. That is not too unreasonable.  We have performance criteria for the 10 per cent companies in Shannon, and these have not been applied to exempt companies. When the 10 per cent is applied so also must the criteria be applied.  That is the position.  I do not think it is necessary to consider any Report Stage amendment. Companies can apply now if they so wish but, when they get their licence, they will go on the 10 per cent rate.  They can do it now or wait until 1990.</P>

      <P>Be fair Minister, Eighty jobs in County Clare and Shannon town, where there is very high unemployment, would be as welcome there as they are in the Dublin Docks site.  I hate to come back to this point, but I want to comment on the way the officers of the Department of Finance advise successive Ministers, and I am not excluding this Minister.  In the case of the off-shore banking, they could not accept the proposal from the Shannon Development Company unless 40 jobs were guaranteed.  When the pressure was put on and we had a local Minister for Industry and Commerce, that number was reduced to 20 and financial service companies agreed this was a reasonable performance criterion. With the transfer of the financial services to the Custom House Docks site, instead of requiring a performance criterion of 15 people, I understand from the Minister and the Taoiseach that companies with just two employees will be accepted.  The Minister has it in his power in this instance to make a reasonable change in the legislation, as requested by Deputy Noonan to give the companies already in existence the confidence to go forward.</P>

The expectation was that all companies operating in the Shannon free zone would move to the 10 per cent regime in 1990. Subsequent to the announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that negotiations had been successfully completed with the Commission, this was widely believed.  The Minister has opened our debate by suggesting that performance criteria will be required. Initially he seemed to indicate that there would be no problem because if the companies are there they will be licensed.

      <P>I am not saying anything different.  I said a performance criterion was necessary for 10 per cent companies.  That is the position now and it will be no different when applied to companies in Shannon.  Normally the performance criterion is that 15 jobs be provided. The Deputy tells me there are some exempt companies with fewer than 15 jobs.  When they apply to get into the 10 per cent tax rate, I am sure special consideration will be given to those companies. It will not be the intention of anybody dealing with this issue to have tax exempt companies, which are applying to get into the 10 per cent tax regime, closed because they do not fulfil the performance criterion.  What we are trying to do for Shannon is to increase the number of jobs and to ask companies to co-operate because, as the Deputy rightly said, if we had the situation which Brussels was requesting, it would be a totally different ball game.  They have moved quite a bit of the way and it is only right when we are going to have the 10 per cent rate &mdash; not 43 per cent as the Deputy suggests &mdash; that we should have some criteria applied before licences are given.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Since the Minister has gone that distance he should go a little further and frame an amendment on Report Stage which would remove the uncertainty because he has as good as said it will be automatic.  Why not move an amendment on Report Stage <Col N="835" /> and put the section beyond doubt?  If the Minister did this, he would not be creating a precedent because there are no zero companies anywhere else.  He can quantify the number of companies to which this would apply.  There is no question of precedents or tax avoidance schemes being created.  It is a quantifiable number of existing companies and the Minister is moving them from a zero tax rating to a 10 per cent tax rating.  I appeal to the Minister to take the uncertainty out of this and to frame an amendment for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised an issue which has not been answered.  I believe that the performance criterion was not a condition of the European Community Commission sanctioning the 10 per cent tax regime for companies.  It is my belief that the performance criterion is being added locally.  I do not believe it was a decision taken in Brussels at all.  The Minister should go the whole way, remove the uncertainty, because undoubtedly there is uncertainty being created.  It is not a big issue either for the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance and it would be helpful.</P>

      <P>There can be no question of lack of control.  There has to be some control.  However, there have been abuses perpetrated in regard to these companies.  The Government must maintain and exercise control over any exemption or relief they give.  This constitutes substantial relief.  Indeed, we were very fortunate in having succeeded in getting the approval of Brussels for it and for the financial services centre at the Custom House Docks site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Noonan's concern. I have no doubt whatever that the companies involved in the Shannon area, effecting this change between now and 1990, will be in a position to come forward, agree a business plan with the Exchequer or the Revenue Commissioners, get their licence and go on to the 10 per cent rate.  It is in their interest to do so because, as the Deputy rightly said, if they do not do so they go on to <Col N="836" /> the 43 per cent rate.  We must endeavour to avoid such an occurrence.  We must have some control along the line, some performance criterion, so that we do not have 15 individuals running into any place, whether it be the Custom House Docks site or the Shannon Free Airport Development area, setting up companies with one person employed in an office with a telephone.  Nobody wants that and I am sure the Deputy does not want it either.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept that absolutely.  In the context of new companies the Minister is absolutely right and I am very glad he has taken that line. One of my concerns is that the performance criterion which might be applied to companies in, say, the Custom House Docks site, would not be firm enough.  I am glad of the Minister's assurance on what is the policy in this connection. What we are talking about in the Shannon area are existing companies, operating under one tax regime, that will be moving to another tax regime.  These are not new companies coming in.  They are there because it is a tax haven; that is why they set up there in the first instance.  If there is any doubt about their future &mdash; many of these could as easily be located in the Channel Islands, The Bahamas or wherever &mdash; it is not the company about which I am thinking but the individuals they employ.  Fifty, 60 or 70 jobs, if one is talking about Dublin city, might not amount to an awful lot. When one is talking of a rural constituency, especially in County Clare, 60 or 70 jobs amount to an awful lot.  I do not think they should be put at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any diminution of Government responsibility or control for ensuring that there is no tax avoidance in suggesting that companies operating under one regime at present could automatically go onto the other.  If there is to be any expansion thereafter, which requires fixed assets grants or other subvention, obviously they will have to submit a company plan or profile and the Minister will have a chance to deal with the matter.  I contend there should be an <Col N="837" /> automatic transfer from the zero to the 10 per cent rate.  To be truthful, I do not think it was even a policy decision.  It is my belief that this was the easiest way to draft it because all the parliamentary draftsmen had to do was introduce a section, a line and a half long, to remove section 39A from the Finance Act, 1980, and that would do the trick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>The reservations I have in regard to this section and indeed the debate itself arise from the incoherent tax incentive components we are now institutionalising.  I should like to ask the Minister: when will we get a 10 per cent tax rate in the Sligo Industrial Estate? Presumably, that will be contained in next year's Finance Bill.  If we wanted to be really clever, we could build a little tax haven, say, for Ringaskiddy, on the grounds that it is virgin territory.  Where are we going to stop?  Simultaneously we claim to be an Irish region for European Community purposes.  Let us get some more brilliant ideas and, say, apply a 15 per cent tax rate to areas covered by the western package.  At the rate we are going, we should not experience much difficulty in giving the tax harmonisation bureaucrats of Europe a succession of nervous breakdowns because, by the time they disentangle what we are proposing here, by 1992, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the EC and the politicians of the day will have had a collective breakdown.  It is becoming ridiculous.  A little bit of Dublin is now a tax haven, carrying a rate of 10 per cent, ringed by Sheriff Street, the Custom House, the Departments of Health and the Environment, Irish Life and Aras Mhic Dhiarmada owned by the State.  I can think of an even more brilliant idea, since we own Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, why not have a 10 per cent tax rate applicable within that building?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing entirely with it.  I regard the way in which the State and successive Ministers for Finance have approached this question as bordering on industrial incentive farce.  In terms of promoting industry here, it would be far better to have a uniform tax rate applicable throughout the country, albeit a low tax rate, and not have the kind of circumstances prevailing now in which we are pumping artificial millions into Shannon, basically on transfer pricing, not on a 10 per cent tax rate, with the Revenue Commissioners looking in the other direction.  We are endeavouring then to build up another new regime at the Custom House Docks site, with all the licensing, special assessments, special committees of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners trying desperately to ascertain who will qualify for this or that bit of a certificate, with the accountancy and taxation professions enjoying themselves no end.</P>
      <P>One might well ask: for what purpose? The purpose is one of employment, industrial development, the rejuvenation of certain areas.  That can be done without getting embroiled in a 10 per cent tax rate.  Indeed the scheme of relief for Shannon has outlived itself in many ways and should be absorbed into a broader, regional, national framework within which it would have a real impact.  Then the Dublin position and the other special areas incentives would not be of such great import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have gone down the road to virtual nonsense in refinement, in a small country with the number of people employed <Col N="839" /> in the industries themselves being capable of being contained on three A4 printouts which would show the companies' names and the bulk of their employment content.  There is no real rationale behind this further refinement.  I suggest to the Minister that, instead of this, he should have a uniform tax rate and give other reliefs, for example, the rates relief which is given in relation to the Customs House Dock site.  That could act as an incentive for inner city development.  Some other form of relief could be given in Shannon which would not be related to specialised 10 per cent schemes of this nature.</P>
    <P>We are now in a farcical situation and the more it is elongated the more pressure there will be from other parts of the country for special reliefs and special consideration. I could name a half a dozen places, for example, Waterford and Cork which equally feel they are entitled to the same specialised tax consideration which, of course, we cannot apply because we would make even bigger fools of ourselves if we were to develop that structure. The Minister should consider this seriously because he purports to be a reforming Minister in terms of public finances and if he is he should equally be a reforming Minister in terms of taxation reliefs.  In any event, I believe the European Community will get sick to death of us by 1992 and thereon because already our special pleading in a whole range of areas is becoming, to say the least, rather tiresome to the Community and the submissions we make for regional aid are very confusing.  It is time the Minister took a long hard look at the real impact of what is before us today in this section of the Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39e:</P>
      <P>In page 39, after line 45, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) In this subsection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;the Area&rsquo; has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of the said section 39B;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;foreign life assurance business&rsquo; means relevant trading operations within the meaning of the said section 39B consisting of life assurance business with policy holders and annuitants who reside outside the State;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;foreign unit trust business&rsquo; means relevant trading operations within the meaning of the said section 39B consisting of the management of the investments of one or more qualifying unit trusts;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;qualifying unit trust&rsquo; means a unit trust scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that is a registered unit trust scheme within the meaning of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972,</P>
      <P>(b)  the business of which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  is carried on in the area, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  is not so carried on but is carried on in the State and would be carried on in the area but for circumstances outside the control of the person or persons carrying on the business,</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(c)  as respects which all holders of units in the scheme are persons resident outside the State;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" />&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax, as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Tax Acts, the rate at which any tax is chargeable (before any credit is allowed for foreign tax) in respect of income arising or chargeable gains accruing from securities or possessions in any place outside the State that are investments of a foreign life assurance business or investments managed by a foreign unit trust business shall not exceed 10 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment of section 33 provides for the insertion of a new subsection (4) in section 33.  The existing section 33 provides for certain amendments of section 39B &mdash; inserted by the Finance Act, 1987 &mdash; of the Finance Act, 1980, which provides for the extension of the 10 per cent scheme of relief from corporation tax &mdash; Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980 &mdash; to financial services carried on or to be carried on in the Custom House Docks site.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (4) provides for a 10 per cent rate of income tax, corporation tax, or capital gains tax, as the case may be, in respect of investments held outside the State which are funds of a foreign life assurance business in respect of which a certificate has been given under section 39B, that is, it is life assurance business with persons outside the State, and investments held outside the State which belong to unit trusts, all of the unit holders of which reside outside the State where the business of managing the investment is covered by a certificate under section 39B, that is, the business of managing the investments is relevent to trading operations under section 39B.</P>
    <P>The provision is designed to allow for an effective 10 per cent rate of income tax in respect of investment income and gains which, since they would not be trading income for tax purposes, or since they would not be chargeable to corporation tax, could not qualify for the 10 per cent rate provided by Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980.  I announced this amendment in my Second Stage speech as part <Col N="842" /> of the packet of measures to help to promote the financial services centre and create employment in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed not only to the amendment but also to the section. In a desperate effort to convince anybody and everybody who might call themselves a financial trader to go down to the Custom House Docks site every conceivable incentive is being held out to them.  Previously a company had to carry out their trading operations on a premises occupied on an arms length basis under the arrangement with a non-connected person.  That requirement is now being removed.  The question arises: why is it really being removed?  Will any costing be done in relation to the impact of this section?  Have any costings been done in relation to the addition of dealings in commodity futures or commodity options to the classes of trading operations which may be certified by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of relief?  What is the revenue foregone for next year and the year after on the basis of the further incentive that it is now being brought into operation in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has reached the stage where, under virtually any pretext, you can get into the site and if you pay your 10 per cent you get your rates relief and every other relief.  I do not propose to go back over the other reliefs but there are no less than 13 incentives being offered.  This is a new incentive which is now being built in to encourage people to move down to the Custom House Docks site.  I am opposed to this kind of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement of the worst kind.  I should like to point out to the Minister that, apart from a very attenuated comment justifying the introduction of this amendment, there will be no indepth explanation giving any logical reason why this amendment is necessary. I suspect that representations were made directly to the Minister by a few people who said they were anxious to go into the site but they could not and they wanted another amendment.  The next Finance Bill, if there is one and if the Minister is in charge of it in 1989, will contain further amendments so we might as well give 10 <Col N="843" /> per cent relief to anything and everything that moves on the site.  We should ask the medical profession to go down and pay 10 per cent.</P>

Just about anything and everything can get onto that site for 10 per cent relief.  Where is this going to stop?  I would go down there tomorrow morning and build a cottage on the seafront if I could get 10 per cent relief. Where is the Minister going to stop?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be great to be a caretaker in the Customs House Docks site if one could get 10 per cent.  It is farcical.  Is there anybody left who cannot get in there?  I suspect that there is not a postmistress in the country who, if she made a decent application, could not get in there at this stage.  The Irish Life across the road have their filing cabinets lined up to move 50 yards across to the site to go from a 50 per cent tax regime down to a 10 per cent tax regime.  Bringing this brainwave into operation will lose us about £25 million on the ordinary taxation basis to have a very exceptional tax haven for a very few financial companies who have decided that they are going to throw their lot in with the Government. These few companies who are in this in a big way, American, Japanese and particularly Irish companies, see themselves making a killing.  They will not have to go to the Isle of Man any more. <Col N="844" /> They just have to go to the Custom House Docks site to get a straight 10 per cent because that, in effect, is what we are providing.  Any of the financial services people I have met around this city are enormously critical of this because it involves the loss of revenue, the total loss of control over what is going on there, and now the criteria for getting a licence to get in there are so loose that anything and everything can get in there on a general 10 per cent basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister has further opened the door in section 33, in a way which I find objectionable, at a time when we are desperately trying to conserve and maintain ordinary State revenue for essential social and public expenditure, and when the Minister finds it desperately difficult to succeed in keeping a few hundred thousand pounds together on rod licences.  What is he doing now?  He is handing back about £2 million in taxes on this thing in the Custom House Docks site.  There is no consistency.  It is not creating jobs.  The Government approached one of the American banks and were almost prostrate on the ground to get them to put down five jobs, even on paper, and the Government would give them a certificate.  Whether the jobs will ever materialise does not really matter.  This is nothing but a contrived tax haven dreamed up in the dining rooms of Government Buildings with a few stockbrokers getting into the buzz words of developmental structures and international financial services.  It would be wonderful for these people to pass it on the way to Government Buildings in the morning and say that this is their creation. For what?  Every pension fund manager, every financial services operator in Dublin will be laughing all the way to the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sad that I have to be so critical of it because we need responsible financial services in operation, not this touting around of further relief to people in a desperate bid to get them to move down to the Custom House Docks site.  I say that as one who, in Government, totally supported the rejuvenation of that area and totally supported the substantial <Col N="845" /> reliefs that we gave, notably the ten year rate reliefs and the further major reliefs on capital investment in the area.  We were very careful about messing around with tax structures.  We did not fall for that kind of special tax haven proposition which is now being further developed in section 33.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to this speech, or a variant of it, for the fourth or fifth time.  There is a certain inconsistency in Deputy Desmond's contributions on these occasions.  On one side of the long playing record on the subject of the Custom House Docks site we have the rip-off tune played, and the rip-off tune is that the Minister is giving a whole load of pals, and institutions who are in his pocket politically a tremendous break from which they are supposed to benefit and for which they are to be eternally grateful and thereby secure his poltical future for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the theme trotted out on every second day.  Every other day we hear the exact opposite theory &mdash; and it amuses me because it is entirely inconsistent &mdash; that this is such a dumb project that no amount of incentives would persuade anybody to go near it. One thing I would like to get across if I can to Deputy Desmond in particular, and to Deputy Mac Giolla, is that when one gives a tax break to an activity which, if it were not for the tax break would not occur, one does not lose money.  If nobody is going to come to Ireland and set up an international futures market in Dublin, any tax break that is given is no loss to our Exchequer.  If nobody is going to trade here in foreign unit trusts, any tax break given to anybody to do that here is no loss to our revenue.  The sooner the left wing parties get it firmly in their heads that tax breaks on activities which would otherwise not occur are not moneys lost, the sooner we will have a rational debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Deputy Desmond would not <Col N="846" /> know the difference between an offshore bank and a delph piggybank lying on a marina if he saw it.  His attitude in all of this seems to be based on a very primitive economic theory, that is, that if one decides on some entirely artificial basis that there is a revenue loss in relation to an activity, that is somehow a rip-off on the people.  Let me say clearly &mdash; and I wish the parties on the left would get this through their heads &mdash; if an activity is not going to occur here unless there is some special tax concession given to it, there is no point in mouthing about the cost to the Exchequer of any tax break given to that activity.  It is simply dishonest, illogical and self-contradictory to keep on making these speeches because they get us nowhere.  We have heard Deputy Desmond's view.  It is based on a fallacy and, as far as I am concerned, the sooner Deputy Desmond accepts the proposition that there is a legitimate role for giving a tax break to foreign investment to come to this country, that tax breaks such as the Shannon Free Airport Zone and the International Financial Services Centre are there because the activities in question would not otherwise occur, the sooner we will have some rationality in this debate.  If we continue interminably on this notion that every penny given by way of a tax break to every activity, whether or not it would occur irrespective of whether the tax break it is given, is a penny lost to the poor of Ireland, we will never address development here rationally or honestly and we will surrender completely to what I believe is the worst form of demagoguery, with the greatest of respect to the former Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what I want to address myself to.  I would remind our legal colleague, whose brilliance in legal affairs I would in no way dispute, that in terms of financial Bills going through this House I have had the experience of being involved in no less than <Col N="847" /> 30 over a period of 20 years and can, therefore, claim to have some rudimentary and somewhat extensive knowledge of those financial Bills.  His remarks about piggybank economics sound rather hollow.  If you add together the assets of Allied Irish Banks, of the Bank of Ireland and of the building societies what would you get?  You would get half the asset value of one building society in the UK, the Halifax.  That is just to give the Minister a little bit of perspective about the relative weight of the Irish economy and its totally profound impact on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We should not have presumptions and we should not have specialised Mickey Mouse havens within a small country of 3.5 million people with a relatively tiny financial structure.  We should not go down the road of mammoth financial structures of attractions of that nature.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks in relation to the proposed amendment are that far from developing financial services and international respect for those services which we must have, both within the European Community and in our interlocked relationship with the sterling area &mdash; totally profound in many ways &mdash; the <Col N="848" /> reactions I have had from reputable economic and financial sources are that they are not at all impressed.  I regard them as no more than a contrived minor tax haven effort which will not have any real effect in terms of the relief offered.  It should be discarded.  There is nothing particularly rhetorical in my comments on it.  There is nothing particularly objectionable in it.  Those with whom I have spoken at accountant level, at economist level, at public service level and at Revenue level have not been impressed with what we have come up with in this Custom House scheme.  The Minister may hold otherwise but I believe that half a dozen people came together and codded the Government into that particular concession. They are still at it because they are seeking to extend additional classes of trading operations which will be certified by the Minister.  The Minister might as well certify all and sundry because it is having no impact other than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything Deputy McDowell has said.  While Deputy Desmond might have 20 years' experience he did not acquire much knowledge about international and financial services on the way.  He may have the experience but he does not, seemingly, have the knowledge.  He is inclined to forget that this kind of business in general is not being carried out in Ireland.  We are trying to attract it in here and create thousands of jobs which I thought would be of interest to a representative of the Labour Party but apparently it is not.  Perhaps it is because of where he lives.  The fact is that this adds no cost whatsoever to the Exchequer.  This kind of business is not carried out here at present.  We would like to see this kind of business being established here and making profits so that the Exchequer gains by getting the 10 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International financial services will be carried on in foreign currency, dealings in puts would not qualify for the 10 per cent rate.  Regarding the general issue which we discussed in relation to nonexempt companies in Shannon and the <Col N="849" /> approval of companies for the Custom House Docks area, each company will have to go through, before it gets approval, an examination of certain criteria, mainly a performance criterion &mdash; as I said earlier to Deputy Carey and to Deputy Noonan &mdash; on the number of jobs that are of benefit to the economy.  In instances where there are some &mdash; and they are very few &mdash; companies carrying on a business here of an international nature who move to that area they will only get a licence on the basis of the incremental value to this economy.  What is being done here &mdash; unlike what Deputy Desmond has said &mdash; is being welcomed almost everywhere.  I do not know where the accountants, bankers or public servants are that Deputy Desmond has been speaking to because I have not heard or seen any of their comments but I must say the opposite is the case.  Almost everywhere you go particularly when you meet people who understand what is being done, and they are in the majority, have nothing but welcome for this project. That is why I have no hesitation in recommending all that is contained in section 33 and the amendments I have proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I understand that the Minister is anxious that additional jobs be provided in the economy. I appreciate that very much.  The State must provide the circumstances in which these jobs can be made available. In that regard section 33 and the following sections should have applied to the Shannon Free Zone as well as to the Custom House Docks site to give us a reasonable opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright:</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the section and the amendments a point was made that because of the smallness of our economy this project might not be wise. Because of the fact that we are a small <Col N="850" /> economy and our business in this area is limited, to say the least, we need to make some effort to expand into that type of business.  The Minister, his staff and all the relevant people attached to the Revenue Commissioners should ensure that companies which are already in existence and trading here would not be allowed the opportunity to move in and conduct business which is already being conducted in this city.</P>
      <P>It could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be classified under this heading as a financial services sector area.  There may be a danger of movement of firms and corporations in existing businesses into the area and merely transferring jobs from one area to another. People in specially designated areas have the idea that they are well placed as far as existing financial institutions are concerned. However, I accept that there is a need for some development of this nature and I am in agreement with this amendment to the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps the figure is not correct but it was mentioned to me by somebody who is not considered a fool in financial circles.  If that is the case, we are not going in the right direction because the poor, unfortunate taxpayer will carry the can.  The principle is right but we must attract the right people.  In this regard, we may be wiser this time next year or the year after.  It is important for the Opposition to point out that this can happen.  I do not wish to be a scaremonger or irresponsible and I hope that the area will attract the people which the <Col N="851" /> country needs to generate the kind of financial development which I should like to see and which would create jobs. However, the financial institutions must not use it as another means of avoiding their responsibilities in regard to paying their fair share of tax.  If there is any danger of this happening, the Minister should examine the matter again.  If firms in Baggot Street, Ballsbridge or other places move their offices to the Custome House Docks area to deal with foreign trading, it will not create employment. However, we must try to attract major international pension and insurance funds into this country and give the companies concerned tax incentives. However, these incentives should not be paid for by the PAYE taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Existing companies can only move into the Custom House Docks area on international business and they will only get a licence if activity is substantially increased, which means that they must produce additional jobs.  That is the real benefit to the economy and many firms who do that business and have it based abroad at present &mdash; Irish companies &mdash; will move that business back to the financial services area, thereby creating extra jobs and they will pay tax of 10 per cent, which we do not get at present, from the profits arising from the activity located here instead of abroad.</P>

    <P>In regard to Deputy Carey's question about extending the provisions of amendment No. 39e to Shannon, there has been no request to date for similar reliefs in respect of Shannon Airport, which can offer 10 per cent relief in respect of a much, wider variety of services than the Custom House Docks site which has been directed solely at financial services. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the new relief should be introduced in respect of the Custom House Docks only.  If it directed solely at financial services. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the new relief should at introduced in respect of the Custom House Docks only.  If it becomes apparent that such reliefs would be taken up if they were available to foreign life assurance or unit trust businesses located in Shannon Airport, the <Col N="852" /> matter will be reviewed in relation to next year's Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bank of Ireland spent £375 million in acquiring an American bank and Irish Life spent £75 million in buying into the United States.  If they decide to base that financial trade in the Custom House Docks area, they stand to operate on a 10 per cent basis on their returns.  This is far from the great bonanza we were led to believe it would be, it is virtually a &ldquo;Fortuna&rdquo; for existing Irish financial institutions to move a few treasury managers &mdash; there are not many in Dublin &mdash; from Baggot Street or Ballsbridge and send them to the Custom House Docks area.  They will not create employment, they will merely handle their overseas investment from that area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There need not be, as the Minister is aware, the slightest growth in employment because they will qualify on a certified basis.  The certification structure is quite loose despite the rigorous verbiage the Minister has surrounded it with.  When the pressure was put on in regard to the group relief, when the developers and banks said to the Government that they would not invest their money in the development of this site unless they were given group relief, the Government caved in like a pack of cards overnight contrary to the best advice of the Department of Finance.

      <P>We need a good banking system here and it is incumbent on everybody, irrespective of their political views, to give the banks a certain amount of commonsense support.  I am concerned about the international financial services sector and what strikes me as interesting is that Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland, and other large companies, have bought into big international companies and corporations.  Will the Minister say if international financial dealings at the financial services sector will be processed through our normal exchange control regulations?  How will those dealings be examined?  How will those transactions be monitored?  Is the Minister in a position to say if the Central Bank will be permitted to examine those dealings?</P>
      <P>Some of the financial institutions who have decided to set up business at the Custom House Docks area have been carrying on business here for decades and it would worry me if they have joined big international corporations with the intention of availing of facilities there to reduce their contribution to our revenue. My reason for raising this matter is because of the huge amount of money that leaves this country in the form of profits, through the black hole.  It is important that we establish safeguards in regard to this area.  I accept that we must see to it that our financial institutions are allowed complete with international financial institutions on an equal basis and we should give them every facility.</P>

In regard to off-shore banking, officials from Shannon had to trek to Dublin with their hands outstretched to the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce but they got no succour.  However, when an effort was being made to sell the Custom House Docks area in London, Mr. Ó Cofaigh and other big wheels in the Irish banking industry were flown to London and many doors opened for them.

      <P>Section 35 of the Finance Bill enables companies carrying on international financial services activities in the Custom House Docks area and qualifying for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to pay interest to non-residents without deducting tax.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the same concession to 10 per cent companies at Shannon in the interest of greater equality of treatment as between Shannon and the docks area. Shannon companies which are at present exempt from corporation tax will not qualify for this concession.  Such companies, having no liability to corporation tax and being in a position to distribute tax-free dividends, have enormous advantages over 10 per cent companies and it is not necessary to give them further benefits.  By virtue of section 32 these companies can now qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  When they opt to avail of the 10 per cent rate they too will enjoy the proposed exemption from withholding tax on interest paid to non-residents.</P>

      <P>The opening statement by the Minister introducing an extremely important amendment to this section was somewhat derisory.  What exactly are the <Col N="857" /> financial implications of this measure? Will the Minister elaborate?  If this exemption in terms of interest is being given, how much is estimated to be involved?  What exactly is being instituted?  We are in effect saying: pay the interest and it will not be subject to withholding tax.  Many people throughout the country are experiencing problems in paying such tax.  Why this exemption?  What will it cost the State in terms of existing financial services activities going to the Custom House Docks area?  What will it cost by way of revenue foregone?  What representations did the Minister receive on the matter?  We are entitled to know the answers to these questions before we give <i>carte blanche</i> to the introduction of yet another exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for questions to be asked so that I can respond.  I said at the outset I would refrain from intervening unless intervention was warranted.</P>
      <P>Many non-residents can obtain interest paid by individuals or companies resident in the State free of tax under existing tax treaties with the country of residence of the recipient of the interest.  In relation to relevant trading operations in the Custom House Docks area, this section extends the facility to all non-residents, irrespective of whether there is a treaty which provides for withholding tax on interest.  The general treatment of interest payments under double taxation conventions is that interest is not taxed in the paying country but is subject to taxation in the country in which the recipient is resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential for the effective operation of the international financial services centre in the Custom House Docks area that companies providing financial services from the centre to non-resident clients should be free to pay interest without deduction of tax, regardless of the country of residence of the recipient.  The centre is entering into a highly competitive arena with longer and better established competitors and it is critical <Col N="858" /> that this real obstacle to its trading activities, which may be carried on with non-resident persons in any part of the world, should be removed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of costs, as the international financial services activities being carried on in the Custom House Docks area will consist mainly of newly generated business and as existing double taxation conventions enable interest payments to be made gross from Ireland to a considerable number of countries, there is not substantive cost to the Exchequer occasioned by this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would agree that where a double taxation convention does not apply this exemption will be of particular benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond:</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, we transfer some of our resources to an area where a double taxation convention does not apply.  We have double taxation agreements with many countries but there are a number of others with whom we have no agreement.  Some of them are tax haven areas.  We transfer our resources there, re-invest into the Custom House Docks site and the interest paid out there from has a total exemption because of the absence of a double taxation agreement. The withholding tax is quite substantial and I ask the Minister to indicate the safeguards which exist to prevent this form of evasion.  Large amounts of money are leaving the country as a result of evasion, apart from straightforward transfers of manufacturing profits.  A lot of money is leaked out or filtered out and this could become another mechanism.  I seek the assurance of the Minister as I am still not satisfied as to the precise import.  This is another incentive for people to come in, but what way do they <Col N="859" /> come in?  If they come in by the back door and there is no double taxation agreement with the country in question, is there, in effect, avoidance of the withholding tax in relation to such interest paid?</P>

      <P>The whole purpose of the exercise is to exempt such people from that tax, to attract them in here. For the information of the House, there are double taxation arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom with respect to tax on income, capital gains, stamp duties and capital acquisition tax.  There are double taxaction agreement arrangements in operation with Australia, Switzerland and Sweden covering taxes on income and capital gains.  There are arrangements between the Government of Ireland and the Governments of Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, the United States of America and Zambia, respectively, for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income.

If I were an American financial consultant, with whose country we have a double taxation agreement, I would look upon that statement with a great deal of jaundice.  I leave it with the Minister, but it shows up my fundamental principle that when you try out this kind of exercise on a refined basis, the more you go down the road the more it unravels and the more you try to circumscribe it and give exemptions, the less satisfactory it is.  In this country everybody pays withholding tax except some shyster with whom we do not have a double taxation agreement who sends in £20 million or £30 million to be manipulated within the Dublin Financial Services Centre and the interest is sent out without application of the withholding tax.

      <P>Section 41 is not part of the general scheme of the reduction of capital allowances.  It is an anti-avoidance measure designed to counter a scheme which has arisen in various quarters and which exploits the industrial building loans provision by avoiding a clawback of allowances granted through the balancing charge procedure when a building is effectively sold although the full title is not disposed of.  Section 41 amends section 265 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to provide for the application of a balancing charge where a consideration, other than a premium, falling to be treated as rent is received in respect of <Col N="866" /> an interest which is less than a relevant interest as defined in section 268 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in an industrial building.</P>
      <P>In the absence of this provision it is possible for the owner of an industrial building to claim capital allowances and then realise a major proportion of the value of the building through the creation of an interest marginally inferior to his own interest, for example, if he owns a freehold interest, by creating a 999 year lease.  Because he retains a superior interest, the amount of the value realised is not reflected by a clawback of any other capital allowances granted.  This section ensures that from now on, such value received will be charged to tax so as to recoup capital allowances previously given.</P>

      <P>41b.  In page 47, subsection (1), lines 36 to 41, to delete paragraph (d) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) machinery or plant provided before the 1st day of April, 1991, for the purposes of a trade or part of a trade of hotel-keeping carried on in a building or structure or part thereof (including machinery or plant provided by a lessor to a lessee for use in such a trade or part thereof) where a binding contract for the provision of the said building or structure was entered into after the 27th day of January, 1988, and before the 1st day of June, 1988.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in respect of capital allowances for plant or machinery for new hotel projects.  The overall objective of section 47 is to ensure that despite the general reduction in capital allowances which is taking place as part of the reform of company taxation 100 per cent allowances would continue to be available in certain limited circumstances.  The exceptions include new hotel projects.  The first amendment, amendment No. 41<i>b</i>, would ensure that the 100 per cent capital allowance would be available where a contract for the provision of a new hotel or a hotel extension was entered into between budget day and 1 June 1988.  The original wording was too wide and might have allowed in existing hotels which was not the intention.  The intention was rather <Col N="869" /> to ensure that projects which were being planned at the time of the budget on the basis of unrestricted capital allowances would go ahead.  To qualify, the machinery or plant must be brought into use under the contract by 1 April 1991.</P>
    <P>The second amendment, amendment No. 41<i>c</i>, merely corrects a lettering error in the original draft.  The third amendment, amendment No. 41<i>d</i>, would exempt new hotel projects covered by this section from the balancing charge which I have introduced under section 41 to counter abuses of the capital allowances system.  I am satisfied that the hotel projects in question are not on all fours with the cases of abuse at which section 41 is directed and if section 41 were to apply it could interfere with certain contingent financial arrangements envisaged as part of the financing of the hotel projects. The exemption is justified to ensure that new hotel projects already in train at the time of the budget can go ahead in the interests of investment and employment in the economy.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the general section, I wish the Minister to put on record the reasons that accelerated capital allowances for machinery, plant or industrial buildings should continue in these areas.  If tax reform along the lines on which the Minister has argued is the correct way to go, and if reduced accelerated capital allowances are to be traded off against lower rates of corporation tax, would it not seem valid that that should apply anywhere in the country?  In view of the fact that in the designated areas the 10 per cent regime applies, and it is not a case of accelerated allowances being traded against corporation tax rates of 50 per cent coming down to 43 per cent, I do not understand the reason for excepting these areas.  I do not see how they lie outside the scope of the Minister's <Col N="874" /> arguments for general reform of the corporation taxation system, with which we agree, along the lines of trading these allowances for lower rates of corporation tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is saying that the argument for the reduction of the accelerated capital allowances was a jobs argument basically. These allowances are certainly not assisting job creation.  In fact, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that they assist job losses.  The Minister accepted that argument on the issue of accelerated capital allowances and he is reducing them to 50 per cent eventually.  The main objective of designated areas is job creation, and we see examples in the Custom House Docks site, the Shannon Custom Free Airport area, the urban designated areas, which were for urban renewal, in addition to job creation.  However, to continue with unrestricted accelerated capital allowances in these areas seems to go against the whole purpose of designating the areas and the whole purpose of what the Minister is doing to assist job creation.  This Finance Bill represents a radical step for an Irish Government though in any other country it would not be seen as radical.  However having taken that step this section seems to remove that progress from a whole string of areas.  As we understood it, one of the purposes of the Bill was to assist in the creation of jobs, but giving unrestricted capital allowances in these areas does not seem to be assisting in that purpose.</P>

To give notice to projects approved for grant assistance by the industrial development agencies and not to have a cut-off point when people could be in the process of negotiations is the right way to proceed. Now we know that what is going to be <Col N="875" /> approved before 31 December 1988 will be OK but from there on the new regime will apply.  I think it is only right that we should have taken into account the policy of the Government in pursuing activities such as these areas allow, to have the unrestricted capital allowances in them.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The problem arises, and I am sure the Minister has adverted to it, in the overall context of what the Minister is proposing companies which are liable to a 50 per cent rate of corporation tax can see that if they lose on the accelerated allowances side they will gain on the corporation tax rate side and their rate will go down to 47 per cent in the first instance and then to 42 per cent.  That is fine.  On the other hand companies paying corporation tax at the rate of 10 per cent &mdash; all manufacturing companies and the manner in which manufacturing is defined in our industrial policy means that it will extend to service companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the third element of the package there are going to be certain parts of the country in which the 10 per cent regime applies but where the benefits of accelerated depreciation will still apply.  Now we have a new anomaly.  It will be more attractive to go into the Custom House Docks site, into Shannon, and into the inner cities for manufacturing industry than to go anywhere else in the region. The whole area of industrial incentives is a minefield but it appears that there is an attraction to go into certain parts of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. There is certainly an attraction to go into the Shannon customs free airport, not so much for the service companies but for manufacturing industry, because the full package of incentives, the 10 per cent corporation tax regime, the fixed assets <Col N="876" /> grants and accelerated depreciation, will apply in these restricted areas but will not longer apply in the rest of the country. Has that point been adverted to?  Has it been agreed by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because I know there will be some people contacting him who might not necessarily agree with that line.</P>

      <Col N="878" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I was querying the Minister as to whether or not he intended to introduce in good time the comprehensive measure which he spoke of in his contribution earlier in this debate.  It struck me that he had gone to some considerable lengths to assure the Progressive Democrats that he had the heads of a Bill already drafted, that he intended to do business on this Bill and that he would view the matter with some urgency.  What was equally apparent to me was that when The Labour Party moved a Bill in relation to local government and in particular in relation to the preservation of woodlands, they were told that the Government intended to bring in a comprehensive measure in relation to local government planning and development and they were asked to withdraw their Bill because the Government had this intention to bring in a reforming statute.  That was a year ago and nothing has been done about it.</P>
      <P>We are now told that the heads of a Bill are available.  That, as I understand it, means that each section of the Bill has been thought out and it is at least known in short form what the new Bill is to contain.  We asked that, if that were the case, we would be shown the heads of the Bill.  To use the graphic metaphor of Deputy Keating, he said he would not believe, until he put his fingers into the wounds, that these heads of Bills existed. We still have not been given any sight of the heads of the Bill that the Government have in contemplation and this strikes me as odd in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Birmingham told the House that there is a precedent for the Government to show the Opposition the heads of a Bill in order to convince them that they are really serious and that they have put their minds to work on the issues involved in the Bill.  We are now told that <Col N="879" /> we may not see the heads of the Bill.  No effort has been made to show us what the Government have in mind or even the rough outline of the legislation they have in contemplation.  This leads me to suspect that there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the minds of the Government as to precisely what they want to achieve.  If there is this degree of uncertainty, one thing is absolutely certain &mdash; we are not going to see this Bill put in place before 1991 at the earliest.  I will lay a bet with the junior Minister who is here that he will not have enacted a local government, planning and development, amending statute within two years of this date.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it will have gone through all the stages in the Dáil and Seanad and have passed under the President's seal within two years of today.  All the signs are that the Minister has not yet made up his mind as to precisely how he wants to deal with the compensation issue.  This is a complex issue.  We in the Progressive Democrats never claimed that our formulation of how to deal with the matter and how to curtail section 56 of the 1963 Act was the only one that could be chosen.  We say it is a workable way of achieving the results which we set out to achieves.  We make no apologies for having put in place what are, by any standards, fairly harsh and severe restrictions on the right to compensation.</P>
    <P>One of the effects of not accepting this Bill will be that the Government will bring in their own Bill.  Because of the rules of practice in this House there will not be a select committee to consider the Government's Bill.  The House will probably sit for weeks on end, because this is a complex and controversial measure, with three or four Deputies in this House debating the third Stage of that Bill when it comes about, a year from now or whatever.  One of the problems with that is that the rest of the House will be delayed while that is going on.  Private Members' Bill have the great advantage that they offer the House an opportunity to get on with something else and the Committee Stage of the Private <Col N="880" /> Members' Bill is dealt with by a select committee while not delaying the rest of this House from doing other more urgent business.  The Fine Gael Bill in relation to marriage breakdown which is now before a committee &mdash; even taking into account that there is an element of filibustering on behalf of the Minister's colleagues &mdash; is not delaying what is going on in this House.  What is going on in Setanta House does not stop the Dáil from functioning.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about Private Members' legislation is that if the Government always say: &ldquo;Please withdraw your Bill on Second Stage; we will bring in our own,&rdquo; first, it requires a Second Stage debate to take place all over again covering roughly the same territory.  This happened with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which Fine Gael brought in recently.  Secondly, it involves discussion by a full committee of this House which means further delays in legislation.  I am appealing to the Minister of State, if he really does have proposals to amend the law in relation to planning, to let the Progressive Democrats' Bill go to its Third Stage and put down his proposals by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>I heard what was said on the last occasion.  It was to the effect that it is not normally the practice for the Government to come up with proposals by way of an amendment to a Private Members' Bill but I cannot see why it should not be the practice.  It would save a lot of time and bother and would make for a more mature process of debate in this House if the Government addressed Private Members' Bills tendered by the Opposition in a serious frame of mind and put down their own proposals by way of amendment instead of insisting on bringing in their own legislation, lock, stock and barrel, <i>de novo</i>, as if nothing had happened before.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on what Deputy Quinn said on the last occasion.  He said that one of the deficiencies he saw in our Bill was the absence of any new scheme for quantifying compensation.  He was talking in terms of changing the law so that, instead of market value, there <Col N="881" /> would be what he called existing use value as the basis of compensation.  He had a graphic illustration of a coalyard on the quays for which the owners were compensated as though it were a site for building on.  There is a mistake in the Labour Party's thinking on that issue. Existing use value has nothing to do with the real value of any asset.  Many assets are under-used at any given time for a variety of reasons, one of which is that people are preparing to use them for another, more productive use.  To take them from people at less than their market value is to expropriate the owners to some extent.  There is no point in beating about the bush and saying that because you are not using your assets to their maximum possible extent at any given time they do not have a potential value for other use.  There is no point in pretending that market value is not a proper yardstick for compensation.</P>
    <P>I am interested to note that the Labour Party do not seem to take on board what effect our proposals to change the planning laws would have on the measure of compensation.  One of the reasons for which you could be refused compensation would be, for instance, that the development you had in mind would contravene the development plan for the area.  That would give to local authorities the power in many respects to control the level of compensation because, if the development plan specified that land should be used for housing only, the present open market value system of compensation would be dramatically reduced.</P>
    <P>I also noted the Minister's speech where he suggested that our proposal to alter the meaning of the term &ldquo;use&rdquo; as it is employed in section 56 would have a more far-reaching effect than perhaps we thought it might have when we drafted that measure.  I can assure him it would not.  Our proposal was to confine compensation to cases where there was no change of use.  Change of use is a term used in the 1953 statute which means a number of things.  It does not mean just any change but a change of use for which planning permission would be required. It means a substantial change of use, not <Col N="882" /> simply any alteration or just any change.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the reasoning used by the Minister in relation to our proposal to extend section 27 jurisdiction to the Circuit Court.  The Minister said the present arrangements in the High Court worked well and seemed to suggest that we should be reticent about extending section 27 to the Circuit Court.  I know from my practice as a barrister of cases where the fact that High Court proceedings were in issue has deterred many people, who had good section 27 applications, from going to court because residents' associations, small people, confronted with big speculators feel afraid of the potential costs if, for some unforeseen reason, the High Court should decide not to give an injunction, which is a discretionary relief, to them.</P>
    <P>I believe the extension of the section 27 power to the Circuit Court would have a very beneficial effect in making it into an available remedy.  It would allow small people to use section 27 with a realistic risk as to costs, and not a risk of costs which would totally discourage any but the richest or most confident ligitants from going to court.  Above all, it would have a geographical effect, because it would mean Kerry County Council could apply to a Kerry circuit judge for an order to stop a breach of the planning law in Kerry, and that all the people involved would be able to go to a local court and have the matter decided by a local judge in circumstances where costs would be minimised.  It seems to me that the Minister's reasoning was conservative, &ldquo;knee-jerk&rdquo; and unconvincing on that issue. Justice demands that the Circuit Court should be given jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by mentioning a few important aspects of the Bill.  The provisions of the Bill relating to sewerage and the 1978 Public Health (Ireland) Act in relation to the statutory duty of sanitary authorities to provide sewerage services in their area, have more far-reaching effects than seem to be understood by some Deputies.  We are not simply taking about charging people to connect drains into sewers.  We are trying <Col N="883" /> to ensure that compensation is not paid on the basis of a mythical and wholly unrealistic presumption and statutory duty that the sanitary authority are to provide a sewer for any development that can be built.</P>
    <P>We are reserving the position.  We are providing that the duty to provide sewerage only applies where planning permission is not in question.  It follows from that that nobody would be able to receive compensation for a development for which there was not, and never would be, sewerage provided by the local authority because it contravened the development plan and the local authority did not want to have the development in the place in question.  That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been made of planning receivers as an idea.  I accept that in many respects where companies are the developers and they have gone into liquidation, the receiver will have very few assets to chase after, but that measure was intended to be another weapon for the local authorities to get on with the business of completing unfinished estates and remedying what are undoubtedly social wrongs.  It does not mean other remedies have to be thrown aside.  It is an extra power.  It cannot hurt anyone to put in place an extra power which would in certain circumstances have some advantages.</P>
    <P>Look at Mountjoy Square in Dublin where there is a huge shell of a building which has been there for God knows how long.  Part of it fell because it was left unfinished for so long.  It should be open to a local authority, in the interests of the people who live, work and trade in that area, to say that that eyesore must be completed.  It should be open to the local authority to send in somebody to do whatever work is necessary, to take possession of the building and sell it and to make sure it ceases to be the ugly concrete skeleton it is now.</P>
    <P>I have probably overshot my limit but, as I indicated earlier, with the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputy Quill.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Develoqknt Act, 1963, is now in its 25th year. In fairness it must be said that that Act has served us well but in some respects it has failed.  We, in the Progressive Democrats, have isolated what we believe to be two of its most fundamental flaws.  The first is the issue of compensation which in many ways is the running sore of local government and, second, the issue of unfinished estates and unfinished developments and the problems that derive therefrom.  We have sought in this legislation to set about remedying those two issues.</P>
      <P>The issue we have put up front because we think it is the most important, is compensation. Most people will say it is high time our legislators addressed themselves to that very serious issue.  In his speech on this debate last Wednesday, the Minister told us that between 1982 and 1986 the amount claimed by way of compensation for refusal of planning permission was £70 million.  At the best of times that is a lot of money but at local authority level we are living in the worst of times where money is exceedingly scarce.  Any city manager or local councillor will say if his authority could lay their hands on even a fraction of £70 million, they could fill many potholes and that a great deal of good, essential and outstanding work could be done if money of that magnitude were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a nutshell what we are saying is this. We can ill afford to allow a situation to develop where under law people can make claims of that magnitude on local authorities.  That must stop, and it must stop now.  Over the years successive Governments have attempted to address themselves to this problem.  Many times in the past it seemed as if new legislation was about to be brought in.  This usually happened when the issue was live and was highlighted, especially when cases came before the Supreme Court and the verdict was brought against the local <Col N="885" /> authority.  Then the legislators would shake their heads and say it was time to bring in amending legislation to curb the issue of compensation and to restrict its use.  That has been said time and time again, but nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>That is why we, the Progressive Democrats, in our first year in this House brought this legislation before the House. We say to the House and the country that we cannot afford to delay any longer. Now is the time to bring in amending legislation.  That is the first issue to which we have seen fit to address ourselves.  We have sought to restrict the number of cases and the number of grounds under which compensation can be claimed.  We consider it necessary to do so not alone to protect public and scarce taxpayers' money but also legislation enacted by this House.  It is just as grave a source of public scandal that we, as legislators, knowing that this practice is continuing, have failed to introduce legislation to curb it.  That is as much a cause of public cynicism as is the practice that has developed of wily speculators seeing this as a way or opportunity of making money.  It is time that practice ceases and the overall position put right.</P>
    <P>In his excellent contribution to this debate last week Deputy Quinn seemed to have grave reservations about the manner in which we seek to address this problem in our Bill.  He has been well and adequately answered by Deputy McDowell who spoke at the outset of the debate this evening.  If Deputy Quinn has serious reservations about any weakness he perceives in the provisions of our Bill, it is open to him to table an amendment. We would welcome any constructive, positive amendment he might introduce that would seek to strengthen its provisions, thereby rendering the ensuing Act more effective.  I hope he will respond to this invitation.  And, if it is found that, as a result of his amendment, we have a stronger, better Bill, we shall be delighted.</P>
    <P>The second main issue we have sought to address in this Bill is the question of unfinished estates.  Over the years those <Col N="886" /> of us who are members of local authorities, especially in urban areas, will have seen the position in which young house purchasers have found themselves, all too often when they move into an estate where the developer has not carried out essential work, being left for month after month, sometimes over a period of years, waiting for essential works to be carried out.  These are mainly works on developing the external aspects of an estate, such as the laying of roads, footpaths or the proper development of green spaces.  Very often more fundamental deficiencies are faced by new householders in such estates.  Sometimes even public lighting is not made available or, having been made available for a number of months, is then cut off.</P>
    <P>There is that sort of grey area of time between the taking-in-charge of an estate by a local authority and the giving-in-charge by the developer in which nobody seems to want to claim responsibility for paying the Bill.  This means that young people, who will have staked their life savings on a deposit to purchase a house, who will have mortgaged a minimum of 20 years of their future to meet the payments to retain that house, find that, after all that effort, they are left without essential services such as public lighting, a refuse collection, or some essential element in order to render it possible for them to live there happily.  That is another on-going sore in local government circles, one that has to be redressed sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>We have set down very specifically in this Bill the manner in which we feel local authorities ought to proceed to ensure that that kind of practice does not develop.  That is the least we should do to protect young people who are prepared to house themselves.  In the past the experience of young people who have found themselves in the circumstances I have described, has had an adverse effect on other young people planning to house themselves.  Very often they see people whom they know very well moving into public estates that are developed on time and properly laid out, whereas people who buy houses in private estates, having <Col N="887" /> staked their money, must wait months and sometimes years for such works to be carried out.  That is not good enough. That is not a fit and proper way for us, as a nation, to protect the rights of home owners and house purchasers.  We have set out very clearly in our Bill &mdash; in stages I do not have time to develop &mdash; how that problem should be addressed, how the possibility of that happening in the future could be averted.</P>
    <P>In the few moments remaining to me I might say this: Deputy Birmingham, while generally welcoming the Bill, appeared to have some reservations.  If he feels that the general thrust and spirit of the Bill is right but still holds reservations, the offer or invitation I gave Deputy Quinn, equally, is open to him. I hope he will see the need for having this Bill enacted in all due haste, that if he has any such reservations he will voice them by way of amendment, and when the time is ripe, come in behind us and support our Bill.</P>
    <P>It is high time the Opposition parties united behind the provisions of this Bill. There is unanimity on the need to have this legislation passed and that it must be done sooner rather than later.  Let us now put our feet where our tongues have been.  I appeal to Opposition Members to support this Bill on Second Reading, to send it on its way, so that its provisions can be enacted sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The Minister has appealed to us to place this Bill in abeyance because, he said, he has a broader and different Bill in course of preparation.  It was exactly 12 months ago this week I stood here and spoke on the trees and woodlands Bill. At that time the very same plea was made by the Minister of State, Deputy N. Treacy, who sat over there, and said to the proposer of the Bill: We have another Bill in course of preparation, a better, broader Bill.  Would you be good enough to put your Bill in abeyance and await the introduction of ours?  That is exactly 12 months ago and nothing has happened in the meantime.  If that kind of delay were to be brought to bear on the provisions of this Bill we should have only <Col N="888" /> more hardship, more claims for compensation, more public cynicism about legislators who cannot respond in time to a very serious set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to take this Bill on board.  I appeal to the Members of the Opposition parties to support this Bill.  I appeal to the better instincts within the Fianna Fáil Party also to see the sense of this Bill, the need for its being enacted sooner rather than later.  When I say I appeal to the better instincts within the Fianna Fáil Party, I should say that nowadays I suppose there are two Fianna Fáil parties &mdash; the cutting party and the other party, the cutting party being led by the Minister for Finance who, on taking office, found this country on the brink of bankruptcy.  With all due credit to him, he turned the country in the other direction towards solvency.  Indeed, in the course of his term of office as Minister to date, he has demonstrated extreme responsibility.  I would appeal to his wing of the Fianna Fáil Party to look at this Bill with the same sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not have the same expectations from the other wing of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I refer mainly to the group of Fianna Fáil Deputies running around the country at present, like monster leprechauns, taking lottery cheques out of their pockets, engaging in that kind of irresponsible political behaviour.  I do not address my comments to them.  Sometimes my fear is that the Minister for the Environment might find himself in that section of his party.  That is why I appeal especially this evening to Ministers in Cabinet who have a very responsible attitude to those matters, to take an equally responsible attitude to this Bill and not allow its passage be delayed any further. I appeal especially to the Minister for the Environment &mdash; who, in many ways, has not been the most spectacular Minister for the Environment we have had in recent years &mdash; to show a sense of responsibility, of urgency, of sensitivity to the needs of the general public, taxpayers in general, to allow this Bill to go through, and give it the kind of backing called for by Deputy McDowell.  If he does that it will be to his eternal credit. <Col N="889" /> I appeal for support for this Bill from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to contribute to this debate this evening. As a member of Dublin County Council, in recent years I have come across several instances in which the threat of a claim for compensation against the council seemed to me to compel the manager to take planning decisions with which he felt unhappy, to say the least.  It is right, therefore, that we should be discussing this issue.  I hope that, arising out of the Bill and the Minister's statement in his opening speech, we will be able to make progress very quickly in our efforts to deal with what is a very contentious issue so far as local authorities are concerned. The threat of compensation is contentious because obviously from a financial point of view local authorities are not very amenable to meeting the claims that are served upon them and certainly they are not in a financial position to meet any of the more spectacular claims that have been sought from them over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The threat of compensation can have an effect on the planning decision process. On a number of occasions we in Dublin County Council have been advised by the manager to support a planning decision that we felt was not in the best interests of the environment or locality to which the application referred. Many of us very reluctantly felt compelled to accept the advice of the manager in relation to some of these decisions only because we were faced with, in the manager's words, &ldquo;a serious compensation claim&rdquo; which would have major financial repercussions for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to study the figures of the actual claims which have come to fruition.  The Minister gave us a summary of these claims, of which only nine, totalling £82,000, have actually been paid.  It is a very small figure and it might tend to give the wrong impression regarding the threat of compensation claims.  Very often local authorities are compelled to reach some kind of an agreement with <Col N="890" /> planning applicants in order to avoid the payment of compensation claims.  We are dealing only with the tip of the iceberg here and a much more interesting figure might be one gleaned from the local authorities around the country indicating the number of instances when planning decisions were taken in a certain way because of the potential for a compensation claim.  Dublin County Council could put up a number of cases which would give a totally different picture and would show how seriously this issue has developed in relation to the threat of compensation claims.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we should be considering amending legislation and it is for that reason that I am delighted with the Minister's statement that he is well advanced on this issue. As somebody who is serving on Dublin County Council at present and having seen the effects of claims and their potential damage to the environment, I hope the Minister will do everything possible to speed up the completion of the drafting of this legislation which, I understand, has been agreed to in principle by the Government and bring it before the House at the earliest possible date.  Obviously it would be very helpful if we could have it during this session because the longer it goes on the more potential it has for damaging our environment significantly. All of us can refer to specific cases in our own county council or local authority areas where claims advanced along a certain path and the very threat of the claim determined the planning application which had consequences which made many of us unhappy but unfortunately with which we had to live.</P>
    <P>The legislation proposed here incorporates a number of the changes that are required in the 1963 Act.  As the Minister said, some of these would find favour with the work he has already done in drafting his legislation.  I do not think any of us can quarrel with that statement made by the Minister.  However, there are areas the Minister should bring into his legislation and this is the doubt I have about the Bill before us now.  There are certain areas in relation to compensation <Col N="891" /> which I would like to see tightened up. It is time that we took those decisions, particularly with regard to the unfinished estates and the changes required in our planning legislation, to deal with this issue.  When I talk about unfinished estates I am not confining myself to housing estates only.  I am also referring to industrial estates.</P>
    <P>All of us who represent developing areas know that the proper completion of housing estates has been a bone of contention during the past 15 years. Many estates which were begun up to 15 years ago have still not been taken in change by Dublin County Council, in my case, and I am sure it is the same in other local authority areas.  The failure of developers to complete estates properly means that ultimately the local authority have to step in and pick up the tab for the completion of the areas concerned. Very often they have to do that under pressure from local communities who in many cases have been abandoned by certain unscrupulous developers.  Some, though not all, have been very remiss in completing their estates and the local people who have moved into the housing areas find themselves compelled to put pressure on the local authority to go outside of their role and take on the task &mdash; in many cases using public moneys where bond moneys have not proved sufficient &mdash; of carrying out these works and completing the estate to the satisfaction of the residents.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago I had occasion to seek information from the manager of Dublin County Council in relation to the number of legal cases he had pending against various developers throughout the administrative area of Dublin County Council.  It came as a surprise to me to learn that practically every major developer operating in the county at that time was the subject of some type of litigation. It was surprising to see the number of developers, both large and small, who were clearly, according to the planning permissions granted to them, not properly completing their areas.</P>
    <P>There is reference in this Bill to the <Col N="892" /> proposed appointment of a planning receiver with certain powers.  It is very good in theory and it appears to be an attempt to cope with the failure of developers to complete estates.  When you examine that proposition closely you have to ask the question: what actual powers would the receiver have?  The powers of the receiver can be based only on the financial backing that is available to him from the developer.  In many cases estates are almost fully occupied before the trouble in relation to the completion of estates begins.  There is, of course, a case to be made for the staged completion of housing estates where permission would be granted for smaller proportions of proposed developments and as each portion is properly developed and completed a separate permission would issue for the next phase of the housing development.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a planning receiver without financial support from a developer, would weaken his hand very considerably because sometimes a property can be mortgaged to a bank or financial institution.  Where would the planning receiver stand in that case? Would he have rights over the position of the bank or lending institution?  If he had rights, how would that affect the potential for development of housing estates or industrial estates?  It would have major implications so far as fund raising to carry out developments would be concerned.  I would not necessarily have a great deal of sympathy with developers on that basis because if they are not in a financial position to complete a project properly it should not be started.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in the proposal to appoint a planning receiver because his ability to raise finance from a development is extremely weak and would not allow him to complete the development in some of the areas I am familiar with because of the lack of saleable assets that would be available to the developer operating in that area.  Unfortunately, that is one of the weaknesses of this proposal. The same applies to industrial estates.  Some estates which were built 15 <Col N="893" /> or 20 years ago are still in quite a shambles because the developer of the industrial estate has not fulfilled the conditions of the planning permission which was granted.  Of course, the bond moneys held at that time were so small as to be irrelevant in so far as today's costs are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to amend some sections of the 1963 Act, which is really the Principal Act, in relation to compensation and the threat of compensation claims.  I want to suggest a number of ideas that come to mind in relation to section 56 of the Local Government Act, 1963.  It should be amended so that compensation under section 55 will not be paid in respect of the refusal of permission to develop land if one of the reasons for refusal is that the proposed development would materially contravene a zoning objective of the development plan.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the effect of this change in the 1963 Act as regards Dublin County Council would be that a refusal of permission for, say, a large-scale residential development on lands zoned for open space or amenity purposes would not attract compensation.  I am speaking from personal experience here.  Again it seems always to come back to this in this fairly complex issue, that where amenity lands in part of my constituency became the subject of a planning application and again because of the threat of a claim for compensation, the manager felt obliged to come to an arrangement with the developer in order to protect those amenity lands and to grant planning permission in another part of the same area.  It was in conflict with the original action plan development thought out and agreed for the area, but again there was the complication of the threat of a compensation claim and consequently the manager felt obliged to give in on that.  This is just an example of what can happen.</P>
    <P>In so far as section 56 of the 1963 Act is concerned, there has been a lot of discussion on the meaning of the word &ldquo;use&rdquo; as defined in section 2 of the Act and that it should be altered to include the use of the land for the carrying out <Col N="894" /> of any works thereon where the effect of such works would be to change the character or nature of the use being made of the land.  Deputy Keating has tried to incorporate this general issue into this Bill, and all of us would go along with that.</P>
    <P>Section 56 (1) (b) of the 1963 Act should be amended to provide that compensation would not be payable in respect of the refusal of commission to develop land if the reason or one of the reasons for refusal was that water or sewerage facilities were not available for the proposed development.  This is often a very complex and contentious issue when we come to talk about planning applications and the issuing of planning permissions. Again, this is incorporated in Deputy Keating's Bill, and its effect would be to remove the concept of prematurity which is contained in section 56 (1) (b).  The amendment would be appropriate in present economic circumstances, as money for development of schemes in the pipeline may not be available for an indefinite period and certainly so far as most of the local authorities are concerned that certainly would be the case.</P>
    <P>We have to take into account the financial constraints on local authorities who simply cannot be expected to provide underground services, including water and sewerage facilities, just to protect itself from compensation claims.  We would all support change to that effect, particularly where open green lands are frequently becoming the subject of speculative attempts by developers to bring their planning application to the point where, though they have no real hope of actually developing the land, they have a better than even chance of being successful with a compensation claim against the local authority.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the Public Health Act of 1878 should be amended to provide that the right of a landowner to connect a house on his land to a public sewer should only arise after the house has been built in accordance with the terms and conditions of a planning permission. The Act should also be amended to provide that a sanitary authority could <Col N="895" /> reserve capacity in any water or sewerage system to provide for development on zoned land for which the scheme was designed and constructed even if planning permission has not been obtained for such development.  The effect of this would be to offset the Short case which certainly had major implications financially for Dublin County Council.  If the legislation were in place and if it were amended it certainly would ensure that we would not have a repetition of that now infamous case so far as Dublin County Council is concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as section 56 (1) (e) of the 1963 Act is concerned, I would have preferred to see the Bill before us incorporating some reference to the question of national monuments.  As far as I understand it, the preservation of a national monument is a compensatable reason.  If a person happens to own land on which a national monument is located he can lodge a planning application and if that application is refused on the basis that it would seriously affect the preservation of the national monument, then he would be entitled to seek compensation.  The 1963 Act, particularly section 56 (1) (e), should be extended to incorporate this protection, particularly in areas on the fringes of Dublin where we have had occasion to supervise the growth outwards of the city and in so doing came into areas where national monuments existed. On the north side of the city there is a fairly substantial claim at present lodged with Dublin County Council arising out of this specific issue, the claim being for £3.3 million.  I hope that under this Bill there will be some attempt to provide for the protection of local authorities against compensation claims arising out of their protection of national monuments.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the legislation he proposes to bring before the House will address this issue because it is important.</P>
    <P>I also believe that an opportunity could and should have been taken in the Progressive Democrats' Bill to add to section 56 (1) of the 1963 Act to provide that compensation would not be payable in <Col N="896" /> respect of the refusal of permission where the reason or one of the reasons for refusal was that the proposed development would contravene an order under the Acts I have referred to.  That should be stitched into the legislation.  It is time we took account of our national heritage. Local authorities should not be open to the threat of substantial compensation claims just because we are trying to protect our national monuments.</P>
    <P>Section 55 (3) of the 1963 Act should be amended, and I hope the Minister will address himself to the issue of determining the reduction of value for the purposes of this section.  Regard will have to be taken of any reduction caused by the refusal of permission on which the claims is based, and it should not be assumed that permission will not be granted for any other development on that area.  This is a matter which was highlighted by a specific case which came to light in relation to the High Court case of Owen Abue Limited <i>v.</i> Dublin County Council.  The applicant applied for planning permission for three houses on 18 acres of road reservation with the open intention of making it difficult for the planning authority to sustain non-compensatable reasons for refusal which they might have been able to sustain if the proposal had been for development as a normal density in that area and in conformity with the development plan and the zoning objectives.</P>
    <P>When the matter came before the arbitrator the applicants held that on the proper interpretation of section 55 (3) they were entitled to claim compensation on the basis of any further development which probably could have been made in accordance with the planning Acts.  The courts, on the case stated before them, decided in favour of the applicants.  This had the potential to be a serious issue in the area in which it arose.  The ground referred to is part of the western parkway motorway construction which got under way a few weeks ago and which is a £30 million project.  This particular area of land formed part of that reservation.  A developer who should be seeking a normal density of 12 houses to the acre, <Col N="897" /> sought a density of three houses to 18 acres and tried to force the local authority to refuse permission and thereby devalue the property, according to them.  Consequently he tried to force Dublin County Council into a compensation claim whereby they could find themselves in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Section 58 of the 1963 Act should also be amended to provide that applications to the Minister or to the board may be made within two months after a planning authority had given an undertaking pursuant to section 57.  One of the criticisms of the court in the case of the Grange Developments Limited <i>v.</i> Dublin County Council on the lands of Mont Gorry in Swords &mdash; which has been referred to by previous speakers &mdash; was that the offering of the undertaking two months after the date of the decision precluded the applicant from making an application under section 58.  If the change that I now recommend in the 1963 Act were to take place, the criticism would no longer arise in the handling of matters of this kind by Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I would like also to recommend a change in section 57 of the 1963 Act which is not suggested in this Bill.  Section 57 should be amended to make it clear that a planning authority are entitled under the section, when dealing with a claim for compensation, to give an undertaking to grant permission for an alternative form of development which would comply with the zoning objective of the development plan, irrespective of whether the applicant had applied for such alternative forms of development, and also to make it clear that the planning authority could give an undertaking under section 57 of the Act at any time before the closing of an arbitration hearing. The change I am recommending would meet other criticisms of the council's actions &mdash; I am talking about Dublin County Council in this case &mdash; which were made in the courts in the case of Grange Developments Limited <i>v.</i> Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>Those are just a few of my suggestions on how the 1963 Act could be changed to deal with the issue of compensation as <Col N="898" /> it arises and how we could extend it to take in more changes which are now required in our planning legislation to take account of issues referred to by many of the previous speakers most of whom I have listened to &mdash; to strengthen the planning legislation to give communities affected by developments the power, through their local authorities, to have some say in the manner in which their areas are developed and the manner in which their housing estates are completed and the infrastructure is provided as part of those developments.  All these matters are bound up inextricably with the various development plans which are determined throughout the country covering each local authority area and region.</P>
    <P>The development plan should be reexamined by the Minister to see if there are ways in which it could be steamlined and made more understandable from the point of view of the public.  The plan is very complex and very difficult for ordinary individuals to understand.  Yet, its adoption can have a major effect on their environment and frequently they find it impossible to come to grips with making their own representations for changes, alterations or substitutions.  It is only when local groups or interested parties and organisations take on the task of trying to come to grips with development plans that the real information, contained in the development proposals &mdash; whether in draft or adopted &mdash; come to light and often individuals are too late in reacting.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment the Progressive Democrats on introducing the Bill in their own time.  I ask them, in view of what the Minister has said, to consider withdrawing their Bill and to work with the Government Bill when it is introduced.  I ask them to take account of the various comments I made about the suggested changes in the 1963 Act which calls for a much wider range of changes than are contained in this Bill even if we were to confine ourselves to the issue of compensation only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill on behalf of The Workers' Party.  It is an important issue and one that should be debated in this House with the greatest attention possible.  A debate on this issue can help to point up the many deficiencies in our current legislation and the difficulties that will be encountered by this House when attempts are made to legislate for stricter planning laws.  A remark made earlier by Deputy Quill was echoed, to some extent, by some other contributors.  I would like to make it clear that the planning Acts have not been a success.  The 1963 Act, and its subsequent amendments, have proved to be disastrously inadequate and inept for anyone working at local authority level and interested in the proper and ordered development of our urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>It should be drawn to the attention of this House that many farm and agricultural developments in our rural areas are not subject to any planning controls and are not required to comply with any standards whatsoever.  That was pointed to during the debates last summer, and in the House after the summer recess, as the cause of many of pollution and of many fish kills that occurred in our rivers. Anyone who looks at urban development in the major city areas &mdash; it is significant in all urban and provincial town centres &mdash; will be aware that the decay and the dereliction are attributable in part to the inadequacies of our planning laws.  When local authorities seek to control land speculation within their areas they are hampered because they are without the power or the resources to enforce the law or to seek compliance with the directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to let the statement go that the planning laws have been a success over the past 25 years.  I do not believe any Deputy concerned with the proper development of the urban and rural environment could be happy with the extent of our planning laws today. The base problem must rest with our Constitution.  This point has not been made by any contributors to the debate <Col N="900" /> so far but it must be commented on in any debate on the whole question of the enactment, amendment or improvement of our planning laws.</P>
    <P>Under Article 43 of the Constitution one of the most remarkable provisions in that document of 1937, the position of private property, is laid down in such trenchant terms as to be perhaps the most strongly stated right of all the various rights in the fundamental rights section. Article 43.1 provides:</P>
    <P>1º The State acknowledges that man, in virtue of his rational being, has the natural right, antecedent to positive law, to the private ownership of external goods.</P>
    <P>Jurists in interpreting those words have established that the law that derives from a source antecedent to positive law is talking about God-given rights, and it is the only right in the Constitution that has the statement contained in it, that antecedent to positive law our right to private property emanates from the supernatural or from God.  No other right in the Constitution is so strongly worded.</P>
    <P>There are, however, interesting qualifications to that which are so often forgotten, not so much by our courts but by us as politicians when we try to address our understanding of what the right of property is and what it should consist of.  Too often arguments, discussions or deliberations in the area of planning are immediately discounted by reason of the strongly and trenchant words of the Constitution with regard to private property. That view ran right throughout the Kenny report of 1974 which sought to address the question of building speculation and building land and the point was echoed in some of the contributions here over the last number of days in the acknowledgment or concession to Government that they must do nothing that would seem in any way to impinge radically on the right to private property because of the constitutional duty to do nothing by way of legislation that would be seen to impinge directly on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have failed to exploit <Col N="901" /> the qualifications in Article 43 that allow us to tackle the whole question of property rights.  Those qualifications should be exercised as under Article 43.2.1º in the context of civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice in Article 43.2 suggesting that laws can be enacted to delineate the rights reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in some of the more recent Supreme Court decisions members of that Bench have sought to remind us as legislators that those qualifications are there and that we, as legislators should have more regard to them. To the extent that we want as a matter of political double-think not to address seriously the definition of private property as contained in Article 43, we must confront the problem that we will never have adequate planning laws.  This element of ambiguity runs throughout the debate and rests to some degree in the Progressive Democrats position with regard to this Bill.  In their own draft constitution for a new Republic published earlier this year, the rights with regard to property laid down in that draft are a word perfect image and reflection of what is in the 1937 document.  They juggle a number of the terms about but come down to exactly the same definition and they use the same qualifications in it. I quote paragraph 5 at page 5 of their document:</P>
    <P>The State shall not enact any law which attempts to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property. It shall be lawful for the State to enact laws to delimit and control, with or without compensation, the exercise of property rights in accordance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>again, in accordance with the 1937 terminology&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the exigiencies of the common good, in general, and, in particular, to regulate and delimit in accordance with the principles of social <Col N="902" /> justice, the development and protection of industry, agriculture, commerce, land and the environment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, an absolute recognition of the right to private property, subject to the two qualifications that exist in the 1937 document borrowed word perfect, is contained in their document.  In that context we have to look a little more carefully at the seriousness of the proposed legislation. For reasons I will deal with later I believe there is a good deal of ambiguity and double-think in the approach of the Progressive Democrats to the issue.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the debate on developing proper planning laws must centre around the Constitution and its provisions.  I have mentioned briefly the Kenny report which is considered to be the modern-day initial authority on the whole question of how to deal with law speculation in developing urban areas. Reading that report it is interesting to see how the judge &mdash; chairman as he then was &mdash; of the committee grappled with this whole problem of the grip that our Constitution has on any enlightened development of laws in the area of property control.  They came down with a scheme of designated land, a designation that would be made by the High Court after a hearing, but in the course of that designation incorporated into it the notion of price control on the grounds of social justice and the exigency of the common good.</P>
    <P>I have made the point that we, as legislators, are constantly running away either from tackling this very narrow definition of property in Article 43.1.1 and facing up to it by means of a referendum, if necessary or even taking that and the Constitution as it is, addressing and utilising those provisions and exceptions in Article 43 that would allow for somewhat more enlightened and ambitious legislation. The double-think and ambiguity I speak of are reflected in the explanatory memorandum attached to the Bill in the suggestion that it would be unfair to describe it as a speculator's charter, but the 1963 legislation can be nothing other than a speculator's charter.  It represents <Col N="903" /> virtually no serious control.  In some regards it delineates and in some way limits the directions in which the speculator can move, but when it comes to confronting an application for development the hands of the planners are utterly without power and are tied.</P>
    <P>Again, when it wants to confront the decay and dereliction that are visited upon so much of our good housing stock in urban areas, the legislation is completely powerless and without authority. The memorandum itself is remarkable because, having said it would be unfair to describe the measure as &ldquo;speculator's charter&rdquo; it states: &ldquo;but there is no doubt but that the compensation provisions contained therein are unduly generous.&rdquo; What does that mean?  It means that the legislation and the Act as it exists represents a very generous gesture to land speculators and is their charter of operation. That kind of ambiguity even comes out in the Minister's use of the figures. He told us that between 1982 and 1986 there were 183,000 applications for planning permission and that only 130 of those involved compensation.  He said that, out of the 130 applications, nine involved the payment of £82,000 in compensation.  He seemed to play down the importance of the compensation aspect or the use and exploitation of the loopholes in our planning laws by unscrupulous speculators.</P>
    <P>The interesting figure that came out later in the debate, unconnected with the point the Minister was making, is that the extent of the claims made by speculators in those 130 cases amounted to £70 million. The position is that the use of this device of making unreal applications for unbelievably inflated demands, in money terms or otherwise, is a lever to twist the arm of local authorities in granting planning permissions that otherwise they would not grant.  Consequently, this whole notion of the local authority to develop in the common interest and the common good is completely circumvented on a widescale basis throughout the country by people who simply put the local authority in a position where <Col N="904" /> they cannot say no, cannot lay down regulations and must cave in to their demands.</P>
    <P>The sum of £70 million is used to hold local authorities to ransom and to obtain decisions that would not otherwise be available to the developer.  In my own constituency in the past year there was the celebrated example of Red Rock.  It is an area in the Howth peninsula, one of the most scenic and highly desirable amenity areas on which planning permission for development would never be granted.  Because of a history of mistakes, which is not worthy of mention in this House, based on legislation which is completely inadequate, a developer was able to hold the county council to ransom, compelled to apply for planning permission, which they granted him, to build 26 houses, invited appeals and at the hearing we saw the spectacle of a developer hand away his planning permission because there was a condition that, should he lose the appeal of the objectors to An Bord Pleanála, a land bank of equivalent value would be made available to him, along with £250,000, in the county area.</P>
    <P>That is the way our planners are forced to deal with speculators.  It is an argument that the Minister sought not to make in answer to the Progressive Democrats' legislation and it makes me worry about the serious intent of the Government to face up to the problems centred in and about the whole issue.  For that reason, The Workers' Party are not taken by the Minister's plea to the Progressive Democrats to withdraw their legislation in the hope of something better coming.  We have serious misgivings about the political willingness of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government to face up to and deal with this problem adequately.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the approach of politicians who have spoken in the House on the desirability of this legislation and at a party in Dublin County Council engaging in a very disreputable process of using section 4 applications before the county council to defeat the proper planning and development of the county area, it is clear that all Dublin County Council meetings <Col N="905" /> are taken up with debating and deliberating section 4 motions seeking to compel the manager to concede to planning applications on the basis of individual cases and representations by members of the county council &mdash; some of whom are Members of the House &mdash; and who do not seem to have any consistent approach to the problem of proper planning.</P>
    <P>The first main feature of the Bill relates to the question of compensation and when it should be paid.  Whatever about when compensation should be paid, the major problem is the extent of the amount ultimately to be paid.  This has not been addressed in the Bill and, from the Minister's response last week, it is clear that there is no serious intention or consideration in the Government's proposed Bill to deal with this problem.  The Workers' Party make the point that property must be secondary in its status to community rights and needs.  The primacy of property considerations as reflected in the Constitution, respected and given status by the planning legislation, is wrong.  Even within Article 43 there is scope for legislation in the planning areas which would put the institution of property in its rightful place, behind the interest of the common good of the community and of people's needs.</P>
    <P>The notion that property must yield absolute maximum return in all regards and circumstances cannot be consistent with the common good.  The issue has to be raised as to the existence or recognition of the notion of community property. There is never any argument in these debates regarding property owners returning to the community, in the guise of local authorities, compensation for the enhancement of their land by the act of the local authorities, without any contribution, good, bad or indifferent from the property holder.  We never hear that, because the local authority provide services to a district or build a road through an area and, consequently, multiply many times over the value of a land owner's property, there should be a contribution from the owner to the community property interests.  The existing <Col N="906" /> concept of compensation is outdated and must be brought up to modern standards. There are many precedents for this, for instance in legislation relating to ground rents where the Oireachtas fixed an arbitrary figure whereby the owner of ground rent will be compensated for the surrender or sale of the ground rent to the lessee, based on a figure approximating to seven times the annual rent.</P>
    <P>Not only is the compensation fixed by an outside agency and in an artificial way, the ground landlord is compelled by law to relinquish the rights of private property and none of this has been challenged constitutionally because owners of ground rent realise that their case, in the qualifications of Article 43, would not stand up to a test in the courts.  It is interesting to note that our legislation in were able to bring forward legislation in that area without the worry that they could not move because of a duty not to introduce legislation that would impinge on the Constitution.  Why is it that it cannot be done in the area of planning law?</P>
    <P>The example also exists in the area of rent control on lettings.  Landlords, where they let their property for accommodation purposes, are controlled by tribunals who decide what is a fair rent and to what extent the owner can expect a return on property.  Something similar has arisen in regard to gaming halls with the Supreme Court saying that legislation passed in 1956 allowing for a 2½ wager, and a limit of 50p in return, was a constitutionally proper provision.  The argument advanced by the gaming hall owners at the time was that their right to make a profit from their property was being artificially curtailed.  The Supreme Court said no, that the legislation was constitutionally sound and it was a matter for legislators on another day, if they wanted to, to interfere with the limits set down.</P>
    <P>In many areas of our law legislators have laid the precedent for the control of compensation, for the control of return on property and for control of the right to earn an unlimited and unbridled profit. There is no reason, in the area of compensation in planning laws, we cannot do <Col N="907" /> the same thing.  Compensation must be based on the original use purchase.  If land is brought as waste land it must be compensated for on the basis of its waste status.  If land is bought as agricultural land whatever compensation is paid &mdash; one recognises that compensation must come into it at some stage &mdash; must be related to the value and price originally paid and the use for which it was originally sold.  In addition, there must be a set-off for any community enhancement of the property brought about by the introduction of services, the building of roads or any other work by a local authority or an outside agency that enhanced the value of the property for the person.</P>
    <P>There is no way that our law should or must compensate a person who is fortunate to buy in a right location, sits on a parcel of land and waits until events turn to his or her favour.  Modern day senses of value and fair play do not require us to legislate any longer or provide for that.  There are indications that at least some members of the Supreme Court hold that view.  The point has often been made that we cannot let this rest in the hands of our courts, that we must take action to ensure that our legislation is proper, adequate and comprehensive. As legislators we must end the ambiguity that clearly exists, is redolent throughout the debate and in the attitude of the Progressive Democrats in their Bill and in the reaffirmation of private property absolute in their draft constitution.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill is the provision dealing with unfinished estates. That is a new departure in planning law and it is remarkable that it has been taken so long to introduce it.  One Member remarked that it was coming at a stage when the horse had gone over the hill leaving us with nothing to stable. However, the provisions are very weak. Other devices could be contrived to deal with this phenomenon.  There are other ways of ensuring that a person who forms a limited liability company to build one housing estate is not allowed form another limited liability company to build <Col N="908" /> another estate some where else.  There are means whereby a contractor would not be allowed move from one local authority contract to another until the first was properly completed.  There is hardly a builder or developer who is not involved in contract work for local authorities on the one hand and developing housing privately on the other.</P>
    <P>The idea of a planning receiver in the Bill is a useful one and one that should be explored fully.  I should like to ask the Minister to bring that concept before the Government and ask them to consider including it in their Bill.  The suggestion has not been fully fleshed out but it could work well if developed more.  The legislation before us is weak in many ways and in its basic politics but if it was to become law tomorrow it would be an advance on our existing laws.  For that reason The Workers' Party support the Bill.  We will vote in favour of it at the end of Second Stage and we invite the Progressive Democrats not to concede to the invitation of the Government to wait until their Bill is introduced.  If they do so we will be waiting for a long time to debate this issue again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCartan is correct in saying that the planning laws have not been entirely successful.  I listened with great interest to much of his contribution and he will be surprised to learn that I agree with much of it.  The Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, was the first comprehensive planning legislation.  It replaced a much more limited series of town and regional planning Acts.  The time has been with us for some years for a complete and thorough review of the 1963 Act.  I was surprised at the conclusion reached by Deputy McCartan.  It seemed that in much of what he had said he was pointing in the direction of a thorough and comprehensive review of planning legislation but he has come down in favour of something that is less than thorough and comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1963 legislation was being drafted the economic conditions were considerably different from they are now. <Col N="909" /> We had gone through a period of population decline, there was stagnation in the economy and the previous decade was not marked by any sort of economic expansion.  The drafters of the legislation could hardly have envisaged what would happen in planning or development.  For example, they could not have begun to envisage the extraordinary value to which development land would escalate, particularly in the late seventies and early eighties. They could not have anticipated the sheer volume of development we have seen in recent years.  The Minister has pointed out that over the last two decades we have seen 4,000 to 6,000 acres of land being swallowed up in development every year.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the drafters of the 1963 legislation that we have in that period seen almost 500,000 houses built, that we have had industrialisation, urbanisation and sub-urbanisation.  Notwithstanding the fact that the 1963 Act has served us reasonably well the fact is that it now requires a very dramatic, radical and comprehensive review.  Another point about the 1963 Act which was, surprisingly, ignored in the contributions on this and which has been ignored in the general discussion on planning was that the Act dealt not only with physical planning but also focused on development. Planning authorities were to be development corporations under that Act.  Under that heading they could become involved in joint ventures, in industrial development, in industrial training, in service activities, in tourism promotion and in the protection and creation of amenities. They are aspects of our planning operations in addition to the obvious weaknesses of the 1963 Act, which need to be reviewed at this stage and which, hopefully, will be part of the comprehensive legislation the Minister has promised us.</P>
    <P>While the development section of the legislation has been used, it comes in for far less attention than the planning and physical development side of the legislation. Deputy McCartan dealt with property rights in a most interesting way. The property rights enshrined in the Constitution have been subject to a some what <Col N="910" /> rigid interpretation which has cast a shadow over the whole question of planning and development.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Private Members' Business. - Worker Participation (State" RHead="Enterprises) Bill, 1988: Second Stage">
    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Bill, 1988  [  Seanad ]:   Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill will help give effect to the Government commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to bring forward legislation to facilitate the development of worker participation at sub-board levels in State enterprises.  The Bill also provides for the election of worker directors to two more State boards, Aer Rianta and the National Rehabilitation Board.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of amendments to the scheme of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The case for wider employee involvement has been advocated in different quarters for many years.  There has been a longstanding consensus among political parties in this country in favour of extending what the European Commission termed the &ldquo;democratic imperative&rdquo; to representative arrangements in the workplace.</P>
      <P>My party collegue, Gene Fitzgerald, MEP, when he was Minister for Labour published a Government discussion paper in 1980 on the subject of worker involvement.  The Bill now before the House brings a long process of debate, trial and compromise an important stage further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is also significant because it confirms this Government's endorsement of the usefulness of mechanisms of consensus in improving our industrial relations climate.  It is possible to use legislation as a catalyst for a change.  It can set a headline and help to encourage more concerted efforts on the part of management and employees at enterprise level.  There has been a tendency on <Col N="911" /> the part of those enterprises, both in the public and the private sector, who have pioneered new forms of employee involvement to keep their experience very much to themselves.  I have spoken before of the need to shed more light on the new forms of work organisation and of co-operation which have been developed in this country.  The promotion of this Bill has already been widely welcomed as a spur to such developments.</P>
    <P>The Bill will support the development of worker involvement below the level of the board in a total of 39 State enterprises. A few of these have longstanding worker participation arrangements. Others have only recently taken the first steps to develop either new structures or consultative arrangements.  I was pleased to be associated with the recent launch by two major State organisations, Aer Rianta and Telecom Éireann, of initiatives in this area which they have now publicly endorsed as part of their corporate philosophy.  Other State enterprises have yet to consider joint consultation.  This Bill should help them to take the first steps in the participative process.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives employees the opportunity to initiate discussion on the implementation of worker participation in their organisation.  Once a majority of employees or the unions which represent them request participation, it is up to the enterprise and to employee interests to devise between them mutually acceptable arrangements.  The terms of the resulting arrangement will be contined in an agreement signed by both parties. While the Bill gives employees the right to initiate the participative process, this provision in no way interferes with the existing role of management.  They remain free to bring forward their own proposals or to approach employee representatives about the development of a joint approach to participation at sub-board levels.</P>
    <P>Flexibility in the adoption of new initiatives at company level is a key feature of the sub-board provisions in the Bill.  Each enterprise and its employees <Col N="912" /> will have the opportunity to develop a unique participative agreement which will reflect the interests and concerns they have in common.  The Bill does not prescribe any particular type of vehicle for consultation or participation at company level.  The enterprise and its employees can decide among themselves the type of arrangements to suit their situation.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that this flexibility will stimulate more innovative developments. We are familiar with participation councils in a number of bodies, but I would expect joint working parties on particular areas and other types of consultative machinery to be developed where this is preferred.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not set out to limit the range of issues for consideration in each enterprise.  The agenda will be decided jointly by the enterprise and its employees.  In that way, the subject areas which are appropriate for participation in each particular enterprise can be identified at local level.</P>
    <P>In a number of State enterprises the widespread use of consultative councils should enable a broad participative agenda to operate from the outset.  In others, it may be that a more gradual build-up of subject areas can be expected.  As confidence and trust develop between both sides, a broader range of areas may suggest themselves for inclusion in the participative process. Although flexibility is the keynote, some critical elements are essential to the evolution of participation and these are set out in section 6 of the Bill.  Whatever kind of vehicle is used for sub-board participation, it should ensure the maximum appropriate disclosure of information about plans, performance and change.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill requires the exchange of views as well as the exchange of clear and reliable information between the enterprise and its employees; the communication in good time to employees of information likely to have a significant effect on their interests; and the distribution to all employees of views and information arising from the participative process.  These are the basic requirements.  There are, of course, <Col N="913" /> many issues on which management and unions could make progress for mutual benefit, by sharing information and joint discussion, leading to better decisions for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from sub-board participation, the Bill will extend and amend earlier worker participation legislation.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, provided board level representation for workers in seven State enterprises.  They are Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, B &amp; I, CIE, ESB, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and NET.  This Bill will designate two more State enterprises &mdash; Aer Rianta and the National Rehabilitation Board &mdash; for worker director arrangements.</P>
    <P>Arising from a Committee Stage amendment which I tabled in the Seanad, this Bill incorporates the provisions for workers director elections in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, which were originally contained in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, in a single code.  The consolidation of the statutory arrangements affecting these bodies follows upon requests from and consultations with the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>More significant for the future development of board level participation in our State enterprises is a new general provision contained in section 24(2) of the Bill.  This will allow the Minister for Labour to extend worker director elections to further State enterprises without recourse to primary legislation.  Under the provision, the Minister may by affirmative order designate additional State enterprises for board level participation after consultation with other interested Ministers.  This will get over the problem which required special legislative provisions to be made in the case of the establishment of An Post and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The original seven State enterprises designated in the 1977 Act were all commercial enterprises.  The formula adopted in that Act gave one-third of all positions on the board to elected worker directors and was specifically devised to cater for commercial boards.  As this Bill <Col N="914" /> designates a non-commercial enterprise &mdash; the National Rehabilitation Board &mdash; for worker director elections, some adjustment to the original formula is required.</P>
    <P>What is needed above all is an approach which is responsive to the requirements of the type of board which operates in the non-commercial sphere. Worker directors are only one of a variety of representational appointments which may be required to be accommodated on such boards.  In appointing worker directors in the non-commercial enterprise sector, it is important not to upset the essential balance which should obtain among the diversity of interests usually represented on these boards.  The optimum number of board members will also be a practical consideration if a cohesive and effective board is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The relative importance of considerations such as these will vary from enterprise to enterprise and no one formula for board level participation will be suitable in all instances.  Accordingly, section 21 of the Bill permits the Minister for Labour to vary, by order, the number of worker directors below the one-third provision.  The Bill requires, however, that at least two worker directors should be appointed to any board.</P>
    <P>These are the main features of the Bill. There are also a number of other amendments to the 1977 Act which I will mention briefly.  Indeed, some of these points were highlighted in the Seanad debate. Section 9 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Labour to extend the vote in worker director elections to employees in the subsidiaries of State enterprises. The provision allows for extension of the franchise by ministerial order after consultation with other Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>The mechanism for initiating action by the Minister for Labour provided at section 9 (3) of the Bill is the result of an amendment which I introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The amendment takes account of concerns, particularly in relation to the position of overseas subsidiaries, expressed to me both outside that House and in the course of the Second State debate.  I am satisfied <Col N="915" /> that the text now before the House deals in an effective way with the difficulties which were raised.</P>
    <P>The new text gives representatives of employees an equal say with the State enterprise in initiating any proposal for extending the vote to subsidiaries.  The original text had left the enterprise with an exclusive right of application to the Minister and required only that the views of employee representatives in the State enterprise should accompany that application.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern about the definition of employee proposed in the Bill.  Under the original Act, only whole-time workers could participate in worker director elections.  The Bill broadens the definition to include employees working a minimum of 18 hours per week.  This is a catching up exercise and brings the definition of employee, for the purposes of worker participation, into line with that provided in other legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me, both in the Seanad and by trade union interests, that this definition does not take account of concerns relating to part-time employees on low hours of work.  I have recently received a detailed submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which is seeking the implementation of a package of measures relating to the position of part-time workers.  Should the Government be persuaded of the need to make such changes, then the position with regard to the status of part-time workers under a number of Acts would have to be addressed by amending legislation. I do not consider that the matter is appropriate for resolutions in the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am extending the terms of office of worker directors from three to four years. This increase in the term of office is the result of requests from both the worker directors themselves and from the boards of some designated State enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Bill also requires that worker directors who relinquish their employment will at the same time cease to hold board membership.  This provision will <Col N="916" /> ensure that employees are represented at board level by one of their number.  It does away with the possibility of a worker director who retires, resigns, or perhaps takes up employment with a competitor, continuing to represent the workers at board level in his or her previous employment. The extension of the term of office of worker directors to four years also points to the need for a provision of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the level of interest shown in this Bill.  There is a new momentum behind the promotion of employee involvement.  There is a growing sense of common purpose on the part of the enterprise and its employees.  There is a shared interest in keeping the business open, in maintaining or increasing the demand for services or product and in developing the business so that it continues to meet the market demands.</P>
    <P>In today's competitive environment, organisational effectiveness is not easily achieved.  The task of running a successful State enterprise requires the joint effort of both management and employees. This involves sharing information about the enterprise and engaging in meaningful consultation about the options for increased efficiency in the future.</P>
    <P>Participation will not do away with unpalatable decisions but it should, through information and consultation, allow a wider range of options to be considered before decisions are taken.  It is also to be expected that a decision taken on that basis is less likely to encounter the opposition and resentment which employees feel about a bolt from the blue.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives strong support to the development of worker participation in our State enterprises.  I am confident that all concerned will have the foresight to implement arrangements for the good of both employees and the enterprise and, ultimately, the consumers of the services and products of our public enterprises.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in broad terms in so far as it goes.  I <Col N="917" /> congratulate the Minister on its introduction and wish him well with its speedy progress through the House.  I hope that by the time the Bill is completed it will carry with it certain amendments to which I shall refer as I go along.  I notice that the Minister referred to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  I am not too sure that some of the amendments which the Minister has made tighten up the Bill sufficiently.</P>
      <P>First, I am disappointed that the Bill is a State enterprise Bill and not a worker participation Bill.  It is time that worker participation was not confined simply to State enterprise.  We constantly tell ourselves in this House that State enterprise should have the same terms of reference and opportunities as in the private sector, yet we do not compel the private sector to meet the same requirements as State enterprise.  There is no valid reason for that, except that the State happens to own the enterprise concerned and, presumably, we feel that we have a special authority to make a decision on its behalf. We also have the duty and right to legislate for the public interest.  It is without doubt within the powers of this House to amend the necessary legislation, including the Companies Acts, to compel other private sector enterprises to ensure adequate participation for their employees.  This legislation has not been addressed by the House since 1977. Coming back to it 11 years later, it has worked pretty well in the public sector.  I do not see why we are not looking at the whole question of worker participation in the private sector also and I am sorry that the Bill does not address that.  I hope that the Minister will return to that at another stage with a later Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that every company have the need to have worker participation. In the case of the vast majority of companies here there is already worker participation since the workers are usually the people who own the company. There are two or three companies where the directors are also the workers. However, where there is a significant number of workers and they do not know <Col N="918" /> what is going on although their whole future is tied up in that enterprise, democratisation in 1988 requires that they should have a role and be consulted.  Not only should they have some sort of authority and an input into how the business is run, but some sort of responsibility as to how it is run.</P>
    <P>Many of the strikes which take place here are contributed to by the fact that there is an attitude of apartheid towards workers, particularly those who happen to get a bit of dirt under their fingernails. There is an attitude that manual workers are, somehow, a lesser breed and society in general has a stand point that, somehow, the white or blue collar worker or professional is to be taken in preference to the tradesman or the man who works on the ground.</P>
    <P>We are living in an era of communications in which the media play a very big role and people are aware of the problems which face society and face those in business.  Workers should be involved in a more trusting way in the enterprise for which they work and to which in many cases they have committed their life's vocation.  It is not just a case of asking workers to have a say.  It is a case of asking workers to have a say and to take responsibility.  I do not believe that you can have authority without responsibility.  That has been one of our great failures in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell for a few moments on the question of manual workers.  Blue and white collar workers are equally as important and should have representation and it seems that, first, all workers need a greater involvement in the way in which the enterprise for which they work is run and in the way decisions affecting that enterprise are reached.  At least, the white collar workers are involved in day to day matters with the management and have some closer knowledge of the situation, but the doer, the man on the ground, the man out delivering or manufacturing, the man who is giving his sweat and toil in many cases, not only has no say but has no association <Col N="919" /> with those who run the enterprise.  This is a particularly Irish failing.</P>
    <P>In many cases the people doing the manual jobs are the people on whom the whole enterprise relies for success. Without the manufacturing employees a company can have all the sales and marketing managers and accountants it likes but the enterprises will fail.  Whether an enterprise is public or private there should be a change of attitude, particularly to manual workers.  Manual workers' workers' interests should be promoted and they should have a greater say in how an enterprise is run.  That applies to all workers but I am making a point for a sector who are often overlooked and then are the dubious beneficiaries of patronising attitudes from people who think that manual skills suggest that there are no brain skills involved.  It is time this attitude was changed.</P>
    <P>Some people think there are stake holders and non-stake holders in enterprise. There is no such thing as a stake holder or a non-stake holder.  We all have a stake in how enterprises are run whether they be private or public.  The growth of the worker involvement in companies is to be welcomed in principle, but certain sections of this Bill could be strengthened to bring about greater democracy and a more enterprising spirit in the enterprises referred to by the Minister in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>Arising from a Committee Stage amendment which I tabled in the Seanad, this Bill incorporates the provisions for worker director elections in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann which were originally contained in the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, in a single code.</P>
    <P>There are still weaknesses in that regard. At present nine semi-State companies have worker directors on their boards. Of these, seven have worker directors elected under the 1977 Act and Telecom Éireann and An Post have worker directors elected under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  This Bill deals directly with the 1977 Act but <Col N="920" /> does not apply at present to the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act. 1983 to the extent it should despite the fact that the Minister mentions it in his speech.</P>
    <P>I understand that Telecom Éireann and An Post are covered in that sub-board participation arrangements are provided for in Part III of the First Schedule of the new legislation.  However, Telecom Éireann and An Post at present have worker directors, so why not include them in either Part I or Part II of this schedule?  The Minister should address this, as it is anomalous.  The Worker Director State Enterprises Group located in Cork have put forward quite reasonable views along these lines.  It seems that the new legislation will leave a number of anomalies between the worker directors elected under the 1977 Act and those elected under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  The Bill will increase the term of office of the worker directors to four years.  This apparently will not apply to Telecom Éireann and An Post.  Perhaps the Minister will address that when replying to the debate.  The Bill will also enable the returning officer to fix the nomination day in the second and subsequent years. The Explanatory Memorandum says on section 10:</P>
    <P>Section 10 increases to four years the term of office of worker directors/members.  It replaces the provision for a three year term of office in the Principal Act.  The section also assigns to the returning officer the responsibility for setting the nomination day in election years.  It requires him to set a nomination day within a specified time.  If he does not, any employee of the enterprise concerned may ask the Minister for Labour to arrange for the setting of a nomination day.  The section prescribes subsequent procedures including, where necessary, the setting of the nomination day by the Minister.  In the Principal Act, the setting of nomination days had been the direct responsibility of the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> In Telecom Éireann and An Post, under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act the returning officer sets the nomination day but employees in both these companies cannot apply to the Minister if the nomination day is not set. This anomaly should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable subsidiaries to be enfranchised by ministerial order.  This does not apply to Telecom Éireann and An Post.  The Bill will allow for a receipt of nominations over a seven-day period and will allow for receipt of postal ballots over a 30-day period.  As far as these provisions are concerned, in Telecom Éireann and An Post elections shall be held in accordance with arrangements made by the returning officer.  That seems to be another anomaly.  The new legislation should apply to all worker directors whether elected under the 1977 Act or the 1983 Act.  I hope the Minister will address this question on Committee Stage.  Directors in Telecom Éireann or in An Post should not be treated differently from anybody else.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Minister for Labour can provide for worker representation of less than one-third of board size in certain State enterprises, subject to a minimum of two workers. Will the Minister consider the question of the appointment of female directors particularly where females make up a substantial part of the workforce or make up specialised sections of the workforce. From recent public statistics it is obvious that women do very badly in being appointed to boards of State enterprises. The Minister should consider putting in a provision that where there is a substantial number of female employees, at least one of the worker directors should be female. That is something worth the consideration of the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of broadening the definition of employee and excluding people who have left the enterprise, that is a worthy suggestion.  If somebody leaves the enterprise he should not continue on the board representing the workers in that enterprise, but there is one difficulty with that broad principle and that relates to retired employees.  As <Col N="922" /> an example, CIE pensioners got a very good increase in their pensions under the last Government &mdash; a good increase on a very small pension.  These pensioners did not have representation on the board of CIE which could influence the pension funds which affected their entitlement. That is anomalous.  If it is not possible to have a retired person on the board of a large State enterprise like CIE, there should be somebody among the workers elected to the board charged with the responsibility of ensuring that retired members of the workforce are taken into account.  It seems to me that retired workers are constantly ignored.  Nobody is interested in their plight.  For a long time in CIE their interests were not at the centre of things in such a way as to bring about the changes to which they were entitled and which they got to some extent although certainly not to the full extent they should have.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer back to the submission made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in which they sought the implementation of a package of measures relating to the position of part-time workers.  I note that the Minister stated that should the Government be persuaded of the need to make such changes then the position with regard to the status of part-time workers under a number of Acts would have to be addressed by amending legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider this given the large number of unemployed, particularly young people, who are taking on part-time work as it is the only work they can find.  In firms such as McDonalds a large amount of the employees would not be considered full-time employees in the sense of what we perceive as full-time pay and pensionable employment.  I am aware that this Bill does not relate to firms such as McDonalds but I think it should, both private and public.</P>
    <P>A very strong case could be made for democratisation in enterprises over a certains size &mdash; what one might call non-closed companies &mdash; so that workers would have greater involvement and a greater say in how the business is run <Col N="923" /> as well as greater responsibility.  When democratisation was introduced in Europe it was frowned upon and I read in a review of a recent publication where the threat of papal authority was used in an effort to put people off democratisation. We have been through several industrial revolutions, in fact industrial revolutions are constantly taking place.  It is time we made industry more democratic and gave those who have put their blood, sweat and tears into an industry a say in how that industry is run and on how their conditions of employment are determined.  On Committee Stage the Fine Gael Party will return to certain of the matters I have mentioned here and I hope the Minister will address some of these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse:</NameTxt>
      <P>While regretting the long delay in bringing forward this legislation I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House. The Progressive Democrats welcome the extension of the 1977 Worker Participation Act.  It has been generally agreed by both the FUE and the ICTU for some years, particularly since the late sixties, that greater industrial democracy leads to higher productivity and industrial peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that this Bill provides for the election of worker directors to two further State enterprises, namely, Aer Rianta and the National Rehabilitation Board.  I welcome the extension of the term of office of a worker director from three to four years and I further welcome that the definition of employee would include part-time staff working a minimum of 18 hours a week. In the past those who worked part-time had very few rights and guarantees and to some extent within the workforce generally they were regarded as second class citizens.  This Bill will continue in a very beneficial way to improve industrial relations in this country and I believe it will lead to greater job satisfaction, improved productivity and greater efficiency in the work place and will <Col N="924" /> enable companies to employment more of our unemployed.</P>
    <P>How many man days have been lost due to unofficial and official strikes?  How many companies have gone into liquidation as a result of these very same strikes?  Good industrial relations mean less man days lost due to strikes. Efficiency in industry can continue to improve the lot of all concerned, both employee and employer, if they are prepared to sit down and talk and share their views and differences.</P>
    <P>Of particular importance is the provision concerning the sub-board participative arrangements contained in section 2 and 8 of the Bill.  We are particularly pleased to note that detailed arrangements for the exchange of views and information on management and on the views and ideas of employees and for the dissemination of information are to be implemented in companies as diverse as Bord na Móna and the VHI.  The list of companies set out in Parts I and III of the First Schedule to the Bill is impressive and one hopes that these arrangements if they do not already exist in the companies listed in Part II of the Schedule, including Aer Lingus, An Post, B &amp; I and Nitrigen Éireann and so on will be put in place in the near future.</P>
    <P>Under the old 1977 Act Córas Iompair Éireann were one of the designated bodies which had worker directors.  As the Minister is aware, Córas Iompair Éireann have been divided into three separate bodies, namely, Iarnrod Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, and I would like the Minister to consider that instead of providing sub-board status for these three bodies, he provide worker director status for them.  Córas Iompair Éireann had their fair share of industrial problems.  Since their inception Bus Átha Cliath have had their problems and to a lesser extent Iarnrod Éireann and Bus Éireann.  I believe that giving full board status to these bodies would certainly do a lot for industrial relations within them.</P>
    <P>It is now well established, particularly among smaller enterprises, that the distinction between management and the rest of the workers in a company is out <Col N="925" /> of date.  We all applaud this.  In order to ensure the efficient and successful management of any company in the late eighties it has been necessary to adopt the principle that prosperity in a company can only be gained through shared effort and shared reward.  Thus, it should be the concerned of the Government, not only in the public but also in the private sector, that the economy be sustained by companies which are not likely to end up with serious industrial disputes at every turn due to out of the date management structures which are to be found in some companies today.</P>
    <P>Most of the disputes in the past did not result from disagreement over wages or the conditions of employees but because of a general lack of communication and information on the future direction of a company.  This led workers to ally themselves through their unions in an attitude of opposition and hostility towards the directors and management of companies.  By allowing a free flow of information which is the subject of an EC directive this climate of confrontation and antagonism can be largely overcome in industry.  We would, therefore, like to see a mechanism if not an actual Bill instituted by the State which would facilitate smaller developments in the private sector.  I hope that managements involved at all levels will have the necessary foresight and responsibility to see that these initiatives are as much to their advantage as to the advantage of the workers themselves. Dual communication is vital in order to have the fullest understanding among the workforce and to underline the importance of full understanding of company objectives and worker objectives.</P>
    <P>The Irish workforce have changed considerably during the years.  Today we have a young, highly intelligent and well educated population.  Educationally the vast majority of our population will stand shoulder to shoulder with members of a board of directors and have qualifications that will match or indeed be greater than those held by members of a board of directors.  We should all be quick to learn from the experience of Aer Rianta and <Col N="926" /> Telecom Éireann in order to see how greater employee participation as part of a corporate management philosophy leads to higher productivity and the achievement of financial targets.  One also hopes that people would realise that many changes have occurred in the workplace since the late seventies.  Men and women alike have equal aspirations and the workforce have had to accommodate the greater level of female participation. Likewise, over 30,000 Irish workers now own shares in their companies due to the change made in the Finance Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>These developments must be perceived in the broader context of the concept of employee involvement in employment, whereby employment holds out the prospect of fulfilment and satisfaction.  In the face of a continuously changing society, I hope changing patterns of work will remove the caution, tradition and fear which have in the past blinkered and served to inhibit progress and development.  I hope all workers in the various State enterprises will recognise that this Bill offers opportunities to allow them to become involved in the decision-making process of the enterprises in which they work.</P>
    <P>Detailed comment on other sections of the Bill can be left more appropriately to Committee Stage.  In conclusion, I think we all need to be realistic about what worker participation can achieve. Worker participation on its own is not a solution to job security or low productivity. Progress requires patience, time and much discussion.  It is a matter of urgency, however, in the difficult economic environment in which enterprise operates today for management and workers to identify common ground as opposed to areas of confrontation. Worker participation with the emphasis on co-operation should help to bring about a climate of trust which, if achieved, should make a significant contribution to the solution of the depressing problems facing the State enterprises, which are referred to in this Bill.  Genuine participation by workers and management, working together and co-operating with one another to achieve greater <Col N="927" /> productivity and prosperity will not alone improve the individual worker's life but will go a long way towards helping to improve the overall economy of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be assured of my support and indeed my party's support. Again, I congratulate him on introducing this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see a Bill of this nature before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Although I will be raising a number of points regarding the limitations of the Bill, none the less I am in agreement with other Deputies that an extension of worker democracy is welcome.</P>
      <P>I am indeed, particularly, heartened by the reaction of Deputy Wyse of the Progressive Democrats and Deputy G. Mitchell of Fine Gael.  From what they have said tonight there seems to be a basis whereby a Private Members' motion could be tabled and the extension of worker democracy could be introduced into the private sector.  I thought for a moment that my case had been taken up by Deputy Mitchell and that he had adopted the classic Labour Party position and I was beginning to become a little concerned that my position had been usurped by the Deputy.  I am sorry he is not present so that I could extend my sincere thanks to him for his commitment to the extension of industrial democracy and worker participation to the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of worker participation was initiated by the Labour Party in Government in 1977 and the present legislation is yet a further development of that.  Indeed, Deputy Quinn as Minister for Labour in 1985, established an advisory committee on worker participation and it is to the credit of that committee that they produced a very valuable study, which gave the background to the Coalition Bill on worker participation in 1986.  Regrettably, that legislation fell when the Labour Party withdrew from Government, but the groundwork had been done, and the <Col N="928" /> Labour Party are pleased to have the Bill before the House at last.</P>
    <P>The principle of worker involvement at board level in State enterprises is a progressive and useful one.  There are now no less than seven State enterprises which benefit from worker participation at board level.  Their smooth running is possibly still a bit of a surprise to some of the cynics of 1976, who condemned the Bill and who raised deep reservations about the ability of ordinary workers to sit on boards of State companies, participate in the success of the enterprise and act as a worthwhile liaison between workers and management &mdash; particularly when difficult decisions had to be made.</P>
    <P>A little of this cynicism appeared during the Seanad debate when a small number of Senators referred to the difficulties which the worker directors would encounter when elected to State boards. As one Senator said on Second Stage on 3 February 1988:</P>
    <P>Not only do they in effect have to cross into new work terrain which would have been strange and maybe even hostile to them in the past, but they are also required to master aspects of a strange agenda, which they may not have the ready skills or background to cope with, such as financial statements, or planning, or economic analysis</P>
    <P>Statements such as this show that the cynics are still among us.  Perhaps they should look over their shoulders at some of the operations which had no worker directors at board level and which needed no help in running into colossal financial difficulties, namely ICI or Irish Shipping. Indeed, perhaps if such agencies had worker representatives on the boards, the alarm might have been sounded in good time to save the Exchequer millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Senator Joe O'Toole during the Seanad debate, that workers have a real interest in ensuring the survival of a company.  Their watchfulness is based on the need to protect their own and their colleagues jobs.  In <Col N="929" /> addition, usually they bring to management boards long-term work experience with the company.  They will be acutely aware of trends in the market for the commodity or service; aware of activities of competitors, through their contact with workers in other companies and they will have a commitment to the enterprise which goes beyond the one-sided commitment to profit.  These are invaluable services to any board and no institutional education could match them.</P>
    <P>In proposing worker participation legislation in the mid-seventies the Labour Party envisaged a broadening of the involvement of workers throughout the public sector and into the private sector.  That is why I am so glad Deputy Mitchell agreed to this extension.  I hope the Minister will bear this in mind, while he is still in that particular Ministry.</P>
    <P>We anticipated greater participation at below board level and it is a disappointment that this did not happen to a greater degree.  However, I welcome the initiative in this Bill to extend the scope of the legislation in making provision for participation at sub-board level.  In extending the provision of the legislation to such a large number of enterprises, many more workers will inevitably go forward to sub-committees and this be in a better position to contribute to the planning and development of the agencies.</P>
    <P>Activity at sub-board level would I think, accelerate the move to principal board level and, therefore, I am particularly sorry that the Minister excluded the financial State companies from the sub-board provisions.  Perhaps the Minister could refer to this in his response and let the House know why he denied workers this facility.  The financial State sector is the most high powered and politically significant sector and the Minister must have some very deliberate reason for excluding workers from these bodies. I wonder whether it has anything to do with the suggestion that Irish Life be privatised?  Perhaps their exclusion could be an indication that the Government's intention is to privatise these companies, <Col N="930" /> but I sincerely hope not.  Yet, if I might refer back to the debacle of ICI and Irish Shipping, they are surely the most pressing reasons for having workers' representatives on such boards.</P>
    <P>I will move on to specific sections of the Bill.  The Labour Party attempted to amend section 6 of the Bill in order to copperfasten the need to provide information in adequate time for workers. Paragraph (b) refers to the provision of relevant information &ldquo;in good time&rdquo;.  I realise the Minister dealt with this point on Second Stage in the Seanad but I would like to refer to it again because his explanation for retaining the phrase was not very helpful.  &ldquo;In good time&rdquo; is a loose use of words and could be interpreted loosely in a situation of tension and animosity. The Minister must be aware of this and perhaps he could give some further consideration to tidying up the section to ensure that there can be no abuse of the term when there is a call to produce difficult and hard-hitting information about a particular enterprise.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the Minister means well but I think the wording is rather loose.  How do you measure good time as distinct from bad time? What yardstick do you use to measure good time?  Is it not possible for the draftsman to come up with some alternative wording for this section?</P>
    <P>I welcome the acceptance of the amendments during the Seanad debate on section 9 of the Bill because I accept that this diffuses anxiety with regard to subsidiaries in foreign countries, particularly with regard to one State enterprise. Trade unionists within that enterprise expressed concern that in that company there were far more people employed outside the State than there were employed within it who could have undue influence on decisions of the board.  The main provision of the Bill is to extend worker participation to Aer Rianta and the National Rehabilitation Board.  This is welcomed by the Labour Party.  Since the Bill is passing through the House 11 years after its initiation, I ask the Minister to consider extending its scope.</P>
    <P>While in Government the Labour <Col N="931" /> Party tried to push for worker directors on the National Rehabilitation Board, in VHI, Irish Steel, Board Gáis Éireann and IIRS.  Would the Minister consider an extension of his legislation to include these State agencies?  They are all enterprises which have been marked for worker directors, as has RTE, and there can be no argument that these bodies are not ready yet.  The Minister might also refer to the newly established bodies, such as Eolas and Teagasc and indicate what the situation will be with regard to worker directors in these specific enterprises.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill which concerns me is that section which empowers the Minister for labour, with the agreement of the relevant Minister, to extend worker participation legislation to additional State enterprises.  Within the current climate this aspiration appears quite reasonable, but it is our duty as legislators to try foresee future problems and I am concerned about the possibility of obstruction to worker participation if the climate changes. During the Seanad debate the Minister was quite dismissive of any suggestion that, at a future date, there might not be such willingness to encourage worker participation.  The Minister in his reply to the Second Stage debate assured Senators that his Department were wholly positive to the idea and he could not envisage any future situation in which this might change.  There could be a change of Minister. I have not doubt that the present Minister has proved to be quite receptive to date, but some successor in the future may not be as receptive or as accommodating.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Minister that the current feeling appears to be positive towards the notion of worker involvement, I cannot be so confident that this will always be the position.  For example, despite the involvement for four worker directors in NET, once the financial climate changed these worker directors were isolated on the board of NET and all the major financial decisions with regard to that company were taken by <Col N="932" /> the holding company which had been given an injection of State finance.  This is but one recent example of a situation where workers, having fought for worker participation and won, were then relegated to a board which, ineffect, had very little power.  This was overtly in opposition to the spirit of the legislation of 1977 and yet it was quite legal.  We cannot be so overtly confident that, once we get acceptance for worker participation on boards, we have nothing to do but sit back and wait for the concept to take on in other enterprises.  Clearly, history has shown that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I believe that the Minister needs to include in the Bill whatever developments he would like to see in the future.  For example, if there are State bodies which are ready for worker participation, I do not see why the Minister does not include them in the legislation at this point instead of waiting for a ministerial order in the future.  After all, if the legislation is to be extended to other State enterprises in the future, there will have to be agreement, first, between the Minister for Labour and the Minister for the relevant Department and, secondly, agreement in both Houses that the extension is in order.  This agreement may be more difficult to get in the future and I suggest to the Minister that we should deal with it now, including the enterprises I have already referred to, and get the matter cleared at this point when the climate is so positive to the notion of worker participation.</P>
    <P>Another important point which I would like to raise with the Minister and which was referred to at length in the Seanad debate is the 18 hour work week for qualification for participation in election of worker directors.  The Minister was urged to drop this qualification in favour of a more practical clause such as &ldquo;permanent worker&rdquo;.  The point was made to the Minister that a clause such as the one in section 13 of the Bill discriminates against workers with less than the 18 hours.  In the Seanad debate, my colleagues suggested that the Minister should amend the legislation to read &ldquo;any <Col N="933" /> person employed&rdquo;.  The Minister refused this amendment but I urge him to reconsider his position because of the discriminatory nature of the section.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the Minister that the working week of more and more people is falling to 18 hours and less.  In fact, at the moment we have a situation of conflict in RTE because of the proposed casualisation of telephonists.  Here we have a perfect example of a semi-State body which has ranked as one of the enterprises to be brought into sub-board worker participation and where the drift towards casualisation of jobs would inevitably result in many workers being prohibited from the election process because they do not work the required hours, even though they may be on the staff for years and may be directly affected by decisions at board level.</P>
    <P>One final concern which I would like to refer to is the power which the Bill gives to the Minister to limit the number of worker directors in some establishments. This clause is undemocratic and unnecessary.  The legislation is to further the principle of worker participation. It proposes to extend democracy within the workplace and acknowledges the benefit that this would be to the State and that this would be to the State and the workers.  In view of this I do not understand the need for the &ldquo;escape clause&rdquo; which empowers the Minister to roll back on this democracy if he is unhappy with the power of worker directors in the future.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his amendment to the Principal Act which is proposed in section 21.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, as I have said, I am pleased to see this legislation before the House.  I would like to compliment the Minister on pursuing the matter over the past year and getting the legislation advanced so speedily.  However, I am genuinely concerned about the sections which I have referred to and I ask the Minister to reconsider the attitude which he adopted in the Seanad.  It is 11 years since the first Worker Participation Bill was discussed in this House and it may be a lot longer before we have an opportunity to discuss this issue again.  I ask the Minister to take some of my suggestions <Col N="934" /> into consideration in order to eliminate the possibility of problems with the legislation in the future and to ensure a genuinely progressive approach to worker participation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party generally welcome the Bill and particularly those provisions which allow for the establishment of sub-board consultative councils in the various State companies and organisations, but we are very disappointed that the Minister has not taken the opportunity presented by this Bill to extend the concept of worker directors to such State companies as RTE, Bord Gáis, Irish Steel, the VHI and the many others which do not yet have worker directors.</P>
      <P>Most people in the State companies are satisfied that the introduction of some limited element of industrial democracy, in the form of electing worker directors, has been a very worthwhile development. It has given workers in those companies who elect worker directors a greater sense of involvement in the affairs of the company; it has probably ensured that they have a greater appreciation of the difficulties the companies sometime face, and it has helped to ease industrial relations problems.</P>
      <P>The Advisory Committee on Worker Participation, which included representatives from the trade unions, the semi-State companies and the private sector, in their report said:</P>
      <P>All members of the committee share the conviction that increased employee participation is desirable both for the personal development of the workers and for the benefit of the enterprise,</P>
      <P>The report went on to note:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All are agreed that effective employee participation generally requires communication of information, consultation and some involvement in the decision making process.  The problem is to some degree, one of mutual trust, and the development of a habit of mutual trust <Col N="935" /> is, necessarily, a lengthy process.  Trust can only be developed by doing.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the election of worker directors should not be considered as something to replace the union structures in the semi-State companies, or as an alternative to the free collective bargaining system.  The election of worker directors is not an alternative to normal employer employee relationships in these firms, but it complements it.  Most of those who have been elected as worker directors are people with a long record of involvement in the trade union movement and are only too well aware of the dangers of any attempt by the Government or management to undermine the role of the unions in semi-State firms.</P>
    <P>The election of worker directors has also brought to the boards of semi-State companies a degree of practical experience of work on the ground which was previously missing.  Most of those on the boards of semi-State companies are either representatives of the management or appointees from outside who may have some knowledge of the general principles of management.  Too often, unfortunately, those appointed to boards by Ministers in various Governments have been appointed more for the political allegiance than for any particular expertise.  At least now we have lorry drivers as well as accountants, labourers as well as management consultants, clerks as well as businessmen, on the boards of our semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>If the election of worker directors has been such a successful development in the limited number of State companies to which existing legislation applies, is it not very strange that the Government have failed to take the opportunity of this Bill to extend the concept, especially to some of the larger companies not already covered?  Why is it right to have worker directors in Bord na Móna but not in important institutions like RTE?  Why is it all right to have worker directors in an important energy provider like the ESB, but not in the increasingly important Bord Gáis Éireann?  There is a strong <Col N="936" /> argument for the extension of the concept of worker directors to other important State companies, such as RTE, Bord Gáis Éireann Irish Steel, the VHI and others, and we will be tabling amendments to this effect for the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill allowing for the establishment of sub-board consultative councils is a welcome development and a broadening of the concept of industrial democracy.  It should also contribute to a greater sense of commitment and involvement, the earlier identification of potential difficulties, and generally improved industrial relations. Most of the semi-State companies and bodies are included in the Bill for the establishment of sub-board consultative councils, but there is one area that is notable for its absence.  All of the State financial institutions have been excluded &mdash; the Central Bank, Industrial Credit Corporation, Agricultural Credit Corporation, Irish Life and Fóir Teoranta.  I understand that the official explanation for their exclusion is the Government's desire to safeguard the confidential character of their operation.  This is a disgraceful slur on the employees of those companies.  There is a clear implication in this attitude that the employees of these companies cannot be trusted to respect the confidentiality of discussions within the company.  But most of these employees have access, by the very nature of their work, to confidential information each day, yet there have been no complaints about unauthorised disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>How can the Government claim that the establishment of sub-board level consultative councils would be a threat to confidentiality?  There is no basis for this claim and the Bill should be amended to have ensure that these are allowed to have consultative councils.  Indeed, given the importance of these companies, there is a strong argument that they have full worker democracy, including the worker directors on the boards.  Why is it acceptable to have stockbrokers, bankers and all sorts of doubtful financial speculators on the boards of these companies but not <Col N="937" /> workers who may have given years and years of loyal service to the firm?</P>
    <P>Although it is not covered in this Bill, there is a need to look at how we can further extend the concept of industrial democracy not just in other areas of the public service, but also into the private sector.  The only ones benefiting at present from industrial democracy are the present employees of State companies.  Has any thought been given as to how this could be extended to other areas in the public service &mdash; Civil Service Departments for instance?</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on Worker Participation also considered the question of worker directors in the private sector and recommended the introduction of enabling legislation for all organisations employing more than 100 people.  The boards of many companies in the private sector have treated their workers with contempt.  They were glad to take the profits created by workers when times were good, but quick to close up and liquidate, without any concern for the workers when times got bad, or simply when they thought they could make more money by investing elsewhere. The election of worker directors in the private sector would be an important advance, and I would ask the Minister to outline his reaction to the recommendations of the advisory committee in this regard.</P>
    <P>Like any other development, to be successful industrial democracy requires the application of effort by all concerned, but it also requires the allocation of proper resources.  Many of the existing worker directors face great difficulties in meeting their commitments as workers and as directors and in some cases the workers of certain semi-State companies have been deliberately obstructed by management.</P>
    <P>If I may will mention one case.  I had a letter from a worker director on the board of IFI.  He showed me a warrant of appointment and told me that in order to carry out his business as a worker director he had no option but to take annual leave.  He claimed that the Irish <Col N="938" /> Fertiliser Industry were in breach of paragraph (b) of the warrant of appointment and he wanted that point noted.</P>
    <P>We had a number of concerned about sections of this Bill as it was originally printed and I note that some amendments were made to it as it passed through the Seanad.  We are pleased that An Post and Telecom Éireann have now been included with the other companies who elect worker directors.  We are also concerned about the provisions of section 24 of the Bill which appears to allow the Minister the power to arbitrarily take away from certain State companies the right either to have worker directors or indeed sub-board consultative councils. We will also be seeking to have this amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former industrial worker in the State area I am particularly happy at the Minister's commitment to worker participation.  Worker participation constitutes a logical step forward and is essential if we are to keep up with the remainder of Europe in the industrial field.</P>
      <P>To date this type of legislation has not received much attention, which may reflect the fact that few Members are ex-industrial workers.  The present Minister seems to have the happy knak of being able to cater for the various needs within industry, on which I congratulate him.</P>
      <P>There are a number of logical step forwards being taken by way of the provisions of this Bill, for examples, the extension of the term of office of a director from three to four years.  It is my opinion that people need that extra year to realise their full potential.  I welcome also the extension of the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;.  I know people are now arguing about the number of working hours necessary to qualify.  However, the Minister has recognised the place of the part time employee with which I am happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few Members in this House and in the Seanad had worries about a director who must relinquish his or her post.  I agree with the relevant provision because a silly anomally could be created if such a <Col N="939" /> director relinquished his post after, say, 12 months and came back as a director having no attachment to the industry or, in the case of a worker director, walked away leaving employees unrepresented. The real meat of the provisions of this Bill is contained in section 6, which is what the agreement referred to in that section is about, the remainder of the section merely identifying who should be involved and for what length of time</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to the exchange of views and reliable information, the giving in good time of any information about decisions which would significantly affect employees' interests should be there as of right in every industry.  It is criminal that to date some people have worked in industries for up to 40 years, in which decisions have been taken and they have been told only on the day a company is about to close.  Employees always have had a lot to offer, very often much more than a serving director on the board.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to hear Deputy Mitchell expound the idea of moving into the State area.  I welcome his contribution because I should like to see an extension into that area.  However, I fully appreciate the difficulties that could be encountered in that respect.  After all, it should be remembered that in the market place we are vying with others to attract companies here.  If we were to tell a company that they may have a number of directors imposed on them in addition to the other restrictions obtaining here &mdash; despite the fact that we have fairly good trade union law &mdash; we could lose an industry.  I should like to see this done by way of encouragement and consensus.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Mitchell that some of the more successful industries in the private sector have been those maintaining an open door with regard to information, who keep their employees <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in the company at all levels.  There is no question of their worrying about confidentiality.  Very often they have profit-sharing schemes in operation.  These are the types of companies where strikes do not take place. <Col N="940" /> There will be no confrontation in such companies because everybody feels they are a stakeholder.  They are stakeholders but it is important that they fully realise that fact.  The irony of the whole thing is that, by definition, employees in the semi-State sector are total stakeholders: being taxpayers they are paying for it and will eventually own it but there is need for such employees to be involved in the company's activities.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being introduced in the proper manner.  Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan was worried about the bad guys who might appear in the future.  There has been too much suspicion that something might happen in, say, ten years time, that we would revert to the bad old days and so on We need to adopt the approach being taken by the Minister, that is, to have a consensus, not imposing a partnership on one side or the other depending on what type of Minister might hold office at any given time, who might favour the employees' side by way of union legislation or the employers on the other.</P>
    <P>Much of our legislation is based on rules dating back 70 and 80 years.  That is probably an indictment of previous Governments and Ministers.  We must change very rapidly.  As Deputy Wyse said, there are massive changes taking place and industrial relations must travel apace.  There has to be greater involvement on the part of employees.  The Minister is taking a broad look at this, working in the area of training of directors, managers, employees.  He is also working on the question of industrial safety and now, by way of legislation, to have people participating in full.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>At times I worry that there is a fear in the minds of some members of the public that every employee is endeavouring to disrupt a company, waiting inside the door with a placard advocating a strike. That notion is crazy because the average employee completes his working life of 35 to 40 years without ever having been involved in a strike, a picket or anything else, and is anxious to participate.  If we look at the voluntary field we see proof of the fact that it is not merely the financial <Col N="941" /> incentive that encourages people, it is the feeling of belonging, of participating in decision-making, of knowing and understanding why one is doing something.  It should be remembered that such people work for no financial reward.  That proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that people will work harder, with greater commitment, when they fully understand their role.</P>
    <P>It would be criminal were employees to be unaware of information that might affect their future but there are other issues to be considered also.  To date there have been many working groups, usually called works councils.  Almost invariably there is a list of issues posted to them showing what matters may not be discussed.  That is ludicrous, eliminating all of the important issues, which means such people end up discussing the condition of toilets, canteens or whatever, which are not of any great importance; there are others to look after such matters.</P>
    <P>The avoidance of conflict is so important we need to think long and hard and concentrate our minds on it.  In that respect Deputy Sherlock mentioned companies or areas that had been omitted from the provisions of this Bill.  There are, after all, 39 companies included which constitutes a massive step forward which should be welcomed.  We can examine other areas in the future but there should not be any confrontation about this.  We should welcome this provision unreservedly and move forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the role played by the trade unions &mdash; it is critical that he should do so &mdash; and not in any patronising fashion.  Rather, he has recognised that they have a job to do, that they are constructive and committed to their members, that they have a difficult task.  The Minister has recognised that fact and has earned respect for so doing.  Likewise, he has recognised the role of the the employer, whether it happens to be the chief executive of a State company or a person putting in cash directly. That impartial approach was needed and I am very happy at the Minister's approach in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I was lucky in that I worked for a good company, Irish Steel Limited, a company that felt its employees should always be involved.  However, I know there are other companies in which employees feel themselves to be just a number on a payroll, very often working at half their full potential, because they are not allowed to become involved in decision-making and the like.  However, I do appreciate that not everybody can be in the directors boardroom but once one feels there is somebody to speak for one, to offer advice based on experience bought very dearly over one's working life that constitutes some assurance, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There remain weaknesses at all levels on which we must work.  That is now being taken in hand.  I would encourage the Minister to continue his efforts in this regard.  With the changes effected he has shown himself to be willing to listen to people in other areas.  Obviously he listened carefuly to what Members of the Seanad had to say and has gone along with many of the changes they felt could be effected.  I would encourage him to keep up that good work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with a number of technical points which I do not want to go into because I am sure the Minister will deal with them.  Like me, Deputy O'Sullivan is a Cork Deputy and I do not know whether it is coincidence that the three Deputies who have spoken tonight are from the Cork area, Deputy Wyse, Deputy O'Sullivan and myself.  We will have to get rid of the suspicious approach in industry and have a bit of trust and confidence.  I do not know who will be the next Minister but I am sure the Minister who follows the present Minister will be equally successful.  I make a strong case to the Minister to look at whatever avenues are open to him in encouraging the extension of this Bill into the private sector because there is a lot to be done there.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again &mdash; and I can draw on my own experience in this regard &mdash; that all workers in State, semi-State or private companies, if treated properly and respectfully, want to play their full <Col N="943" /> part in industry.  I know people who have gone way beyond the call of duty because they were treated in a proper fashion. This Bill is an opportunity for them to get involved at sub-board level and that is what is needed.</P>
    <P>As a fairly new Deputy in the House, I congratulate the Minister on his approach and willingness to listen to amendments and put them in where he feels they can be fitted in.  I strongly support the adoption of the Bill and ask those people with any feelings of aggression or conflict not to worry too much about the Bill, to accept it and move forward with it.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Wyse, Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Sherlock, Deputy Dennehy and all the Deputies who stayed back tonight to make their comments on this Bill. While there are matters on which Deputies wish to have clarification and some valid points which we can debate further on Committee stage I am heartened, as I was in the Seanad, by the general agreement on this legislation.  Many of the points which were made were raised in the Seanad and some new points have also been raised.  I will try to cover the general points raised by each Deputy in as much detail as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to private and public enterprises I think we were all glad to hear Deputy Mitchell's view though it is probably not a view on which there was agreement in the advisory committee which was set up by a previous Minister some years ago.  In drafting this Bill, the whole ethos has been on a voluntary and flexible approach in encouraging people into worker participation.  One would <Col N="944" /> defeat the whole purpose if one spoke about compulsion and driving people into worker participation.  I think Deputy Wyse pointed out that we should adopt a voluntary approach and encourage people, whether they are management or employees, to participate and build up a new co-operation with the workforce. Deputy Mitchell's view about forcing the private sector is not in keeping with the spirit of this legislation.  I will encourage the private sector to involve themselves in participation.  I do not believe &mdash; and I cannot see it within my remit &mdash; that it is open to me to force the private sector into worker participation but I will &mdash; as I have done on a number of occasions in the past at seminars which have been arranged on a nationwide basis &mdash; with the officials in my Department who have been involved in this for a number of years, try to encourage people to participate and get involved in worker participation. That is what has been said here this evening.</P>
    <P>Some comment was made with regard to the inclusion of women on State boards and the need to increase the number of women directors in State enterprises. Worker-director elections have already provided an opportunity for the first women to take their seats at board level in some State bodies.  As the Taoiseach informed the Dáil on 7 April, he has instructed Members of the Government to advance the status of women in all aspects of responsibility.  This includes the appointment of suitably qualified women to State boards and bodies.  I should also like to see a balanced representation as between men and women among the persons nominated by trade unions and staff associations standing in worker-director elections.  This is a matter for consideration by nominating bodies.  We discussed it last week during Question Time.  It is also a matter for the electorate who vote directors on to boards.  If these electorates are largely comprised of women workers surely it is a reflection on them for failing to put forward one of their own sex for election. All we can do is encourage people to consider equal representation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> With regard to worker directors in An Post and Telecom Éireann and the sub-board arrangements, I think that most Deputies have picked up the point that they are now fully within the scope of the legislation by means of an amendment to the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell also spoke about the need to represent the interests of retired workers.  Workers play their role while they are within the work force but I cannot see how they could be involved afterwards in the position of worker directors.  Everybody will retire some day and the worker directors who are there take this into account.  In the case the Deputy mentioned in CIE, it was the worker directors who came into this House and put forward the views on behalf of the retired members on several occasions during my time here and they continued to do that for several years until they got some of the programmes mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse asked a question about CIE.  I confirm that the Bill provides for worker director elections to the board of CIE, which is included in Part I of the First Schedule This allows, when read together with the Transport (Re-organisation of CIE) Act, for all employees in the three companies to participate in the elections to the main CIE board.  In addition the Transport Act allows for the appointment of worker directors to each of the subsidiary boards and, as I understand it, the subsidiary boards can have two worker directors from among the four who sit on the main board.  That Act covers the point the Deputy was concerned with.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned a number of extra bodies that are to get worker directors.  The recommendation to reduce from six to three the number of enterprises designated for worker director arrangements was made by previous Ministers and there has, for a number of years, been some difficulty in getting agreement to extend it to two boards but the Bill provides for worker director arrangements in two of the enterprises proposed, Aer Rianta and the <Col N="946" /> National Rehabilitation Board.  The third enterprise, An Foras Forbartha, has since been changed in status.  The other two will remain as in the previous Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the Bill allows for the addition of further State enterprises by order of the Minister.  I would like to stress that point because until now, in the 11 years of operation of the 1977 Act, if there is agreement, workers can have full board status.  One of the criticisms I have about the 1977 Act, and some of these difficulties are now resolved, is that in every other country and every properly organised firm, it is possible to have worker participation below the level of the board so that people obtain the experience of how to deal with industrial relations and various other issues within the company etc., and are then allowed on to the board as full members.  When I met the worker directors, one of the points they made was that there should be below-board representation where people can gain the experience and then be admitted to full status on the board, and that this allows the Minister of the day, without having to go through the long procedure of new legislation, to make that amendment in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and the parent Minister.  That is a major step forward.  It also gives the incentive to people to prove that worker participation at sub-board level is effective and successful.  Then I do not believe there would be a difficulty.  This is highlighted by the fact that Deputy Quinn was convinced by these two companies, as I am.  That is why the Act has been amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to read section 24 (2) in that light.  It empowers the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Labour, with the Minister for Finance and the Minister responsible for the enterprise concerned, to give full board status.  The Department of Labour is the Department trying to get worker participation moving, particularly in State enterprises and in private enterprises, and as such would be only too glad to give that status.  But there is no agreement <Col N="947" /> in some of the boards mentioned here tonight.  I do not wish to go through all the arguments.  I have spoken to the workers concerned both formally and informally and they are happy with the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the phrase &ldquo;in good time&rdquo;.  There was much debate about that.  In the Seanad I said that section 6 (2) provides that one of the features of participative arrangements at sub-board level would be the disclosure of relevant information by management to employees in good time.  There was some concern expressed in the Seanad that this is too loosely worded, and that has been expressed here again this evening, although some of those who raised the matter acknowledged the difficulty of finding a more precise wording and we had a long debate about that.  The phrase &ldquo;in good time&rdquo; was settled upon after consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.  It allows management and staff representatives in the State enterprises concerned to make their own provisions in this area which will take into account the particular circumstances of the enterprise, and it would not be tied into legislation one way or another, because a day may be sufficient for one organisation but a month or several weeks may not be sufficient in the case of another organisation.  To attempt to impose a uniform length of notice would be too inflexible.  In the end in the Seanad we all came to that conclusion.  The people best placed to determine the meaning of &ldquo;in good time&rdquo; in each instance are the management and staff representatives of the enterprise.  I am purposely not trying the hands of an enterprise. The legislation is geared for people working in co-operation.  I am endeavouring not to put hard and fast regulations into legislation which would require an Act at some future date to change.  It is designed to be purposely flexible and loose and to be used accordingly by management and employees in the future, not something vague that works against them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock raised the same point about the number of bodies for worker <Col N="948" /> director arrangements.  I have answered that in dealing with Deputy O'Sullivan's point.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the definition of employees in the Bill.  The amendment in the Bill is merely a catching-up exercise.  It broadens the definition of employees in the 1977 Act from whole time employees to those working not less than 18 hours per week. This issue was the subject of some debate in the Seanad when several Senators queried the merits of the 18 hour threshold. However, the question of part time workers is a much broader issue which is not appropriate for a resolution in the context of this Bill.  The whole issue of part time workers is now a major one.  I acknowledge that readily and have been in discussion with the Congress of Trade Unions on the issue and they are making a number of recommendations.  The policy group within the Department of Labour will look at this area.  There is a requirement to tighten it up and look at the whole question of the 18 hours in the context of all our legislation.  The 18 hours is standardising what is in all the other Acts.</P>
    <P>I want to put on the record that the question of part time workers is now in discussion and we are making some progress. It has created a number of difficulties in social welfare and labour legislation and with the Congress of Trade Unions, and their proposals which we have started to look at are extremely interesting.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we spoke about this issue as well.  It will be looked at and will be the subject of further discussions, but it is not the purpose of this Bill to increase or reduce the threshold.  In this Act we are bringing the 18 hours down to what has been inserted in legislation over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock referred to the exclusion of the financial institutions, the Central Bank, the Industrial Credit Corporation, the Agricultural Credit Corporation. Irish Life and Fóir Teoranta have been omitted from the First Schedule which lists the bodies designated for sub-board participation.  I agree with <Col N="949" /> Deputy Sherlock that it is not because these people who hold confidential information on a daily basis will start running around the country giving information about something that happened.  There is an acknowledgment in the financial institutions of the importance of their business and both sides recognise that.  If information in any form is discussed in the State area it can create major difficulties. Some of those points have been well made by Senators in the Seanad.  It is correct to say that they have not now been included in the sub-board legislation. I do not believe that will create a difficulty for the financial institutions because of their very nature they have their own confidential arrangements for dealing with the information.  It would not be in the interests of management or employees to get into a position of talking about the confidential information which they have to discuss from day-to-day. While information which is discussed can damage other organisations but for financial organisations the repercussions are immense.  I should like to inform Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan that it has nothing to do with the privatisation or selling off of Irish Life.  That is a separate issue and it has nothing to do with what we are talking about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock referred to a letter he had received from a worker director on the board of the IFI.  The question of the facilities to be afforded to worker directors on a day-to-day basis in pursuing issues related to board membership is, and must remain, a matter for the enterprise concerned.  The facilities available to worker directors vary from enterprise to enterprise.  In the case of NET it is understood that the facilities were particularly good prior to the joint venture agreement.  The Department of Industry and Commerce have indicated that in the year 1986-87 the time spent by the four directors was fairly considerable.</P>
    <P>I made it clear in the Seanad that I would be totally against any particular enterprise affecting the worker directors relationships or their working methods. It had built up over 1977 and it was obvious that some enterprises would do better <Col N="950" /> than others.  The worker directors became more involved in the day-to-day staff activities than others.  In the case of NET there is a tightening of those regulations.  As I spelled out clearly, if it was a matter affecting how they carried out their work I would be extremely concerned. The intention is that worker directors can fulfil their role and their duties properly and not be interfered with.  I had discussions with the worker directors of NET some months ago regarding their particular problems.  It is a matter for the Minister if there are any difficulties.  It is an issue we will keep in touch with.</P>
    <P>Lest somebody believes that worker directors are being interfered with and that their roles are being immersed by the chairmen of boards, that is not the position.  There was a particular problem with NET who had better conditions and we will continue to monitor that as it was necessary to keep control of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock referred to the power of the Minister under section 24 to delete bodies from the legislation.  The Minister may add or delete the enterprises, as I have already said, from Part I and Part II of the First Schedule and of the Second Schedule only after he has consulted with the Minister for Finance and the Minister responsible for the State enterprise concerned. After such consultation takes place, the deletion of the body would be the subject of an affirmative order requiring debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The addition or deletion of bodies from Part III of the First Schedule is subject to an order laid before the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days, the order remaining valid unless a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House. The provision for deletion must be seen in the broad context of section 24.  The section allows for the future extension of worker participation in the State sector without recourse to primary legislation. It makes provision for unseen future circumstances, such as the requirements of new enterprises, for initial work and involvement arrangements and that of existing enterprises for more comprehensive participative processes.  If the <Col N="951" /> flexibility provided by the section is to be effective, it must also take account of future amalgamation, abolition or other circumstances which would entail the deletion of the bodies concerned from the Schedules.</P>
    <P>In many circumstances, deletion of a body from one part of the Schedule will be with a view to its addition in another part of the same Schedule.  For example, any enterprise may be deleted from Part III from the sub-board arrangements of the First Schedule only for the purpose of adding it to Part I or II of the Schedule, thus designating it for worker director arrangements as well as for sub-board participation.  These powers are intended to avoid any difficulties in the future and not for any sinister reasons.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for the constructive contributions they have made.  I also thank my Cork colleagues among whom the worker participation legislation has generated much interest.  I know that a number of the worker directors elected are from that area.  The issue concerning manual workers was raised by Deputy Mitchell.  Worker directors can come from whatever category.  There is no discrimination and I do not believe some of the arguments which Deputy Mitchell put forward about technical workers, white collar and blue collar workers.  I have endeavoured to stop categorising anybody as I do not think it is helpful to do so.  Many of those arguments are arguments of the past.  The technical people who work with their hands in any industry are involved in technology and bio-technology and are often far more important than white collar workers.  Many of those arguments are arguments of the fifties and not of recent times.  I do not want to say anymore about them.</P>
    <P>It remains for me to thank the Deputies from all sides and from all parties for contributing on the Second Stage of this debate.  Other points which perhaps I have not referred to, I will undertake to look at them again and the arguments which were put forward before we take the Committee and remaining Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to place on the record of the House that my reason for raising this matter is not due to any discussion that I have had with any member of the Garda Síochána at any level but it is due entirely to the subject matter of the article in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> of last week which was headed: &ldquo;Anger as Garda Chief is moved&rdquo;.  The article goes on to spell out a number of things to which would like to refer.  I want also to place on record that it is not in any way a reflection on the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I want to say at the outset also that I welcome the proposed appointment of Chief Superintendent John J. Nolan to Dundalk to take charge, I understand, of special appointments as also reported in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> of last week. Anything that can be done as far as I am concerned to improve security on the Border is welcome.  As one who has served for over 29 years in the Defence Forces of the State in the Border area I know and appreciate the problems there. Any strengthening of security as far as Dundalk is concerned would be welcomed by me and indeed by all the people in County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to place on record that we <Col N="953" /> welcome the appointment of Superintendent Faughnan to replace Superintendent Jack Keogh who retired having served in Drogheda.  I should like to say to the Minister that much concern has been expressed at the reported proposal to transfer Chief Superintendent Owen Giblin who has only two years to go before reaching retiring age.  The people of Drogheda and of County Louth and County Meath know he has given good and loyal service to the State and is highly respected in the Force and by the public at large having served in Drogheda on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>A great deal of disquiet has been expressed at the very shabby way another good officer of the division, namely, Superintendent Michael Bohan, a former neighbour of mine, was treated.  People are saying these officers were set up for internal political reasons.  That is the way people are thinking.  Public confidence in the administration of the force and the morale of the force must be restored by the Minister and by Dáil Éireann.  It has been suggested to me that these two officers are being slapped for the second time, perhaps because of their close association with the former Commissioner. I do not know whether this is true, but this type of talk is going around and this is the place for these matters to be raised so that the air can be cleared and the Minister can make a clear cut statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I must now ask if it is not long-standing policy in the Garda Síochána over many years not to appoint a senior officer in his home area.  Is the office of chief superintendent to be retained in Drogheda? It is felt that the appointment of Chief Superintendent Nolan on the Border area is for a specific reason.  As I said in my opening remarks, I welcome that.  Will a long-standing promise to replace the old divisional headquarters building in Drogheda with a new divisional headquarters be honoured?  I wish to remind the Minister that at least three of the more recent Governments publicity promised the force and the people of Drogheda, Louth and Meath that this replacement building would be provided <Col N="954" /> and that funds had on at least one occasion been provided for the site.</P>
    <P>As Mayor of Drogheda, together with the town clerk, I worked very actively to secure the Murdoch site for the express purpose of giving part of the site to the Garda for the provision of a new divisional headquarters and to provide much needed car parking.  The moneys were provided in the Estimates in 1985 and 1986 but were never used for the building, I understand, because, of delays in having the site transferred and other matters of delay that were unexpected at the time. I must now ask the Minister if this proposed transfer and the continuing delay in giving sanction to the building of the new divisional headquarters are part of an overall plan to down grade Drogheda once again.  If this is the policy, what will happen to the services that go with the divisional headquarters?  Where will they be transferred to?  I understand all other stations in the Louth-Meath divisional area, Dundalk included, are, to say the least, antiquated and over-crowded.</P>
    <P>The talk around Drogheda is that if these things can happen to senior officers, what chance have other ranks?  The Garda do a very good job, with ever-reducing and limited resources, in protecting the public and giving loyal service to the State.  Collectively we must protect their interests also and ensure that they get fair play.  I am raising this matter to express the disquiet and feelings of the people in the County Louth and County Meath area.  Drogheda has been the pivotal position of the divisional headquarters of Louth and Meath since the foundation of the force.  It is centrally located in the division.  It is easily accessible from each area and the proposed new building would be located on the main road from Drogheda to Dundalk, Drogheda to Navan and Drogheda to Balbriggan and on the most suitable site for the new divisional headquarters.</P>
    <P>Drogheda has lost a number of things over the years.  This was one we were sure we would not lose because of the many promises made by successive Ministers and Governments.  I will be horrified <Col N="955" /> if once again a very important development for the town of Drogheda is whisked away to whatever other area might be designated to take this new divisional headquarters.  We are also very concerned about disquiet within the force which has been expressed to me on many occasions.  If what I fear were to happen, that would only add to that disquiet.</P>
    <P>I understand that a colleague of mine wishes to say a few words on this subject and, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will be happy to give him whatever is left of my time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague Deputy Bell for allowing me the opportunity to come in on this Adjournment debate on this topic.  I am also glad he has raised this issue so that at least some matters may be clarified.  I would like to echo his sentiments.  There is some disquiet in my constituency about a number of newspaper reports in particular on what is happening in the area.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Garda authorities on the good job that has been done in recent times.  I understand the Garda authorities are coming forward with various proposals in the light of recent events to try to pool the resources of the Garda Síochána in a better fashion to ensure that crime will not pay for criminals running around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard one thing from Deputy Bell with which I would not agree.  He seemed to be inferring that there is some political interference in the appointment of superintendents and chief superintendents.  I refute that.  I understand what has been done has been done by the Garda authorities in order to distribute their resources property.  I welcome the appointment of Chief Superintendent John Nolan to the Dundalk area.  He will have special responsibility for security <Col N="956" /> right along the Border, and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the aspect that is causing some disquiet particularly in the town of Drogheda, the possible transfer or taking away from Drogheda of the divisional headquarters, I have made inquiries as a result of many representations I have had on this and I understand that no decision was made as yet on it.  However, I have complete confidence that the Garda authorities will decide on all these issues and I will go along generally with what they say in relation to it.  The Minister has to answer a number of questions here. Maybe he is not in a position to do so as the Garda authorities may not yet have made a final decision in relation to it.  I will be very interested to hear what he has to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Bell and Deputy Ahern for their very generous and well-deserved welcome for the appointment of Chief Superintendent Nolan to the division of Louth-Meath.  I appreciate Deputy Bell's comments in relation to the need for this appointment.  However, he appears to be somewhat confused because, while welcoming the appointment of Chief Superintendent Nolan to the division, he regrets the fact that, in order to facilitate this appointment, Chief Superintendent Giblin has had to be transferred to another place.  Each division has only one chief superintendent and Louth-Meath is no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me assure the Deputy that, irrespective of whatever disquiet he feels as a result of newspaper reports, there is no basis whatsoever for any belief that this appointment has been made because of Garda politicking.  That suggestion is totally untrue and, on reflection, the Deputy will probably withdraw it.  There is no truth either in his allegation that this is interpreted as a slap in the face &mdash; to borrow his phrase &mdash; for any chief superintendent or, indeed, anyone else who is transferred because of a friendship with a former Garda Commissioner.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as Chief <Col N="957" /> Superintendent Nolan would be regarded as one of the closest friends of the former commissioner.  Chief Superintendent Nolan is probably considered to be one of the brightest, most intelligent and efficient of all our chief superintendents.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that a decision in principle has been taken to transfer the divisional headquarters for the Louth-Meath division from Drogheda to Dundalk. While the newly-appointed chief superintendent will be stationed at Dundalk from the outset, the transfer of some of the divisional headquarters services from Drogheda will not be effected until suitable arrangements as regards accommodation etc. have been made at the new headquarters.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the overall policing needs of the Louth-Meath division, the Commissioner came to the conclusion that the divisional headquarters should be relocated at Dundalk.  The reasons for the change are very valid ones and I accept the Commissioner's professional judgment in the matter.  The decision to transfer the divisional headquarters has to be looked at in the light of the overall policing needs of the division and the requirement that resources be deployed to best advantage in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>
    <P>Louth-Meath is a Border division and since the troubles erupted in the North in the late sixties, the focus of Garda activity in that division has increasingly centered on the Border and its environs. Dundalk, is, of course, very close to the Border whereas Drogheda is quite some distance from it.  Additionally, Dundalk has a larger population than Drogheda, even though the difference between the two is not great.</P>
    <P>All of this points in one direction.  Naturally you deploy your forces to take account of the area of greatest need.  The Garda Commissioner, quite rightly in my view, decided in principle that overall control of the Louth-Meath division should be switched from Drogheda to Dundalk to take account of the changing circumstances.  That, for the reasons I have outlined earlier, is a logical decision and I would ask Deputies to look <Col N="958" /> at the move in the wider interest of the population of the two counties of Louth and Meath rather than in the narrow perspective of the local people in any particular town.  Deputy Bell should take this into account instead of alleging that Drogheda has lost many things over the years.</P>
    <P>However, I must emphasise that the decision will not affect the normal policing arrangements for Drogheda.  The divisional officer is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that his resources are utilised to best advantage in meeting the policing needs of all the areas in his division and the location of the divisional headquarters does not determine the level of policing for individual areas.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that the residents of any area will feel some concern and a certain sense of unease when any change in policing arrangements is mooted.  I would like to assure the people of Drogheda, however, that there is no need for any alarm on their part.  The decision to transfer the Garda divisional headquarters to Dundalk will not adversely affect the policing arrangements for their town.  While no details have been settled, it can be taken that the services which will be transferring from Drogheda to Dundalk are administrative services which cover the whole division.  The operational Garda strength at Drogheda will not be affected by the proposed changes.</P>
    <P>What I want to get across is that the people of Drogheda can be assured that the level of Garda service to the area will not be reduced in any way.  Drogheda will continue as a district headquarters in charge of a superintendent and the resources at the new divisional headquarters at Dundalk will be available as a support service to the Garda at Drogheda.  The transfer of a divisional headquarters is something that is only done in the best interests of policing arrangements as a whole and I am satisfied that the transfer we are discussing here tonight is the best thing to do having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to cover a point made by Deputy <Col N="959" /> Bell in relation to the provision of buildings. I recognise and accept that a case has been made in recent times for new Garda buildings in Drogheda.  That is accepted and agreed and new Garda buildings will be provided in Drogheda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>They most certainly will be provided in Drogheda as there is a genuine need for them.  This need has been recognised and a commitment was given that we would go ahead as quickly as possible to provide new buildings in Drogheda.  I have not read the newspaper from which Deputy Bell has quoted but I may get an opportunity to do so before the week is out.</P>

I can assure the Deputy that I will read the newspaper concerned because, as was mentioned by Deputy Ahern, if there is some element of disquiet portrayed in the newspaper article I would like to see the grounds on which it is based.</P>
      <P>I think I have more than fairly and adequately dealt with the comments made tonight.  I should like to make it clear that this is a professional police decision made by the Garda Commissioner, with which I concur, purely on the position that exists.  I have no doubt the decision will lead to a marked improvement in the policing in the Louth-Meath division.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies Ahern and Bell will in a short period see a marked improvement in the policing in that division.  I should like to assure those Members that I am more than satisfied that the level of policing the people of Drogheda have become accustomed to will not be interfered with in any way.</P>

      <P>A wide-ranging series of measures have <Col N="725" /> been taken by the Department of Health to combat AIDS since it was identified. Measures have been taken to monitor the number of AIDS cases and the level of infection in the community.  The blood supply is screened for the virus and blood products for haemophiliacs are heat treated.  Seminars have been held around the country for health care staff and literature on AIDS disseminated to them.  The public have been educated about AIDS through a national campaign which also provided those particularly at risk with more detailed information through a booklet and telephone service. A voluntary and confidential HIV testing service is available throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I recognise that special measures are required in relation to IV drug abusers and towards this end I have allocated £450,000 as a special measure from the national lottery sources to fund an AIDS prevention and intervention programme aimed primarily at this group.  The major project to be funded is an Eastern Health Board pilot outreach programme which involves statutory and non-statutory agencies working with drug abusers and is aiming to educate and inform IV drug abusers and their families about AIDS and to encourage them to present for treatment.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, Minister for Education, and I have agreed that we should concentrate upon the educational system this year.</P>
      <P>A group of officials from both our Departments is currently preparing a long term AIDS programme for secondary schools.  While that programme is being prepared and to ensure that children leaving school this year have the facts about AIDS I asked the Directors of Community and Care-Medical Officers of Health to co-operate with local school managements in providing AIDS education to ensure that no child should leave school without being aware of the facts of AIDS and I am happy to report developments in this area.</P>

The ethical problems which arise from this type of treatment are the subject of debate in many countries at this time.  I will obviously study developments elsewhere as it has not even been proven that the technique has beneficial effects for the recipient.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the ethical committees which exist in all major general hospitals would ensure that no such treatment would be carried out in this country if it was felt to be unethical.  In addition I should point out that under the terms of section 69 subsection (2) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, it is a function of the Medical Council to give guidance to the medical profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>

      <P>There are no rules or regulations laid down by my Department in respect of running and staffing of labour wards in public hospitals or private labour wards in public hospitals.  It is accepted practice, however, that delivery rooms should be staffed by qualified midwives and in teaching hospitals by midwifery students under the supervision of qualified midwives. Patients in labour are usually attended by a midwife if the delivery is expected to be normal.  Should an emergency arise the midwife would call the doctor on duty.  The question of attendance on private patients in labour by a consultant is a matter for the consultant and the patient.</P>
      <P>Private hospitals and nursing homes must be registered as maternity homes under the Maternity Homes Act of 1934 and the Maternity Homes Regulations, 1934.  My Department have, under these regulations, laid down standards in relation to premises, sanitary services, fire protection, furnishing, accommodation and medical and nursing staff.</P>
      <P>In relation to medical and nursing staff it is a statutory requirement that the superintendent nurse of a registered maternity home must be a registered general nurse or a registered midwife.  Apart from this statutory requirement it is desirable that the staffing arrangements in every home should be such that a registered medical practitioner or registered midwife is available for attendance on every woman in childbirth in the home.</P>

      <P>There is at present a delay in the examination and reporting of cervical smears at the cytology laboratory at Cork Regional Hospital.

The analysis of smears for diagnostic purposes is not affected by this curtailment.</P>

      <P>&mdash; to examine the current arrangements for the taking and analysis of cervical smears;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to recommend how current arrangements can be improved to deal satisfactorily with the present workload;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan):</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been in contact with the US authorities on the matter since the enactment of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, 1986.  Section 313 of this Act provides for the establishment of a visa waiver pilot programme for visitors to the US from <Col N="744" /> certain countries.  The purpose of the programme is to lighten the work-load of certain US diplomatic missions abroad by waiving the requirement that holiday and business visitors obtain a US visa.</P>
      <P>Under the Act the scheme can be introduced on a pilot basis only in respect of countries which have a low rate of holiday and business visa refusals.  Continuing qualification depends on a low rate of exclusions from admission to the US and on a low overstay rate in the United States on the part of those who benefit from the scheme.</P>
      <P>In implementing the scheme, the US authorities are giving priority to countries where the volume of holiday and business visitors is large (over 1 million) and where there would be a significant saving in embassy resources.  It has not, so far, been implemented in relation to Ireland. We understand that, in comparative terms, the volume of visa business handled by the US Embassy at Dublin is seen as relatively low and the US authorities consider that the savings resulting from a visa-waiver arrangement would be small. We are, however, continuing our discussions with the US authorities in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the special tax concessions available to the bloodstock industry may be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>Income Tax and Corporation Tax</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 18(2) of the Finance Act, 1969, (as amended by section 14 of the Finance Act, 1985) exempts from income tax the profits or gains arising to the owner or part-owner of a stallion from the sale of <Col N="746" /> services of mares by the stallion or to the owner or part-owner of a stallion from the sale of rights to such services, provided that the stallion is ordinarily kept on land in the State and that the servicing of mares takes place in the State.  Likewise, a company may, in the same circumstances, be exempt from corporation tax by virtue of section 11(6) of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.</P>
    <P>The exemption is also applied to the part-owner of a foreign-based stallion where the part-ownership is acquired and held primarily for the purposes of the service by the stallion of mares owned or part-owned by that person in the course of a trade of bloodstock breeding carried on in the State.</P>
    <P>Capital Gains Tax</P>
    <P>Bloodstock are regarded as both tangible moveable property and wasting assets and, consequently, are excluded from capital gains tax under the provisions of section 18 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.</P>
    <P>Value-Added Tax</P>
    <P>Exemption from VAT applies to the supply and importation of horses and also to stud fees.  Racehorse trainers are taxable only in relation to the training element in their fees which is taken to be 10 per cent of total fees.  Jockey's fees are treated as not being taxable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry):</NameTxt>
      <P>The total interest paid on the national debt from Central Fund Services in 1987 was £1,935 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> The bulk of the foreign currency denominated loans are issued in bearer form and a breakdown of the investors currently holding them, as between banks and lending institutions and other investors, is not available.  However the total interest paid from Central Fund Services on Irish pound denominated debt in 1987 was £1,213 million and the total interest payments on foreign currency denominated debt in the same period was £722 million.  These interest payment figures represent an average rate of interest on Irish pound denominated debt of 8¾ per cent and on the foreign currency denominated debt of 7½ per cent.</P>

While in custody he was a patient of the medical officer at Portlaoise prison and he was also seen, occasionally, by the consultant psychiatrist who attends the prison.  Following a review of his case in 1986, involving staff of the Central Mental Hospital, he was sent to that hospital on 15 October 1986, for treatment.  He remained in that hospital until 18 November 1986, when he was returned to Portlaoise prison.</P>
      <P>On 19 September 1987, he was sent to the Central Mental Hospital for treatment. He remained there until 28 September 1987, when he was returned to the prison.  He was again sent to the Central Mental Hospital on 7 October 1987 where he was found dead on 10 October 1987.</P>
      <P>A request for a report was received after the transfer on 7 October and was in course of preparation on 10 October.</P>

      <P>I assume that the question is intended to <Col N="754" /> refer to &ldquo;fine-on-the spot&rdquo; notices issued in respect of parking offences and not to fines imposed by the court for such offences.</P>
      <P>The total amount received by way of payment on foot of parking notices issued in 1987 by members of the Garda Síochána and Garda traffic wardens was approximately £2.33 million.  The face value of notices issued in 1987 which are still outstanding is estimated at about £3.423 million.  Summonses have been issued in connection with all outstanding notices in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the great majority of them in the rest of the country.  While it is a matter for the courts whether a fine will be imposed in these cases, it is to be expected that a considerable amount of further revenue will be collected in due course as court fines.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit to 4 June 1987 after which date payment was disallowed following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance of benefit and was examined by a different medical referee on 27 August 1987 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>The case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that he was not incapable of work in respect of the period from 6 June 1987 to 7 December 1987 and was not entitled to be paid disability benefit in respect of this period.</P>
      <P>The person concerned continued to submit medical evidence and benefit was again disallowed.  He appealed against this decision and was again examined by a medical referee on 11 April 1988 who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  The case was referred to an appeals officer on 26 April 1988.  No date has been set for an oral hearing.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 March 1988.</P>
      <P>There was a delay in issuing payment as medical certificates were received at irregular intervals from the claimant. Details of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to her by the North Eastern Health Board had to be confirmed and this caused further delay.  The position has now been clarified and all benefit payable to 28 April 1988, the date of the latest medical certificate received, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the health board, has issued.</P>

      <P>The legislative basis for the assessment of means is set out in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended where appropriate by subsequent social welfare enactments.  It was confirmed to the deputation that there is no new policy as regards the assessment of income for social welfare purposes from households in the Gaeltacht who keep students.  In the normal way the profit from such undertakings would be very small and any means assessed would be negligible. Very few cases arise where means are assessed under this heading.</P>

It is a matter for the council to determine the order of priority for such new house starts within the provision made for this purpose in 1988.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will clarify whether those people on training courses under the <Col N="781" /> Jobsearch scheme were paid a Christmas bonus; if they would qualify had they remained unemployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the link between unemployment assistance and the standard AnCO-FÁS training allowance, I decided that eligible persons (viz. those who had been long-term unemployed immediately prior to participation on an AnCO-FÁS training course, who applied for the bonus and who were certified accordingly by the Department of Social Welfare) would receive a training bonus equivalent to the foregone Christmas bonus under unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>There may be a small number of trainees who had not become classified as long-term unemployed before starting training but who would have been so classified had they remained on the Live Register until the qualifying date.  These trainees did not receive the Christmas bonus.  The major reason for not giving the bonus in such cases is that the social welfare status of FÁS trainees, including Jobsearch referrals, is suspended for the duration of their training.  While they are on a mainline training course they are treated as Class J social welfare contributors, not as unemployed persons. Periods spent on FÁS training courses are therefore not reckonable for the purpose of calculating total duration of unemployment.  I have no proposal to change the present position in view of the very considerable implications for the Exchequer and the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>I should add that the standard training allowance in FÁS is equivalent to the maximum urban long-term rate of unemployment assistance.  Persons previously on short-term unemployment assistance will, therefore, receive an increased weekly allowance after commencing training.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme and Teamwork are manpower programmes which form part of the Government's drive to help the unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed and young people leaving the educational system.  They are also of considerable benefit to local communities through the provision of services and facilities which could not otherwise be made available.</P>
      <P>Payments for participants in the two programmes are decided by me in the light of a number of considerations including rates of unemployment benefit and assistance, the expenditure constraints facing the Government and the need to ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from the programmes. In these circumstances, I do not consider that establishing such a committee for participants in manpower programmes is appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon):</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal recommendation of the <Col N="788" /> Task Force on Child Care Services was that new legislation should be introduced to update and extend the law in relation to children.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, which was one of a number of measures intended to give effect to that recommendation, was being examined by a special committee of this House when the general election intervened.  While the committee had met on only two occasions, it had become clear that the Bill required substantial changes, involving as many as 150 amendments.  These were necessary in order to meet points raised by various groups and individuals involved in child care and, more particularly, to take account of a Supreme Court judgment in 1985 which cast doubt over the constitutionality of some of the proposals contained in the Bill.  Rather than re-introducing the Bill as it stands I have decided to introduce a new child care Bill and I expect to be in a position to publish it in the near future.</P>
      <P>The supplementary report of the task force recommended that the law should be changed to permit the adoption of children whose parents are married to each other.  The Deputy will be aware that the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which I introduced since taking office, is at present before the Seanad and I expect that Report Stage will be taken shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention that there have been significant developments in child care services, including a major expansion in foster care services and improved day care services, since the report of the task force in 1980.  I am committed to maintaining and, where possible, building on the advances which have been made in this area.  Last year, for example, I allocated special funds for the establishment of two units in Dublin for the investigation and assessment of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.  I will be making an announcement in the near future about the allocation of special additional funds to enable similar services to be expanded outside Dublin.  In regard to services generally for disadvantaged <Col N="789" /> young people the Government last week announced an allocation of approximately £4 million out of national lottery funds in respect of a wide range of improved specialised services.  This allocation includes, <i>inter alia,</i> a sum in excess of £1 million in respect of improved services for the young homeless as well as special allocations for services for young substance abusers and young travellers.</P>

In Circular Letter M57/87 which issued in August 1987, the authorities of post-primary schools were advised that pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1987-88 subject to the payment of a repeat course fee of £100 per pupil and a repeat examination fee of £100. Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card will be exempted from the payment of the course fee and will only be required to pay the standard examination entry fee of £33 on production of the medical card for noting by the school authorities.</P>

      <P>A special higher education grant scheme for mature women students operated on a &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; basis under the aegis of my Department for the academic year 1987-88.  There is no provision in the Estimates for such a scheme in 1988-89. However, I have initiated inquiries to determine whether private sponsorship might be available to cover the costs of operating such a scheme.  Details of such a scheme, should it take place, will be sent to the person mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
