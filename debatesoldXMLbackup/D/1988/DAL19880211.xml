      <P>It is a matter of some urgency because, as you know, local authorities in some parts of the country will have to rebuild sections of roads and piers and to deal with a lot of other damage.

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister for Finance, in his capacity as acting head of Government, if the Government will consider giving time next week to discuss the activities of orgainsed criminals in Dublin.  That matter was shown last night on a television programme and it was quite alarming.  The programme showed there is massive surveillance on certain alleged criminals without any results. Will the Minister for Finance seek to make time available in this House next week so that the House will be fully informed of what is happening in the city in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The week before last the budget, in the main, delivered a caution on acute political balance when in fact what was needed was dramatic departures on some of the most burning social and economic problems facing Irish society today.  They are, as I pointed out last night, mass unemployment leading to widescale poverty for many of the 250,000 unemployed; more than 30,000 people opting to deploy their skills and energy in some country outside of Ireland each year and an imbalanced tax system which over penalises work and initiative and which should have been radically tackled by widening the tax base which in turn could have begun a dramatic cut in the standard income tax rate of 35 per cent.  It is interesting, when we are told by the Government, and also by the previous Government, that it was quite impossible to contemplate anything of the nature put forward by the Progressive Democrats the last two years in relation to taxation to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of this morning the decision and proposals of the New Zealand Government in regard to income taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Zealand is a particularly good example for us to take because it is similar to us in so many ways.  Its population is similar, it is heavily dependent on agriculture, its climate is similar and many of its physical aspects as a country are similar.  Of course it is at a major disadvantage compared with us in that geographically it is extremely isolated. Notwithstanding that, the New Zealand Government have now decided on the introduction, from 1 October next, on a two tier income tax system in which the two levels of tax will be 24 per cent and 33 per cent with rebates for the lower paid.  That system is being proposed in substitution for their existing three-tier system of 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 48 per cent.  At the same time they are proposing the reduction of company taxation from 48 per cent to 28 per cent for <Col N="1912" /> resident companies after 1 April and a reduction for non-resident companies from 48 per cent to 33 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance of the New Zealand Government, Mr. Douglas &mdash; I might remind the House that it is a Labour Government and, even by Irish standards, one might almost begin to say a Socialist Government, because it would be a great deal farther to the left than are my absent friends to my right, or most of them &mdash; when he introduced the original plan two months ago and which his Government toned down somewhat, described it as innovative, bold and imaginative.  He boasted that no other country has yet had the drive, vision or courage to give its citizens the advantage of such a tax system.  He is right.  They have taken great risks.  This is not some country that is not comparable to ours. Of all the countries in the world it is perhaps the one most comparable to ours.  That is what they have done.  It is a country that has many disadvantages we do not have.  For example, they have not got our industrial infrastructure, they have not got the advantage of membership of the EC and have not got guaranteed markets for their very substantial agricultural output.  Also, the country is located many thousands of miles away from the main markets of the world in whichever direction one moves. Still they have been able to do that &mdash; and a Labour Government have been able to do it &mdash; because it makes commonsense. Equally, it would make commonsense here.</P>
    <P>I suggest this move away from a standard income tax rate &mdash; at the highest level in Europe of 35 per cent &mdash; would simultaneously boost the prospects for the long-term unemployed.  I suppose improved assistance payments to this sector have to be welcomed.  But we must also beware of the fact that they simply deepen the poverty trap engulfing the unemployed, rendering lower paid work &mdash; where inevitably they must enter the workforce &mdash; totally unattractive compared with remaining on the dole.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have a well <Col N="1913" /> defined agenda for tackling these fundamental problems.  Everyone talks about the necessity for reducing the tax burden represented by income tax and indirect taxes.  However, that is really only feasible in the context of widening the tax base.  That is why our party are committed to a comprehensive property tax on buildings and land to begin to get this equation more into balance.  Even in the United States property taxes raise 10 per cent of annual revenue.  Here the comparable figure is 3 per cent.  We must redress the virtual trebling of the burden of income tax in this country over the past eight years.  In 1980 that burden amounted to £1,200 million.  Last year that figure had risen to £3,200 million.</P>
    <P>Our detailed property tax proposals would enable a dramatic cut in the standard income tax rate, would move us significantly along the fundamental tax route of the Progressive Democrats to a standard tax rate of 25 per cent.  I want to reiterate also that our commitment to this measure, which incidently would enable some real local government to reemerge for the first time in a long time, is solely on condition that the receipts from a property tax are to facilitate a cut in income tax.  In no sense should the present level of income tax be retained if such a property tax were introduced.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute crippling of work and initiative to have an initial tax rate of 35 per cent which, when PRSI and other levies are added, constitutes an initial effective tax rate of 42.75 per cent.  This explains also why our party believe that PRSI reform is as pressing as tax reform and should be seen for what it is, not a self-financing social insurance fund &mdash; as the Government and others allege &mdash; but really another dimension of the tax system which should be described as such.</P>
    <P>We should reflect, as a recent series of articles in the <i>Economist</i> pointed out, that we have here an initial effective tax rate, after allowances for a single person of £2,000 only, of 42.75 per cent.  The <i>Economist</i>, or the authors of those articles, are unable to find any other country in the world that has such an incredible <Col N="1914" /> tax burden on people who are so lowly paid.  I cannot think of any such country either.  It is inevitably enormously damaging to economic progress here to have such a system.</P>
    <P>Again I might revert to the decision of the New Zealand Government yesterday and ask this House, and this Government in particular, if a country with all the disadvantages that New Zealand has can do what they have now done, why cannot we do it?  Is our need to do this not at least as great as that of New Zealand's?  Is our ability to do so, due to our fortunate location and membership of the EC, not much easier if only we had the guts to try it than it has been for the Labour Government in New Zealand?  It is interesting that New Zealand, so similar to us and which has so many problems similar to ours, has taken steps to solve and overcome them much more rapidly than we did.  For example, it is interesting that, when they found themselves with a two-Chamber Legislature, they looked at it for a couple of years, decided they did not need it and abolished their Senate. Exactly the same factors apply here because of the considerable similarity between the two countries.</P>
    <P>We have criticised the manner of the allocation of the £92 million income tax relief announced by the Minister for Finance. In our view, this money would represent much greater benefit if it were differently deployed, by removing PRSI &mdash; which is in fact simply taxation under another name &mdash; from the first £2,000 of income for everybody.  That would benefit everybody but would be of particular benefit to the lower paid.  Moreover, it would begin to dismantle the huge tax/PRSI disincentive facing unemployed people who might be lucky enough to be given an opportunity to enter the work-force. How often are these people faced with the very real dilemma that if they take on an available job their position is that they will be no better off, and often are worse off, in net income terms than they would be if they remained on the dole.  That is why I have reservations about the increased payments of up to 11 per cent for the long-term unemployed. <Col N="1915" /> Every Deputy and party supports improving the lot of the long-term unemployed, but is this the best way to go about it?  I do not believe so.  The emphasis of Government policy in this area must surely be characterised by the desire to offer work rather than welfare to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I pointed out last night when quoting a speech made by Deputy Colley last October at the Progressive Democrats' annual conference that the number of long-term unemployed has risen by a factor of 40 in the past 20 years and that virtually nothing has been done to take account of that fact.  All that is done in this budget is to throw a larger sum of money than hitherto was the case at those unfortunate people to encourage them to keep quiet and not to do anything.</P>
    <P>I suppose this morning we should rejoice that among the well known long-term unemployed who will get 11 per cent more, we have Mr. Martin Cahill.  I am sure we are all happy for him today that instead of getting £92.50 and a fuel voucher to keep his feet warm he will now get significantly more.  We are happy I am sure that as well as the £80,000 house in Rathmines which he was able to buy for cash, Dublin Corporation provided him with another house at a cost in excess of £50,000 to the taxpayer.  I am not entirely clear why Dublin Corporation feel Mr. Cahill needs two such residences. Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that neither would be big enough to hang his collection of paintings and that he needs two houses in order that he might gaze by day and by night at his collection of 17th century Dutch Masters.</P>
    <P>RTE provided a very genuine public service by what they did last night in highlighting some of what is going on. The absence of prosecutions up to now is a matter which needs to be highlighted and in my view, RTE were perfectly right to take that step.  It is disturbing to find that among those of lesser rank than general, there are so many others who are classified as part of the long-term unemployed who have the support of this State. <Col N="1916" /> It seems extraordinary that the investigative powers and activities of the Department of Social Welfare seem in practice to be confined to elderly widows or people of that kind who are hounded because they are alleged to have received £2, £3 or £4 a week more than they should.  It is distressing to find elderly people who are hungry and cold deprived of things like fuel vouchers because of a bureaucratic rule which is applied to them while there are people with vast wealth &mdash; two houses, three motor cars, five motor cycles and so on &mdash; able to avail of the generosity of the State and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I hope the lowly paid people of this country who begin to pay 42.75 per cent of their income after the first £2,000 of an allowance, will get consolation from the fact that the exorbitant levels and rates of tax they are paying will go to keep Mr. Martin Cahill and his equals in the comfort which they have awarded themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly remind the Deputy that it is long-standing practice of the House that persons outside the House should not be named and identified.  This is a privileged assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not mention the name again in deference to your ruling.  There are 44 people in the Department of Social Welfare to investigate these matters and the number of social welfare recipients is vast.  The result is that each of those 44 people on investigative work have to deal with an average of 18,000 recipients each.  It is not surprising in these circumstances that the kind of people we saw last night are able to get away with what we have seen happen.  I would have thought, for example, that the 300 people who are not employed but are paid by the Land Commission, and who have no work today, might be better employed investigating some of these abuses and appalling anomalies in the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building an ever higher welfare wall around the long-term unemployed and <Col N="1917" /> then clobbering them with a tax mallet when they manage to climb over it is precisely the wrong strategy, but that unfortunately is what has been done in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats would like to see scarce Government resources utilised in community work schemes, even ones offering part-time work, that would afford the long-term unemployed the opportunity to enjoy the dignity of work, to feel wanted and to become valued members of a work force contributing to the community positively in various community and environmental projects which are crying out to be done in every corner of the land.  Our party's Labour spokesman, Deputy Colley, has carefully developed this party's policy in this area in her draft policy paper, which she read at our annual conference last October and to which I referred earlier.  We would like to give dignity, and not merely the dole, to the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>On the question of fuel vouchers, in the last few days I got a letter from an elderly couple, old age pensioners, who have a son in his twenties living with them.  The son has been unemployed for some years but he got a part-time job recently earning £20 a week.  The fuel voucher was taken from that couple.  That is precisely what I am talking about.  A welfare wall is built and if you try to climb over it you get clobbered not just with a tax mallet but also the withdrawal of other benefits.  Is it not interesting that that elderly couple, honest people who worked hard all their lives, should have this fuel voucher which was probably essential to them withdrawn, yet a man with three motor cars and two expensive residences, is entitled to retain his fuel voucher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners who follow with such vigour and vehemence somebody who is earning £20 or £30 per week in order to take tax from them, and who follow firms who are trading in <Col N="1918" /> extreme difficulty and at great disadvantage, in order to get VAT, PRSI, etc., from them every month, might perhaps devote some of their energies to asking those who draw £92.50 per week unemployment assistance, plus a fuel voucher, how they are able to have two homes, three cars and five motor bikes and how they are able to work as a private detective and, at the same time, draw this money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney, on behalf of this party, has consistently over the last year or two put forward suggestions that the Revenue Commissioners should have power to seize assets which have been acquired by means which have not been disclosed to the Revenue.  That is the situation in the United States and other countries and it is ridiculous that decent, honest and honourable people are hounded, sometimes literally even into the grave, by the Revenue authorities while the sort of people we saw portrayed last night are allowed to go free.  It is absolutely deplorable that a house costing £80,000 in a fashionable part of Rathmines should bear no taxation and at the same time some young person, even with a part time job earning a small amount of money, is asked to pay 42.75 per cent of the initial part of his earnings after whatever small allowance he is given.  Is it any wonder that there is cynicism and a perception and belief that it pays not to be honest and not to tell the truth to State authorities?</P>
    <P>The Government's introduction of self-assessment is very welcome.  This was, of course, one of our party's proposals in our October 1986 economic policy document, <i>A Nation that Works.</i> One of the lost opportunities of the budget was a failure by the Government to commence a programme of privatisation of State assets to increase competition and efficiency and to reduce the liabilities of the State and, ultimately, the general taxpayer.  I mentioned before that Irish Life is a classic case of a State company which is ripe for privatisation. I realise that the Fianna Fáil Party gave a categoric assurance before the last election <Col N="1919" /> that they would not adopt a policy of privatisation but that party's unfortunate election programme is now one more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  In view of their attitude in Government to things like health and education spending, which are in direct contradiction to everything they said right up to polling day in the last general election, I suggest they might usefully perform a similar U-turn on this matter.</P>
    <P>In the case of Irish Life&mdash;I refer to it because it is the easiest and most obvious case &mdash; privatisation is a policy favoured by the company's management.  The reported sale figure which it is believed could be obtained is £300 million.  That figure represents more than a one-hundred fold increase in the return given to taxpayers compared with continuing the present situation.  Last year, for instance, Irish Life paid a dividend to the State of about £400,000.  If it was sold, as I pointed out last night, and the national debt reduced by £300 million, there would be an immediate saving to the Exchequer of £30 million per year forever.  The profit, therefore, expressed purely in financial terms in doing what I suggest would be £29.6 million per year, every year, forever. It is absolutely crazy not to follow that practice.  We are unique in Europe in having the highest and most crippling burden of taxation.  Equally, we are unique in being the only European country that does not endeavour to dispose of State assets which it is not necessary for the State to own.  We would insist, as a party, that the entire proceeds of privatisation must be devoted to eliminating our overhanging and crippling national debt and must not be squandered to avoid the tough political necessity of getting the current budget into balance eventually.</P>
    <P>This policy has practical current budget advantages too, as I have already demonstrated. All in all, we advocate privatisation generally because the State and the taxpayer gain and the particular companies are given an opportunity to compete openly and aggressively in the competitive market-place.  This year's capital expenditure programme has been <Col N="1920" /> pared back to £332 million, or just 1.9 per cent of GNP.  Slashing the capital programme as part of the overall policy of fiscal retrenchment is undoubtedly necessary but the emphasis on the capital cutback side means that the continuation of the battle against Government overspending next year must be inevitably concentrated on current day to day spending.  That is no easy task and again it casts in solid relief the criticism of the Progressive Democrats against the national wage deal incorporated in the so called national plan of last October.</P>
    <P>In blunt terms, we are increasing the public sector wage bill by approximately £100 million this year with money which the State does not have.  Not only that, we are expending a further £80 million at least on the redundancy programme in the public service again with money which the State does not have and is borrowing from the Central Bank on the basis that the bank will have profits in four, five or six years' time and that this money should be spent now.  It has the additional, unfortunate aspect, as well as being extraordinarily expensive and inappropriate, of encouraging the best public servants to leave.</P>
    <P>That has already happened in relation to at least three of the most prominent semi-State bodies, the IDA, CTT and Bord Fáilte.  That is regrettable because it is the best who feel that they can survive and prosper in open market conditions. Those who are more cautious like the security of permanent and pensionable employment where initiative plays a less important part than rule giving.  I am not suggesting for one moment that public servants are not, in appropriate circumstances, deserving of a pay rise, but the warning that I sounded last October on the publication of the national plan that a wage increase was being bought in exchange for a total deterioration in public services and major job losses must now be clear even to the public sector trade unions.  What they did on that occasion is unique in the history of trade unionism.  For additional benefits for the many they were prepared to sacrifice the jobs of their own colleagues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> I believe that if public servants were accorded radical tax reform of the kind I have already outlined, and the resources to do the job for which they have been trained and employed, they would willingly forego £100 million in pay increases this year or, at least, a reasonable proportion of that.  For instance, it is worth noting that a recent ESRI report estimated that average public sector pay will rise by 6 per cent this year, which is almost twice the level of inflation.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious to anyone who has carefully studied the Government's proposed extension of PRSI to farmers and the self-employed that this measure is nothing less than a serious deception of the PAYE sector in its detail and its presentation.  Even assuming a 100 per cent compliance by farmers and the self-employed and assuming a contribution rate of 6.6 per cent which was recommended by the pensions board, the Exchequer &mdash; and that is the general taxpayer &mdash; will end up paying 60 per cent of the cost of the non-contributory pensions it is proposed to accord these sectors as of right in ten years' time.  It is ridiculous that people who do not want these pensions and who are prepared to provide out of their own resources for their old age should find themselves in the position that they will be enormously subsidised in the provision of a pension of this kind and that that will be done by ordinary PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>At present the State has failed to devise a satisfactory means of extracting levies totalling 2 per cent from many members of these sectors.  Does anyone seriously believe that the situation can be transformed so readily that they will pay over 8 per cent if the proposed levy is added to what it is impossible to collect at present. The Progressive Democrats agree with the broad intention of the Government in seeking a greater contribution from farmers and the self-employed towards the Exchequer funding of pension entitlements, especially the £300 million which will be spent this year in non-contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>We believe that the Government are wrong, both in the interest of the <Col N="1922" /> Exchequer and the complying tax-paying public, to confer non-means tested pensions as a right to 250,000 farmers and self-employed in return for the ostensible extension of PRSI to them.  The Progressive Democrats support the abolition of PRSI, which is merely a tax levy under another name, and we support its eventual incorporation into the income tax system as a social insurance levy as proposed by the Commission on Taxation. Pending that and given the fact that other sectors have to pay PRSI we recognise its existence as a form of taxation.  It should be looked on as that, it should be called that and it should operate in that way.  In no way should it be used at the expense of the general taxpayer to give large scale benefits to people who do not want them, deserve them or ask for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been broadly accepted by the majority of the community at large as a realistic and practical measure designed and prepared to meet the present economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Any economy if it is to develop and expand can only do so if the development and expansion is based on solid financial foundations.  Government strategies and administrative arrangements, which I believe are necessary and timely at this stage, put in place solid financial foundations on which to expand and develop the economy.  We cannot do that on shaky foundations no more than one can build a house on a shaky foundation.  Unless we can put our financial foundations on a firm footing we cannot hope to expand our economy in the future.  I believe that this budget goes a long way towards stabilising the financial foundation of the economy.  The administrative arrangements which are also being put in place are, in my view, timely and long overdue in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this purpose in mind the Government established the Department of the Marine to draw together the various strategies and administrative arrangements which had previously been scattered over eight or nine different Government <Col N="1923" /> Departments and to put in place a streamlined administrative arrangement to avoid overlapping and duplication which had taken place in the past, and to avoid waste of human and financial resources.  With a well streamlined arrangement we could avoid the waste of human resources and tackle many of the areas of development which had been neglected in the past and which have potential for development in the future.</P>
    <P>In the Department of the Marine we have concentrated for the past few months on reorganising the various areas of responsibility which were hitherto scattered over eight or nine Government Departments and agencies.  We have now put together a new administrative arrangement to deal with the different areas of responsibility.  We now have nine divisions in the new Department dealing with personnel co-ordination, organisational services, finance and planning. We all know that the absence of planning and policy in the area of our maritime economy has hampered the prospect of employment opportunities and the creation of revenue for the State.  There is a division dealing with pollution and legal affairs and another dealing with shipping policy which has potential for development. As I have already indicated we introduced shipping investment grants and other incentives last year.</P>
    <P>We have a second division dealing with maritime safety because we recognise, as most Deputies do, the importance of maritime safety and of having our legislative arrangements brought into line with international legislation and to have modern sophisticated maritime safety procedure in operation in our jurisdiction. We know that in the harbours area there is a need for co-ordination. Previously harbours were dealt with in the Department of Communications and Transport, and fisheries harbours development was dealt with by the fisheries division.  We now have a new division in the Department dealing with commercial harbours and fisheries harbours. We also have a division dealing with the prospect of opening up new <Col N="1924" /> opportunities in the maritime area and the provision of marinas and recreational amenity facilities which are equally important and must go hand in hand with the development of our commercial harbours. We have a sea fisheries division which deals mainly with EC and Community regulations and legislation.  There is a sea fisheries division which deals with licensing aquaculture.  This is a new and expanding area where job opportunities will be created in the isolated coastal communities.  The area of licensing and foreshore licensing was scattered over three different Government Departments and is now dealt with in that division.</P>
    <P>We have identified inland fisheries as an area for development which we hope will open up new opportunities in an industry which is estimated to be worth in the region of £50 million to £100 million. Because of the lack of administrative and financial arrangements in the past this area was allowed stagnate.  In the short time since the Department was established we have been concentrating on putting in place a co-ordinated system of administration avoiding the overlapping and duplication which has hampered development in the past.  Since the establishment of Roinn to Mara our strategy has been designed to reversing the systematic neglect over the years of maritime matters.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the main areas concern fishing, shipping, harbours, marine safety, conservation, recreation and amenity aspects which are now under the new Department.  As the structure is now in place we are getting on with the review of maritime and marine policies, the establishment of priorities for action and the preparation of programmes and strategies for the achievement of the Department's objectives.  These objectives must of course take account of the Government's plan to reduce the volume of public expenditure to a level which our resources can support and sustain.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with some areas which are of importance and to avail of this opportunity to put on record our priorities in some of these areas and the <Col N="1925" /> actions we are taking to put these priorities into action.  In the sea fisheries area, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> put emphasis on the potential for the development of the fishing industry to generate growth and development in the economy.  The Government's programme recognised that a properly planned approach to the exploitation of our sea fisheries was essential and offered a very significant opportunity for economic expansion and job creation.  For this reason, I requested Bord Iascaigh Mhara to prepare a development plan covering the expansion of our sea fisheries resources up to the end of 1991.  It is the Government's intention that the proposed plan will revitalise all the sectors involved in fishing and, above all, instil a new confidence and competitiveness in the industry.</P>
    <P>The plan will address specifically those issues which have inhibited expansion in the past.  It will propose strategies aimed at redressing these problems and point the way to new opportunities in the fishing area.  One of the key strategies in the plan will be a planned approach to fleet modernisation which would seem essential in order to reduce the unacceptably high age profile of our fleet.  It has been recognised that the fleet is an aging one and is in need of modernisation and new investment.  At the same time we have got to keep in mind that in modernising and expanding the fleet we are limited to a large extent by the system and regime within which we operate in the Community where, because of the exploitation of stocks strong conservation measures are needed.  It is essential that we undertake a modernising of the fleet which is an aging one.</P>
    <P>We have embarked on a scheme for the expansion of aquaculture with particular stress on added value.  I have asked Bord Iascaigh Mhara to give this sector particular attention.  I also hope to see positive indications of support for exploratory fishing aimed particularly at encouraging such activity in our more distant west coast waters with a view to rapidly developing new fisheries in these areas. <Col N="1926" /> Marketing and related product quality issues will feature prominently in the plan as it is apparent that with increased landings and expansion in fish farming it will be imperative that we adopt a much more co-ordinated and dynamic approach in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Naturally, this type of planned development will entail a very significant level of investment by the industry.  I have no doubt that the Government for their part will be prepared to examine how and to what extent they can help stimulate this investment through the provision of Exchequer assistance.  It would, in addition, be the Government's aim to ensure the maximum take-up and the effective use of all available EC structure funding.  I am pleased to say that the Bord Iascaigh Mhara plan is now at an advanced stage of preparation and is likely to be submitted to the Government for their approval before Easter.</P>
    <P>On the fish quotas issue, we continue to work within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In the case of some sensitive species, and in particular I am thinking of herring and mackerel, I am continuing to press for increases in the fish allocations and I have received an undertaking that the situation will be reviewed during the year.  We must ensure however that stocks are conserved. There will be increased emphasis on fishing management by Roinn na Mara over the coming years.  In 1987, we obtained an extra quota of 10,000 tonnes of mackerel for Irish fishermen by exchanging quantities of unused quotas for other species.  Also, in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy we will continue to press for the maximum aid for the Irish fishing industry which benefited to the tune of £3.6 million from EC funds in 1987.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, we invited the Commissioner to visit this country last year.  Following a thorough review of our situation the Commission indicated it was very impressed with the level of activity taking place to develop our industry. It has indicated that it is willing to support us in whatever way it can to ensure that we get the maximum benefit <Col N="1927" /> from any Community funding which is available.</P>
    <P>We have faced some difficulties arising from the activities of the so-called flag of convenience vessels.  The issue is being pursued through the European Courts and while not wishing to prejudice any further legal actions I feel that a recent judgement by the Court of Justice in Ireland's favour offers real hope for the future solution of the problem.  That matter was also raised by me at a Council of Fisheries Ministers meeting on 29 September 1987 and during the EC Commissioner for Fisheries' visit to Ireland. We received a positive indication from the Commission of its willingness to come to grips with this problem which has been causing some anxiety within the Community during the past couple of years.  I hope that in the very near future this problem will be resolved permanently as this would be to the benefit of our industry.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made this first year in the enforcement of existing controls on quality standards within the fishing industry.  This will be consolidated over the coming year with the planned introduction of a new fish marketing Bill.  This Bill will provide the legislative means of regulating and controlling the hygiene-quality dimension of the fishing industry in its entirety from catching to processing to distribution.  I think this Bill will be welcomed and recognised as being essential.  Recently I saw some of the quality products of other countries on display during the Green Week in Berlin and I think we can learn from the attention which other member states in the Community are now paying to this question of quality.  We need to address this question very quickly and we propose to introduce this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity as this would enable us to regulate and control the hygiene and quality dimension of our fishery products.  This is essential if we are to continue to maintain our position in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture in Ireland is a relatively <Col N="1928" /> new industry and although production is increasing by substantial annual percentages it is still a long way from reaching its full potential.  The statutory basis for the development of the industry is contained in the Fisheries Act, 1980 which gives me, as Minister for the Marine, power to designate areas within which aquaculture may take place and to licence individual operators within those areas.  The process prior to designation taking place is a thorough one and allows all views in relation to water usage to be taken into account.  To date, 14 areas have been designated and five further areas are under consideration for possible designation.  The Department will be pressing forward in 1988 with a new series of hearings which I hope will lead to further designations being made.</P>
    <P>My last remarks were by way of background information and they explain my Department's responsibility in relation to aquaculture, which is to provide a sound legal framework for the development of the industry.  There is more to it than that, of course, and that is why I am putting in place structures to facilitate the most effective co-ordination of the role of the State in the development of aquaculture so that the full potential of this dynamic sector can be reached.  I intend that Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash; the primary grant-aiding agencies for the sector &mdash; shall work in tandem under the aegis of my Department in order to maximise the returns to the economy in terms of employment, output and exports from the aquaculture sector.  Other agencies who will be working to this end in conjunction with my Department include the fisheries authorities who will monitor the environmental impact of fish farming and &mdash; when established &mdash; the Marine Institute which will be responsible for technology research, education and training.</P>
    <P>To help achieve my objectives, I have recently established, with the approval of the Government, a small group &mdash; known as the Aquaculture Management Group &mdash;comprising representatives from my own Department and the Department of the Gaeltacht, BIM and Údarás na <Col N="1929" /> Gaeltachta.  The task of this group is to review on a regular basis the status of aquaculture development in relation to the objectives of the Government, to coordinate State funding for aquaculture projects, to consider the means necessary to secure adequate EC funding for aquaculture and to review the provision of grant-aid for the aquaculture industry and on foot of that to advise me and the Minister for the Gaeltacht of any restructuring that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture is an industry to which this country is well suited by virtue of our national resources and large stretches of unpolluted coastline.  It is doubly important in that it affords valuable opportunities for development in precisely those areas which traditionally have been underdeveloped.  Our hope is that over the next few years we will take our place as one of the major producers of farmed seafood&mdash;salmon, trout and mussels.  To achieve this we will be counting on, in the first instance, the enterprise and initiative of the persons involved in the industry and then, as I have indicated, on a concerted approach from State services to encourage and support the efforts of the industry.  The returns will be worthwhile. In addition to new jobs and output, 1988 will see the establishment of a sound licensing system for projects in the industry and there will be a direct return to the Exchequer from this in terms of fee income.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the importance of aquaculture for the economic development of coastal communities.  All members appreciate how difficult it is to attract sound economic industries to isolated coastal areas, to western areas in particular.  Aquaculture is a new and exciting industry which offers the possibility of creating jobs and revenue for local areas.  We have moved very slowly up to now on aquaculture but our dynamic approach will result in meaningful jobs being created in isolated coastal communities.  There will be a greater prospect of creating sustainable jobs at very little cost to the State.  Those jobs will be based on the natural resource that exists in those areas.  I am not saying that <Col N="1930" /> there are not problems associated with aquaculture and that is why we have established a policy and planning committee. We want to ensure that we take into account the views of the various interests in isolated areas.  Above all, we want to ensure that damage is not done to the environment and that there will not be any prospect of pollution.  We do not want environmental hazards to arise out of the development of that industry. The industry will be based in areas of great scenic beauty and we must ensure that there is a balance between the protection of the environment and scenic spots and the provision of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The development of our inland fisheries was identified in the Government's economic programme as a significant source of additional potential employment and as a major tourist asset.  My view is that the administrative structures in inland fishing are in need of reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The policy objectives which I consider should underpin the new management strategy are as follows: employment and income generation; optimisation of income distribution; optimisation of the amenity and recreational value; conservation and development of stocks; rationalisation of management; access and ownership of individual fisheries; development of community involvement in management protection and marketing of the local fishery resource.</P>
    <P>The absence of clear, coherent and formally adopted Government policy has inhibited the development of inland fisheries and has been for many years the subject of adverse criticism of successive administrations.  In their election programme for fisheries the Government recognised that inland fisheries was a significant growth area which has been neglected in the past.</P>
    <P>Over the years, the State has made significant financial contributions to inland fisheries.  Over £30 million has been allocated since 1980.  Fees from own resources over the period were about £6 million or 17 per cent of the total resources.  Having regard to the fact that <Col N="1931" /> the level of these contributions could not be maintained in the present difficult financial situation, it is imperative that the administration and management of inland fisheries should be organised in such a way as to ensure the best use of the limited resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>However, if the full potential of our inland fisheries is to be realised, it is clear to me that a new framework for their cost effective development and management is required.  I am currently finalising proposals on the whole question of inland fisheries development in consultation with interests involved.  The recently published report of the Salmon Review Group has been published as a framework for discussion.  The keystone of these proposals will be the rationalisation of the management structure of the existing fisheries boards to ensure that development possibilities are addressed in a more cohesive and concrete way.  I will be putting these proposals to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, I identified the urgent need to broaden the financial base of the central and regional fisheries boards.  Accordingly, and in addition to rationalising the categories of salmon angling licences, I introduced trout and coarse fishing licences with effect from 1 January 1988.  The revenue from these licences is collected and retained by the fisheries boards for their own use in the protection, development and conservation of the fisheries under their control. I have referred earlier to the State allocation to inland fisheries over the years.  I think it is only fair that those who have benefited from these subventions should be required to contribute to further development of the resource.  The revenue from the licences will help to make the boards more self-sufficient and independent in the carrying out of their functions.  I would like to emphasise again that licence revenue will accrue directly to the boards and will be used by the boards for the protection of fisheries in their areas.  Any shortfall in the revenue from the trout and coarse fishing licences during 1988 will directly hit the development <Col N="1932" /> of fisheries.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to encourage people to contribute by taking out coarse and trout fishing licences in 1988.  Their financial contribution will help in the fight against pollution and illegal activities and will help to provide revenue to effect some of the essential developments which are urgently required in the promotion and development of tourism and the fulfilment of recreational needs generally.  I appeal to those who are resisting the licence fee to recognise that they are hitting their own industry by not co-operating with us.  I emphasise again that the money will be collected and spent locally in the fight against pollution and illegal activities, as well as the development of coarse and trout fisheries.  Many of these fisheries are stagnant and under-used or inaccessible and would benefit enormously if we had sufficient funding at local level to enable worthwhile developments to take place.  I would encourage those who are opposed to licences fees to think again about their position.</P>
    <P>In November 1987, I received the report of the Salmon Review Group which addresses the many complex issues of salmon fishing from commercial and recreational points of view.  I have accepted the objectives as set out in the report and am confident that these objectives will form a firm foundation on which the future development of the salmon industry can be based.</P>
    <P>Salmon is a national asset and must be developed in the national interest with a view to creating sustainable employment, better income distribution and improved recreational amenities.  The important recommendations in the report regarding the development of a system of tagging salmon, ownership, pollution control, law enforcement and the future structures for the management of inland fisheries generally are being actively considered.</P>
    <P>I have recently published the report and in view of the importance of the proposed reforms, I have invited interested parties to submit their views not later than 31 March 1988, following <Col N="1933" /> which appropriate action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The development and exploitation of our inland fisheries for both domestic and overseas anglers is clearly of vital importance to the expansion of tourism.  This was clearly identified in the Salmon Review Group report.  In the context of the Government's overall commitment to, and plans for, development of the tourism sector, my Department will be redoubling their efforts to ensure that development and promotion of freshwater angling continues and improves. Co-operation and co-ordination between the Central Fisheries Board and Bord Fáilte in development and promotion continues to strengthen.  The primary development role of the Central Fisheries Board and the tourism promotional role of Bord Fáilte will continue to complement one another in the development of new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Review Body report has clearly indicated the way in which we must tackle this problem as a matter of urgency.  If indiscriminate illegal activity in coastal areas is allowed to continue indefinitely there will not be a salmon industry to develop and protect and the resulting damage will be enormous.  We must come to grips with these illegal activities which have been taking place for a number of years.  We cannot allow this to continue and we look for the cooperation of genuine salmon fishermen to stamp out this illegal activity which is putting the whole salmon industry in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>A product area of particular importance is marine tourism.  My Department have been given the specific remit to develop the largely untapped potential which marine-related leisure activities represent.  It is my Department's objective to encourage the development and promotion of a range of aquatic recreational activities which would have a significant appeal to the domestic market as well as visiting tourists.  The unique coastal attractions of Ireland represent a very considerable competitive advantage for developing a range of tourism activities based on marine sports.</P>
    <P>Work has already commenced within <Col N="1934" /> my Department on identifying potential marine-related leisure projects, facilities and activities which can be targeted for development and promotion.</P>
    <P>My Department are working to facilitate and accelerate maritime and aquatic sports and related activities.  We need many more marinas right around the coast.  The Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works will assist and facilitate private investment in this area and have instructions to encourage suitable development plans and remove obstacles.  A number of marina proposals at various stages of development have already been identified.  I hope that some of these projects will commence construction in the near future.</P>
    <P>My Department have been active in their role of protection of the marine environment and in the early days of the Government's life was faced with difficult and immediate decisions in relation to the wreck of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> which posed a threat of continuing oil leakage to the environment of the west Cork coastline and to the tourism projects for that region in the summer of 1987.  Happily we were able to successfully remove the remaining oil from the vessel in time and to confirm that no paint containing the very damaging TBT was held on board.  A claim for almost £1.75 million was lodged with the owners/insurers by my Department last October to cover the cost of the clean-up operation and we will be pursuing this claim actively to ensure that early compensation is forthcoming. In this regard I am happy to report that we recently settled a claim with the insurers of the <i>Christos Bitos</i> in respect of our claim for compensation for pollution damage caused by that vessel some years ago.</P>
    <P>I mentioned TBT earlier in the context of the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and of course I should say also that I moved early in the spring to introduce a by-law controlling the use of TBT anti-fouling compounds which have the capability to inflict considerable damage on stocks of edible shellfish.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of my new <Col N="1935" /> Department is to introduce a major programme of legislation to protect the marine environment and here I am glad to say that the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987 has reached Committee Stage in the Dáil having been passed in the Seanad.  I look forward to this Bill completing all further Stages here in the very near future.  I hope that a further Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill, will be ready to bring before the House in the near future.  This Bill will strengthen the law dealing with discharges of oil from ships and extend the law to cover non-oil pollutants, as well as introducing new provisions in relation to wreck management and removal.</P>
    <P>As announced by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, in November last, the Water Pollution (Amendment) Bill, 1987 is being drafted to, <i>inter alia,</i> increase the penalties for pollution under the Fisheries Acts and require the polluter to make good the damage caused by his actions.</P>
    <P>In establishing the Department of the Marine the Government had as one of their objectives the bringing of all harbours&mdash;commercial and fishery&mdash;under one administrative and planning umbrella.  The integration of the harbours division of the Department of Communications and of the fishery harbours division of the former Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry in a single division of my Department has largely been achieved.  Arrangements are now in train for the transfer of the major fishery harbour centres of Howth and Dunmore East and of Dún Laoghaire Harbour to the Department of the Marine.  I am confident that the centralising of control in one agency will facilitate the orderly development of our harbour infrastructure and result in the best use of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>The basic economic and operational philosophy underlying Irish ports policy has been that ports should, in principle, be operated as commercial undertakings and be financially self supporting, with management and development left to <Col N="1936" /> local interests with a knowledge of local needs, subject to my overall control.  The policy with regard to harbour grants has been that they should be provided only where improvements are essential to meet well defined commercial needs, where a harbour authority's own resources are insufficient, and where a commercial return on investment is in prospect.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure on harbours in the six years to 1987 was some £52.1 million.  Almost two thirds of this was provided from Exchequer sources by way of State grants or borrowings from the Local Loans Fund, with the balance coming from commercial borrowing and revenue surpluses.  Exchequer grants amounted to £25.4 million &mdash; some 49 per cent of total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Public Capital Programme this year contains provision for the payment of State grants totalling £2 million for commercial harbours development.  A number of projects are under consideration with a view to ensuring that the money available is used in a way which will ensure maximum return to the State in current circumstances where it is imperative to get the highest possible return from all capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Government decision that European Regional Development Fund assistance may be sought in respect of investment by public sector entities other than the Exchequer, where such assistance may otherwise be lost to Ireland, means that for the first time commercial harbour authorities may apply for EC funds for developments being financed from their own resources.  I will do everything in my power to ensure that moneys from this source are obtained for harbour projects that meet the criteria laid down.</P>
    <P>I am initiating a review of the Harbours Act, 1946, and in that connection my Department are in touch with the Irish Port Authorities Association for discussion on the matter.  Many of the provisions of that Act are out of date and the composition of the harbour Authorities needs to be reassessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will have the cooperation of the Deputy in ensuring a speedy passage for that legislation.</P>
      <P>In relation to fishery harbours, in future the Government's policy is to develop the sea fishing industry to its full potential.  In this context a programme of harbour development and management has been undertaken on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The programme will continue this year and £1.1 million has been allocated to fishery harbour works.  Of this amount £0.7 million is being made available for ongoing works on the provision of a much needed boatlift at Killybegs to service the large and very valuable local fishing fleet in which the State has a substantial investment. A further £0.33 million is for works on a harbour development scheme at Greencastle to relieve an acute berthage problem and provide deeper water for the harbour.  This will facilitate quicker turnabout and will enable the bigger boats in the fleet to use the port, particularly in the early part of the mackerel season when the fleet is working off the western coast of Scotland.</P>
      <P>Harbour development should be viewed within a consistent framework. Harbours can be used for shipping, for tourist traffic, for fishing and for recreational and amenity use.  I intend to ensure that in relation to the planning, organisation and development of harbours the options for complementary and alternative uses of existing harbour facilities are fully pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Faced with a declining merchant shipping fleet and with the prospect of ever increasing dependence on foreign shipping for transportation, this Government have acted with speed and purpose in their support for the Irish shipping industry.</P>
      <P>Fiscal incentives were introduced for shipping in the 1987 Finance Act, together with the Shipping Investment Grants Act which came into operation in December, 1987.  These measures offer a favourable environment to Irish ship-owners with reduced taxation, access to Business Expansion Scheme investment and a scheme of grant aid to owners of Irish ships to purchase new or secondhand vessels.</P>
      <P>Safety of life at sea is a major preoccupation of my Department.  I am concerned to ensure that vessels in distress can make contact with the Marine Rescue Services.  VHF radio is widely used for maritime communications.  VHF installations are practically universal on fishing vessels and are compulsory on merchant vessels of any significant size.  VHF provides a ready and easy means of emergency communication.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the provision of a 24 hour listening watch on VHF distress and emergency channels or in all coastal areas is the single most effective contribution they can make to the safety of life at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A start had been made in 1979 on the establishment of a chaim of remote controlled VHF radio stations but after four stations were built the programme was halted several years ago for budgetary reasons.  This Government believe that modernisation of safety aids cannot be further delayed.  The Government revived the programme in 1987 and ordered equipment for two more stations <Col N="1939" /> at Glencolmkille, County Donegal and at Cork Airport, which will commence operations in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to increase in the budget the published Estimates provision for coastal radio stations to enable four more VHF stations to be established.  This will enable the system to be radically expanded in 1988 and substantially completed.</P>
    <P>The sea and sea-bed resources, and the technologies related to their exploitation, represent a new and important aspect of economic and industrial development.  In the case of Ireland the marine area constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries as well as for leisure and recreational development.</P>
    <P>In order to capitalise on our marine and fisheries resources, it is essential that we measure these resources, and devise the most effective exploitation methods while, at the same time, ensuring the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The need for a coherent policy for marine and fisheries research and technology and for adequate support structures has been fully acknowledged for some time.  I intend to ensure that the necessary co-ordination is achieved in this area and that a more systematic approach is taken to fishing and marine research and technology.</P>
    <P>The Government have approved in principle the establishment of a marine institute which will bring together under one body activities carried out by a range of State-funded organisations.</P>
    <P>A Bill is now being prepared to establish the institute on a statutory basis as soon as possible.  The marine institute will have primary responsibility for the development and management of marine and fisheries research and technology activities.  As part of its co-ordination function, the institute will have responsibility for the operation of all centralised facilities and equipment.  It will also <Col N="1940" /> organise the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive data collection, storage and dissemination system.</P>
    <P>Because of the current embryonic stage of development of the marine and fisheries sector, the bulk of the necessary investment in research and technological activities will have to continue to come from the State.  However, as downstream activity develops, I expect that industry will bear an increasing share of the costs. Towards this end, the institute will work closely with industry to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The institute will also have a policy of obtaining a significant, and increasing, percentage of its funding requirements from non-Exchequer sources.  To that end, it will be expected to seek EC funding for marine and fisheries research projects and to expand the range and level of commercial services it provides for the private sector.</P>
    <P>The institute will be a very important instrument in support of the Department, and of the marine policy of exploiting to the maximum the potential of our marine economy which since the foundation of the State has been neglected.  This new administrative arrangement and the new dynamic approach we are now adopting at Roinn na Mara will be an instrument for opening up a whole new era of economic prosperity in our marine economy. In this area we have already made major strides in the first 12 months of our existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is like a cheap piece of furniture &mdash; good looking from a distance, tatty on closer examination and unlikely to hold together for very long.  It is strung together by, first, optimistic assumptions about the debt-GNP ratio; secondly, bringing forward money from future years through extended social insurance contributions; thirdly, paying for redundancies through off-balance sheet financing and, fourthly, one-off and non-recurring income through a one-off pension tax and a raid on ESB funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> Meanwhile, with all this one-off money it creates extra and continuing costs for future years because first, the full year's costs for tax and social welfare concessions will be greater next year than they are this year; secondly, larger pension liabilities are being created because of extension to the self-employed; thirdly, extra pension liabilities are being incurred for prematurely retired public servants and, fourthly, there will be a depreciation in the quality of public services because of the heavily subsidised retirement of the more productive public servants.  When all these eight factors are brought together, one can see how shaky is the foundation upon which this budget is built.</P>
    <P>The Government say that their fiscal aim is to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio &mdash; in other words, to reach a point where our income will be rising as fast as our debt.  Our debt would, of course, still be rising, but our rate of income growth would then have caught up.  However, a stabilised debt-GNP ratio is no promised land.  Even when we would have arrived at it, we would still see a continually increasing amount of money going out each year in extra interest payments.  The Government have therefore chosen a deliberately modest target in saying that their aim is merely to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>How far does this budget go towards that target?  Interest rates are still at about 8 per cent.  This adds 8 per cent to our debt each year.  Meanwhile, our GNP &mdash; in other words, our income &mdash; will grow this year by only about 3 per cent in cash terms.  This leaves a gap between the speeds at which our income and our debts are rising.  We can close this gap in three ways, first, if interest rates come down below their present level of about 8 per cent; secondly, if we increase the rate of growth of our income above the current 3 per cent; or, thirdly, if we reduce all new borrowing to well below the amount of interest we are paying on old debts.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a pretty complicated <Col N="1942" /> calculation.  That, indeed, is why stabilising the debt-GNP ratio is a clever political target to set.  All you need to do is fiddle around with the assumptions about interest rates or growth rates, and lo and behold, you can say that you are just on the brink of stabilising the debt-GNP ratio?  Yet there really is no solid evidence around to justify any belief that between now and the end of the decade interest rates will, in fact, fall below their present level of 8 per cent, or that growth rates will rise much higher than their present level of 3 per cent in cash terms in 1989 or 1990.  Interest rates, on last week's evidence, seem to be going up, not down.  If interest rates and growth rates stay much as they are, this budget still leaves a very long way indeed to go towards a stabilised debt-GNP ratio.</P>
    <P>In 1988, the budget leaves our new borrowing at £517 million below the likely interest bill for the year.  This is a difference of almost 3 per cent of GNP. But it has been calculated by the international accountants, Ernst and Whinney, that Ireland would need a difference between these two figures, not of 3 per cent of GNP, but of 7 per cent, if we were to stabilise our debt-GNP ratio.  This is a gap of £700 million.  So, unless interest rates fall, or growth rates rise, the Government will have to find a further £700 million in spending cuts or tax increases to reach their own chosen target.  This is not to denigrate the progress that has been made, but it is a necessary antidote to some of the simplistic oratory in ministerial speeches in this debate.</P>
    <P>There are considerable possibilities for creative accountancy in the system used to present the budget.  In my experience there are huge backlogs at the moment of agricultural, educational and housing grants.  These backlogs were deliberately used to postpone 1987 liabilities into 1988, and will probably be used again to postpone 1988 liabilities into 1989.  This trick has been used to make the 1987 budget outturn look much better than it really was.  The Government can also use similar creative accounting to appear to be reducing the debt much more quickly <Col N="1943" /> than is really the case.  First, they have already got rid of £534 million of Irish Government deposits in foreign banks which were previously classified as debt even though they were not debt at all &mdash; they were, in fact, credits; secondly, the Government have eliminated £1,784 million worth of double counting of debt in the Local Loans Fund.  It is also open to them, if they wish, to exclude from the official calculation of the national debt £857 million worth of Government securities held by the Department of Finance and used for trading in gilts.</P>
    <P>Together, these paper transactions &mdash; and that is all that they are &mdash; could appear and I emphasise &ldquo;appear&rdquo;, to take almost £2 billion, or 10 per cent of our national debt.  Commentators should beware of cosmetic improvements of this kind and concentrate on the reality of an ever-increasing real debt.  In real terms, the Minister for Finance has added £2.5 billion to the national debt since he took office last March.  The accounting changes I referred to, to minimise this, are perfectly justifiable in themselves, but we must be wary of their being used to give a misleading picture of the progress actually being made.</P>
    <P>The central mistake in Fianna Fáil economic policy arises from their anxiety to negotiate a pact with the unions last year.  To achieve this pact, they agreed to give wage increases financed by redundancies, and agreed to the extension of social insurance pensions to the self-employed. Both decisions create long-term extra costs for the taxpayer.  They were decisions in a hurry to achieve a cosmetic improvement in one or two years budget figures, without any regard to the long-term effect of Government finances.</P>
    <P>The voluntary redundancy scheme in the public service is particularly unwise. Because the scheme is voluntary, there will obviously be a tendency for those with the best prospects outside the service to leave.  It stands to reason that those who have the best prospects outside, have those prospects precisely <Col N="1944" /> because they have a knowledge and a competence that is worth money to somebody outside the service.  The transfer of that knowledge and competence to the private sector is now to be generously subsidised by the taxpayer.  The trade union movement speak frequently about the danger of the privatisation of the State's physical resources in return for receiving money.  It is ironic that they are actually endorsing a scheme of privatisation of the State's human resources, its best employees.  Under this scheme the State is actually not receiving money but paying out money to transfer its best human resources to the private sector, and very often to the private sector overseas.</P>
    <P>I know that the argument will be made that management in the public service retains the power to refuse redundancy to those particularly talented and well-placed officials who seek it, but how realistic is that?  It can hardly be expected that morale will remain high in an organisation if the best and hardest working people are told that they are imprisoned in the public service and will be denied the privilege of a generous golden handshake, while their less industrious and less talented brethren are told that they are free to take jobs in the private sector, and get cash bonuses and pensions as well.  This is just not workable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy does not want to suggest that the public service is a prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That problem could, of course, be overcome in a private firm by management offering talented individuals extra money to stay on if they were tempted to leave.  But the Government cannot and will not do that.  In fact the combination of their refusal to pay the Gleeson award, and their offer of very generous terms to quit, will lead to an exodus of talent from the public service.  That clearly does not worry the present Government.  Their time horizons are rather short.  But it must surely be a cause of concern to more thoughtful members of this House who worry about <Col N="1945" /> the direction this country is taking.  Far greater sums could be lost than anything saved by the redundancies, from misjudgments and inefficiencies of a public service depleted of its best managerial talent.</P>
      <P>The other questionable decision arising from the pact with the unions is the decision to provide social security pensions for the self-employed.  There is no clamorous demand from the self-employed to take part in the costly and compulsory system of social insurance pensions.  At this very time, neighbouring countries are looking at methods of encouraging choice, diversity and new thinking in regard to the provision of pensions.  Other countries see options in the pension area as ways of encouraging individuals to save wisely, and of spreading the individual ownership of shares in productive wealth.</P>
      <P>Yet at this very time, the Fianna Fáil Government are going in exactly the opposite direction.  They seem to believe that the old, unreformed, compulsory and monopolistic system of social insurance should simply be taken and extended to the self-employed.  Is this a wise decision?  Let me read out the views of the oft quoted Commission on Taxation. The Commission said, on page 306 of its first report, that our existing system of social insurance contributions, breached virtually all the standards normally accepted for equitable taxation.  They described it as &ldquo;regressive relative to income&rdquo; and as &ldquo;failing to take into account ability to pay because the same contribution is payable without regard to marital status&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The commission went on to make the most damning condemnation of all of our existing social insurance system when they said that its economic effects &ldquo;included a higher level of unemployment&rdquo;. If that is what the Commission on Taxation thinks of our social insurance system, why do Fianna Fáil want to extend and entrench it?  Surely their priority should be to reform it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our social insurance system is bad for jobs because it is a tax on one factor of production only &mdash; labour.  Thus it <Col N="1946" /> directly penalises job creation.  The Commission on Taxation also condemned the present social insurance contributions system because &ldquo;to the extent that the contributions are shifted forward into prices, they increase the cost of goods produced in Ireland relative to foreign produced goods.&rdquo;  In other words they help, indirectly, to subsidise imports. Because the contributions are only leviable on the bottom slice of income, and totally exempt income above a certain figure, they tend, in the view of the Commission &mdash; and it is a view that I share totally &mdash;&ldquo;discourage the employment of low income earners (largely the young, part time workers, women and older unskilled workers.)&rdquo; The Commission also saw the system as encouraging &ldquo;proliferation of benefits-in-kind which in practice do not carry the burden of social insurance contributions.&rdquo; In other words, it encourages the culture of tax avoidance, so prevalent in this country.</P>
    <P>What process of logic persuaded the Government to extend a system such as this to a whole new sector of the economy? Surely the correct course would have been to reform the system as recommended by the Commission on Taxation, rather than entrench it by extending its coverage?  In their actual proposals for the self-employed the Government seem set to introduce new and further anomalies into the system, as if the present ones were not enough.  Let me give one or two examples.  First, they propose that there will be a minimum payment of £2 per week by each person covered, a minimum payment whether or not there is an income that week or that year.  The scheme is supposed on paper to be a pay-related system of social insurance.  How then can the scheme continue to be called &ldquo;pay-related&rdquo; if some people have to pay a minimum sum whether they have an income or not?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Dr. Woods, claimed in this debate, that this minimum contribution provision was &ldquo;necessary in the case of self-employed persons mainly because capital allowances are deductible for PRSI purposes and self-employed persons with high <Col N="1947" /> capital allowances who would otherwise have a reasonable income, could end up paying a very small PRSI contribution or none at all&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister knows that this is not the only possible reason why a self-employed person might have no income in a particular year?  Has he never heard of trading losses, of falling products prices, of bad debts?  There are all reasons why self-employed persons might have no income in a particular year even though this Government want to make them pay a minimum contribution to a so-called pay-related system.  If capital allowances are the reason for this minimum contribution proposal, which flies in the face of the pay-related concept, then let us make special provision for taxpayers claiming capital allowances. But it is entirely wrong to throw out the &ldquo;pay-related&rdquo; principle, and make people with no income pay contributions, just because of that difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly.  The Minister for Social Welfare said that smallholders on unemployment assistance will not be required to contribute to the scheme &mdash;although they will presumably qualify for the benefits.  This will create a poverty trap for those just above the income limit for smallholders unemployment assistance. How does he propose to get over that difficulty?</P>
    <P>Many support the extension of the PRSI system to include the self-employed on the ground that it will make them pay their share.  This school of thought ignores the well documented case that this proposal will do the opposite.  It will, in fact, confer massive long-term financial benefits on the better off self-employed. These are the ones who would not normally qualify for non-contributory old age pensions, but who will now qualify for contributory social insurance pensions. This is an extra cost on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the better off self-employed will pay proportionately less towards these benefits than will the poorer self-employed.  This is because there is an income ceiling on contributions in our social insurance system. <Col N="1948" /> An uncounted number of people, within three years from now, will for a minimal contribution, be qualifying for tax-financed pensions that they do not need, and never sought.  What sort of tax equity is that?  Most self employed are on relatively low and variable incomes.  That is not really a very persuasive case, on grounds of equity with the PAYE sector, for making them pay social insurance contributions as well as income tax, health and youth employment levies.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning a few facts about the taxation of the self-employed, just to put matters into perspective.  First self-employed taxpayers do not qualify for the PAYE tax allowance of £800.  This means that they are liable up to £464 a year extra income tax.  Second, the privilege they enjoy of paying tax on a previous year's account is now worth much less than it was a few years ago when inflation was at a higher level.  Third, it should be noted that&mdash;and I quote from the report of the Commission on Taxation&mdash;self-employed persons are usually taxed on the basis of income accrued or earned whether or not it is actually received.  In other words, their income could be tied up in extra stock in trade, which is not immediately available for tax or social insurance payments.</P>
    <P>Fourth, self-employed tax payers are compelled to incur large book-keeping and accountancy costs in order to comply with their tax obligations.  The auditing of accounts can come to £1,000 per year, even if there is no tax or social insurance payable.  In addition, the Commission on Taxation quoted figures for the extra costs on self-employed persons of collecting PAYE and VAT for the State. They said that these extra costs borne out of after tax income by the self-employed person were 6 per cent of the State's PAYE receipts from that sector and 11 per cent of the State's VAT receipts from that sector.  These administrative costs have to be met by the self-employed person regardless of whether the business is making a profit.  The commission pointed out that these burdens fall disproportionately on small businesses, the type likely to be run by self-employed individuals, <Col N="1949" /> rather than by companies.  These are the types of business that some argue must, on equity grounds, be brought into the social insurance net.</P>
    <P>The self-employed do enjoy the benefit of a more liberal regime in regard to expenses.  It is widely believed, probably with considerable justification, that this allows self-employed persons, quite legitimately, to minimise their tax liability.  If this really is the problem the criteria for claiming expenses should be changed. Introducing comprehensive social insurance is an expensive and lazy way of dealing with minor anomalies like that.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Revenue sheriffs appointed by the previous Government and the tax amnesty proposed by this Government will quickly clear up the problem of tax arrears.  Once these arrears are cleared up, and I do not justify them in any way, a good part of the reason for the &ldquo;aggro&rdquo; against the self-employed will have disappeared.  If so, where is the need on grounds of equity, to bring in social insurance for the self-employed at this time, which will end up costing the PAYE sector huge sums of extra money and giving virtually free pensions to many people who have not sought them?</P>
    <P>Family Income Supplement was introduced to remove the poverty trap which locked people into unemployment.  Many people found that when all expenses were taken into account they would lose money by taking up a job and signing off unemployment assistance.  The FIS gives a cash supplement to low income earners at work, and is related to the number of children they have.  The scheme is rather complicated and the take up has therefore been disappointing.  There is certainly a very good case for reforming it, but there is no case for undermining it, as the Minister for Finance seems to be doing in this budget.</P>
    <P>He has announced substantial, and justifiable, increases in the personal rate of unemployment assistance and increases in other social welfare benefits as well. Yet the figures for eligibility and the rates of payment, under the FIS, have not been increased in line with the other social <Col N="1950" /> welfare increases.  This diminishes the value of the FIS, diminishes the incentive to work and is bad social policy.  I strongly condemn the Minister's failure to maintain parity between the FIS and other social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>I now turn to an anomaly in our tax code to which I have a strong personal and philosophical objection.  Our tax code has followed the British one in ceasing to recognise the costs associated with the rearing of children as affecting a tax-payer's ability to pay his or her income tax.  We have the curious situation that £4,100 extra of one's income is tax free, and one also qualifies for double tax bands if one has a dependent spouse.  But if one has a dependent child, one qualifies for no extra tax free income, and no improved tax bands.</P>
    <P>The present tax treatment of spouses is based on the Supreme Court judgement in the Murphy case.  This judgment relied on the constitutional provisions in favour of the family to strike down any discrimination in the tax code against married couples in favour of single people.  I do not understand, therefore, why the same constitutional provisions in regard to the family do not require that the tax code affords some consideration to the costs associated with bringing up children.</P>
    <P>I know it will be argued that a child tax allowance, like all other tax allowances, is liable to confer greater benefits on the better off, who will gain 58p for each £1 of child tax allowance granted, whereas poor people will only get 35p or nothing at all.  That does not seem to worry people in regard to other allowances.  But if it is a problem it can be overcome by granting a tax credit for children instead of a tax allowance, or indeed reforming the entire system to substitute credits for allowances.</P>
    <P>It could also be argued, as I have frequently heard it done, that people &ldquo;freely choose&rdquo; to have children, and that the State has therefore no obligation to give them a tax cut just because they have undertaken these extra responsibilities. If that logic is accepted, it is hard to see why a couple should have a double tax <Col N="1951" /> allowance because one of them &ldquo;freely chooses&rdquo; to remain at home, as a dependent spouse, or because they &ldquo;freely choose&rdquo; to have a mortgage, or pay health insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>Another argument against a tax allowance for children that I have heard, is that the State already spends a lot of money on the education of children.  In providing free or subsidised education, the State is saving the family a lot of money and it is argued that this is more than fair recompense for the lack of a child tax allowance.  This line of argument presupposes that the provision of free education is some sort of favour that the State confers on families.  As I see it, free education is something that is provided not as a favour, but because of certain moral values held by the community, and expressed by the State, as to the rights of children and the general development of society.  If that is so the existence of free education is hardly a sufficient argument for granting tax allowances for the individual himself, his spouse, his mortgage and health contributions, but not for his children.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the system of social welfare child benefits, paid to the spouse, is a full and adequate substitute for a child tax allowance.  I do not accept this and the figures show that this is not so.  The child benefit system does not achieve horizontal equity between taxpayers on a given level of income&mdash;one who has a spouse and no children and the other who has a spouse and a number of children.</P>
    <P>The child benefit is only worth a maximum of £180.60 a year to a family for each child.  The tax allowance and double tax bands for a spouse are worth up to £2,550 in tax saved.  The tax saving for a dependent spouse is up to 14 times as great as the benefit for a child.  Surely this is unfair to families with a number of children, relative to those who have none.  We should reform the system of tax treatment of children.  We should look at the French tax system which contains a much fairer system for allowing for children and other dependants.  It is <Col N="1952" /> described in some detail in paragraph 16.16 of the first report of the Commission on Taxation.  Under it, tax paid is related closely to family responsibilities. This is done by a system of quotients.  It encourages people to accept responsibilities for dependants.  This ultimately spreads responsibilities and saves money for the State.</P>
    <P>To judge from the Minister for Education's speech in this debate, the Government's educational policy is one of reviews, task forces, committees and no action.  Between pages seven and 12 of the Minister for Education's script I counted seven different reviews, studies or task forces, which she has established in order to long finger real educational problems on which she should be taking decisions now.  The plain reality is that Fianna Fáil's educational priorities are wrong by any normal standards.  They are concentrating their cuts in the primary and vocational sectors.  These are the sectors of most relevance to the early school-leaver, the child most at risk of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile we have the idiocy of continuing in this budget to spend £20 million over the next three years on the training of 1,800 national school teachers for jobs that will not exist, and with qualifications that are not recognised in any other country outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have continued spending on universities, in faculties the bulk of whose graduates are emigrating.  Mr. Patrick B. Diggins of the Teachers' Centre in Drumcondra has estimated that the Irish taxpayer spent £87 million on third-level education of graduates and nurses who emigrated in 1986.  He describes this as a straight transfer of wealth from this country to rich countries where these emigrants settle.  He accepts that emigration is natural and healthy, but he raises a very valid question as to whether this relatively poor country should continue to transfer educational financial resources to other countries without acknowledgment, compensation, or profit.  He suggests, and I agree, that Europe should develop a common educational policy whereby the costs of third-level <Col N="1953" /> education would be shared by member states within the European common labour market.  In this context the transfers to Ireland of funds for education from the European Social Fund should be seen not as a privilege but as a right.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should cut back on the level of graduate output from university faculties from which there is an especially high emigration.  For instance, the cost per architectural graduate&mdash;virtually all of whom emigrate&mdash;is £21,899.  The cost of a commerce graduate&mdash;much fewer of whom emigrate&mdash;is only a quarter as much&mdash;£5,600.  We should reduce one and increase the other.  Thus we could save money, without reducing total student numbers, simply by shifting resources from one faculty to another.</P>
    <P>If we are seeking to release resources for important educational priorities &mdash; for example, in the primary or vocational sector &mdash; we must surely question also the huge amount of money, estimated at £160 million, which we spend on teaching Irish.  Could be not devote at least some of that money to introduce a continental language at national school level, and provide for the teaching of at least two continental languages to all students at secondary level?</P>
    <P>I realise that these are changes that would take some time to bring into full effect.  I doubt if the present Government have either the political will, or the length of perspective, necessary to make a start on fundamental reforms of this kind.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other fundamental educational reforms I would like to see.  They are, first, the provision of an educational voucher &mdash; cashable for education or training at a later stage in life &mdash; to all early school leavers.  This would bring some justice into our present unjust educational system; second, the introduction of proficiency tests in reading, writing and basic mathematics at the age of 10, as a means not of streaming but of identifying children in need of extra help and establishing relative standars in regard to schools and third, the making available to parents of inspectors' reports on schools.  This has been done <Col N="1954" /> in Northern Ireland and gives useful comparative information, as well as being a spur to improve standards in schools.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of broadcasting. I believe that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was padded out with State enterprise proposals to please the trade unions.  One such proposal, which according to the Minister for Communications in his speech in this debate is proceeding apace, is the establishment of a new long wave radio service, namely, Radio Tara.  The project will provide very few jobs &mdash; as acknowledged by the Minister &mdash; but it would appear that the Minister believes that it will finance itself by the generation of revenue from the sale of advertising airtime in the United Kingdom, which he describes as exports. If that is to be the basis of its financing I fear that it will be another white elephant. To survive, it will have to win a large slice of an increasingly crowded British advertising market.  Just as Radio Tara is going into business, the British authorities have announced the issuing of 500 new local commercial radio licences and the establishment of three new national commercial radio stations.  All will be competing directly with Radio Tara for advertising on the British market.  Before the Minister continues encouraging RTE to spend large sums erecting a huge transmitter in County Meath &mdash; over the virulent objections of local residents &mdash; he night pause to ask himself if this is really such a good commercial venture at all.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters raised by Ministers in this debate which I would like to query.  The Minister for the Environment said that he was not going to build a national hazardous waste dump at Baldonnel and that he was offering private sector firms 50 per cent grants to dispose of hazardous waste.  If so, where will the waste be dumped?</P>
    <P>This looks to me as if the Minister is washing his hands of the whole matter of hazardous waste, and is going to leave it to local authorities, private firms and local residents to fight it out as to local authorities, private firms and local residents to fight it out as to where, now or by whom hazardous waste is to be <Col N="1955" /> disposed of.  Meanwhile, the problem gets worse and the Minister wrings his hands.  Surely the Minister should not be running away&mdash;and that is all he is doing &mdash;from his responsibilities in this matter. This is typical of the short-term, politically slick thinking that comes out from between the small print of many Government announcements&mdash;kick the issue into next year, or the year after, and maybe it will go away.</P>
    <P>There is a similar piece of slick manoeuvring in the budget remarks of Deputy O'Hanlon, the Minister for Health.  Last year he announced estimates which involved a drastic cutback on the long-term illness scheme.  This created grave anxiety on the part of many sick people, who feared huge bills just to get life-saving drugs.  As with the leaks about property tax and possible restrictions on mortgage interest relife, the Government seemed to be building up public anxieties deliberately.</P>
    <P>Then on 4 February along comes the Minister for Health to tell us that the Government had, between October and January found it possible to provide an additional £11 million for the scheme, thereby allowing it to be retained in full. The Government found it possible, within those few months, to provide the money this year.  What does this mean? Does it mean that they might not find it possible next year.  What was the original £11 million cut all about?  Did the Minister get cold feet?  Did the survival of the long term illness scheme depend solely on how the latest estimates for tax revenue turned out just a week or two before the budget?  If that is the case the long-term illness scheme has just got a short-term reprieve and will be abolished next year. The Minister for Health owes the House a proper explanation as to what happened. Until such an explanation is provided, one must assume that this scheme remains under threat, and was reprieved for one year only because of the vagaries of this year's budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>If our budgetary problems are to be overcome, our economy must grow.  The key to economic growth is flexibility and <Col N="1956" /> the rapid and continuing reallocation of resources.  The monopolies in the transport, electricity and telecommunications areas tie up resources and push up costs. Our social insurance and tax systems penalise employment, and reward labour saving.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system continues to tie people into idleness, as do decisions in this budget about the Family Income Supplement, rather than rewarding each and every effort to make a positive contribution to society.  Our education system is grossly inefficient, condemning many to perpetual unemployment, concentrating huge resources on the few.</P>
    <P>The favourable tax treatment for income tax and capital gains tax purposes &mdash;of Government stock and personal investment in housing ties up too much of our savings in these unproductive assets, rather than channelling them into assets which produce new wealth.</P>
    <P>We need a systematic policy to push resources out of any area, where they are making a small return, into new areas where the return will be greater.  This must be the overriding criterion of Government policy, a Government policy for growth.</P>
    <P>The Irish people need a dynamic alternative to the present Government, an alternative Government and Fine Gael are determined to provide this.  That is what we are building towards; that is the key to our present work on policy development.  Our people want effective Government, not the playing of parliamentary games of&mdash;I address myself to the empty benches over there &mdash; holding the balance of power, to quote one slogan in the 1987 election.  What the people want is an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil and the only people in a position to provide that are Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Our problems are serious.  Our opportunities are vast.  I say to all who want to listen, let us concentrate on building an alternative Government.  That is the role Fine Gael want to play in Irish political life today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important <Col N="1957" /> budget debate.  It is a follow-up to the budget introduced by the Government on taking office approximately ten months ago which set in train at that time a strategy for economic recovery.  During the period up to last December the Government kept within the specific targets laid down in that budget and in October last published the Book of Estimates for 1988, a tremendous achievement.</P>
      <P>The present budget is consistent with the Government's work as set out in the 1987 budget.  Tough and unpopular decisions have been made and will continue in the national interest in order to right our finances.  One has to accept that only a courageous Government would present such a budget.  Due to the Government's success since taking office, one can see a growth of confidence throughout the business sector.  This is reflected in the large decrease in commercial lending interest rates, including the mortgage interest rate.  Since last March bank interest rates have fallen six times.  The fall in interest rates has a major effect on costs for the public and private sectors.  It helps to reduce the cost of servicing the public debt as well as reducing the borrowing cost of private sector firms.  Many young people purchasing their houses have benefited from the drop in mortgage interest rates from 12.5 per cent to 9.25 per cent since the Government took office.  A typical £25,000 mortgage over a 20-year period gives a monthly saving of approximately £25.  This is putting money into these people's pockets.  Our economic trends include the low rate of inflation and a surplus balance of payments due to the tremendous performance of our exporters.</P>
      <P>The budget also provides extra increases in social welfare&mdash;a 3 per cent overall increase in weekly rates, 11 per cent increase for those getting the lowest payments, with 6 per cent for dependent children, and the continuation of the equal treatment payments which were due to end last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the additional £11 million to ensure the continuation of the community drugs refund scheme and the <Col N="1958" /> long-term illness scheme.  The retention of these schemes in full is and will be very much appreciated by all concerned.  The additional £3 million which the Government provided towards the cost of providing accommodation for the homeless, of which £1 million will be made available this year, is long overdue.  As a member of a local authority, or a health committee, one is very conscious of this very serious problem.  I would hope to see this money helping the very many organisations which deal with the many homeless people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of the young farmers' grant installation scheme is very much appreciated in agricultural circles. This is a very important scheme which costs approximately £1.4 million, and the EC will refund 50 per cent of this expenditure. This scheme will continue to encourage the transfer of land to young farmers and they, in turn, can be depended on to develop agriculture.  The stock relief has been maintained, as has the calculation of levies on income after capital allowances, which was a matter of contention among the farming community for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, and I am sure in other constituencies, young farmers' applications under the installation aid package were disallowed on technicalities, and they have appealed directly to the Minister.  I would appreciate if he could give such cases sympathetic consideration with a view to resolving these problems as this package will give a great start to young farmers.</P>
    <P>The forestry sector has tremendous potential and the Government have introduced new and bigger grants for planting.  The planting programme exceeded all expectations last year, which was a record, and no doubt this work will continue in 1988.  I look forward to the establishment of a State forestry enterprise agency.</P>
    <P>Taxation reform has received special mention in this budget.  It is acceptable that our tax structures and administrations are in need of overhaul.  The general thrust of Government policy is towards a broader base for tax liability <Col N="1959" /> and a much more effective method of collection.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts since 1981 I am very conscious of the problems in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the collection of tax.  The Collector General in his excellent report has highlighted the situation with regard to outstanding taxes.  The Commission on Taxation devoted their fifth report to examining the administration of the tax system with special reference to the method of collection.</P>
    <P>The first serious steps in tax reform were taken in the budget and have to be put in the context of what was achieved in 1987 with the setting up of the special tax force to deal with tax arrears.  No doubt, this task force were most effective. Every taxpayer is very concerned about the very high arrears of outstanding taxes.  The Revenue Commissioners are monitoring the position and hope to resolve this problem over a certain period.</P>
    <P>The introduction of self-assessment for income tax and corporation tax in the self-employed area is a step in the right direction.  The overall aim is to reform the taxation system so that the tax burden will be distributed equally.  Fairness within the tax system is a Government priority and this can be seen in the present budget.  Sixty three per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the standard rate of 35 per cent in the income tax year 1988-89. Self-assessment will also help the Revenue Commissioners to release staff to follow up on massive arrears.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to local government reform and the need to have these reforms implemented.  We all agree that this is an urgent priority.  It is essential to put local government on a sound financial footing so that they can provide the necessary services.  The biggest problem facing local authorities at the moment are the county roads, due to a lack of funding.  This applies in particular to my own county of Kerry.  For the leading tourist country, our roads are a source of embarrassment.  I appeal to the Government to look at this problem and <Col N="1960" /> ensure that special finances are made available, especially for county roads. Tralee is very pleased to be included under the urban renewal scheme, and I would like to see other areas in my county given the same designation.  I look forward to the people of Tralee availing of this package which will create much needed jobs in our town.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the big problem facing the country and the fact that 250,000 people are unemployed is sad and leads to all sorts of social problems. The tax amnesty is welcome as is an incentive to assist people to bring their tax affairs up to date.  Over the past number of months I have received representations &mdash; and I know many other TDs have also &mdash; from many people who have received very large tax bills.  Quite a few go back for years and in many cases the interest is 40 or 50 per cent of the total demand.  I am satisfied that many such people will now respond by paying their taxes before the due date, 30 December 1988.</P>
    <P>The recent changes in collection and the appointment of new sheriffs in many areas is effective.  However, I note that once a warrant has been sent to the sheriff the Revenue Commissioners will not entertain any representations with regard to payments.  The time is opportune to consider concessions for prompt payment of taxes.</P>
    <P>The building sector will also be assisted with the restoration of the section 23 relief.  They have had a very difficult year but there are indications of recovery within the industry and this incentive will certainly assist them.  It will encourage more construction of residential accommodation for renting and, at the same time, reduce rent charges in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The national lottery, which has exceeded all expectations in less than a year, has provided a sum of £60 million for sport, youth, arts, health and the Irish language, which I welcome.  Spending on these projects is now getting under way. As the lottery continues to expand, it is intended to provide further support for worthwhile projects.  An additional allocation <Col N="1961" /> of £6.5 million over and above the figures published is being made available for primary and post-primary school building programmes which is a most welcome boost.</P>
    <P>The figures in relation to the Jobsearch programme are impressive: 141,500 people were interviewed, 40,000 were placed on Manpower schemes, AnCo training courses and Jobsearch programmes and 4,200 found employment as a result of these schemes.  When invited to avail of the Jobsearch programme, 12,700 people left the register.</P>
    <P>Industrial output of exports was most impressive during 1987 as it increased by 8 per cent, more than two and a half times the level reached in each of the previous two years.  In real terms, industrial exports increased compared with 1986.  The Estimates for 1988 mean a most desirable shift in State support from fixed assets to research and development, management development and marketing support.  The total exports for 1987 topped the £10.5 billion mark, the first time that figure has been exceeded.  The Government's crash programme last year to boost tourism was a tremendous success as there was a 16 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the business employment scheme to tourism projects. In County Kerry, which has done so much for tourism, these incentives are very much appreciated.  Access fares led to a significant recovery in 1987 and the decision to introduce another package of special measures for tourism in 1988, costing £4 million, will no doubt pay dividends. In particular, the setting up of a task force will further enhance the potential of tourism.  I am satisfied that this group have the expertise and ability to reach out to new markets which will result in attracting many visitors to our country.  Tourism in most countries over the past number of years has expanded while we have remained static.  It is now accepted that new initiatives are needed, especially in the marketing area, if we are to benefit from the tremendous tourism potential in this country.</P>
    <P>The regional boards involved in tourism are doing tremendous work but they <Col N="1962" /> are starved of funding.  I speak in particular of the Cork-Kerry region which this year was supposed to have a budget of approximately £640,000 but they have now been notified by Bord Fáilte that their allocation is only £213,000, leaving a shortfall in excess of £400,000.  This is not acceptable in view of the fact that the region has almost one third of the total residential accommodation, and, as a result, should qualify for a much greater allocation from the board.</P>
    <P>The re-established Cork-Swansea ferry played a major role during 1987 in the Cork and Kerry regions.  The ferry carried in excess of 100,000 passengers and 24,000 cars.  In 1988 they hope to increase these figures but they need a further subsidy this year and I appeal to the Government to respond to the request from the Cork-Swansea Ferry Company.</P>
    <P>A recent report published by Price-Waterhouse recommended that the Department of Tourism and Transport should be actively engaged in the co-ordination of policies affecting the development of tourism.  For this reason, the co-ordination of tourism policy can only take place effectively at Government level.  The fact that tourism, as well as transport, merits senior ministerial rank in the Cabinet is a welcome development. Monitoring and co-ordination at this level is important to ensure that various policies and actions undertaken by Government Departments, which sometimes work at cross purposes, can be controlled.</P>
    <P>One area where the need for co-ordination at this level has been clearly shown to be acute over the last year is the protection of the environment.  The adverse impact of water pollution and the nonenforcement of fishery laws, for example, are already threatening one of our major special interest markets&mdash;angling&mdash; which is the largest participation sport in the United Kingdom.  A further deterioration of standards in this area, together with inappropriate section 4 planning decisions and the uncontrolled disposal of waste, will preclude the <Col N="1963" /> development of further specialist products recommended in the Price-Waterhouse report.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Transport should specify for all other Government Departments the information regarding State activities on the unique environment so critical to tourism across a wide range of areas.  Effective policy co-ordination at this level under the aegis of the Department of the Environment would free Bord Fáilte to concentrate on significant planning issues submitted to local planning authorities and on local development plans affecting tourism amenities.</P>
    <P>The report of the salmon review group which addresses the many complex issues of salmon fishing has been presented to the Government and I am delighted that they have accepted their objectives as set out in the report.  No doubt, these objectives can be the basis for future development of the salmon industry.  The report sets out very clearly the importance of salmon as a national asset which must be further developed, development which will create worthwhile employment. The report has recently been published and interested groups have the opportunity of making submissions before 31 March 1988 to the Minister for the Marine.  Bord Fáilte have indicated that fishing in Ireland has attracted quite an amount of interest in overseas markets and, for this reason, the important recommendations in the report regarding the development of salmon fishing should be followed through without delay.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Government to proceed with the setting up of a Shannon Estuary Authority as this was promised by the previous Coalition Government. However, it is now obvious that vested interests prevented it from getting the green light.  For this reason, it is now most important that it is set up with a dynamic board which will seek further development of the estuary, thus creating much needed employment.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the period in office of the Government, it is evident that the <Col N="1964" /> country has seen a change for the better. Confidence has been restored, investment is coming back and we can see visible improvements.  The strategy of the Government has been accepted by the people and, while there is a long way to go, present economic indications are good.  The budget has involved tough decisions in the national interest.  It is responsible and constructive and faces up to the serious problems facing the country, especially in regard to high unemployment.  The overall aim of the Government is to set out a formula to secure growth in the economy.  The overall structure in the present budget is to reduce dependence on borrowing and set out targets to attract investment and in so doing to create the conditions that will attract much needed employment.  The objectives of the Government are long term.  The first objective is to restore confidence in the economy and no doubt this has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated on his budget as it deals with many important issues.  He has made a special effort to assist the weaker sections of our community.  He has made a determined effort in relation to tax reform and no doubt this will be accepted as a serious effort.  Overall, the strategy of the budget addresses the problem of the economy. It is a continuation of the policy laid down by the Government when resuming office &mdash;to seek growth, development and job creation.  I welcome the budget.  It is accepted that it is going in the right direction. The tax incentives and social welfare benefits will ensure that while this Government are interested in getting the finances and the national debt in order they also care about people.  I hope we can continue on this vein as it will lead to prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute say that 134,000 more young people will emigrate between now and 1992.  They also say that if we continue our present policies our level of employment will either remain as it is or increase in that period. <Col N="1965" /> The budget does not address itself to the twin problems of emigration and unemployment. It holds out very little hope for our young and well educated population. Effective action and control of our budget deficit is welcome and essential, but it is not enough.  Imaginative ideas are required to improve the employment prospects and give hope to our young population.  We must lift this country out of the dull, dour, hopeless philosophy which reflects the entire national thinking today.  The Government are preoccupied with getting the figures right, irrespective of the consequences.</P>
      <P>I see this budget as a holding operation more than an attempt to solve the present problems of both unemployment and emigration.  The concessions to the PAYE sector are welcome.  However, these reliefs are purchased at a very high price.  There have been savage cutbacks in health and education.  I know from my dealings with the public that many parents would prefer to have a proper education for their children safeguarded than have a few extra pounds in their pockets which would mean very little in the long run.</P>
      <P>Education is one of the escape routes from unemployment and poverty in times of severe economic recession.  Government cutbacks hit hardest at the poorest sections of the community.  Education also gives to many of our emigrants the only advantage they will have when they go abroad.  I seriously question the wisdom of cuts in both primary and vocational education as these affect the most vulnerable of our population.  The primary and vocational sectors present, in the majority of cases, the only form of practical education for many of our young emigrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the practice of percentage across-the-board increases.  Tax reliefs which progressively favour high income earners, are socially unjust.  In 1988 a person on a wage of £6,000 will get an increase of £250 while those on £25,000 will get £1,225.  That takes into account wage increases at 2½ per cent and tax reliefs.  In times of great poverty the <Col N="1966" /> better off must be prepared to make sacrifices to benefit the poor.  In the budget the tax exemption limit was increased by only £100 for a single person and £200 for couples.  It is estimated that this will remove about 16,000 people from the tax net.  I believe that the tax exemption limits for the lowly paid should have been increased further.  In contrast to the taxation changes, those made in social welfare specifically favoured those on the lowest rates.</P>
    <P>As has been stressed by our deputy Leader, Deputy John Bruton, we must look at our tax system.  It must be revised and reviewed and more equity will have to be brought into it.  If this is to happen a lot of imagination and hard decisions will be required.  I advise the Government to look more imaginatively at the tax system in order to bring about equity and to have a more progressive tax system which would reward those who work hardest and also the lowly paid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the re-introduction of the young farmer establishment aid.  This was introduced by the last Government and subsequently abolished by the present Government when they came to office. These grants which are 50 per cent funded by the EC encourage young farmers to take over their family farms and encourage the order generation to give their land over to the younger generation.  The grant also guarantees that young farmers will get a sound agricultural education as the green cert is an essential qualification for eligibility for such grants.</P>
    <P>In this age when we need to give our young people a greater role in the running of our country and allow their ideas to be brought forward in both business and farming, this grant provides that incentive. I would like also to request the Minister for Defence, as he was the spokesman on Agriculture during Fianna Fáil's last period in Opposition, to encourage the Department of Agriculture to speed up the payment of the young farmer establishment aid grants. Very few have been paid at present thus undermining confidence in the system.  If this scheme is to be productive, grants will have to be paid more speedily.  I <Col N="1967" /> request the Minister to make inquiries of the Minister for Agriculture regarding the payment of these grants.</P>
    <P>The reduction of VAT refunds to farmers who are not registered for VAT is a most unwelcome step.  It is a penalty especially on the small progressive farmers of Ireland and a further disincentive to progress.  The small progressive farmers were coming out of their shell and were prepared to have a go.  Incentives like VAT refunds were rewarded to progressive farmers.  They knew that some of their expenditure would be restored to them.  However, this move will serve as a disincentive to the small farmer in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The extension of the PRSI scheme to farmers and the self-employed, while welcomed by the unions, leaves many questions unanswered.  As the Minister is aware, farm incomes fluctuate considerably from year to year.  In many cases farmers will not make a profit for the year.  For example, in 1985 and 1986 farmers did not, in the majority of cases, have any income.  Indeed, a payment of £208 per annum for small farmers who would suffer losses is penal and could pose a problem for many of these people in time of losses.</P>
    <P>The payment of contributory pensions to farmers at age 65, irrespective of his means, will restrict the mobility of land ownership.  A farmer will no longer need to transfer his farm to his son or daughter. He can hold on to the land and continue to control its destiny.  This will militate against the younger farmers.  The farm establishment aid encourages farmers to sign over their land but the change will mean that farmers will not be encouraged to give over their land.  I would like the Minister to tell us in the case of part time farmers who are working and making PRSI contributions how those contributions will reckon when they reach the age of 65.  Will they still have to make contributions from their farm incomes?  I would like to have that matter clarified.</P>
    <P>There is one area which I would like to refer to, which was not mentioned either in the budget or in the Estimates, <Col N="1968" /> and that is the further reclassification of the less severely handicapped area.  The previous Government made a submission to Brussels on 4 February 1987 suggesting that less severely handicapped areas be reclassified as more severely handicapped areas thus ensuring headage grant payments for farmers in those areas. However, the present Government did not persevere with that commitment and I understand they have made further proposals to Brussels.  There is no provision in the Estimates for the necessary amount of finance which will be needed for an extension of the scheme if these areas are to be reclassified.  It was estimated in 1987 that this would cost £15 million but because of budgetary restraints and so forth I presume it will be very difficult to find this money in the tight financial resources which are available.  That is another point which I would like the Minister to clarify.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget which is most worrying is the statutory sick pay pension under which employers would be responsible for paying employees for the first 13 weeks of illness.  Most small businesses will find this a crippling cost.  For example, an employer may now be faced with paying over £2,000 for the first 13 weeks a person goes on sick leave.  This could contribute to the closure of many small businesses, certainly in the north Kerry area, as it will affect their cash flow considerably.  £2,000 over 13 weeks is a big take out of the cash flow of a small firm or enterprise.  This is very worrying for those small-time employers.  I realise that they will get this money back but they will initially have to find this money and they may find it difficult to do so. That is something which should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, 1988 will witness the further decline of the small business sector and I predict at this stage that we can expect to see many more small businesses go to the wall due to the lack of Government supports and incentives. The building trade is going through a crisis at present and that is obvious to all.  The house improvement grant scheme created a boom for small builders <Col N="1969" /> and this was especially true of my own constituency, Kerry North.  It was also of great benefit to builders providers and hardware shops.  Since the scheme was abolished there has been a progressive downturn in the building industry.  Small builders are emigrating or signing on for unemployment benefit.  Hardware shops are letting staff go and every facet of the building industry has been affected in some way by the removal of these grants. I am very surprised that house improvement grants in some form were not reintroduced in the budget, especially when we consider the promises which were given by the present Government before and after they came into office.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the budget has totally ignored the building crisis and there has been great disappointment at the performance of the Government in regard to the construction industry.  Section 23 reliefs will benefit only the construction of rental accommodation.  For example there is little demand for such accommodation in rural areas and as such there is little flat construction.  Section 23 reliefs will have minimal effect except in the major urban centres.</P>
    <P>Government policy towards housing in the past year was represented by a withdrawal of supports and an increasing level of taxation.  The £5,000 special grant for local authority tenants who wish to buy a house in the private sector was withdrawn. Also, the £2,250 special builders grant was withdrawn and the most punitive measure of all was the 10 per cent reduction in mortgage interest relief.  It is acknowledged that because of these factors the future demand for new housing will be at a significantly lower level than in the seventies and early eighties. School building programmes have also been dramatically reduced.  For example, the building programme for the primary sector has been reduced from £30 million to £21.8 million.  Originally it had been reduced from £30 million to £15 million but this was increased by £6.8 million in the budget.  In the secondary sector, the capital building programme has been reduced from £38 million to £21 million. <Col N="1970" /> Again, this could have a very adverse effect on the building industry.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to how the proceeds of the national lottery will be spent.  This year £60 million of national lottery funds will be spent &mdash; £34 million on capital projects and £26 million on current expenditure.  Again, I would like to stress the need to spend more money on capital projects rather than on current expenditure.  Usually in the case of current expenditure it just takes the place of existing expenditure.  I do not think that the national lottery was meant to do this originally.  Having a sporting background, I am very disappointed at the way the proceeds of the national lottery have been spent on sport.  The spending has been very piecemeal and fragmented and there seems to be no coherent policy as regards how this money should be spent.  The Minister has given a grant to one sporting organisation in one parish and another to a sporting organisation in the next parish, and Deputies from all parties are vying with each other to see who will get most of the funds allocated to clubs etc.  This is not the way the money should be spent.  It is now time that a coherent spending plan was drawn up which would indicate clearly where the money will be spent in future.</P>
    <P>It bothers me that we have never had a national sport policy.  Now that we have finance available to back up such a policy it is time that we brought forward a national sports policy.  Such a policy should have specific objectives about the future direction of sport and single out areas for investment.  More importantly, it should guide the development of a national sports centre to house all sports organisations and a national sports museum where historical records of sporting achievements and organisations could be kept.  Such a centre could prove to be a great tourist attraction.  The Government should choose a site for such a centre and stop messing around with the GAA and other organisations.  That centre should be developed with funds from the national lottery.  In my view the Government are trying to save as much as they can from the proceeds of the <Col N="1971" /> lottery so as to be able to spend it for political purposes in the different constituencies in an effort to make Government Members popular.  At the end of the day we will be accused of killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  We will not have very much to show for the proceeds of the national lottery if we do not develop a proper policy now.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government established a sports science and medical research centre.  All sports organisations are crying out for such a facility to help them improve training methods, treat injuries and prepare proper rehabilitation methods for injured athletes.  A special committee that examined sports injuries recommended that such a centre be established but we have not heard anything about their recommendations.  Such a centre could be built from some of the proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foley referred to the Shannon Estuary and alleged that vested interests prevented the passage of a Bill dealing with that estuary.  I should like to remind him that Deputy Jim Mitchell, when Minister for Communications, piloted such a Bill through the Seanad.  The House spent a considerable amount of time debating that Bill.  It was introduced in the Dáil but lapsed when the general election was called.  The Fianna Fáil Government did not reintroduce the Bill although there was widespread support for its provisions.  It did not create any rumblings in the constituencies concerned. In my view the Bill which the Minister for the Marine proposes introducing will cause a lot of unnecessary conflict in the Limerick, Clare and Kerry regions.  The Bill which was passed by the Seanad was acceptable to the Limerick Harbour Commissioners, the Foynes Harbour Commissioners and the various county councils.  My view is that the new proposal will result in a lot of arguing and delaying tactics.  Even at this late stage the Minister should reintroduce the original Bill.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the tourist industry.  In the budget the Minister allocated £4 million for the promotion <Col N="1972" /> of tourism but the Estimates produced last year showed that £7 million was taken from the tourist allocation. That means that that industry suffered a net loss of £3 million at a time when the Government are stressing the importance of promoting it.  I find that hard to understand. I hope the promotion campaign being undertaken by the Government will have some effect but I do not think we will achieve the targets that have been set.  A Spanish businessman who is involved in the tourist business recently pointed out to me that the tourist offices in Spain do not carry one brochure promoting holidays in Ireland.  He was amazed that there was no evidence of Bord Fáilte promotions.  Spanish people anxious to visit Ireland have to travel to France or Italy to get information about this country.  In Spain, and Mediterranean countries, there is great interest in golf and angling and we should tap that market.  The Minister for Tourism should encourage Bord Fáilte to concentrate on Mediterranean countries and not confine their activities to England and America.  Golf is very popular in Spain and we should be able to attract Spanish golfers to this country.  A Kerry hotelier has carried out promotion work in Spain and is expecting at least 20 Spanish golfers to spend a holiday in Kerry this summer.  He should be commended for his initiative.  The Bord Fáilte promotion work should be extended to include more than England, America and northern Europe.</P>
    <P>The budget will have very little effect. It amounts to a holding procedure rather than an effort to face the problems of unemployment and emigration.  Last year may have been a very difficult year but I fear for 1988.  When the cuts bite we will have a very depressed economy.  We should pray for fine weather this summer because it will be the only thing that will save us in 1988.  The Government's policies may get our national finances in good order but they will not do enough to offset the negative effects of unemployment and emigration.</P>

      <P>Irish Governments from all parties have had at least one thing in common in recent years; they have been inundated by demands to reduce taxation and increase spending.  Anyone with a rough grasp of arithmetic can see that there is no easy way to square that particular circle.  Borrowing money to bridge the gap has proved to be no solution.  Indeed, Government borrowing is no more than deferred taxation.  Loans must be repaid and for Ireland the day of reckoning is at hand.  There are still some voices crying for special treatment, for an extra amount of expenditure here or a tax concession there.  In all but the most urgent cases the answer must be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The country cannot afford it.  Financial laxity today will bring disaster tomorrow.</P>
      <P>It has become fashionable in recent years to compare the levels of taxation and standards of social services available in Ireland with those in the United Kingdom and our neighbours in Northern Europe.  The outcome of such comparisons is always the same: those living in other countries enjoy lower tax rates and have access to better social services. This should not surprise anyone.  If we insist on comparing ourselves with the wealthiest countries in Europe, indeed in the world, we can hardly expect to be pleased with the outcome.  Our true peers in terms of national income per head are countries like Spain and Greece.  There is nothing much wrong with our provision of services that a higher national income would not fix.  However, we cannot spend it before it has been earned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Raising out national income will not <Col N="1975" /> be easy.  Whatever people may believe, economic growth and development did not come easily to any of our wealthy neighbours and it will not come easily to Ireland.  Economic growth is the reward given to those countries which plan, those which put effort into creating a positive environment for business and, above all, those countries willing to make short-term sacrifices in return for long-term benefits.  This long-term approach has been lacking in recent years.  The damage done by the failure to take decisive action sooner will take some time to repair. However, this Government, with two responsibly thought-out budgets behind them, have demonstrated their commitment to economic recovery.  As each year passes, our task will become easier as more and more people realise the correctness of our approach.</P>
    <P>I have found over the past few days that people have a general feeling of realism as regards the budget introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. The days when people felt that something should be pulled out of the hat by the Government are gone; for that at least, thank goodness.  There are no surprises in the air.  The realisation is about that we have only started on a long but sure stabilisation of the economy by way of the implementation of our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> published last October, which has been accepted by all the social partners.  That in itself ensures the way forward, the way to progress and the way to prosperity, The Government alone cannot do it.  With the support from all the interest groups, thankfully the Government are now giving the lead, showing the way forward for all these groups.</P>
    <P>There can be no Member of the House who will disagree with the concept that the national debt and its servicing have gone beyond the State's ability to sustain them, and the Government have undertaken to stabilise the ratio between the national debt and the gross national product by the end of 1990.  This budget is part of the necessary process.  I outlined at the beginning the figures to underpin <Col N="1976" /> that statement.  In the area in which the immediate managerial onus is on the Government, namely the public service, an unprecedented rationalisation of resources has commenced.  It is a painful one but none knows better than those immediately affected by it of the need for the measures involved.  Some State-sponsored bodies have been closed down, others have been amalgamated, and throughout the public service at large staffing reductions are under way.  The reverberations are felt throughout a whole spectrum of services such as schools, hospitals and emergency services. The reality is that we have been providing a level of services out of the public purse which simply did not contain the wherewithal to pay for it, and we must now take corrective action by the introduction of sensible housekeeping. On the productivity side, some of the harsher effects are being softened by greater recourse to computerisation and automated processes.</P>
    <P>Simultaneously with this rationalisation, the Government are pressing on with an ambitious but realistic programme of decentralisation.  My own Department will have 200, that is over one-third of its Civil Service staff, moved to Galway by the end of 1989.  On Monday, I had the pleasure of cutting the first sod to embark on that move and, hopefully, things will be in place by the end of next year.  The Department of Social Welfare will move 300 staff to Sligo, the Department of the Environment 200 to Ballina, and the Department of Agriculture 150 to Cavan.  In addition to these moves, a second phase of decentralisation involving eight further centres throughout the State has already been approved.  The notion that a policy of decentralisation would benefit both Dublin city, with its overcrowding, and rural locations, with falling or stagnant populations, has long been favoured almost universally throughout the State, but it is now being taken on board with determination by this Government.  The spin-off in terms of increased services requirements in the host communities will be considerable.  The present imbalance <Col N="1977" /> between Dublin and the other parts of the country will be redressed.  Every weekend there are bus loads of young country girls and boys going home on Friday evening and returning to the city on Sunday evening.  This will give them an opportunity to live and work in their own communities and to contribute to their own areas, both socially and economically. This policy will ensure that rural communities will once again become vibrant, virile communities and we will see these places being built up.</P>
    <P>While I have dealt with the hard realities of our economic position, we must recognise the strengths in our position and identify targets at which we should aim.  To do this we must realise that there are areas in which, from an international trading point of view, we cannot hope to compete.  In the field of labour intensive industries devoted to mass production, employing unskilled or semi-skilled people, or people trained by on-the-job processes, we cannot hope to compete with Third World countries in, say, the Far East, where workers are still to be found who will accept a tenth or less of the remuneration expected by our own workforce.  Extreme cases of which this is true are mass productions of textiles, footwear and plastic goods.  Another case of diminishing opportunities is that of the traditional production and marketing of farm produce, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, our economic and social prospects depend ultimately on the development of our industrial base to produce quality traded goods and services for world markets.  We should underline the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  Successful starts have been made in a number of areas, such as the electronics industry, tool making, vehicle components, craft products, and international engineering consultants, but the areas one visualises as promising the most dependable expansion are the food industry, marine resources, afforestation, and tourism, areas which this Government are now emphasising, areas of natural resource <Col N="1978" /> which we are developing for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>We have the most pollution-free country in Western Europe.  Should our marketing of our foodstuffs not reflect this? Our coastline abuts the richest fishing grounds extant in the north-east Atlantic but the potential for home fish processing has still to be tapped, and aquaculture is still only in its infancy.  The new development strategy being prepared by Bord Iascaigh Mhara should set us on the right course here.  Our tourist industry has yet to develop anything like its true potential but recent events and measures should help to put it on the right track: I cite the dramatic reduction in the cost of fares on car ferries to and from the country, the new EC air transport package which will open up all Irish regional airports to international service, and indeed, the extention of the business expansion scheme to a large spectrum of services and activities serving the export tourism market.</P>
    <P>The budget allocation of £4 million for the package of special measures will ensure that last year's turning point in the tourist industry will be the spingboard from which a whole new approach will take off, and a new impetus generated. A moment's reflection will convince any thinking person that almost all of our success stories in the commercial area are based on the creation of quality goods and services for up-market customers. They are the products of skills that come relatively easily to a highly educated workforce and have been marketed with a growing degree of sophistication.  The Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála have made great contributions to these successes and carry many of our hopes for the future.  Again, the Government recognise the great pluses here, the great progress that can be made.  This was highlighted during the past year with the creation of the ministerial offices for trade and marketing and for science and technology.</P>
    <P>I have remarked on the relatively pollution-free environment in which our crops are grown and our livestock are grazed and which we invite tourists to enjoy.  There are, unfortunately, two <Col N="1979" /> clouds on the horizon here.  The first represents the growing incidence of inland water pollution by the release of effluents into our rivers.  The other is perhaps more sinister.  It is the use of the international waters as dumping areas by countries with the problem of disposing of nuclear waste, most notably by the United Kingdom.  Not only have the discharges from Sellafield given cause for concern as regards the Irish Sea, but now reports are being publicised that the British Ministry of Defence are considering dumping the reactors from a number of nuclear submarines, already decommissioned, or about to be decommissioned, in the Atlantic a few hundred miles off the coast of Cork.  The whole situation is intolerable and I cannot imagine that there is a single Member in this House who is not 100 per cent behind my colleague, the Minister for Energy, in the campaign he has mounted against the UK authorities to force them to recognise their responsibilities to the international community.</P>
    <P>The extension of the pay-related benefit insurance scheme to the farming community and to the self-employed has raised some hackles in some quarters.  I must say that the criticisms raised are ill-founded.  The Government's intention with regard to PRSI is to ensure that the cost of providing benefits is spread evenly among the population as a whole.  At present, the cost of providing non-contributory old age pensions is borne by the public at large.  In introducing the new PRSI levy, the Government are merely asking that people should contribute towards the cost of their own pensions. That surely is not asking very much.  It is hardly fair to criticise this move as inequitable.  On the contrary, the new scheme represents the removal of an existing injustice.</P>
    <P>In devising the scheme, the Government have made every effort to ensure that no taxpayer will suffer unduly.  Those who receive the smallholder's unemployment assistance, that is the poorest section of the farming community, will be exempt.  Those without a taxable income will pay £2 per week, perhaps no more <Col N="1980" /> than the price of a packet of cigarettes. Those who have a taxable income will be phased gradually into the system.  All in all, there are no fair grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>The issue of taxation equity has been a dominant issue in politics for as long as I have been a Member of this House, since 1969.  There is no other issue in public life which has produced so many promises, combined with so little action. The Minister for Finance, therefore, is to be particularly congratulated for devising and introducing a real measure of reform in these difficult times.  We have not just spoken about it, we have taken the necessary action which is so important at present for tax equity.</P>
    <P>It is universally accepted that the present system of assessing and collecting income tax from the self-employed is an ungainly patchwork.  In particular, the unsatisfactory system which required inspectors of taxes to estimate tax liability is being tackled at long last.  The new system will place a responsibility on the taxpayer to make returns and pay tax accordingly.  The Revenue Commissioners will be able to concentrate staff resources on dealing with evasion. By getting away from the system of estimating assessments automatically, the staff of the commissioners will be relieved of a major administrative burden.  Taxpayers themselves, at least those who submit returns, will be able to keep their affairs up to date.</P>
    <P>Income tax evasion is a major source of inequity in Irish society.  It is often regarded as a victimless crime.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Everyone who dishonestly avoids carrying his share of the tax burden automatically increases the load being borne by his fellow citizens.  The reforms initiated in this budget are to be welcomed as a long overdue step towards re-allocating the necessary costs of providing the public service which we all take for granted on a fairer basis.</P>
    <P>Owing to the stringency with which the Minister for Finance has had to allocate <Col N="1981" /> the resources at his command it has not been possible to implement the recommendation of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector as regards the pay of our top management people.  The problem of determining pay levels for public servants and the Defence Forces, particularly those occupying very senior positions, is always difficult to solve.  Obviously the public service needs quality managers now as never before and I should hate to think that because they perceive their pay-scales drifting as against their peers in the private sector morale would be reduced and that we might encounter a brain drain out of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Now as in the past, senior public servants have shown great patience with regard to their own remuneration levels and simply get on with the job.  It is not, however, possible to implement the findings of the Gleeson report immediately for the reasons already indicated.  I would, however, like to assure the public servants concerned that their patience is appreciated and to reiterate what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance has already stated &mdash; that the recommendations will have to be grappled with at some stage.</P>
    <P>As regards my own Department, I am pleased to be able to record in the financial year 1987 we were able to show a saving of roughly £8 million or 3 per cent of the total budgeted in the Vote for Defence for the year, and we expect to get through the year 1988 on the same order of expenditure.  Noteworthy recent developments have been the setting up of the Defence Policy Review Group whose deliberations should bear fruit later this year, the intake of new recruits in the period from the beginning of last November, and the placing of a contract for the purchase of new Austrian rifles to replace the old FN rifles which have been in service since 1961.  A special significance of this contract is that it provides for counter trading arrangements whereby substantial orders of Irish goods will be purchased by a subsidiary of the contracting company.  Córas Trachtála will handle <Col N="1982" /> the implementation of these arrangements. This represents something of a departure from the established pattern of Government supply contracts and the officials of both Córas Trachtála and my Department involved in the arrangements are to be complimented on their initiative and alertness.</P>
    <P>In future contracts in my Department will always include an element of counter trade which I think is essential and I am glad I initiated that in this contract.</P>
    <P>Among my Ministerial responsibilities one that is constantly to the forefront of my mind is that of accommodation for our soldiers.  In recent years, new billets with modern amenities have been built at a number of locations.  A programme of renewal and improvement is continuing. It is expected to have a contract for a new military barracks at Cavan placed imminently.  Renewal of existing billets will continue to have a high priority.</P>
    <P>It would be totally inappropriate if I did not refer to something that is in the forefront of everybody's mind at present, particularly those living in our capital city.  Our ever dependable Permanent Defence Force have once again stepped into the breach, this time to supply Dublin with a fire fighting capability in the absence of the regular fire fighting services occasioned by industrial action. I want to publicly pay tribute to the members of the Permanent Defence Forces who have participated recently by taking this added burden.  I want to compliment the officers and the men for the work that they are doing and, a Leas Cheann Comhairle, as a person living in this city you can feel happy that you are in safe hands.</P>
    <P>The burden of dealing with our economic problems is a heavy one.  It is being felt, to a greater or lesser degree, by every person living in this country.  The measures set out in the budget, while hardly surprising, will, inevitably, be criticised by some as harsh.  I can only say that it is childish to pretend that things could be otherwise.  When making decisions, the Government must pick from a menu of choices.  The menu is not <Col N="1983" /> ordered by ourselves.  The narrow list of options available to my colleague the Minister for Finance does not include any soft course of action which would enable him to avoid the current spending restrictions.</P>
    <P>The hard decisions being taken now provide a continuing basis for economic recovery in the longer term.  There will be no return to prosperity in the future unless we persevere with austerity now. After all is said and done, the medicine is not as unpalatable as many thought it would be.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Leonard for so graciously ceding way.  I am sorry that I must insist on the order and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity of contributing.  It is important in the debate on the budget that those who have a different view of it and who consider there is a better way to deal with the economics and order of this country should come into the Chamber and be heard as clearly and as forcibly, although perhaps not as often, as we hear from the benches of conservative economics the plaudits and the praise that have been poured on the Minister and his Government in introducing what can only be described as yet another of the very strong anti-working budgets that have been introduced here <i>seriatim</i> over the <Col N="1984" /> years.  It is very important that those who say there is an alternative, those from the Left, those who reject Right wing economics and who seek to defend the interests and the economic lives of working people, should do so forcibly and clearly in the House.</P>
      <P>In the last two weeks we have listened to contributors from the so-called Opposition, Fine Gael, say that they support and seek a fairer deal for the less well off but at the same time they support in principle, and by their refusal to engage in serious Opposition politics, the very swingeing cutbacks included in the budget.  It is the duty of the Opposition, as represented by the voice of those who speak on behalf of working people, to point out that this budget is full of pitfalls, is full of short comings and, at the end of the day, will represent no real advance for the majority of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that must be addressed in the context of the budget is that it is set strongly in the economic gospel of the previous Coalition Government and of this Government in the first year of their term, in the approach to solving our economic problems based on cutting back. That cutback approach is an entirely selective one.  It is asking only a sector of Irish society to accept less and at the same time demanding that they pay more.  It is saying to working people, who pay PAYE tax at a level of contribution not equalled by any other sector of our community, that, having paid up as generously and as faultlessly as they do, they must accept less by way of benefit and return.  It must be stated again and again that 90.3 per cent of income tax collected comes directly from the pockets of PAYE working people.  They have paid for their services; they have made their contribution and they have done everything in their power to ensure that this country gets back on its feet economically.  They have had no part to play in the abysmal failure of Government economic policy over the decades.  It is not their fault that we have upwards of 250,000 people unemployed and that upwards of 35,000 per annum are forced to emigrate and to bring their talents and education elsewhere. <Col N="1985" /> The fault for unemployment and for the fact that the Government have led our economy to the precipice rests squarely on the shoulders of those who have sought to impose Government decisions on our people.  For that reason The Workers' Party reject the notion of cutbacks on those people who have no part to play in and are not to blame for the economic problems facing us and who have paid fully and dearly for the services of a social nature to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>We would certainly consider at any stage a package of cutbacks in the benefits to large farmers, of cutbacks in grants of an unlimited nature to private bankrupt industry that seems to get nothing back but handouts and support from each successive Government.  We would look at those types of cutbacks constructively and critically and we would look to see whether they would produce the kind of innovation, development and reform in our economy that is necessary to try to get this country back to work.  We are absolutely opposed to this approach of Government of forcing those who have no blame to carry and who have paid in full to carry the full weight of cutbacks in services and more importantly a cutback or drop in real incomes.  No matter how a Government dress up the proposals in this budget in relation to incomes the reality is that in a short period it will come home to all and sundry that it represents, in its totality, an invasion of real incomes.</P>
    <P>Wages, or the spending power of wages, will have been seen to have dropped as a result of these budgetary provisions. When all of the indirect taxes introduced in the budget come home to roost, have been implemented on foot of the Finance Bill to be pressed, then the reality will be brought home to people &mdash; that this utterly inadequate gesture to PAYE reform will have been annulled, if by nothing more than the imposition of VAT on ESB charges.  This matter was put squarely to the Minister in the short debate that took place late on the day of the introduction of the budget.  He was asked on what basis, on foot of what <Col N="1986" /> authority could he, or his Government, impose a reduction of charges on the ESB.  The Minister spoke about the climate being right for a reduction in charges comparable with the increase brought about by the imposition of VAT, arguing that there would be a levelling out of cost to the consumer.  I contend that the ESB will not reduce their charges but rather will seek to increase their charges on account of this imposition of VAT.  I contend that that will wipe out any advantage to working people of this so-called gesture to tax equity and the widening of the band of the basic rate of income tax. Certainly it will put at nought the increased social welfare payments announced in this budget.  It should be remembered that the recent increases in CIE charges alone will seriously erode any meaningful increase in payments under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The whole swing of cutbacks affecting working people must cease.  Before the end of this debate the Government must give a clear undertaking that Circular 20/87 with regard to cutbacks in staffing in education will not be re-introduced in the summer months.  The clear indications are that the Minister intends &mdash; under the planned campaign seeking to improve the Taoseach's directive of June last to cutbacks in spending in the Department of Education &mdash; to re-introduce this circular, imposing its provisions in the summer months when schools are closed, parents are on holiday and public representatives are unavailable.</P>
    <P>The proposed cutbacks in the health area must not be made.  The Minister for Health has indicated that he does not intend closing any more hospitals in 1988. I welcome that declaration but what has not been made clear is whether, as a result of the cutbacks in the budgetary allocations to the various health boards, the health boards themselves can avoid the closure of hospitals within their areas of responsibility.  Viewing the trend of services generally in the health area I predict that hospitals will be closed in 1988, that we have not seen the end of these closures.  The district and regional hospitals system is currently under attack <Col N="1987" /> in a manner never encountered before. Therefore I contend, despite the Minister's assurances that he will not take any decision, that hospitals will be closed in 1988.</P>
    <P>I might applaud the campaign spearheaded by Deputy Sherlock in Cork North-East in defence of Mallow Regional Hospital.  I would say to all those persons concerned that the axe will fall on their hospital in time to learn a lesson from the unified campaign in Cork which, at the end of the day, led to the remarkable position of one person only taking the side of management in favour of the closure of Mallow hospital.  I contend that the campaign to fight and defeat the programme of closures, intended directly or indirectly by the Minister for Health, can be successful where the will of the people is brought to bear on the matter.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in social welfare payments and social services generally must cease.  The Minister for Social Welfare, my fellow constituent Deputy, must be made answerable for the review of the policing of social welfare he has advised under the begin description of Job-search. I contend this scheme is not one of searching out jobs, that there are no jobs there.  Not one new job has been created by this Government since assuming office.  Rather it is a scheme to hound and harass beneficiaries under the social welfare code.  It is not difficult to see how Fianna Fáil featured so well in recent opinion polls.  In this one area one can see how the whole purpose and direction of this scheme has been so misrepresented by Government &mdash; has been taken up so unquestionably by media commentators &mdash; when the slightest investigation or inquiry into how the scheme is operating could only lead people to the conclusion that what is happening is that the figures are being contrived to make it appear that there are real gains and savings being effected.</P>
    <P>Within my constituency in recent weeks &mdash; since the full brunt of this scheme has been brought to bear on people &mdash; there have arisen an enormous number of hardship cases, with utterly <Col N="1988" /> ridiculous decisions being taken which help to demonstrate that this scheme does not constitute a serious effort to encourage people to work but rather to hound them out of their entitlements under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I might quote the instance of a woman constituent denied sick benefit since mid-1987 as a result of a ruling of the Department that she is fit for work despite the fact that she is currently having physiotherapy treatment in Beaumont Hospital on account of a back injury.  Her work is in the area of print and involves much strain and manual effort.  Clearly she is unable and unfit to take up those duties at present.  The Department, despite medical evidence and records to the contrary, have insisted she is fit to return to work and, as a consequence, have terminated her entitlement to sick benefit. There is another married woman in my constituency who until recently had a working record of upwards of seven years.  She has now sought to return to work.  She signed on, sought her entitlement but the Department ruled immediately that she was unavailable for work. Within a week of that ruling that woman took up a job in a local factory.  She is a mother of two whose husband is unemployed. Yet, despite her long record of work and of a clear indication that she was interested, willing and capable of working, the Department &mdash; against all evidence &mdash; ruled that she was unavailable for work and rescinded her entitlement to benefit.  I have no doubt that that case appears in the Minister's records, as does the previous one I gave, of somebody seeking to defraud the system, whereas she is someone who, because there was a ruling to the contrary, lost her entitlement to benefit over a period of weeks, leading to months.  I have no doubt but that those cases will comprise part of the huge savings about which the Minister speaks.</P>
    <P>Those are the kinds of decisions being taken under the general provisions of the Jobsearch programme in order to produce what are unreal figures and indications that the Government are seriously doing something about social welfare recipients or beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>The issue of adult literacy teachers working without pay due to financial shortages has not been raised with me or my Department.  The vocational education committees are at present being informed of their allocation for 1988, and arrangements are now being made to make the payments to them.  I have no plans to change the present arrangements for providing adult literacy courses.  The VECs have the primary role in providing adult education, including literacy and community education.

      <P>Can the Minister advise when she anticipates that the final budgetary allocations for VECs will be fixed?  I am surprised to learn she has not been made aware that the budget for adult literacy throughout the country, and for Dublin in particular &mdash; I am concerned with Coolock &mdash; expired in December 1987.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to do so but it appears the Minister has not been made aware of the situation.  Since January all the workers in the adult literacy scheme are without wages and until the VEC make the allocation, they have no income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I might have read my answer too quickly, but I said the vocational education committees are at present being informed &mdash; today and tomorrow &mdash; of their allocation for 1988. That answers the point raised by the Deputy.  Admittedly the allocation was made on 6 April last year because there was a change of Government and the budget was being introduced.  As I said, over the next few days, the vocational education committees will be informed of their allocations for 1988.  The Deputy said he was referring to the city of Dublin.  We have been in touch with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and they tell us it is not true that literacy teachers in their area are working without pay.  These teachers do not start until late January.  We told the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee on 29 January that they would get at least the same allocation as that given in 1987 for literacy and community education, and they have informed us that they have acted on this information.  There is a letter on the way from the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to school principals telling them of their provisional allocation for 1988.</P>

      <P>There is obviously a breakdown of information between the Department and myself, having been at a local meeting recently when we talked to people on the ground.  However, I am glad the Minister's action has led to a resolution of the matter.  May I ask about the future of adult literacy?  Would the Minister indicate if at some stage she would make a statement either in the House or elsewhere about what the future holds for people involved in adult literacy courses?  The allocation is provided for this year but there is a major problem at ground level for people planning the development of these courses and trying to work towards the future because there is no clear indication of the Minister's intentions towards adult literacy and its eventual integration into the education system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a very interesting question.  The previous Government allocated a sum for adult education and literacy and community education to be spread over three years. That sum has been exceeded and the end <Col N="1992" /> of that global allocation was reached last year.  Despite very stringent circumstances, we have been able to provide the same amount this year.  In general, the adult education community workshops and other groups will, within the next few weeks, know their allocations. I was very interested to see the Aontas report &mdash; the Coolock report &mdash;<i>Live and Learn,</i> a copy of which was sent to me.  My Department will be undertaking a review&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the financing of such projects, particularly in view of the fact that we want to see what has been done to date.  We have given a research grant to the IVEA to undertake research in the area of work already carried out in adult literacy.  The results of their findings will be available to me very shortly.  The purpose of the project is to establish the effectiveness of the use of those funds provided for adult literacy and community education, and when that is done, we will quantify the results.  We want to see if the considerable amount of money we are providing is being spent in the right way.  The project undertaken by the IVEA and funded by us should give some very valuable information.  That answers the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I agree there is a need for the constant evaluation of the provision, the way the provision is allocated, the type of courses and the type of allocations made in the area of adult education, because new needs are constantly emerging as environmental changes occur, particularly work patterns, return to work, redundancies and so on.  These matters will evoke a greater need for adult education as time passes.</P>

I am glad we went to the Minister for Finance and got the money back.  One of the savings is on uneconomic maintenance costs.  I know there is a grave problem about to arise in the school transport service as the school buses reach the end of their useful life.  They are very old, some of them in their late teens, which for a bus is very old.

In view of the very high standard in medical education offered by all the Irish medical schools and the great difficulties they are all experiencing now because of the cutbacks with which universities have to deal, has the Minister considered discussing with the Higher Education Authority and the medical schools the question of a co-ordinated programme of attracting students from other countries outside the EC who are very keen on the kind of medical training in this country in order to subsidise the training which these schools are finding it very difficult to give because of the difficult economic climate?</P>

Their terms of reference will be to recommend the manner in which decisions should be taken about the desirable level of provision in particular disciplines or faculties within the overall total and they will take that consideration on board.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's information.  Will the people coming to the medical schools from other countries be paying approximately £8,000 or £10,000 per year, which is the full economic cost, for medical education?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is necessary for a country of 3.5 million people to have five medical schools? Given the Government's commitment to rationalisation of services, will it be necessary to rationalise some of the medical schools?  Will the Minister agree that we are educating at least 150 doctors more per annum than we need?  Given that the cost of educating these students is running at about £10,000 per annum, will she agree that this is a waste of public expenditure?</P>

      <P>The process of rationalisation appears to be desirable one day to the Progressive Democrats and not to be so the next day.  I have no proposals to close any of the medical schools or to take steps to reduce the number of doctors.  I will qualify that by saying that we have set up an inter-departmental committee which, significantly, includes Health within its component Departments who will be contributing to the committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the action, if any, she proposes to take following the findings by the ESRI report on streaming in Irish schools published on 2 December 1987 that the practice was harmful educationally, particularly to slower and more disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To stream or not to stream is not a simple issue: there are variations on the practice that make it <Col N="1999" /> more or less defensible educationally depending on one's ideological standpoint. The crudest form of streaming segregates those deemed to be the most able from the rest for all subjects from the start of post-primary schooling.  The obvious objection to this form of streaming is that it labels pupils as underachievers, with consequent effects on their self-esteem, if they are classified as belonging to the second stream or in a larger school to the third or fourth streams.  However, streaming can be modified depending on the size of the school, the participation rates for different subjects, the availability of appropriately qualified teachers and other factors.  Streaming in sophisticated form, &ldquo;setting&rdquo;, allows pupils to study their chosen subjects at the level and pace best suited to their abilities and interests.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the organisation of classes is not possible on the basis of a prescriptive formula because of the imponderables already mentioned, it is a matter for the schools to decide the best possible arrangements for their own pupils.  A &ldquo;mixed ability&rdquo; arrangement is often more an aspiration than a reality and, in any case, ability is not the only criterion that impinges on pupil success or failure.  Indeed the motivation and application of less than brilliant pupils often enable them to outshine the intellectually more favoured.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances and to answer the question posed by Deputy Barnes, I would consider that my Department's role in relation to class organisation in such a contentious area should be advisory rather than prescriptive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, I did not want a long lecture.  It was quite a simple question.  Can I ask the Minister is she not aware of the fact that the ESRI report by the very respected Professor Damien Hannon found that there was a 25 per cent error in Irish schools which stream students?  Is she aware that this error then arranges students in classes where they are precluded from going to third level and <Col N="2000" /> where they cannot even take a modern continental language?  These students have the ability to do that.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister, in view of the serious findings of that ESRI report if she would undertake that her Department would look carefully at that research and report to this House, before the summer, on her findings about this report which affects every child in second level schools and every prospective child going into the second level system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI report is very worthy of consideration and my Department will undertake a very thorough evaluation of it.  It still boils down to the question: do you tell each school or do you globally tell the schools of Ireland what they should do, bearing in mind that the school manager or the <Col N="2001" /> school principal of the particular post-primary school will know in his, or her, mind the best situation to fit his, or her, pupils as the occasion demands.  That is the question whether you lay down the law or whether you act in a prescriptive capacity.  To answer the last question which the Deputy raised, it is a complex and not a simple question.  The ESRI have done a great service by publishing it.  It is one that everyone interested in education should read thoroughly and it is one that I intend to have studied within my Department very thoroughly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of schools which have been categorised as disadvantaged; the criteria used in classifying schools as <Col N="2002" /> disadvantaged; the additional resources which are made available to disadvantaged schools; and if the implementation of Circular 20/87 would affect the pupil-teacher ratio operating in disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 168 schools have been assisted to date through a programme of special educational measures for schools serving disadvantaged areas for which a special fund was initiated in 1984.</P>
      <P>In selecting schools to participate in the programme many educational, social and environmental factors are taken into account including the following: (1) high-levels of truancy and behaviour disorders; (2) discipline problems; (3) evidence of poor application, impaired reading and maths understanding; (4) home factors such as parental problems, poor quality of home life, lack of interest; (5) high unemployment and material poverty; (6) crime and vandalism; (7) lack of community support; and (8) poor standard of accommodation.</P>
      <P>The main benefits which the individual schools receive through the programme are: (i) special grants for books-materials (ii) the sponsorship of home-school-community liaison initiatives (iii) in-service training for the teachers concerned (iv) provision of curricular materials and (v) the supply of educational assessment materials.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a scheme for providing additional teaching assistance to primary schools serving disadvantaged areas.  A total of 79 schools throughout the country are included in this scheme at present.</P>
      <P>In the allocation of posts, factors taken into account include the disavantaged nature of the area, the number of pupils and the level of staffing, and any particular problems or needs which may exist in each school.</P>
      <P>I have already announced that existing remedial posts will not be affected by the changes under Circular 20/87, nor will special posts in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister <Col N="2003" /> tell me in the list of criteria which she mentioned for the selection of an area or a school in an area which would be deemed disadvantaged if all the items listed must exist?  To what extent must an area be disadvantaged in order to qualify? While the Minister said in her reply that none of the special teacher assistance or remedial teachers will be affected by Circular 20/87, will the existing teaching staff in a school which is designated as being in an disadvantaged area be affected by Circular 20/87.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first question, the eight criteria which were listed, which should be taken into account, are included in general.  There is no specific blueprint as to whether the eight should be there or what element of the eight should be there.  They are based on information furnished and on inspectors' and principals' reports and visits to the schools.  They would not necessarily need to have the eight components but by and large they would include a majority of those in some shape or form depending on the region and the environmental factors.  On the Deputy's second point relating to remedial posts in the disadvantaged areas, particular teachers would not be affected but normal staff posts in such schools would fall.  Bearing in mind that the quota review is looking at each school, then that school would fall into that category too and it might be affected.  The remedial, the disadvantaged and special posts would not fall to be disturbed; the others would be up for review.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say that remedial posts would not be affected in disadvantaged schools. Can I take it that it is not because of Circular 20/87 that a school in a disadvantaged area which was promised a remedial and resource teacher in September last has still not been allocated Can the Minister tell us the reasons why a teacher has not been allocated to that school?</P>

      <P>Because I do not have the facts I cannot comment on any one particular case, but what I can say is that if a remedial teacher had been sought last September and has not yet been allocated this would not be due to Circular 20/87. I presume it is because the case is at present being considered within the Department and if the Deputy furnishes me with the details of the case I will have it looked into.</P>

      <P>An additional £6.5 million has been provided in the budget, which has been favourably commented upon by the Minister for Finance, for refurbishment and additions.  This application has been with the Department of Education since 1971.  It was approved in November 1985 and went to tender in June 1987.  In view of the fact that the area is an oasis of development would the Minister of State not agree that between now and the end of the year favourable reconsideration should be given to this particular project?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to say that the £6.5 million relates to both the primary and post primary school building programmes.  I am anxious that we proceed with this project.  Indeed, I have received numerous representations from Deputy Morley on this question. However, the difficulty at present is that with the scarcity of resources we must have as our priority the provision of classrooms rather than the provision of general purpose rooms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morley has not come into the House to support me on this question.  Over the past four years valuable elementary and basic extensions have been provided to both primary and post-primary schools, such as general purpose rooms etc., circumventing and by-passing much of the costly, bureaucratic and excessive red tape.  There are quite a number of unemployed tradesmen and small contractors in rural Ireland.  Additional consideration should be given to some new device which would enable these projects to go ahead at a far more basic cost and expeditious time factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy Higgins' sentiments in that respect.  It is important to point out that since the Minister and I came into the Department we have succeeded in making very significant cost reductions in <Col N="2007" /> the types of buildings which are now being put in place without any serious decrease in the quality.  We are continuing to look for every possible method by which we can reduce costs.  I agree with the Deputy that the suggestion he has made is a meritorious one and it is one we have examined within the Department. There are some difficulties with such a system but I can assure the Deputy that it is our intention to consider it further if it would mean we can put buildings in place at a lower cost.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there are probably 100 schools in the country which are in serious need of <Col N="2008" /> repairs.  I have admitted that fact since day one.  It is sad that that backlog has been allowed to build up.  Let me venture to suggest that part of the reason for this is because we have been building schools in recent years at a cost of between £200,000 and £400,000, with classrooms costing in the region of £40,000, and I am at a loss to understand how it cost that amount of money to build specific projects. The idea now is that we go more for buildings of simple design and good quality and try to redress the backlog.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at this school does not warrant the appointment of an additional teacher under the rules for national schools.  My Department have already advised the school board of management on the reorganisation of classes to avoid any class-groups of over 40 pupils.</P>
      <P>In answer to another point raised in the question it is worth noting that although the school is described in the question as a developing school it has not grown in pupil numbers or in the number of staff employed since September 1984.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that I received information in the last few days that there are 430 pupils on the roll of the school, thereby justifying the appointment of a <Col N="2010" /> temporary assistant teacher.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the school is in a disadvantaged area in Tallaght, has an unemployment rate of more than 60 per cent and that the people of the area face real problems?  Will the Minister accept that for those reasons the area demands special attention, apart from the fact that the school has sufficient pupils to qualify for the appointment of an extra assistant teacher?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The information in my reply was supplied to my Department and I cannot comment on what has happened in the last few days.  I must state that the school has not grown in numbers or in teacher staff employed since September 1984.  The school has applied for assistance under the special scheme for additional teachers for schools in disadvantaged areas and that matter is under consideration.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  When referring to schools in disadvantaged areas earlier the Minister mentioned some of the factors that are taken into account and I should like to remind her that in this area the unemployment level is more than 60 per cent and that the number of single parent families is about 35 per cent.  Will the Minister accept that the school should qualify under the special measures operated in the Department for disadvantaged areas?  If that is so, the appointment we seek could be made and I should like to ask the Minister to consider that seriously.</P>

      <P>The Minister has told us that pupil numbers have not grown in recent years but I should like to point out to her that there is a real problem in that area, and in other districts, where the grant for first time purchasers of new houses was availed of.  Those who were able to move out of the area by availing of that grant did so but now the position <Col N="2011" /> has been reversed, the school is growing and the principal can show that he expects more pupils this year and next year from the junior school.  Will the Minister accept that it is a growing school in a disadvantaged area?  Will the Minister commit herself to look at our request from that point of view?</P>

      <P>However, the facts presented to us by the principal of the school and entered on the school roll, which are definitive, indicate that since 1984 the school has not grown in either pupil numbers or in the number of staff employed.  We cannot get away from that fact.  However, I have noted the case made by the Deputy and I am aware how the £5,000 surrender grant led to many local authority tenants leaving their local districts to buy new houses.  The cessation of that grant has meant that more people are staying in their local authority houses. If the numbers are as the Deputy has outlined that information will be forwarded to the Department and I will consider it.</P>

It is not possible for caretakers in rural areas to travel long distances from one school to another.  In any event, as the Minister will agree, caretaking is a full-time occupation in all schools.

      <P>Because of the pressure on the capital funds available in 1988 to my Department for their national schools building programme, I would not be in a position to sanction finance for the provision of the extension proposed to Baconstown national school, County Meath.  This project envisaged the extension and adaptation of the existing school building whereby four classrooms and a general purposes area would be provided. I can inform the Deputy, however, that recent discussions took place with representatives of the school during which a lesser scheme designed to cater for the immediate accommodation needs of the school was suggested.  The proposal is being examined by my Department's professional advisers and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities in due course as to whether it may be possible to proceed for grant purposes along the lines of the modified scheme, and whether finance is likely to be available for it during the current financial year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the reason she decided to exclude those teachers at present on career breaks from the recent offer of early retirement-voluntary redundancy; and if she will consider making that offer available to some or all of those teachers so affected who would now wish to avail of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if the voluntary redundancy scheme for teachers is available to teachers on unpaid leave of absence but working overseas without a condition that they must return home and obtain a teaching post first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 59 together.  The early retirement-voluntary redundancy scheme is one which applies to the public sector as a whole.  The terms of the scheme preclude its application to members of the public service in any sector on career breaks or unpaid leave of absence, with the exception of those on unpaid sick or maternity leave.  This provision applies to members of the teaching profession in the same way that it applies to all other public servants.</P>
      <P>The voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme is in keeping with the Government's commitment to reduce public service numbers and will apply only to the extent that the number of excess teaching posts in the 1988-89 school-year cannot be eliminated by other means, such as natural wastage, redeployment and career breaks.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, this scheme is open only to serving permanent teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of cases where a teacher, or some other person in the wider public service, may be on leave of absence for a year or a certain given period and may now decide to leave the public service.  These people are not being encouraged to do so.  The teacher who has taken a year off for a very valid reason will have to go back to the school, appear to be in a full-time teaching position and then, if the package is still available, apply for it.  The point I am trying to make is that many younger teachers are unemployed and we should be encouraging existing teachers to take retirement if they wish to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that you have had correspondence about primary teachers.  The scheme applies to the public sector in general.  It is not that the Department of Education made a particular rule about career breaks.  Any man or woman on a career break from any sector of the public service is not eligible to apply for voluntary redundancy or early retirement.  There would be enormous difficulties in the case of teachers because a teacher on a career break of one year or more would have been replaced by another teacher on a temporary contract.  It would be invidious of any teacher to come back and tell the temporary teacher to go.  I am sure no teacher would wish to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley seems to be trying to steer through a problem that has become apparent in this area where a teacher presently on leave of absence must come back and take up a teaching post thereby depriving somebody else, perhaps a young teacher or a new entrant to the teaching profession, of a job in order to apply for the voluntary redundancy scheme.  That is entirely illogical given the number of unemployed teachers looking for work.  Will the Minister look at what Deputy Colley and myself are saying, that it seems illogical that somebody should take up a post, depriving somebody else of a post, in order to apply for this voluntary redundancy packet?  Perhaps the Minister will look at this and correspond with us?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since there are more applications for the redundancy package than are required, as a means of allowing for the employment of teachers who actually wish to teach, would the Minister <Col N="2020" /> consider allowing teachers into the profession instead of keeping them on the dole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought we had problems before Christmas, but another problem has now arisen in that there are twice and three times as many as anticipated seeking voluntary retirement.  Of course I will consider all the correspondence which comes to me on the matter.  However, the public sector voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme clearly envisages that teachers or anybody else on a career break will not be eligible and that a person must be on active service before an application can be considered.  I will certainly consider and answer any correspondence addressed to me.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the steps she proposes to take to make it possible for principals of second level schools to offer (a) German and (b) Spanish as a language option to students in the school year commencing September 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in this regard is that my Department recognises German and Spanish as approved subjects on the school curriculum and has prescribed syllabi for them at intermediate and leaving certificate levels. However, as German and Spanish are not compulsory subjects, it is a matter for the school authorities to include them among the subjects they offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School authorities are naturally responsive to local needs and interests in their curricular provision provided that the number of pupils involved would justify the introduction of a subject.  In this regard I recently attended a symposium held, at my request, by the National <Col N="2021" /> Council for Curriculum and Assessment about the place of German, Spanish and Italian in the second level curriculum. Approximately 100 people were involved in the seminar including language teachers, school managers, representatives of CII, CTT, EC, the embassies and the cultural institutes.  I am awaiting a report from the Council on its findings in relation to the issues involved and I will then consider what steps can be taken on achievable objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are approved courses and that there are syllabi for German and Spanish, but the Minister will also be aware of the increasing demand from every sector for the provision of more modern language teaching in our schools.  I have no doubt but that the Minister will respond to that demand as quickly and as actively as anyone else in education.  With that in mind does the Minister know how many teachers are qualified to teach German, Italian or Spanish?  It is necessary to have that information if we are to make any progress in that field.  Is the Minister prepared to actively intervene and ask school principals if the time, 43 per cent of the total, spent at primary and post-primary school levels for language acquisition, is being well spent or if it could be better spent by the inclusion of different languages combined with modern methods of language teaching, because a number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has asked me a long question and has told me that I am to give a short answer.  That is a new way of dealing with parliamentary business. I recognise that the question put is extremely important.  Indeed, Deputy Hussey has another question on an aspect of that. This was one of the issues prevailing when I came into the Department of Education. Earlier Ministers also expressed concern about this, so much so that I was determined to try to get a momentum going. The public recognise quite clearly that if we are to go anywhere in our dealings with Europe, we will have to be fluent in other languages such as German, Italian and Spanish, as well as French.  I told Deputies about the seminar.  The Council for Curriculum and Assessment are coming back to me with objectives arising; industry has said they will help financially and the cultural institutes and the EC are preparing ideas for me whereby perhaps as a subsection of ERASMUS there may be some way in which we can link into programmes.  I am considering intervention in schools which show that they have a need and can accommodate this sort of thing in their curriculum.  New course committees have been set up in languages.  They are currently being established by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. As a further measure I have authorised substitution pay for teachers who act on the various course committees.  I have asked the linguistic institute to prepare draft materials for German, Italian and Spanish as they have done so successfully with the Salut scheme in French.  There is movement but I share the Deputy's anxiety.  I welcome from around the House the various commitments and <Col N="2023" /> expressions of support for such a movement. I am determined to move along with it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education her views on whether the present allocation, of more than seven times the financial and teaching resources to English and Irish than to modern continental languages by her Department, is unsatisfactory in view of the impending full economic integration of the EC by 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish and English as the two national languages are naturally studied by almost all pupils.  They are both compulsory subjects at junior cycle and Irish is compulsory in the senior cycle.  On the other hand, modern continental languages are optional subjects. In the event, they have achieved very high participation rates.  In junior cycle approximately 170,000 study a modern continental language as compared with about 207,000 studying Irish and English. The figures for senior cycle are approximately 67,000 and 100,000, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, as Deputy Hussey will well know, do not allocate resources to particular subjects: the material and human resources involved in any subject area are determined by the number of pupils taking the subject.  It is therefore quite misleading to say that the Department of Education allocate to English and Irish more than seven times the financial and teaching resources they <Col N="2027" /> assign to modern continental languages. It is disingenuous to include expenditure on the provision of English and Irish at primary level to show an overall disproportion between spending on the national language and on foreign languages.</P>

      <P>That is an extraordinarily unsatisfactory answer.  We have had intimations of meetings with the Taoiseach and promises of post-primary reviews. There have been 12,000 people descending on Athlone to protest against the new pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1.  The Minister was asked if she would confirm that a review of post-primary education is to be initiated by her Department.  She was asked if she would give details of the <Col N="2029" /> funding allocated for the work of that review.  She was asked if the new pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 would be enforced before that review was completed. Would the Minister now tell us if there is to be any review of the post-primary sector, if the Taoiseach has met the unions to discuss that issue and if a 20:1 pupil-teacher ratio in the vocational community comprehensive sector is to be enforced?</P>

      <P>What happened the Deputy in her questioning was that she galloped on as if she knew the answer to the first question.  The Taoiseach and I have not met with any post-primary teaching unions.  These unions have requested such a meeting and I am of opinion that such a meeting will be facilitated in the near future.  That leads one to make assumptions about further measures.  I am aware that a number of people, not 12,000, were in my native town and brought great business to that town while they were there.</P>

      <P>The traders of that town were delighted with themselves.  I am going to have all the fishermen there on Saturday also.  The Government intend to move to equalisation of teacher provision at second level, a move that Deputy Hussey herself initiated in her term of office when she instructed VECs to move between a band of 17 to 19 and arrive at 19 as quickly as possible.  I hope that in the years ahead the equalisation will be downwards, particularly when the demographic trend would show that.  A review has been mooted by the teachers' unions, but we have yet to meet them formally, either in the Department of Education, or in conjunction with the Taoiseach.  I am sure that meeting will be facilitated in the near future.  Again &mdash; this is a leap in the dark &mdash; perhaps such an issue would be raised at that meeting. As regards a formal written request to <Col N="2030" /> me or to the Department, such a meeting has not yet been sought.  When it is sought, I hope that it will be facilitated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I had sought to give instances of cases where clearly it can be shown that this vaunted claim of the Minister for Social Welfare that he was clearing out many thousands of people from the social welfare scheme was not a real achievement in itself.  I tried to illustrate the fact that what he was doing was harassing and hounding people who were otherwise entitled to benefit.  I talked about the married woman who is currently attending hospital for serious back injury and receiving physiotheraphy but who, for some reason or other, has <Col N="2078" /> been found by the Department to be fit for work.  There was another instance of the housewife with seven years' work experience who had been deemed unavailable for work but, within seven days of that decision being made by the Department, she was in a new job busily working as she had always intended.</P>
      <P>There is also the series of incidents in the Howth area, within my constituency, where in one week alone upwards of 15 people were told that they were not available for work, all men of working age, all of whose surnames, remarkably, began with the letter M, picked out of the scheme at random but by design and told that they were not available for work and consequently were not entitled to benefit on the current week.  Among them was a 21 year old who, from the age of 15 years, has been signing on religiously with Manpower in the hope that something will be done to help him find work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is this decision arrived at?  It appears that the Department of Social Welfare have been told by the Minister that if people living on the north side of the city do not cross the Liffey and knock on doors of factories on the south side of the city &mdash; which are full and do not have work for them anyway &mdash; and get signed there these meaningless pieces of paper saying that there is no work available, if they do not spread their net of inquiry wide enough, they are not seriously looking for work.  People who live in the Howth area want to work in the Howth area, and it is their entitlement to do so. People who live on the north side of the city want to work on the north side of the city.  We have an atrocious transport system with high, and rising, CIE fares. To expect people who are unemployed, receiving the minimum level of payments and who are living below the poverty line or close to it, to spend every penny they get bussing around this city to meet some arbitrary decision of the Minister that unless they travel about and beyond their immediate catchment area they are not seriously seeking work is too much. These people are looking for work.  They are victims of a Minister who wants to present to the public an image of doing <Col N="2079" /> a good job in regard to social welfare. Everyone of those people deemed not available for work is immediately transferred onto this great list of people who are supposed to be defrauding the social welfare system &mdash; not entitled is equated with defrauding.  While these people try to scramble back, through the appeals system, to some degree of normality and rationality, the moneys they would have been paid are deemed as savings by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Minister makes no reference to what the Department of Health must pay out to people who come to the assistance officer in the interim to look for help until reason can be brought to bear on their individual cases.  No effort has been made to work out the number of people who leave the social welfare scheme as a result of natural wastage, as a result of death, emigration, finding employment and otherwise.  In referring to the 35,000 people placed through Jobsearch, the Minister makes no acknowledgement that the National Manpower Service managed to place upwards of 25,000 people in jobs.</P>
    <P>So the achievements of this great scheme are minimal compared to the hardship and harassment being visited on people who, through no fault of their own, are compelled to look to the State for a basic modicum of income.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister has not realised what he is doing with this Jobsearch scheme and has not made some effort to address the wrongs of it.  There is no justification for what people are put through doing needless, pointless courses of training for jobs that do not exist.</P>
    <P>In a debate of this kind the other major issue that The Workers' Party would underline is that the only way we will put right the figures in the national economy is by creating jobs.  The Government say the only serious way we can address our national debt is by creating the right climate to get the many thousands of unemployed people back to work.  It is the only way we can get this country back to a meaningful level of existence.</P>
    <P>Jobs must be created and this will not <Col N="2080" /> be done by the Government creating the right climate for private investment to come in and put money into the economy to create jobs and build factories.  It has never happened in the history of this State that the private sector has shown the kind of commitment necessary to ensure anything approaching the generation of wealth necessary to create jobs or full employment here, despite all the incentives, all the protection barriers, all the schemes of Government.  Private investment has never seriously created the programme of jobs necessary to meet our national needs.  There is absolutely no reason to believe that things will be any different in the future.</P>
    <P>Have the Government any indication, good, bad or indifferent, from the private sector that they have done so much for in the last number of decades by giving them every conceivable grant, aid and support that they like what the Government are doing in regard to the hand-outs, the let-off from tax and PRSI in the budget, and that they will now call in the huge resources invested abroad in banks and elsewhere and put it into putting this country back to work?  Has there been any indication of that?  Surely it is time that private sector business and the captains of industry and banking let us know if they have a plan or any intention of responding to the over-generous packages handed out in this budget and in the last years?  Have the multi-national oil companies told us that they will now open up exploration of our natural resources by reason of the complete and utter sell-out by Government in 1987? Have we heard from private interests that we are now to get a viable shipping industry operating out of our ports, or are we to be left in the hands of international shipping interests to supply our imports and take our exports away from us at their whim?  The answer to that is no. There is no indication from the private sector that they are beginning to enjoy the climate the Government are creating.</P>
    <P>I feel safe in predicting that at the end of this year we will be in the same situation, with the Government still talking <Col N="2081" /> about the books getting into shape and the climate getting better.  But at the same time there is not one sign of one of those cowboys on the horizon coming to the aid of the beleagured working classes in this country.  We will still have as many people, if not more, unemployed on the dole or seeking the emigration boat and not one serious effort being made to create jobs.  The only way jobs can be created is by exploiting basic natural resources using State investment.  I make no apology for saying that.  If such investment involves borrowing abroad further we would say, do it.  There is no harm in extending borrowing provided the money is used productively to create jobs.  We are not afraid of this great national debt the Government talk about because, as it stands, of the £22 billion, upwards of £12 billion is domestically owed.  Our foreign borrowings amount to about £9 billion. There is room for expansion in our borrowing provided we spend the money on serious job creation.  One further job created is one more person creating wealth, one more person contributing tax to the revenue of the State and one person fewer who has to be paid social welfare.  It is only in this way that the Government will ever tackle the balancing of the books and get the climate right.  It is time to call a halt to the talk that by giving more handouts to private industry, to private sector investment, they are going to show the commitment that they have never shown and can never be expected to show in terms of commitment to this State.</P>
    <P>We talk about national resources, about land and its under-utilisation, about the need to industrialise our agriculture and to create jobs in rural areas for people who want to stay there and do not want to be forced into the urban areas or abroad on the emigration boat.  The scale of the investment necessary in land, in the housing construction area, in fishing and mariculture and in our natural resources, such as oil and other base metal investment areas, is so great that the private industry sector is not in a position to accumulate the capital necessary to do the work and to take the scale <Col N="2082" /> of risks necessary in that type of investment. There will be risks involved and nobody should be afraid of that.  We should develop agricultural industry and stop the myth that we are a food-producing nation.  We are a nation that has to import £80 million to £100 million worth of foodstuffs a year that we could so easily provide ourselves.  It galls me to see handouts and grants being given to the farming community who produce very little in return to the national economy and very little food which is required by our people in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>As a maritime nation it is unbelievable to think how undeveloped our fishing industry is.  In regard to the tourism industry, the notion that the private sector can ever succeed in realising the potential of our tourist industry is fallacious. We make no apology for saying that private companies do not have the capacity, the will, the resources or the courage to tackle seriously the creation of employment in this country.  Unless the Government use their wealth and borrowing and exploit the fundamental resources we have, we will never get beyond the level of debate at which we are today.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget to which I would like to refer is the maintenance of the bank levy, the raising of revenue from the huge profits of our major banks. I am a Deputy who believes the money raised should be greater but at least I welcome the fact that the measure is still there and has not been abolished, as was seriously considered by Government in the run-up to the budget.  I am particularly sore about one of the major banks at present.  All banks probably rank equal but in relation to one in particular, Allied Irish Banks, I have a special word to say in the context of this budget and the Minister's reintroduction and maintenance of the levy.  Allied Irish Banks have made a decision to close one of their branches, in my constituency in Edenmore, on the basis of rationalisation. They say they have too many branches making too much money in the north-east area.  The decision to close the Edenmore branch is particularly regrettable because <Col N="2083" /> it is the only branch in that shopping area. They have enjoyed a 20-year monopoly and now, in a year when they have made unprecedented profits &mdash; they made over £100 million in the previous year &mdash; they intend closing their doors and, I believe, sounding the death knell of the viable shopping community that exists in Edenmore Estate.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I thanked the Minister for Finance, in his absence, for having received me briefly in his office and for having taken a petition from me on behalf of the people of Edenmore.  I hope he can, through the status of his office as Minister for Finance, bring pressure to bear on the bank to reverse this very serious decision so that the doors of the Edenmore branch of Allied Irish Banks will remain open to the people beyond 9 April, the final day of reckoning.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer to the decision in the budget regarding the transfer from the Department of Finance of responsibility for rebate of import and excise duties on cars converted for use by the disabled.  This is a matter that has been raised by the Irish Wheelchair Association and by other organisations whose members benefit greatly from the rebate, given in return for the cost of having motor cars specially adapted for their use.  I accept what the Minister says that there is a great reason for transferring this responsibility to the Department of Health but one thing must be said: these motor vehicles are not just items of luxury for people such as the disabled or the people in need of this special facility; they are essential to them.  It is crucial that this transfer of responsibility does not represent any decrease in the level of subsidy from Government to the disabled. Given the recent history of the Department and the swingeing cutbacks that have been imposed by the Minister for Health throughout the service at all levels, and often without any serious regard for the repercussions for those down the line who have suffered as a result of the cutbacks, we would be extremely concerned that the previous <Col N="2084" /> level of consideration and concern given to individual cases and to the whole concept might not carry through if the Department of Health were dealing with the scheme.  On behalf of the persons concerned, I will take a special interest in this matter and will seek to ensure that there will be no diminution in the service to these people.  I understand the Minister for Health had a meeting recently with the representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I hope he will take on board the very many concrete and constructive recommendations they made to him to improve the scheme so that it will in no way be diminished or undermined.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the incredible campaign announced by the Irish Farmers' Association last week in answer to the Government's proposal for the first time to address in some part the non-payment of tax by that sector of the community to central Government.  They have said in their campaign that they intend to make clear their demand for tax equity in the system.  I am amazed to think that a sector of the community who pay so little to national resources for the development of services that they so ably benefit from, could seriously discuss the achievement of tax equity as a rallying call for their members in opposition to what Government propose and intend.  What the farming association were doing was calling to heel the majority of Members of this House who relied on the rural vote for their seat in this and the other Chamber, reminding them that they are their political masters, warning them that, unless they gave the campaign unequivocal support, they would bring their political pressure to bear on them.  Their demand for tax equity is cynical in the extreme. What is being proposed by the Government is a very modest proposition and goes nowhere along the road towards achieving tax equity.  I hope it will be a proposal implemented with the same full vigour and enthusiasm this Government have shown when pursuing the PAYE sector for their PAYE and PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> This budget has received much praise from the community as a whole but primarily from the business community.  I contend its provisions have not yet been reckoned with or fully realised.  When its provisions come to bite on the incomes and living standards of working people it will be seen clearly for what it is, another in a long series of budgets that has done little or nothing for working people and which will not contribute in any way to the creation of one extra job in our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general satisfaction on the part of the majority of Members of this House at the general thrust of the budget and its provisions. Also recent opinion polls have shown a favourable reaction on the part of the general public, reaction that was unique in its approval.</P>
      <P>Probably all of us would like to have seen other areas benefiting from those budgetary provisions; we all have our own views and beliefs in that respect but the general thrust of the budget was in keeping with the performance of the Government over the past 12 months, which was to rectify our ailing economy, reinstating some degree of reality in that respect.</P>
      <P>The two subjects mentioned most in any discussion on the budget or economy are interest rates and inflation.  Though only less than a year in office, the Government have created an air of confidence generally.  There is now an appreciation of the measures being taken to get our massive borrowings under control.  This is especially significant when one remembers that for many years industrialists, businessmen and farmers were fearful of expanding their activities because of the prevailing high interest rates, with inflation at one time running at a rate above 20 per cent.  The rate of inflation now is the lowest for 20 years which, with reducing interest rates, should encourage people to expand their activities again.  It is to be hoped that interest rates will fall further at an accelerated pace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> constitutes an important innovation <Col N="2086" /> which is to be welcomed.  It is to be hoped that its implementation will put a stop for all time to the annual confrontation and bargaining in that it constitutes an advance programme for the industrial and economic sector.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker was critical of the Jobsearch programme.  This has been a successful scheme.  Therefore it is difficult to justify such criticism in that it proved sufficiently successful to attract for interview 141,000 people.  The Minister has claimed that, within a short time of its operations, it realised in excess of 4,000 jobs.  The Minister stated recently also that there had been an additional saving of £22 million to the Exchequer on account of reduced numbers of people registering for the dole.  The most important benefit of that scheme was that it brought together the training and employment agencies of the State and the Department of Social Welfare in order to ascertain, for the first time ever, what could be done for the unemployed and job creation.  I believe it affords great potential for a continuance of an examination of proposals for the benefit of people on long-term unemployment assistance, in an effort to re-employ them.</P>
    <P>I was invited to attend one session in regard to the Jobsearch scheme in my area in order to discuss various projects with the people concerned.  At that time there was the proposed closure of a meat plant which they wanted to discuss.  They also wanted to discuss a number of programmes on which the Government had embarked in regard to afforestation and fruit and vegetable growing.  Rather than resent my presence, they seemed to be in a mood for discussion, hopeful that something would emerge from the provisions of that scheme by way of jobs, so that people would no longer be forced to remain on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>Another budgetary provision in the social welfare area is the imposition of PRSI contributions on the self-employed. This provision was introduced in the Six Counties in the early forties at which time conditions in regard to contributions and entitlements were similar to those now <Col N="2087" /> prevailing here, for example, being compulsory on farmers above a certain valuation. If one were to discuss the matter with self-employed farmers and others subjected to the provisions of that scheme in those earlier years one would find that they were satisfied with the system, especially its benefits, when they came to retire.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare is to be congratulated on the 11 per cent increase granted to the long-term unemployed. Many of those people have been unemployed through no fault of theirs but rather on account of the general economic position, or other factors, when they seemed to be facing a lifetime of unemployment.  It must be a traumatic experience for anybody to be unemployed for many years.</P>
    <P>There was general disappointment among politicians in my region that the Minister had not seen fit to grant some assistance to traders in immediate Border regions which, despite the measures he introduced last year, still leaves these traders with serious problems.  Indeed following on the announcement of that 1987 budgetary measure there were many people doubtful of its outcome.  Certainly the proviso that one had to remain outside this State for 48 hours put a stop to all coach tour parties, all organised groups, travelling to the North to buy goods. However, towns near the Border, within this nine miles-plus corridor, still experience a problem because people still find it worthwhile and are legally entitled to bring goods across the Border.  It has the effect, especially in the Cavan-Monaghan area &mdash; from Belturbet to Clones and on to Castleblayney &mdash; that all of the major towns in Monaghan and a number in Cavan located within that nine miles-plus radius continue to experience trading difficulties.</P>
    <P>If a close examination of the region was carried out, without much extra cost the schemes which are already in operation could do a lot for that area.  I mentioned this yesterday to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment because he introduced the urban <Col N="2088" /> renewal scheme to revitalise town centres and reactivate the industrial economy in areas with large populations.  Similar schemes properly introduced would be of great benefit in smaller areas.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government started the decline in 1983 when they imposed an exorbitant increase in petrol prices.  A study carried out by the Social and Economic Committee of the EC in 1982 found that that region was in need of revitalisation. They said that in their view this was a severely disadvantaged area. In future, planners and the Government agencies will have to look at these black spots and make special provision for them.  Special recognition should be given to these black spots under the international fund and the second programme for the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the re-introduction of the installation aid for young farmers.  The Minister for Finance realised the importance of this scheme when he re-introduced it.  To be eligible a person must have the necessary ACOT training, be under 35, have been practicising farming as their main occupation and have obtained full title to the farm.  In my view, farming has the capacity to provide many jobs in future, provided young farmers have the proper qualifications and initiative and that there is a proper economic climate for production.</P>
    <P>Milk production has been curtailed over the last few years and all the indications are that there will be a serious drop in the cattle herd.  Despite the measures introduced to increase cattle numbers they are lower now than when we entered the EC.  At that time there were approximately 6 million cattle, but those numbers have since fallen.  The processing side of the industry must have the most up to date plant and equipment to meet the stringent hygiene standards demanded by those countries which import our products.</P>
    <P>There is another area to which I would like to refer, and that is pig processing. This has been the subject of discussion over the last few months.  In 1986 there were one million pigs in Ireland but that figure has dropped drastically.  Monaghan, <Col N="2089" /> Cavan and north Cork are the three most intensive pig producing areas in the country.  In July last year one plant was closed in my area because of rationalisation and amalgamation, and the other plant, which employed more than 100 people, closed because of trading difficulties.  Now, seven months later, pig producers are transporting their pigs 30 or 40 miles every week to slaughtering plants.  The plants which closed killed only for the export market.  If they had cornered some of the home market they might still be in business.  I appeal to the Minister and the IDA to make every effort to ensure that there is a pig slaughtering facility in this area.</P>
    <P>There are proposals to establish slaughtering facilities in non-traditional pig producing areas.  The areas of north Monaghan and Cavan are traditionally pig producing with the potential to increase production.  In many cases there is the processing capacity but a shortage of pigs, but in this area we have the pigs and the plants are closing.  This has created a very serious problem.  The only hope for the future is that slaughtering facilities will be provided in traditional production areas which have the potential for future development.</P>
    <P>As regards cattle production, this is an area where we can provided extra jobs and boost the economy.  Irrespective of what is said about beef mountains, the cattle population in the EC has substantially dropped from 81,800,000 in 1984 to 76,740,000 this year.  As regards our cattle numbers, in 1986-87 there was a drop of 72,000 and from 1985-86 there was a drop of 480,000, despite a projection in 1973 when we joined the EC that our cattle numbers would increase to 9 million by 1990, levelling out to 10 million a few years later.</P>
    <P>The recent CBF report mentioned these figures but gave some very good news, that is, that the meat plants had increased their share of exports of beef on the hook from 82 per cent to 86 per cent; that processed and boneless beef exports increased from 55 per cent to 64 per cent; that Ireland's main export <Col N="2090" /> market, Britain, accounts for over one-third of our total exports; that vacuum-pack market sales rose by 42 per cent in volume to 20,000 tonnes and that continental EC destinations accounted for 20 per cent of total Irish beef exports.  There is an urgent need for a more professional approach to beef production through the formation of producer groups and they should have sufficient clout to negotiate on behalf of the producers.  The ridiculous situation which has operated over the last number of years in regard to prices going up and down should not be allowed to continue.  There should be a more organised and professional system which will be beneficial to the producers.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate Deputies referred to our road structures. While we are delighted at the recent allocation of funds for national, primary and secondary roads, we are faced with a very serious situation at county council level where the roads are deteriorating to an alarming degree.  Funding from the Exchequer has been substantially reduced over the last number of years in real terms and during that time there was a corresponding increase in demand for services within the local authorities who had to provide pollution officers, dog wardens and water control officers.  The 12 western counties received extra funds through the FEOGA aided regional water schemes.  There is a particular problem in road maintenance in County Monaghan due to the hilly terrain.  The area is also fairly heavily industrialised and heavy transport is required to carry poultry, pigs and mushrooms.  The county council do not have the money to carry out repairs to roads but money will have to be provided from some source, perhaps by way of a loan, before there is a further serious deterioration which would eventually mean that massive sums of money will be needed to repair the damage.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme and Jobsearch have been very successful.  The social employment scheme could be extended and used to very good advantage, not alone by local authorities but <Col N="2091" /> by groups of people co-operating in afforestation or other programmes.</P>
    <P>In County Monaghan there is a 24,000 square feet advance factory which was built ten years ago.  It is on the outskirts of Monaghan town and has never been occupied.  There is also a unit of three factories similarily unoccupied. At the time of currency changes in the EMS, I was approached by a number of manufacturers across the Border who were looking for accommodation to set up businesses.  I suggested to the IDA that they should divide up the large factory but I was told that, because of the way it was constructed and the services provided, it would not be feasible to do so.  They wanted it to operate as a single unit but this has not happened and is not likely to happen.  I discussed this matter with a contractor who said it could be converted very easily to facilitate decentralisation, about which so much has been said.  Various Departments should look into this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned tourism, an area which has great potential.  Over the last 12 months the Minister for Tourism &mdash; a colleague from my own constituency &mdash; has been very successful in this regard. There is a Border fund of practically £8 million, the sum of £4 million mentioned in the budget and an international fund from which a substantial amount of money will be provided for the development of tourism.  This could include water sports and an equestrian centre which would be beneficial to the area.  Parts of the region have been very successful in promoting and developing water sports and coarse fishing.  There are lakes in abundance and the requirement now is for accommodation, guest or farmhouse.</P>
    <P>The existing equestrian centre has done very well and there is a terrific demand for their services.  One man has 40 horses and seems to be fully booked for most of the year.  Previous Border funds provided a number of very useful developments such as Killykeen Park in Cavan and Lake Muckno in Monaghan. However, the lake has not been fully developed but I hope it will be completed <Col N="2092" /> soon.  We have continually lagged behind other countries in the development of our craft industries.  This area is a great attraction to tourists and provides much needed employment.  The IDA and Shannon Development made a breakthrough a number of years ago with the result that a number of jobs were provided in that region.  However, the IDA did not seem to show the same enthusiasm in the Border region although over the last number of years at the annual crafts and trade fair at the RDS I was very impressed at the fine range of goods on display.  This could be developed to great advantage.</P>
    <P>Allocations have been made from the international fund to tourism and, while it is independently administered, they do not have any technical or professional staff which would reduce administrative costs.  On the other side of the scale they are totally dependent on Government Departments for guidance.  They are the same Government Departments which guided the funding for the first fund and they did not do it on an even-handed basis.  During the discussion on the international fund I made the point that I hoped it would be distributed evenly irrespective of the regions, not by population, but by need.  I hope that that will be the criteria they will use now that they are in a position to dispense this fund.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised by others is the question of afforestration. It is another area for job creation.  It is another area for the development of our economy.  It has the added advantage that it is the one product of which we know there would be no surplus of production in the EC in the foreseeable future.  It is estimated that there will be a serious shortfall of 32 per cent for world supply by the year 2000 and that it will accelerate to be a serious problem in the following years.  In Britain there is a ready market because the United Kingdom imports 90 per cent of their wood requirements.  At present and to the end of the century they can supply only one-tenth of their needs. We should utilise our advantages because we have soil, climate and annual growth <Col N="2093" /> far in excess of most other EC countries. It is claimed that spruce and pine, which are the two softwoods most commonly grown, have a growth rate of 15 cubic metres per hectare as against 11 cubic metres in the United Kingdom and two to five cubic metres in the rest of Europe. The home grown supply is 25 per cent of the demand for construction softwoods of which we import about £50 million worth a year.  Our total wood product imports are about £400 million to £500 million.</P>
    <P>A scheme which was introduced under the programme for western development in 1981 did not get off the ground but over the last few years there has been a reasonably good take-up in most of the counties.  There is no doubt that the take-up will increase.  From 1981 to 1987 the take-up was about 5,600 hectares.  It has the capacity to provide jobs.  The IDA did a survey in the eighties on the needs of the sawmilling and processing capacity. They claimed that there was a surplus capacity but many of us find that it may not be in the proper regions.  In Cavan, Monaghan and part of Louth there is no processing capacity.  Much of the wood is moved across the Border for processing and then brought back as log timber for sale and various other timber products.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we develop our natural resources.  There is no doubt that if we had them properly developed we could provide many of the jobs which are needed at present.  The Government have laid the foundation for economic revival.  If we get the proper support, assistance and help from the people and from the private sector when the three-year programme is over, we should be in a much safer position in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a bland budget which proposes nothing radical, new or positive in relation to the major problems facing this country.  We all recognise the main problem which is the national debt.  All parties agree that that is a major problem and are prepared to do anything that would reduce it.  That is no longer an issue for debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2094" /> However, the major issues are that there are 250,000 unemployed people in this country and the taxation system.  On reading the Minister's speech, as he presented the budget to the House, I had hoped that there would be some radical proposals to tackle the major problem of unemployment.  I was very disappointed to find that not once in his entire speech did the Minister for Finance refer to unemployment.  Everybody in this House recognises the serious social problems accruing from unemployment.  Unemployment has a very serious, social and psychological effect on the population and yet the Minister for Finance did not see fit to address that problem once in his speech on the budget.  Neither did he refer to the serious problem of emigration.  Unemployment and emigration are intermingled.  The problems that emerge from emigration are even more serious because some of the most talented and well educated people are leaving.  The result is that there is a major brain drain which this country very badly needs given that it has so many serious problems.  The brains of this country should be applied to the problems of this country.  Unfortunately, the brains are leaving, which puts the future of this country at even greater risk.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the course of the Budget Statement of urban renewal and expansion of urban renewal programmes in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and other areas.  I welcome that proposal and indeed it was initiated by our Government three years ago.  I wonder if this Government have ever considered the necessity for rural renewal?  Does this Government recognise the serious problems arising in rural areas now?  Does this Government recognise that the young population in rural communities are being decimated and that it is only a matter of time until there will be very few people living in rural areas and particularly in rural disadvantaged areas? Could this Government not have put forward a programme for rural renewal in view of the decimation of the population in rural areas.  The recently published census proved that that is the case.  Since <Col N="2095" /> that census was taken the numbers have been more seriously depleted by emigration in recent times.</P>
    <P>Could this Government not have put forward a programme that would encourage rural people to remain living in rural areas and travel some distance to work by introducing some type of travel allowance or tax allowance on travel? This is a matter to which this Government should address themselves.  In rural areas many people are travelling to and from work but there is a tendency for them to gravitate to the towns or cities because they cannot afford the travel costs involved.  That is one aspect that should be considered with a view to retaining the population in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>In the disadvantaged areas this Government took a decision to reduce the off-farm income from £6,800 down to £5,400 in order to qualify for headage payments.  This is a retrograde step, that works against the rural community and against retaining people in the rural areas.  I urge the Government to reconsider that decision and to increase the off farm income limit once more.</P>
    <P>A lot of good work has been done since the previous Government introduced home improvement and reconstruction grants but there are still many houses in rural communities which need improvement. The Government should consider an extension of these grants with the rural communities in mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education's Circular 20/87 will have a detrimental effect on rural communities if implemented, particularly on two and three teacher schools.  If the Government were to consider a rural renewal programme this is a matter which should be taken into account.  The normal parameters which would apply to schools in larger areas should not necessarily apply to rural areas because of the geographical structure of the community.  There is a real need for the Government to consider putting together a rural renewal programme and <Col N="2096" /> I hope that whatever Government are in power will see fit to include this in the next budget.</P>
    <P>There is more and more a gravitational pull to the cities and larger towns and all of us in this House recognise many of the social problems which are developing as a result.  Many people from rural areas are not able to adapt to city life nor are they able to mentally adjust to that type of change.  Many major social problems have arisen as a result which have put a great strain on our social welfare and health resources.  There is a need for us to consider a programme which would retain more people in rural areas.  I accept that that goes against the European trend where there have been reductions in the rural population.  We do not have to imitate all of what happens either in Europe or in England.  For too long all we have done is imitate models which have proved to be anything but good.  We have never learned from the mistakes which other countries have made.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to tourism and said that it was widely acknowledged that the full realisation of Ireland's tourism potential requires new initiatives, especially in the marketing area.  Taking into account the recommendations of the tourism forum the Government have decided to introduce another package of special measures for tourism in 1988 and to allocate £4 million for this purpose.  With due respect to the Government and their performance in regard to tourism it would be wrong if I did not say that there is a major publicity campaign going on in regard to tourism. There has been a lot of talk and bandying about of figures but many of those who are involved on the ground are not too cheerful and have strong reservations about the strong publicity campaign the Government are carrying on at present.  Even the Taoiseach is being photographed at promotions but what has been the result of these promotions? How many jobs have been created as a result of these?  How much additional finance has been brought into the national coffers as a result?  I am very anxious to know the answers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> When the extra £4 million was announced it was never indicated that there had already been a £7 million reduction outlined in the Estimates.  In effect, therefore, there has been a reduction of £3 million on the allocation for last year.  It would be far better if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism implemented the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report rather than set up more task forces, committees and review bodies.  One of the features of the term of office of this Government has been the setting up of task forces, committees and review bodies.  There is an awful lot of talk but very little evidence of anything concrete happening on the ground.  Here, I am talking about the creation of more jobs and greater incentives to create jobs.  There is not much evidence of that in this budget.  I do believe there is great potential within the tourist industry but I am not satisfied with the approach being adopted by the Government.  In fact they are riding on the horse created by the previous Minister particularly in regard to the reductions in air fares which are attracting many of our emigrants to make visits home but which are not attracting as many tourists as one would have hoped for.  Therefore, far more constructive work has to be done on the ground.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, at this stage one would wonder whether we have any educational policy.  Has the Minister any overall view of what education should be setting out to achieve?  We have to recognise that there are many problems and that our educational system should be striving to solve these problems.  While we are members of the European Community we are very ill equipped to be part of that Community.  When people travel to the Continent they find out just how ill equipped they are.  Our European conterparts are fluent in at least three languages while we in most cases are only fluent in one language, English.  The Minister should immediately introduce a programme of foreign languages in primary schools and should make it compulsory that at least one foreign language is taught in all primary schools.  That is <Col N="2098" /> essential if we are to play our full part in the European Community in the future. From what I have heard from the Minister for Education both in the House today and on previous occasions there seems to be no serious thought in that direction.  I urge the Minister to treat this as a matter of urgency.  First and foremost many of our industrialists would be in a much more advantageous position when going abroad to conduct business if they were fluent in foreign languages.  Secondly, job opportunities exist in Europe. As can be seen from the demographic charts there is a more aging population in Europe than in Ireland.  There are possibilities for our young well educated people to obtain jobs in Europe.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House for giving me permission to raise this matter this evening.  It would be wrong if the Dáil, the national Parliament, could not discuss the very serious implications that arise from the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme which most of the nation watched in horror last evening. At the outset I should like to congratulate the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team for their courage in going ahead and showing that programme and for their courage in standing up to those who sought to intimidate them.  They have done the nation a great service.  Legal changes here generally come about because pressure groups of one kind or another lobby hard in a vociferous way in order to bring about reform.  If we had a lobby group to bring about reform of the whole area of criminal law I have no doubt that many of the people we watched on that programme last night would not be walking free in this city but would be in our prisons, where they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy who represents one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country I have to say that I am angry and frustrated at the kind of image that came <Col N="2099" /> across on that programme last night.  Perhaps, for many who take the view that everybody on social welfare is either lazy or defrauding the State or does not really care where the money comes from, last night's programme may reinforce in their minds that awful attitude.  It has been my experience that although there is some abuse of the social welfare system the vast majority of the 700,000 recipients are honest and decent people who turn to social welfare only as a last resort in order to survive.  It is a disgrace that our laws are in such a state that we do not seem to be capable of means-testing in an effective way people like Martin Cahill and his friends.  I have with me the <i>Guide to Social Welfare Services,</i> recently published by the Department of Social Welfare. Last night we saw that Mr. Cahill and some of the others on the programme are on unemployment assistance, £65 for himself and his wife, £27.10 for his three children &mdash; under the budget he will get an extra £6.70 &mdash; and he has a £5 fuel voucher.  I assume he has a medical card because if that is his means he qualifies for one.  He has a low rent on his corporation house in Swan Grove but yet he can have three cars &mdash; I wonder if they are insured and taxed; that did not come across last night &mdash; and a luxurious house in Cowper Downs and many other things.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that so many people are losing respect for our legal and judicial system when they watch an individual like him?  They must ask: &ldquo;What kinds of law do we have?  Why is our criminal law so archaic, and relevant only to the last century, that it cannot deal effectively with such people?&rdquo;.  The booklet produced by the Department of Social Welfare states that in order to qualify for unemployment assistance a person must have a qualification certificate which shows that person's means. It states that as the investigation of one's means could delay payment a person should apply for a qualification certificate in good time.  The criteria for qualifying for a certificate are outlined in that guide. The following are taken into account: the <Col N="2100" /> applicant's cash income; the value of any property the applicant has, but not the applicant's own home; the value of any investments and capital the applicant may have and, in the case of unemployment assistance or single women's allowance, the value of other benefits.  It appears that the individual I referred to has two houses.  The Swan Grove house is the house from which he applies for his social welfare assistance and, therefore, that house is not taken into account. However, the other house must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister not just to give us an assurance, as I understand he has already announced, that he will investigate the matter but to stop now payments to this individual because he does not qualify under the criteria laid down in the Department's booklet. Those payments should be stopped from today.  I want that individual prosecuted under the Social Welfare Acts for defrauding the system because he has announced himself that he was working for a private detective agency.  In addition, I want the Minister, as I have done, to get in touch with the housing department of Dublin Corporation and ask why that man &mdash; indeed, Mr. Dunne who is serving a sentence had a corporation house in Dolphin's Barn and a person suspected of the £1¼ million robbery of a security van at Fairview has a corporation house &mdash; can qualify for a local authority house.</P>
    <P>If our housing Acts allow us to house people on the basis of compassionate grounds, even if they do not otherwise qualify, then those Acts must be changed to allow us to de-house people if there are exceptional security grounds.  I suggest that Mr. Cahill and his friends use their local authority houses as a base to organise their crimes.  The people they get to do their dirty work for them can be sought from and trained in those local authority houses.  I want the corporation to investigate this matter.  If they do not have power under existing housing legislation, which they may not have, that legislation should be changed so that those people do not continue to qualify <Col N="2101" /> for housing, at great cost to the Exchequer, and at a time when so many people are homeless.  Next week in the House we will seek to have a Bill dealing with homeless persons printed &mdash; these genuine homeless must be our priority.</P>
    <P>We should look at a number of other matters.  If such people come before our courts they will be asked if they are unemployed and when they answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; they will be given free criminal legal aid.  Larry Dunne has already had free criminal legal aid.  Time and again our gardaí give evidence of people having substantial sums of money in bank accounts, the proceeds of crime, but yet those people get free criminal legal aid.  That is a disgrace.  On many occasions that legal aid can cost up to £20,000.  There is no effective and proper means testing of applicants for the free criminal legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>In the House last night one of my colleagues raised a question about the Coolock Law Centre and he was told that as there are serious financial problems in this country the Government could not allocate any more resources to that centre.  If an ordinary person on a low income goes to any law centre his or her means are properly assessed before they are given legal aid.  That strict test should also apply to people who are before the courts on criminal charges.  We should ensure that it does not pay for people to get involved in crime.  If crime pays there will be many people only too willing to get involved in it.</P>
    <P>We have a rate of house burglary 1.7 times higher than that of the UK.  In 1986, the last year for which figures are available, £44.8 million worth of property was stolen and only 8 per cent was recovered.  The reason more of that property was not recovered was our archaic laws.  Earlier this week the Law Reform Commission in their excellent report, much of which I support, made suggestions for reform in this area.  At the moment in order to get a conviction against a person for having received stolen property it is necessary to prove that, at the time they received it, they knew the goods were stolen.  It is virtually impossible to prove that and, as a result, <Col N="2102" /> very few prosecutions are brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>I want the law changed so that the onus of proof is switched to the accused.  If a person is reckless or careless as to whether or not property was stolen such a person should account for how they came upon that property.  Those people should have to show that they got the property legally and, if not, they should be convicted and made serve a long sentence. When people are convicted of having been involved in serious crime like drug pushing, armed robberies and so on, it should be possible for the Garda to apply to the courts and get a criminal bankruptcy order against those people, have their assets seized and have the proceeds of their crime given to worthwhile people like the victims of crime or to other causes.</P>
    <P>I understand that Mr. Cahill was before the Dublin District Court this afternoon and fined £70 for driving carelessly in Dublin in July last.  It would have been possible for the court to have disqualified him from driving.  We have to use the existing laws, inadequate as they are, to make sure that we bring this person and his associates to task.  We must no longer allow them to roam the streets and to play a cat and mouse game with the Garda Síochána.  It is just not good enough.  The reform in the Garda Síochána structure by putting more manpower into the special surveillance unit is not in itself sufficient.  We need laws to back up the Garda and to make sure that these people can be convicted.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Woods as Minister for Social Welfare will agree that the minimum amount needed to keep any car on the road is £1,000 per year.  The minimum amount required to live in a house in the area known as Cowper Road in Rathmines must be at least £2,000 per annum.  I understand this person paid cash for that house when he bought it.  I want the Minister to make an example of the people shown last night and to have them disqualified immediately from social welfare payments.  I want all their cases examined.  I want the Department to work in future in conjunction <Col N="2103" /> with the Garda Síochána to ensure that any persons suspected of being involved in serious crime have their means fully investigated before any means-tested social welfare benefits are paid to them. I have dealt time and again with ordinary individuals applying for non-contributory widow's or old age pensions.  They have to fill in an enormous number of forms and go through many procedures in order to show the Department of Social Welfare that they qualify for a particular payment. It is right that they should be means-tested properly, but it galls me, and I am sure most of them, to see how easy it is for some people to slip through the system.</P>
    <P>I can understand how it happens.  In the special investigation unit of the Department of Social Welfare there are, I understand, 35 social welfare officers and seven supervisors.  They have to deal with 742,000 recipients, approximately 17,800 each.  There is no way that one individual can supervise 17,800 recipients and make sure there is no defrauding of the system.  It is impossible.  The Jobsearch scheme currently in place has offered worthwhile job opportunities to some people and has also rooted out some of the abuse, but the people who are abusing the system know full well that the chances of being caught are very slim and they are prepared to take their chances. Two of them said on last night's programme that even when they robbed the post offices and got a few thousand pounds they still signed on because they knew if they did not there would be questions asked the following week.  It was better to keep signing on because then they would not get caught.</P>
    <P>I do not blame this Minister or any other Minister.  I blame the attitudes whereby we make certain welfare payments to everybody regardless of their means.  We have perhaps the most complicated system of social welfare in any developed country, yet our resources are such that we should begin to be selective in the payment of social welfare.  In particular we must take social welfare payments away from those who do not need <Col N="2104" /> them and give them to those who do.  We must rationalise the system so that we have fewer social welfare schemes.  If we had a simpler system we would have more people to put into the special investigation unit.  My colleague, Deputy O'Malley, said today that the persons currently employed by the Land Commission, which is long since defunct, should be put into the special investigation unit to increase its manpower.</P>
    <P>We must give powers to the Revenue Commissioners to investigate how people have acquired certain wealth.  That was eventually how Al Capone was caught and it is perhaps the most effective way of catching some of these people.  If we put the squeeze on their financial resources and ensure that crime does not pay, many of these criminals will not be interested in crime.  They are flouting the laws.  They arrogantly dismiss everybody. They play a cat and mouse game with the Garda Síochána.  They seek to intimidate producers of programmes and, indeed, Deputies who speak out.  They must not be allowed to intimidate those in our society who want to protect our democratic values and to ensure that ordinary decent people who look to this State for help through the social welfare system are not defrauded.  When criminals defraud the system they are defrauding the most vulnerable, the most marginal people in society.  For that reason too they must be rooted out.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cahill explained on last night's programme that he had a job but was also seeking a job through AnCO.  Has he ever been offered a job through the Jobsearch programme?  Perhaps not.  He might be a worthy candidate to be offered such a job.  I do not know.  It is unfortunate that it took journalists on an RTE programme to bring this matter to the notice of the Department of Social Welfare. I have discovered through conversations with the housing department of Dublin Corporation that it also took this programme to bring it to their attention that this person was in a house in Swan Grove.</P>
    <P>It is up to us as legislators to up-date the criminal law and make sure it is capable <Col N="2105" /> of dealing with today's sophisticated crime.  We need to establish as a matter of urgency a committee for that purpose. We should give that committee a short time to report in order to make sure that the criminal law is capable of getting criminals behind bars where they should be and where they should stay.  It is unfortunate that we have not seen fit to do so. Who would believe that it is a criminal offence in Ireland today to shake one's rug outside one's house before 8 o'clock in the morning?  Yet what we saw last night is freely allowed.  It is an absolute farce that our laws in this area date back in the main to the 1840s, the 1850s and the early years of this century.  We must make the laws effective.  If we do not, the Garda will not be able to bring these people to justice and take them away from our streets.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent days about justice in the United Kingdom and much concern has rightly been expressed by Irish citizens about the quality of justice there.  After last night's programme many people will look at our own judicial and legal system and ask whether there is justice in Ireland and whether our system is capable of dealing with today's modern and sophisticated crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should tell the Deputy at the outset that Martin Cahill was called for Jobsearch and made himself available.  I have to hand the form which applied to that Jobsearch investigation.  Every claim for unemployment assistance is investigated in order to establish the claimant's means.  The items to be taken into account as means and the manner in which the assessment is to be made are set out in the social welfare legislation. Included as means is the yearly value of all property belonging to the claimant, other than property which is personally used or enjoyed by him or his spouse, that is, the family home.  The value of the family home is not taken into account in calculating the claimant's means but the value of a second house owned by a claimant would be assessed as means.  The <Col N="2106" /> legislation also provides that a person who refuses or fails to disclose any means will have his or her unemployment assistance claim disallowed.</P>
      <P>The person who was identified in last night's &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, Martin Cahill, has been in receipt of unemployment assistance for a number of years.  During that period he has resided at a number of addresses at different times.  For instance, he is known to have resided at Hollyfield Buildings and Upper Kevin Street, in addition to a corporation flat in Swan Grove, Ranelagh. A report that he owned extensive property in Rathmines and in another part of Dublin was investigated in 1984 but the report could not be substantiated.  In last night's television programme it was stated that the individual concerned owns a large house in Cowper Downs, Palmerston, and had expensive cars and motorcycles.  These matters have now come to the notice of the Department for the first time.  Indeed, this house was previously noted by my Department but an investigation showed that it was not registered in his name.  These allegations will have to be investigated fully.  This morning I ordered that a full investigation be undertaken immediately.</P>
      <P>Members of the House will be aware of the concern I have expressed since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare and of my determination to deal with fraudulent abuse of the social welfare system whether it be by employers or workers.  I am seriously concerned with this latest development and I am determined to uncover the full facts.  In the meantime, no further payments will be made to the person concerned.  I have also ordered an investigation into the possibility of fraudulent claiming in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Finglas youths, the television programme also included a presentation of two youths in disguise who were said to be from the Finglas area and to be involved in crime and violence and who claimed to be in receipt of social welfare payments.  The information given in the programme suggested that for some periods these two may not have <Col N="2107" /> been entitled to social welfare payments. The case of these two is being investigated. However, it must be appreciated that my Department staff face a particular difficulty here in that they must first establish the identity of these individuals before they can investigate their cases.  I am sure the Garda would also like to be sure of the identity of the two concerned.  I assure the House that this will be followed up.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question generally, checks are made as a matter of course to establish a claimant's identity, his insurance record, the date he ceased employment and details of residence, etc. In addition to the range of checks applied to claimants for unemployment assistance, a range of checks is applied to claims in payment, as well as the ones applied initially, on an ongoing basis. Claimants are questioned each week as a matter of course as to whether they have worked since they last signed.  Claimants also make a formal declaration each week to that effect.</P>
    <P>In relation to unemployment payments, we have various sections in the Department which are involved solely in investigating claims.  I am afraid that the Deputy's information on this is incorrect. We have the external control unit who have been particularly successful.  They have a staff of 19 which is to be increased by 15.  We have the special investigation unit which is possibly the one that the Deputy and Deputy O'Malley referred to this morning, which has a staff of 40. It has also been particularly successful in the last year.  We also have the joint investigation unit which is a joint unit with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  That was a pilot unit and at present it is being considerably enlarged.  There were five staff in that unit last year and 15 further officers are being given to that unit at present.  The principal advantage there is the link between the Revenue Commissioners and social welfare officers.  We also have a principal inspection branch which is quite apart from the staff in the special investigation unit and the joint <Col N="2108" /> investigation unit.  Here we have a further 374 staff employed.  The majority of the items dealt with by this branch relate to unemployment payments.  As the Deputy is aware, we also have the Jobsearch programme which has its indirect effects.</P>

      <P>If one is fairly hard-nosed one will go along and say one is available. Is that not what it indicates?  It is not quite so simple as the Deputy might suggest.  It has taken a very major force of gardaí to bring about this programme last night and that programme obviously unearthed statements which, of course, are of interest to us in the Department of Social Welfare, but it is very difficult to get these statements if there is not the kind of pressure which is involved in major Garda surveillance.  There are some 500 staff involved in the specialist investigation unit.  This is very many more than the 40 to which Deputy O'Malley referred this morning.  This gives a completely different picture from what goes on in practice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard Deputy O'Malley's remarks this morning as being particularly intemperate in tone.  They did not take account <Col N="2109" /> of the difficulty of establishing facts and the need to establish facts in the administration of the Social Welfare Acts.  This need is not exclusive to these Acts.  It is a basic requirement in any democratic society.  I am very surprised at the tone of the Deputy's remarks which implied that the rest of us are not as anxious as he about crime against the person or the State.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>I was also surprised at Deputy O'Malley's broadside attack on the level of increases given in the budget in the personal rate for those on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The Deputy must be out of touch with reality.  Certainly his views are contrary to the views of the general mass of informed and concerned opinion on this subject.  Were it possible, I would have liked these increases to have been even greater.  However, the Government recognise that these recipients of social welfare assistance and allowances are in greater need than others and tried to alleviate their plight in so far as resources permitted.  I am satisfied that what we did was correct and that it is supported by society as a whole and by the House.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's bitter attack on the investigation staff of the Department of Social Welfare was totally unwarranted and ill-judged.</P>

I have also ordered an investigation into the possibility of fraudulent claiming in the past.  This would arise if it can be proved that cash was used to buy the house over that period, or that there was money available from any other source.  This is a very serious matter.  I welcome the programme because of the admissions which were made in the course of the programme. It shows the value of pressure, surveillance and intelligence.  I assure Deputies that we do not carry out that kind of in-depth surveillance in the <Col N="2111" /> Department of Social Welfare nor do I believe that the people would like us to do that.  Nevertheless, we welcome the programme and the surveillance carried <Col N="2112" /> out by the Garda.  I assure the House that we are acting on this immediately.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to ensure that the owners of the former national school premises referred to by the Deputy would sell the premises to the people concerned with the establishment of a multi-denominational primary school.  It would be a matter for the people concerned to deal direct with the owners and/or trustees of the premises in question.</P>
      <P>The position generally is that national schools are held under an arrangement whereby trustees hold the school premises under a standard form of lease from the owners and undertake to conduct a national school thereon.  State grants represent only part of the cost of providing the building and are not payable in respect of the acquisition of the site for school purposes.  In that situation people wishing to acquire the premises must deal with the owners and/or trustees and it is not open to me or my Department to direct how the premises should be disposed of.</P>

It is strongly recommended that such a decision be made only in respect of third or fourth standards and it is clearly stated that the number of instances of this practice should be minimal. In no circumstances would the circular allow for a situation where the whole class or a significant number of any class, should be held back.</P>

      <P>In addition to the three special classes mentioned above, facilities for language disorder also exist at Ballinteer, for preschool language-disordered children and in special classes at the Temple Street and the Mater Hospitals.  The hospital facilities are for children suffering from more than one handicap, including language-disorder.</P>
      <P>Facilities are also available in various other types of special schools and classes for the handicapped, as in many cases the children suffer from additional disabilities such as hearing impairment, emotional disturbance, physical or mental handicap or reading disability and the language-disorder may not be the primary cause of referral in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board provide a speech theraphy service on a part time basis to each of the three special classes. In the case of the facilities at Drumcondra and Tallaght, children are referred to the <Col N="2042" /> special classes through the assessment and diagnostic services of the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary bodies including the voluntary hospitals.  The facility located in Baggot Street was established for a specific group of children and the enrolment is restricted to the pupils currently attending.  Accordingly the question of referral procedures does not arise in that case.</P>
    <P>The Department pay a capitation grant of £96 per year in respect of each pupil enrolled in the special class for the duration of its operation.

      <P>Circular letter M85/85, which issued to post-primary schools in October, 1985, introduced the requirement that, with effect from the beginning of the 1986-87 school year, the junior cycle be of three years' duration, and the leaving certificate course be of two years' duration in all schools.  Schools which at that time were providing an authorised three-year leaving certificate course were permitted, however, to finish out that course for existing senior pupils.  Schools which were then providing an authorised four-year junior cycle course were permitted to finish out that course for existing junior pupils up to the end of junior cycle.</P>
      <P>This removed the anomaly that existed up until then, whereby some second level schools offered a six-year cycle to leaving certificate while the vast majority of such schools offered a five-year cycle.</P>

      <P>The proposals to increase the age of entry to national schools was one of a range of options examined in the context of the Government's budgetary strategy for 1988.  It was estimated that changing the age of entry from four to five years with effect from 1 January 1988 would result in savings of approximately £200,000 in 1988 and approximately £19,000,000 in a full year.  This would be achieved thorugh a reduction in teacher numbers of approximately 1,300 through a combination of redundancy and redeployment measures.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;actually come in course of payment&rdquo; which was used in the reply to the parliamentary question referred to is contained in section 24 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  My Department interpret this matter in accordance with paragraph 13 of the booklet &ldquo;An outline of Irish Financial Procedures&rdquo; issued by the Department of Finance in 1976 which states that the term means that the liability has matured and that the operation of authorising payment has been completed before the year end.  The established procedures for processing and making payments were followed in every respect in relation to the year in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The tender submissions for the schemes in Skryne and Slane, the technical aspects of which are generally acceptable, were received in my Department in January and March 1987, respectively.  It was not possible to sanction these schemes in 1987 and they could not be funded within the allocation for local authority housing for that year.</P>
      <P>Pending examination of the housing authorities' claims for capital allocations for their 1988 housing construction programme, which were recently received in my Department, it is not possible to indicate what funds will be available to individual authorities to finance their housing programme in 1988 and consequently when these or any other schemes may be approved.</P>

      <P>Improvements to the national primary road at Laraghbrien are being carried out in two phases.  Phase I has been completed at a cost of £804,000. A revised design for the second phase, costing an estimated £500,000, has been approved by the Department.</P>
      <P>The provisions available for road grants during 1988 have been fully allocated. It was not possible to allocate a grant this year for the second phase because of competing demands for other important road improvement schemes. The question of a grant for the second phase will be reconsidered when the road grant allocations for 1989 are being determined.</P>

FÁS operate the <Col N="2070" /> EC sponsored SEDOC information exchange system on job seekers and job vacancies which helps citizens of the EC who wish to take up employment in another member state.  In addition, FÁS manage a number of programmes as part of their day to day activities aimed at helping graduates obtain experience abroad including the Youth European Orientation Programme and the European Export Marketing Programme.

Careers and appointments officers in third-level colleges also help graduates find employment, including employment abroad.  Many major international companies contact these officers.</P>

      <P>Tender documentation has been prepared for the provision of an extension to Ballymore Eustace national school, County Kildare.  Because, however, of the demands on the capital being made available in 1988 to my Department for its national school building programme, it is unlikely that an allocation can be made towards the cost of this project in the current financial year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has <Col N="2077" /> been drawn to the fact that St. Raphael's national school, Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, has no caretaker; if she is prepared to arrange for a caretaker to be provided either directly or under the social employment scheme or under any similar scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As the scheme for the employment of caretaker staff is being phased out, it is not open to my Department to approve the appointment of a caretaker in St. Raphael's national school.  The administration of the social employment scheme is the responsibility of the Minister for Labour.</P>
