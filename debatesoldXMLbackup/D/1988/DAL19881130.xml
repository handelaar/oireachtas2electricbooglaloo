I suggest, therefore, that we debate these amendments together, also amendments Nos. 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, and 37.  I am proposing that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21 to 43, inclusive, and 45 together as they are all related.  I am asking for your approval that we debate them together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), before the definition of &ldquo;exempted supply&rdquo; to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;child' means a person under the age of 16 years;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of this amendment and the related amendments is whether videos should be in two categories only &mdash; those <Col N="2330" /> that are permitted and those that are banned.  We are saying that there should be a classification system of videos permissible to be viewed by adults only and those suitable for children.  That is a very reasonable provision.  This view was shared by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism who prepared an excellent report on the control of video nasties in 1986-87.  I want to refer to some of the comments on the question of classification made in that committee, and I agree with them.  In paragraph 3.6 of the report they said:</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the introduction of controls is an unwarranted interference with people's freedom to watch what they like in their own homes.  However, the Committee considers that there comes a point when the freedom of individuals must be controlled for the common good and that there is a need to protect the public, particularly young people, for the effects of witnessing scenes such as those portrayed on some of the video nasties available in this country at the present time.  The aim of controls is to remove the really objectionable and revolting material from circulation, The Committee considers that the general availability of video nasties has a corrupting influence on, at least, some members of our society.  It is to combat this evil influence that some controls are required.</P>
    <P>At paragraph 3.7 they made this crucial point:</P>
    <P>The Committee recognise another aspect of the problem of video nasties, namely, that legislation of itself cannot provide the complete answer; the primary duty for the protection of children and young persons rests on parents and other adults having a duty towards such persons.  It would not be practical for society to try and take on the twenty-four hour a day task of safeguarding the standards of children and young persons.  That is the function of parents and guardians.  The State has a part to play in reducing the extent <Col N="2331" /> to which corrupting influences are available; but, it falls to parents to exercise their responsibility for the welfare of their children within the framework laid down by the State for the benefit of the common good of society.</P>
    <P>When we bring in these restrictions on videos we must have a care that we do not go overboard.  We pride ourselves in being, to some extent, a liberal society and a distinction has to be drawn between viewing what may be suitable for adults and viewing that may be suitable for children. Many films and many videos are perfectly in order and it would be perfectly proper for adults to view them but they would not be suitable for young persons to view, and in the amendment we define a young person for the purpose of these sections as a person under the age of 16 years.  That category that it would be in order for adults to see should not be banned because of the possibility that they might also be seen or viewed at any time by a young person.  As the select committee said, it is not the function of or within the power of the State to organise a 24 hour, round the clock guard on young people and what they may view. There is a limit to what legislation can accomplish in this House and there is no point in trying to legislate for something that cannot be achieved.  The select committee were right when they said that the primary responsibility for supervising what children watch, what they do and what they view rests on their parents and their guardians.  We here in legislation can do only so much.  We have to take care that classifications are given so that parents will know whether videos that are on offer are suitable in the eyes of the censor for viewing by their children.</P>
    <P>There are different types of classifications that would be possible.  In the film industry there are quite a number of classifications.  The select committee in their report recommended the international coding system which has a classification of audience suitability, and they recommended that that classification be <Col N="2332" /> adopted that there then be provision that any unclassified videos should not be available and that it should be an offence to make them available.  The committee said that they consider that the international coding system which classifies audience suitability should be adopted and understand that most videos coming on the Irish market are of American or British origin and already conform to this standard.  In the amendments I have proposed I am suggesting simply two classifications, those suitable only for adults and those suitable for children under the age of 16 years.  I think that is a reasonable compromise.  It would be a big mistake to bulk all videos under the category of suitability or non-suitability irrespective of who the viewing audience would be.</P>
    <P>I consider the amendments reasonable and I ask the Minister to consider them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer initially to amendment No. 2 which is to insert in the definition section a provision for a limited supply certificate, which means a certificate granted by the official censor under this Bill containing conditions, restrictions or directions as to the persons or class of persons to whom the video work to which the certificate relates may be supplied or by whom it may be viewed.  This amendment is on the broad lines of what Deputy Taylor has been talking about.  I know this matter was pushed in the Seanad and it got nowhere, but the Minister should respect the fact that the committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism dealt with this issue and recommended classification and, so far as I know, all parties in Opposition are recommending classification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to pose a <Col N="2333" /> few things to the Minister.  The Bill refers to the fact that a supply certificate will automatically be given where a certificate has been granted for cinema viewing. Suppose the Film Censor is asked to look at a film and grants permission for viewing subject to certain conditions, say, that people over the age of 18 only would be allowed into the cinema during the time the film was being shown.  The same film is supplied on video and the only option the same censor would have at that stage would be to grant a certificate with no restrictions despite the fact that he had already imposed restrictions in relation to the film.  This makes a bit of a joke of the whole thing.  I, like Deputy Taylor, do not go along with the fact that we as legislators have to go into people's homes and decide how they are going to control their children.  We can do certain things and issue certain guidelines but after that we have to depend on the ability of individuals to look after their own lives and their own homes and accept their responsibility as parents.  However, I believe it is a good idea that some indication is given by the Film Censor, and not on a voluntary basis as suggested by the Irish Videogram Association who apparently are opposing this idea of classification, much to my surprise.  I would prefer if the Film Censor was to give some indication or direction as to who should or should not view a video.  If after that it gets into the hands of children at home there is not much we can do about it, but at least the parents will have been put on notice.  If you have no classification then, depending on the view of the censor, videos which would be suitable for 18 or 19 year olds or adults would not be approved because a censor would have no option but to say that in his opinion it would be unsuitable for viewing, bearing in mind that young people might be seeing it.  Adults can look at certain things which would not have the same effect on them as such viewing might have on young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about incitement and the causes of violence surely there must be a difference between the effect a video has on a 15 year old in that area and the <Col N="2334" /> effect it would have on an adult of 40 or 50 years of age.  There is no comparison in these areas as to the effect these videos can have on individuals.  Therefore, are we to ban videos that would be very suitable for adult viewing but because the censor fears they are going to be watched by young children he might be hesitant as to whether he should grant a supply certificate?  That will depend totally on the censor in question, and I think we are asking the censor to carry out an unfair function.  We should accept an amendment that will allow the censor to grant a limited supply certificate and if he wishes to put on a recommendation that X video is suitable for whatever age group upwards, let him have that discretion.  If he does not, so be it, but at least let us have a provision in the Bill where he can do that and not just give him this black and white provision where he can do nothing about it.  No argument I have seen, read or heard will convince me that there is logic in affording him the opportunity of saying only &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he might wish to do so subject to certain conditions and he should have that discretion.  The minimum this Bill should provide for a censor would be that facility to grant a limited supply certificate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am asking my colleagues to accept and support this amendment and to support the principle behind it.  It is not a question of trying to get an amendment passed for the sake of doing so. There is an issue here.  All the arguments I have heard are in favour of having that discretion for the censor as against the sort of &ldquo;no, I do not agree with it&rdquo; argument which does not really convince me that there is any logic to not providing this facility.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to consider accepting this amendment for the good of the legislation. In fairness to him he has gone a fair bit in the Seanad listening to various arguments and he was prepared to accept reasonable amendments.</P>
    <P>One does not know how a Bill of this nature is going to work until it is actually in operation.  If it does not work we can <Col N="2335" /> always change it and if it does work so be it.  What we are trying to do is adopt a reasonable approach to the supply of video recordings to the public and avoid video nasties in particular getting into the hands of young people.  That is basically what this legislation is about.  We can do that by giving the censor some discretion. I have not heard any argument that will convince me that it is better just to have a black and white situation rather than allowing the censor some discretion.  I maintain that giving the censor some discretion is in the best interests of the legislation that we are trying to pass through this House today.  I again ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments are to do with the classification of videos.  Perhaps we are putting the cart before the horse.  It would have been more appropriate to discuss section 3 first on the question of what effect videos have or have not got on the viewer.  In any event, we are not discussing the question of classification and whether or not the censor should have the right to classify videos in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands the censor may only accept or reject a video on the basis of whether there is any material in it which he regards as obscene or likely to incite violence.  That is something of a blunt instrument.  As it stands, the censor does have the right to classify films and that has worked reasonably well in the past ten to 12 years.  My understanding is that the censor no longer cuts films but does <Col N="2336" /> obviously reject some films because of their gross nature, and he classifies films for over 18s, over 16s, over 15s, for general viewing, with parental guidance, etc. It would seem only reasonable that the same approach should be adopted with videos.  Under the Bill as it stands the censor will have to give a general certificate to a video for which he has already given a certificate for a film.  The film may in fact be restricted; it may have an over 18s certificate but because of the way this Bill is framed the video of that film would have to be made available automatically in video shops without any restrictions whatsoever on who may come into the shop to rent or buy them &mdash; it could be a child of ten or an adult of whatever age. That undermines the whole thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the film &ldquo;The Temptation of Christ&rdquo;, it has been brought to my attention since Second Stage that I had done the censor an injustice by suggesting that he had cut the film.  In fact he had not.  He had placed a couple of restrictions on it.  One was that it should only be viewed by over 18s; another was that it should carry a statement before the film was shown that it was not in line with the strict interpretation of the Bible; the third one was that no one should be allowed to enter the cinema to see the film once the film had started.  The censor obviously had good reasons for doing that.  I do not necessarily agree with an over-18 audience not being allowed into the cinema once the film had started.  In any event, under this Bill any video which is presented to the censor, the film of which has been certified by the censor, must automatically get a general certificate and will be available to one and all without any restrictions whatsoever.  There is an anomaly in the Bill with regard to what it is intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>The other effect this Bill may have if it is passed as it stands is that we may end up by getting passed only videos which are suitable for children with no such thing as an adult film available on video. There may be a problem there because with these new powers the censor may well have it in the back of his mind when <Col N="2337" /> he is viewing the film that he might be presented with a video of this film in the future and, if so, does he believe that this film should be on general release to all. This may, in fact, increase the constraints on the censor and make him more conservative and reluctant to pass films for release for viewing by adults.  So we could have a regression in relation to censorship here because of the way this Bill is framed.</P>
    <P>There are arguments against classification too.  One is that it is impossible to prevent an under age person viewing a video.  That is true.  If it is in the home it is, presumably, up to the parents to control what the child is viewing; but we have already on the Statute Book legislation which restricts children from buying a range of things which are on sale.  We do not allow the sale of alcohol to persons under a certain age from offlicences or from pubs.  We do not allow the sale of drink to persons under a certain age in pubs.  We do not allow the sale of condoms to persons under a certain age.  However, that legislation does not prevent children from using these things; it does not prevent adults from buying them on their behalf and handing them over.  Yet this House, in all solemnity, decided that it was important enough to restrict sale of these items to children.  If we are serious about this Bill it is only reasonable to argue that a video shop should be obliged not to rent or sell to children under a certain age videos that have been classified by the censor as suitable for viewing only by people over a certain age.  The video shop should be obliged to abide by the law in that regard.</P>
    <P>The second argument is one of cost. The Minister indicated in the course of his Second Stage speech that it costs in the region of £1 million to classify videos in Britain.  It is a valid point for the video industry to put forward that they do not want to have an additional cost placed on them but our concern must be whether adult videos should be generally available having been passed by the censor and whether we believe it is important to restrict access to adult videos by children. If that is our firm belief-the question of <Col N="2338" /> cost should not be the overriding factor. In the course of his contribution the Minister said he was not stubborn in regard to this issue and I was glad to hear that. The case for classification is overwhelming. Commonsense arguments in favour of it have been put forward and the Minister should take them on board. The issue was debated at length in the Seanad and I am sure the Minister heard these arguments there but I hope that on this occasion he takes them on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this issue of classification it is worth looking at the purpose of the Bill which, it seems to me, from the beginning was one which insisted on taking out of circulation videos which grossly offended or incited people to violence or crime.  If that is the purpose of the Bill, it is very black and white and does not leave much room for manoeuvre.  It amounts to wanting to take the videos out of circulation.  If the Bill is amended in the way suggested by various parties I do not think it will be possible to enforce its provisions.  The purpose of the Bill is quite different from the thinking behind the amendments.  I would be afraid that the law would be brought into disrepute because the provisions of the Bill would not be enforceable.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I made a number of points in regard to the difficulty of enforcing the provisions.  One must look at the difference between the medium of film as shown in the cinema and the medium of videos as shown on a video machine, normally in the home.  The censor has the right to impose restrictions as to who may view a film in a cinema and the kernel of the argument is that those restrictions can be adhered to.  It is possible to bring a person to court if those restrictions are not adhered to.  A basic element of legislation is that its provisions be enforceable.  I would be afraid that if we included provisions suggested by Deputies Barrett, De Rossa or Taylor we would be faced with the problem of enforcing them.  As a result other laws would be brought into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor suggested that if we do <Col N="2339" /> not have classification we will be making a joke of the legislation but I am afraid that if we have classification that is not enforceable all the provisions of the Bill will be a joke.  The Government have a role in upholding moral standards to the extent that they are consented to by the majority but it must be recognised that private bodies have a role to play.  The least amount of government we can have involved the better.  There are other parties involved in this, parents and responsible guardians and citizens and the traders and importers.  They are directly involved in the maintenance of proper standards.  A reasonable guide to videos is in existence and has been produced by the Irish Videogram Association.  This extensive guide to the type of videos that are available for hire is displayed in video shops.</P>
    <P>One must bear in mind that after the passage of the Bill the video industry may change considerably.  There will be a greater degree of scrutiny of the industry, there will be the licensing of outlets, the role of the censor and a general public awareness that there is a law on the Statute Book that can be used to stamp out the appalling grossness in some videos.  I do not have any objection in principle to the censor having a right to classify videos but I have an objection to us obliging the censor to do something that cannot be enforced.  Deputy De Rossa referred to the film, &ldquo;The Last Temptation of Christ&rdquo;, and the restrictions placed by the censor on that film.  That makes the point I was referring to, that the censor could impose restrictions, that he could call for the restriction of the showing of a film to over 18s such as that people should be seated before the film starts and that notices should be displayed outside the cinema.  The censor may impose conditions relating to the size of the notice that must be displayed.  I do not think the censor can lay down such restrictions in relation to videos.  It would not be possible to enforce them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the classification of videos but I do not think it will be possible for the censor to impose restrictions that will <Col N="2340" /> be effective and to follow that up with the moral force that should be behind all legislation.  Self imposed guidance is something we should strive for.  I accept that there is an apparent anomaly in that films that have age restrictions placed on them when shown in cinemas are generally available in video shops.  Rather than insisting on excessive control, we should allow a period to elapse to see if the Irish Videogram Association police the business, as they say they do.  We would learn if people have a greater awareness of their rights and what can be done about videos.  If we discover that there is no control of video outlets we can amend the legislation and give the censor the right, and a way of following through on it, to impose restrictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the argument which was very well put by the previous speaker and, indeed, by the Minister, I am not fully convinced that we are doing the right thing by legislating for the control and supply of video material without introducing an element of classification.  The anomaly that will exist, if the legislation is not amended, can be underlined by the curious scenario that will allow somebody to be turned away from a cinema and, perhaps, 50 yards away to be in a position to purchase or hire the particular film to which they were denied access to five minutes before.  That must be the overriding argument.</P>
      <P>We are talking about access to material, access to video nasties, access to unsuitable material as well as material of an objectionable nature.  Deputy Colley felt that by introducing a system of classification we were broadening the legislation and she defined, too narrowly in my view, what this legislation is all about.  Even a reading of the title gives an indication that there is more to it than to outlaw objectionable material, it is to control the regulation of the supply of video material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point of the <Col N="2341" /> censor's role in the celluoid industry can be underlined by the classification system we have within the cinema.  I fail to see why, side by side, we can have exactly the same material available under general classification.  Let us face it, we will have a situation where film material in the form of video is either on the shelf or off the shelf &mdash; it is black and white, it is either in the shop or it is not in it.  We have to accept the fact that there is viewing material suitable for different age groups. The Minister will have to accept that. There is material that is suitable for adults and there is material that is suitable for children, irrespective of how we feel.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation there will be absolutely no control over access in a video shop.  The argument in favour of classification can be further exemplified by the various television announcements we have when a film comes on for viewing on television; if it is not suitable for children there is an announcement to that effect.  That is the type of thing we are talking about in the legislation, that there should be a system of classification and a warning notice and there should be an onus upon the retailer to ensure that this material does not fall into hands for which it is not suitable.  The area of control will be difficult and that is the problem the Minister has.  I do not think we should cop out and say that it is going to be difficult to police and that it will be too difficult to control.  I do not feel that we should take that view.  We should try to regulate it by means of putting an onus on the retailer to have all his material classified in one form or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody has access to video machines.  It is not as if a video machine will be locked away in a house and not under the direct control of a parent.  Anybody who wants to see any type of material, once it is available in the shop, can do so with little or no restriction. That should be borne in mind.  That is a further argument in favour of some form of classification.  We are really making something of a joke &mdash; which is the phrase which was coined earlier by two previous speakers &mdash; of the existing role of the <Col N="2342" /> censor as far as the film industry is concerned if we are directing that there be classification for films on the big screen and yet no classification when it comes to video material.  That must be the fundamental aspect of it.  I hope, now that we are legislating for control and supply, that we see fit to have a classification system to ensure, in so far as we can, that objectionable material does not get into the hands of those for whom it is not suitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a point before the Minister makes his decision.  I have a funny feeling that he is going to trot out the official line which he did in the Seanad.  I am afraid we will have some problems with this Bill if that is the case. As Deputy Flanagan has said and, with respect to Deputy Colley, she is missing the point.  We are talking here about the supply of videos.  We are not saying, and no legislation can say, that so-and-so cannot see this or so-and-so should not see that.  We are talking about people who are in business, like off-licence owners, who would be told that they cannot supply or sell to somebody under a certain age.  That is what we should be talking about here.  If after that, somebody who is 30 years old goes in, as Deputy De Rossa said, and buys alcohol, goes down the road and into his house and opens the bottle and gives a large Jameson to his 16 year old son, we cannot do anything about that.  We never tried to do anything about it either but what we did say was that if a 16-year old son went in to the off-licence we would not allow the owner to sell him the Jameson. What we are saying here is that there should be control over the supply of particular videos if the censor so decides. Without that can the Minister tell me how a censor is going to make his decision? Section 3 (1) of the Bill states that:</P>
      <P>The Official Censor shall, on application to him in relation to a video work, grant ... a certificate ... unless he is of opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the viewing of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2343" /> (1)  would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection,</P>
    <P>It could be interpreted from that, that a good thriller, which we all enjoy sitting down and watching, could be banned by the censor if in his opinion it is going to indicate or suggest ways of doing something or of avoiding detection.  A good thriller that you can see every evening of the week on your television screen or that you can see in the cinema could be banned, if the censor was scrupulous and said to himself: &ldquo;This could incite crime if a 15 or 16 year old was to see it.  I may not be doing my job in accordance with the Act so I cannot grant a certificate in that instance.&rdquo; If the man has discretion he will say that if a 25-year old was to see that it is not likely to incite him to commit crime, or it will not really have an effect on whether it suggests ways of committing a crime or how to avoid detection. The old film, &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo;, would be banned in accordance with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it would. That is what the wording of the Bill is saying.  I will give the Minister an opportunity to reply in a minute.  Surely the censor should have some say when he looks at it.  It would be different if a 25-year old, a 40-year old or a 50-year old saw this as against a 15 or a 16 year old. Surely he should have some discretion and we should not tie his hands.  He should be able to say: &ldquo;It is my recommendation that this video should not be shown to people, or supplied to people under the age of 16 or 18&rdquo; or whatever he so decides.  I cannot see how that can bring our law into disrepute.  If we were to use Deputy Colley's argument, with respect, and I am sure the line which the Minister will trot out, you could forget about controlling the sale or the supply <Col N="2344" /> of alcohol because the same arguments would apply.  Therefore, there is more behind this than meets the eye.</P>
      <P>If this classification was inserted into this legislation it would make life a little more difficult for people in the business. We are legislators and we have to produce legislation that makes sense and if in the course of doing so we cause people some inconvenience I am sorry if that is the case.  We passed an Intoxicating Liquor Bill recently which caused certain problems for people and they will have to adhere to the law as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have to say we want legislation that makes sense.  This legislation, in my opinion, does not make sense.  The censor will be asked to do a job which will be extremely unfair to him because he will not know which way to turn.  He will not know whether &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; should get through because of the wording of section 3, or say: &ldquo;I think this is suitable for adults but it is not suitable for children&rdquo;.  Therefore, the handiest way out, depending on the censor, might be that he would not grant the certificate. On the other hand, we might have a censor who will take a different approach, who might say that it is all right and who will grant certificates to most films because he can read into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If my wording is not suitable, if Deputy De Rossa's wording is not suitable or if the Minister has some objections to what Deputy Taylor is suggesting, I am prepared, as I am sure my colleagues would also be prepared once the Minister accepts the principle, to wait until Report Stage if the Minister would prefer to come back with some other wording.  We can then discuss and debate it.  If the Minister does not accept the principle I suppose, as you would say yourself, Sir, &ldquo;the only thing you can do is to use the Dáil to voice your opinion.&rdquo; That is what we will do and we will call a vote on this issue.  It would be a shame if we had to vote on an issue like this.  There is a principle involved here and if the Minister does not accept the principle I will certainly call a vote on the issue because <Col N="2345" /> I believe that what we are trying to do here is effectively to prevent young people from watching video nasties and people from making money out of encouraging people to commit crime through the extreme violence that we see. We want to do something about this but at the end of the day we need to have reasonable legislation in place to enable us to do so.</P>

      <P>For the sake of the record I would like to say that we are starting the Committee Stage debate and even before I reply to the debate on a group of amendments I am being given out to by Deputy Barrett who argues that I might trot out all the usual arguments including that there is something more behind this than meets the eye and that he will be denied the opportunity of viewing any good thriller such as &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; which we all enjoyed and which I am sure we will continue to enjoy because it is a film we could look at on many an occasion.  Even before I get the chance to make my case he is threatening me with war by way of a vote.  In fairness to him, recognising that that is his approach, he prefaced his remarks by saying that he hoped that I would not be stubborn.  He cannot have it both ways.  Let me say very simply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the basic purpose of this legislation is to prevent the availability of pornographic films and video nasties.  If we forget this and broaden out the argument into areas which this legislation is not meant to cover, we will get into very serious problems.  As Deputy Barrett said, and I am sure he means it, he wants, as much as everyone else who is here wants, legislation which makes sense and which can be enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of amendments down about the system of classifying works in such a way as to limit their supply by reference to the age of the purchaser or the renter.  Before dealing with them I intend first of all to set out some general background to the Bill and <Col N="2346" /> then speak about classification <i>per se.</i> When we were considering this area, there was an urgent need as has been said by everybody who has participated in the debate in this House and in the debate in the other House, for this type of legislation, and there were a number of basic questions which had to be dealt with in the drafting of the Bill.  A decision had to be made whether video works should be controlled by vetting them before they were released commercially on to the market as distinct from bringing a prosecution, after their release on to the market, in respect of any works considered obscene.  That is the kind of film we are talking about, not films such as &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; and I think Deputy Barrett should remember this. What we are talking about are obscene works or works which are otherwise unacceptable. Having considered this area, the decision was to vet the works before they were released on to the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should read section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to more than obscene works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me try to make my side of the argument.  I have listened very attentively to everything that has been said by Deputies on the other side of the House.  The question then arose as to who should do the vetting.  Should it be the Film Censor or for that matter should it be a board?  The decision was that it should be the Film Censor.  There was a question then whether the outlets should be licensed.  As Deputies are aware, the original Bill did not contain any provision for the licensing of outlets.  However, after a very thorough discussion on this point in the other House I decided to amend the Bill to provide for the licensing of outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining basic question was whether there should be a classification system for video works passed as being fit for supply.  I gave very careful and deep consideration to this question in the <Col N="2347" /> same manner as I gave careful consideration to the other questions I have mentioned.  The basic reason for having a classification system is to prevent people of a certain age from viewing video works.  That is the basic reason for having such a system.  A classification system would prevent works classified for people over a certain age from being supplied to people under that age. However it would not or could not prevent children under the specified age from viewing them as they could be obtained by people over the age and then shown to those under the age or they could be left in houses where children could view them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The same as alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about a due comparison of alcohol and brandy with video films in a few moments because I do not think that is a good argument.  As I am sure Deputy Barrett knows in his heart and soul, it is not a comparison which will stand up.  The fundamental point is that the State cannot control the age of people viewing a video work once it is supplied.  There is no way that the State, as Deputy Colley has said, will want to be involved in areas it should keep well out of and leave very well alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been made that as there is a classification system for cinema films there should be a similar classification system for video works. However, cinema films and video works are not comparable in relation to this question of classification.  Cinema films are shown in a controlled environment and if a film is rated as being suitable only for those over 18 years of age, then it is possible for the cinema management to prevent young people under that age from entering the cinema and viewing it. It may be argued that it is difficult to decide on the age of certain people entering the cinema but the reality is that in the vast majority of cases the cinema management would know by looking at <Col N="2348" /> people whether they were under the age specified or not.</P>
    <P>Cinema management have a clear responsibility in this area and it is possible for them to exercise that responsibility, but the position in regard to video works is not the same.  A shopkeeper letting out a video work would have no control whatsoever over who would see it; cinema management have.  Even though the person to whom he supplies the film is 19 or 20 years of age this is no guarantee that a work which is classified for viewing, for example, by people over the age of 16 only will not be shown to people under that age.  That blows aside totally the comparison which has been made between cinema films and video films.</P>
    <P>The point was made by a number of Deputies today and during Second Stage that we have a responsibility to frame realistic legislation.  That is what we have to try to do and I am satisfied that this is a case in point.  To provide for a classification system would simply not achieve the objective for which classification is intended.  It would not ensure that people below the stipulated age would not see the work for the reasons I have already stated.  Deputy Colley was right when she said that the difficulties which would arise for the Garda in the enforcement of the classification system are matters which we must consider as well.  This Bill, as it is now framed, will result in a considerable amount of additional work for the Garda and I am satisfied that the Garda have been helped in every possible way in the framing of the Bill in an effort to enable them to carry out their work.  The registers of video works and licence holders are documents which will help them do this.  Similarly the need to have licences displayed by those who operate video outlets will be of assistance to the Garda. To ask the Garda to control outlets by reference to the age of those renting or buying video films would be a fruitless task.  It would be very difficult to bring charges, and any cases of alleged offences, and added to the prosecutions, even if successful, would not attain the objective of preventing people below the stipulated ages from viewing the video <Col N="2349" /> works in question.  I am satisfied that this would be a serious waste of very scarce Garda time.</P>
    <P>I should also mention &mdash; and Deputy De Rossa anticipated one of my arguments in this area &mdash; the cost involved in a classification system.  A system of classification would make the vetting of video works more expensive.  Of course, as I have already said this would not be an additional expense on the taxpayer because the cost of the system would be covered in full by the fees which would be charged under the Bill.  However, there would be considerable extra expense involved which would presumably be passed on to the consumer.  The position in the United Kingdom is that their system of censorship of cinema films and video works cost approximately £1.3 million last year and 55 people were employed.  I am advised that our costs are estimated to be £300,000 with 12 people employed.</P>
    <P>I have been very conscious at all times in the framing of this Bill that it will involve some extra expense for the trade and the consumer but I have endeavoured to keep the extra costs to the minimum necessary.  There will have to be fees for the viewing of video works by the film censor and his staff, for the labels which will have to be affixed to video cassettes and for the work involved in implementing the system of licensing of suppliers.  All of these expenses are necessary because they arise from procedures which are fundamental to the success of the scheme set out in the Bill. Extra expense due to classification would be an unnecessary expense as classification is not required for the success of the scheme set out in the Bill.  A further point in that classification could delay the finalisation of arrangements for all videos subject to the controls of the Bill.  Examining all video works already on the market and those coming on the market would be a much lengthier process if the censor had to assign a classification to all the works rather than make a decision whether it should be authorised for supply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2350" /> There is one other point about classification systems which I should mention &mdash; it gives a purchaser or renter of a video information about the age group for which the work is suitable.  This information would, of course, be useful to parents when choosing video works to be viewed by their children.  The Irish Videogram Association have taken an initiative in this respect and they have drawn the attention of the public to the fact that there is a classification mark on video works already available in outlets. This is, of course, the classification system which is operating in the United Kingdom and it informs a purchaser or renter whether a film is suitable for viewing by anybody, whether parental guidance is needed in certain circumstances or whether the work should not be seen by children below a certain age.</P>
    <P>As I have already said very careful consideration has been given to the question of classification.  The advantages and disadvantages have been weighed in a very thorough manner and I am satisfied that on balance the classification system should not be built into the Bill as it would not achieve the objective for which such a system is intended &mdash; that is, the prevention of the viewing of certain video works by people below a certain age.  On this ground I am satisfied that the right course is not to provide a classification system.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a misunderstanding about another point in that arguments have been offered more than once that films marked for viewing over 18 will not be available in video shops.  That is not so.  Any cinema film &mdash; and I want this to be understood &mdash; which has a certificate for showing in a cinema must be given a supply certificate as a video work.  There is no question of Deputy Barrett being denied the pleasure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Flanagan makes the point that if somebody is turned away from a cinema he can go to a video shop and get a video.  Let me say to Deputy Flanagan that even with classification his big brother could get it for him and we could do nothing about it.</P>

This brings me to a point made by Deputy Colley, that there has to be self-imposed guidance and parental involvement in the type <Col N="2352" /> of films which children are going to view. We do not want that job.  We cannot do it and the Garda cannot do it.  None of us here would want the Garda to have to do that job.

In fairness to those whose job it is to advise me, the Deputy should not make a side swipe at them that the Minister will trot out the official line.

      <P>We cannot depart from what we are trying to do, which is to prohibit the availability of pornographic nasty films that everybody recognises are a total insult to women and should not be available to anybody.  That is all that we are trying to do.  I believe that if we try to make it wider than we are doing, we will have legislation on our hands <Col N="2354" /> which will not be enforceable.  I can see the arguments in regard to classification. There is no way in which I can be convinced &mdash; and I have had discussions with all those involved &mdash; that we could ever enforce it.

      <P>This is an area where there is common ground between us on many fronts.  We all wish to achieve the same end; I accept that.  The difficulty lies in how we do it.  That is the question.  This is a new development for which there is no precedent in this country.  We have looked at this and other areas in the legislation of other countries and have tried to learn from their mistakes.  It is likely that there will be a need to amend this legislation as we move along and learn from its operation.  I accept that.  It would be very unwise if I did not.  I would hope that it would be my very pleasant responsibility to return, say, in 12 months or two years and say that we should have a look at the legislation, having regard to the circumstances that we feel must be catered for.

      <P>That is not what the Minister said a moment ago.  I wanted to put my view on the record.  The Minister may have faith in the censor, but going back to the thirties and forties, the Government of the day had every faith in the censor of that time, but some ridiculous decisions were taken.  People who are adult should be able to make judgments for themselves.  The censor should be involved only in controlling what this House in legislation decides he is in a position to control.  We should not suggest that people are not able to make decisions for themselves.</P>
      <P>I am totally in agreement with the general thrust of this Bill but not enough emphasis is being put on the violence available in films and videos.  Since the report on the control of video nasties was published by the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism, we have had the advent of satellite TV. Many of the matters which the Minister is purporting to control from public viewing in this Bill will be beamed into the homes of many Irish families and available to young children.  The Bill comes a little late and what the Minister should be considering, in consultation with his colleagues in the European Community, is what sort of Europewide control should be adapted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the opening section giving the purpose of the Bill, there is a certain weakness to which I shall return later.  This is in connection with what is described as a business and what is described as a premises.  There is an essential weakness in the Bill because the Minister did not take in account sections 9.3, 9.4, 9.5 and 9.6 of the select committee's report in which they advocated the licensing of premises which would be subject to the control of local authorities and subject to annual renewal.  I shall return to that point later.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials would give some thought to involving local councillors in the control of the outlets which hire video nasties or pornographic material which is offensive, so that when licences come up annually for renewal via the local authorities, at least people will be in a position to make <Col N="2356" /> representations to their local elected councillor and somebody will have an opportunity to tell a person that it is known that he is breaking the law but that this cannot be pinned on him and that unless he gives an undertaking that he will desist from providing these videos which the law has prohibited and will not continue to provide them from under the counter his premises will not be licensed or his licence will not be renewed.  That power should be with local elected councillors. They should have the authority to review annually the licensing of such premises.</P>
    <P>I shall quote very briefly from the select committee's report as follows:</P>
    <P>Licensing of retail outlets</P>
    <P>9.3 The Committee recommends that legislation in relation to video recordings should provide that the owners of all retail outlets be licensed. The holding of a valid licence should be a requirement for continuing to operate in the business.</P>
    <P>9.4 The Committee was advised that there is a relationship between the non-legitimate video trade and the availability of video nasties and hardcore pornographic videos.  A licensing system would be a means of bringing some control into the industry and would make it possible to enforce realistic controls on the availability of video nasties.</P>
    <P>9.5 On the question as to who should be the licensing authority, the Committee recommends that this role be allocated to the local authorities; that it should be a reserved function of the councillors, and that there should be provision for an appeal to the Courts against a refusal of a licence.  A licence should attach to the owner of the retail outlet and should be renewable every year.  However, in the event of a second conviction for an offence under the legislation, the licence should be revoked.</P>
    <P>9.6 In addition to the powers available to the Gardaí, the local authority <Col N="2357" /> should be empowered to take proceedings against any licence holder who is alleged to have breached any provision of the legislation or against any unlicensed person offering video recordings for hire or sale.</P>
    <P>I will return to that subject at a later stage.  I give notice at this stage on the purpose of the Bill.  I should like the Minister and his colleagues to give some thought to this.  It is an essential weakness and if the owner continues to provide under the counter videos of a nasty, violent or pornographic type not permitted by the legislation, there should be some way of getting at him.  It is not always possible in law to prove cases against these operators so local resident's associations should be allowed to make representations to councillors.  If a person is treated unfairly by not having a licence renewed then, as the report of the select committee suggests, he would have the right of appeal to the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to go back to the point the Minister made in reply to our request for a limited supply certificate. The Minister's argument suggests that the next step &mdash; if the Bill is to make any sense &mdash; is to abandon film censorship.  There is no point in having film censorship if there is no discretion in relation to videos.  The Film Censor may award an X certificate to a film which means it is only suitable to those of 18 years and older but it will not make much difference if the same film is kept in a video library.  Once a film is allowed in there are no restrictions on video.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that my remarks about &ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; were exaggerated and that videos of that nature could be banned.  However, section 3 clearly states that a certificate will be granted unless the censor is of the opinion that the work is unfit for viewing because the viewing of it would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or avoiding detection.  If <Col N="2358" />&ldquo;The Great Train Robbery&rdquo; is screened showing how people commit a robbery and ways and means of avoiding detection then, according to section 3, the Film Censor cannot grant a supply certificate. Perhaps the Film Censor will say that it is suitable for people of 18 years or over or &mdash; like &ldquo;The Last Temptation of Christ&rdquo;&mdash; you must see the film from the beginning and that it also is only suitable for those of 18 years of age and over. However, a 15 year old can buy or hire a video of the film and there is nothing in the legislation to prevent it.  If we want legislation that becomes a total and utter joke, then have it without classification. All the arguments against classification certainly do not outweigh those in favour of it.  Of course you can argue that it will be difficult to pursue people breaking the law by showing these films but we are talking about those who supply them and who are looking for a licence.  We are not talking about whether I allow my 15 year old child to see a video which the Film Censor recommended should be shown to those of 18 years of age and upwards. I do not want to legislate for what people do in their own homes.  I said earlier &mdash; and I will repeat it &mdash; if I give a glass of Jameson to my 15 year old the law of the land will not interfere with me.  The law says that the person selling alcohol should not sell it to a 15 year old.  The same thing applies to a video, it should not be sold to a 15 year old if it is meant for an 18 year old.  There is no point in saying that you cannot enforce a law of this kind because you cannot provide for a 15 year old not consuming alcohol in the home. Of course the parents must exercise control but the Film Censor should have the power to supply limited certificate to certain films.  If that was the case a parent could examine the video a child had brought back from a library and ensure that it was suitable.</P>
    <P>The Minister is telling us that we should follow Britain's example and that the video association should become the film censor.  On more than one occasion I have heard Deputy Kelly complaining that we follow Britain's example.  Why do we have to follow them?  Can we not <Col N="2359" /> have a film censor who makes up his own mind?  Surely the association can apply their own labels?  The Minister said that the video association will do their own thing, that may be so but they are not the Film Censor.  If I did not put down this amendment I could not defend the legislation at a party or public meeting if someone asked me why unsuitable films were available in video libraries.  How could I answer anyone who makes a reasonable argument of that kind?  I could not and I would make a fool out of myself if I tried to do so.  We are asking the Film Censor to make a black and white decision without giving him any discretion as to whether he should impose classification. I cannot see how it will weaken the legislation if we give the Film Censor power to grant a limited certificate, if he so wishes.  I have always argued that you can make your views known about certain films but that when the censor makes his decision we should accept it.  His hands should not be tied behind his back and the Minister has not convinced me by his arguments in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that we are all trying to be helpful on this issue and that we are not making difficulties.  However, it is part of our task to ensure that we get a sensible, logical and consistent system of legislation on the subject of censorship generally. I understand what the Minister is trying to do but the net effect is to bring in one set of censorship tests for the cinema and a separate set for videos.  You just cannot do that, it is a nice idea but it makes no sense.  There is no logic in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister what is the point in banning films for under 18 year olds while it is perfectly in order for a ten year old to get the film on video?  That would bring the legal system into disrepute. The Minister is trying to squeeze in a separate system for videos and films but the two will have to go hand in hand. If there was a system of vetting films under which they are either passed or not <Col N="2360" /> passed, we could do the same with regard to videos.  I would not approve of that arrangement but if films were either allowed or banned we could say that video films may also be allowed or banned on a similar basis.  That cannot be done because it makes no sense.  It is totally illogical.  We cannot have a legal system that provides one set of tests for videos and another set of tests for films.</P>
    <P>From a cinema proprietor's point of view he would have to do his best to exclude under 18 year olds from seeing a film in the sure knowledge that next door there is a video library where a 12 year old can obtain and see the same film. That cannot be right.  The Minister is creating that kind of situation once he decides that there will be no classification arrangements for videos.  We want to be helpful and to point this out to the Minister. It is just not tenable.</P>
    <P>We should also think of the Film Censor and what his position will be.  He will be put in an impossible position in making decisions on these films.  He will have no leeway at all.  Films will be either banned for everybody or banned for no-one. That makes no sense, if, out of every 100 films, 10 per cent at the top end ought to be banned for everybody, 10 per cent at the lower end ought to be on view for everybody and in between are films that are perfectly appropriate for adults and inappropriate for young people, what is the censor supposed to do in that kind of situation?  The objective of the Bill is that films of a certain category must not be allowed to be viewed by young people, which means that they have to be banned. That is totally wrong because adults are entitled to see those films and it is perfectly in order for them to do so.  It is unduly oppressive on adults to be banned from seeing these films.</P>
    <P>The whole question of censorship is something we have to face up to.  In an ideal world there would not be any censorship but we all have to face the fact that that situation does not exist.  There has to be censorship of some things just as there has to be controls on the sales and licensing of drink and so on.  In a modern liberal democracy our objective <Col N="2361" /> should be a minimalist approach.  The level of censorship that we bring in should be at the lower end of the scale.  We should provide the absolute minimum censorship.  There is a broad view that the Minister's Bill goes much too far down the censorship road and that it is taking a far too extreme position.</P>
    <P>The chairperson of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties put it very strongly &mdash; maybe too strongly &mdash; when he described the Minister's Bill as a noxious form of paternalistic censorship which has no place in a liberal democracy.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 October described it as a bad Bill which will only make things worse.  Maybe those descriptions are a little too extreme but I think the Bill goes too far.</P>
    <P>If there is no classification system the censor will be put in a position where if a film is unsuitable for a young person he will have to ban it.  In other words an adult will not be able to see the film.  That is the objective of the Bill.  It will be extremely difficult for the censor to know where to draw the line.  I spoke about the position with regard to films and the ludicrous situation that will result.  I will give an example of a film which is referred to in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 October.  It is called &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo;, directed by Alan Parker.  I have not seen the film myself.</P>

      <P>It could be described as soft porn.  The Irish censor has passed that film with an over 18 certificate.  That means, if this Bill is passed as it stands, <Col N="2362" /> in so far as videos are concerned that film will be on general release and a 12 year old can get it in a video shop.  I think the Minister said in his speech that the object of the Bill is to ensure that soft porn would not be seen by young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>He said soft porn.  I will check it out because I want to put it on the record.  The Minister said that the position with regard to drink is not a good comparison with that of films.  I think it is a very appropriate and valid comparison. It recognises what the State is or is not supposed to do, what it can reasonably do or what it cannot be expected to do.  If one wanted to take the extreme position and say we will have an absolute control on drink sales to young people one could say we will have prohibition, as happened in the United States, and ban drink.  That would ensure that nobody under age would avail of alcoholic liquor.  The same could apply in this case.  If we wanted to make absolutely sure that no young person would see a film that we think should not be seen by a young person we could say that we will just ban them all but we cannot do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to try to strike a reasonable balance while recognising that there may be some defects and the system may not work 100 per cent.  We have to accept that fact.  That is the thrust of the alcoholic liquor legislation which attempts to strike that balance.  It says we will not allow the sale of alcoholic liquor to young people.  Of course we are not fools.  We all know that, although we provide restrictions to that extent, many young people will get around those restrictions.  Indeed there may be unscrupulous adults who will buy the liquor for them, let them have it and so on.  But that does not mean we should bring in prohibition to deal with that eventuality.  So it is with the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> videos.  We know there may be cases of parents who would not care or other <Col N="2363" /> unscrupulous adults who would get such material for them.  That is something we must recognise and face up to.  That is the alternative obtaining with regard to a classification system.  The other alternative is to adopt an extreme censorship stance and deny adults the viewing of videos that are perfectly proper and in order for them to see.  If one had to choose between those two alternatives I would have no hesitation in going for the more liberal approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister was advancing as possible grounds for support of his measure the fact that it would cost somewhat more, might cause delay and so on.  They are weak arguments which would not withstand the test.</P>
    <P>The basic net issue here is that the House in Committee should not allow this Bill to proceed in a manner that will produce a totally silly and illogical result. I do not know how the Minister can ask us to assist him in passing legislation that would bring about that result.  Once we have and accept a cinema arrangement under which classification takes place, whether or not we like it, we are then left in the position that a similar arrangement must obtain with regard to videos.  Otherwise the provision makes no sense and the defects of that system would be highlighted very rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the Minister's indication that he did not intend to be stubborn on the issue of classification.  However, having listened to what he had to say, it is quite clear that he has his mind made up.  Because the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats has indicated that they are not in favour of amendments other Deputies have tabled our only way of convincing the Minister is by argument rather than threats of defeat on votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point of view I would be anxious to clarify a number of points. Amendment No. 3 in my name and those of other Workers' Party Deputies involves simply a definition of a &ldquo;limited supply certificate&rdquo;.  Amendments Nos. 4 <Col N="2364" /> and 6 are consequential on that definition. The two amendments I am most anxious to promote are Nos. 13 and 14. The reason we have tabled amendments Nos. 13 and 14 is that we are seeking to ensure that, where the official censor grants a certificate in respect of a film and applies age restrictions to the viewing of that film, those same restrictions should apply to a video in respect of which he must automatically issue a certificate. Therefore we argue if the official censor believes a film requires certain restrictions, the same restrictions should apply equally to a video.  That does not necessitate any additional expenditure by the official censor, or any additional effort on his part but simply his passing on the decision he has already taken in regard to a film or a video.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where the Official Censor is of the opinion that any video work in respect of which an application has been made to him for a supply certificate is not fit for general supply, but is fit for supply only to persons above a certain age limit, he may grant to the person making the application a certificate (referred to in this Act as a `limited supply certificate') declaring that such video is fit for supply subject to restriction, conditions or advices (which shall be expressed in the certificate) in regard to the categories of person to whom the video may be supplied.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We tabled that amendment specifically because it appeared to us, from a reading of the Bill as it stands, that the official censor may only accept or reject a video &mdash; excluding the exception referred to already when he must grant one when he has dealt with the relevant film &mdash; if he is of opinion &mdash; and I will quote the relevant subsection, which says:</P>
    <P>(i)  would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes...</P>
    <P>It does not specify the crimes although <Col N="2365" /> the Minister appears to think those provisions apply to crimes against women only.  Obviously there is a much wider range of crimes involved.  Section 3 (1) (a) (i) and (ii) continue:</P>
    <P>whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so or of avoiding detection, or would tend, by reason of the inclusion in it of any obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it,</P>
    <P>The argument has been advanced before but I will reiterate that that is a very broad definition and includes almost anything one might care to think of depending on the approach of the official censor. It has been said, and I would agree, that we have at present a very sensible official censor.  However, we did not always have a sensible official censor.  The official censor did not always adopt a liberal approach to films.  Indeed, as a population, we suffered as a result in terms of the restrictions placed on adults as to what they might view in the cinema.</P>
    <P>Taking section 3, as it stands, I contend that the official censor may only reject or accept a video.  If he accepts it he must have at the back of his mind &mdash; as the provisions of the Bill stand &mdash; that that entails acceptance for all ages and categories and there can be no restriction imposed on anybody walking into a shop to rent or buy that video.  I argue that, unless we give the official censor the right to classify, he will be more likely to ban more videos.  That is my fear.  If you like, I am arguing from a different pole from other Deputies.  I contend that the provisions of this Bill will be more restrictive than we would hope or intend, that the official censor will feel obliged to be more restrictive in terms of the certificates he will grant for videos because he will be aware of the fact that they will not be restricted in terms of their sale or rental. I am concerned that these provisions will result in less availability of adult films on video.  I have no compunction at all in admitting that.  I am not dead from the waist down, no more than, I hope I am dead from the neck up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We would have to ascertain whether or not that is true.  We should not pretend that the only event in which we are interested is the great train robbery.  Life consists of considerably more than that; our needs and feelings deserve more.  Our purpose here is to ensure that the extremely gross, gratuituous violence at present portrayed in video form should not be available particularly to young, immature children who are not in a position to cope with the kinds of emotions that would be aroused as a result of their viewing.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced by the argument that videos, film or television, willy nilly, lead to crime or assault on women.  I advanced that argument on Second Stage and I do not propose to repeat it now. For psychological or other reasons these people are already pre-disposed towards attacking women or old ladies or old men and they will be influenced by video nasties. We should look at this in terms of avoiding unduly restricting the right of the censor to make adult videos available for adults while at the same time ensuring that immature people do not have access to them.  I have already made the arguments in relation to the licensing laws.  If we were to take the view that something is unenforceable and that therefore we should not legislate for it, then there is an argument for doing away with a whole lot of legislation.  I do not accept that argument and I have used the licensing laws as a good example.  The Minister is wrong in saying that we are arguing about the effects of alcohol and the effects of videos.  The question is whether or not we should take the right to restrict or classify certain types of video availability through the shops.  We should take that right in order to give the censor a freer hand in relation to how he decides what videos to let through.</P>

      <P>Earlier I made the point that the difficulty in enforcing a classification system is the main difficulty with these amendments.  To introduce an unenforceable section in this Bill would bring the whole Bill into disrepute and would add to the disrepute with which a lot of legislation is viewed.  I have no objection to the censor having a right to classify as long as we are not obliging him to do something that is not enforceable.</P>
      <P>The argument about how legislation deals with alcohol has a relevance to this debate.  There are two different types of amendments before us, one relating to the supply of videos to under-aged people and the other relates to the supply and viewing of video material.  As the Minister said, the object of the Bill is to restrict the viewing of certain videos to adults.  As far as I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to take out of circulation the kinds of videos which are gross, obscene, which constitute hard pornography and which would incite people to commit crime.  Nevertheless, I have to acknowledge that there is an anomaly in that the decision of the censor has been made regarding a film before it ever gets to the video shops.</P>
      <P>The normal occurrence is that a film is released generally in the cinema and then some years later it is released on video in the video shops.  The censor will have made his decision in the light of the film shown in the cinema and there could be said to be an anomaly between the restriction he places on the film in the cinema and a decision that might be made in relation to videos.  If there were a possibility of restricting the supply of those videos I would be prepared to consider it.  I say that, feeling that the Bill as it stands and the amendments as they stand do not greatly enhance the possibility of enforcing these types of restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My basic objection is still the fact that it would be extremely difficult to enforce this section and this would bring the Bill and other legislation into disrepute.  I have to acknowledge that there is an anomaly here, that there is a comparison to be made with the supply of alcohol, <Col N="2368" /> but the laws relating to the supply of alcohol to young people also bring the legal system into disrepute.  We passed the Intoxicating Liquor Act earlier this year.  It provided the means for further implementing the laws on restricting the supplies of alcohol to young people. Those methods have not been implemented.  The age cards which were allowed for under that Bill have not been introduced and I do not know of any plans the Minister may have for introducing them.  The age cards would enable publicans to decide who can and cannot be supplied with intoxicating liquor.  They could also be used to enforce this legislation. My basic objection is not to the restriction that might be imposed on these films by a censor, but that I doubt the enforceability of it.  If we could find some way around that I would have no objection to having a classification system of some sort in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the evidence given to the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism a list of approximately 30 films considered to be obscene was published by the Director of Public Prosecutions in Britain and it was issued prior to their legislation.  The legislation introduced in Britain has helped to clean up the scene there but there is evidence to suggest that because of the legislation in Britain, which came into effect in September 1986, there has been a certain amount of dumping of some of the video nasties on the Irish market.  It was suggested to the committee in evidence that where pornography is stocked by clubs here either openly or under the counter, these films account for 25 per cent to 33 per cent of turnover and that a comparable figure in Britain would be only 5 to 10 per cent. With that in mind, we should consider the recommendation made that we accept an international coding system for classifying videos and that unclassified videos be banned outright simply because they do not come within the classification system.  There are about 220,000 video machines in the Republic and about 600 outlets.  Some sort of classification should <Col N="2369" /> be brought in and the international classification code is what the report recommends. We should look at that.  If we ban the videos outright we will drive them underground.  The proximity of the Republic to Northern Ireland, the ease with which things can be imported within these islands generally, whether or not they are banned, does not augur well for legislation which would concentrate on banning rather than classifying.  There is a case for classification.</P>
      <P>Within RTE they have what is called a film acceptance viewers' staff group who have to vet films before they are shown. I believe about 70 per cent of RTE's output is acquired programming.  A little over 60 per cent of the population in the Republic have access to other television and radio stations, but in the case of foreign television stations, it is a matter for their legislators to decide what they show on television.  The Minister suggests that we should have control over the videos people can buy and bring into their own homes.  Why is the Minister not concerned about what people can see on their television screen, programmes which are being beamed from foreign stations?</P>
      <P>The legislation on its own does not really address the central problem; it only addresses a part of the problem.  We should not be afraid to say what we want to see available here and we should lay down the law so far as we have control and seek to have that standard adopted throughout Europe, especially the countries which are beaming programmes of violence into our homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in RTE who think they should be above criticism and defend anything they say as &ldquo;using their editorial judgment&rdquo;.  They will be offended if their editorial judgment is called into account. They do not appear to have heard of democracy, although, to be fair, the editorial judgment exercised in RTE is good, but it is not beyond criticism.  In my view, some programmes showing violence get by their staff viewing panel.  I mentioned on Second Stage a programme shown during childrens' viewing time which I <Col N="2370" /> believe is completely unsuitable for young children.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not really addressing the underlying problem of violence in the community and that is what we should be looking at.  Some women's groups gave evidence to the committee and said there was no point banning or controlling videos, but that we had to understand what hard core pornography is and what violence is.  They said somebody should carry out an examination into hard core pornography and violence and look at the various ways they affect the community. I must be fair to RTE because Mr. Finn gave evidence to the committee and I want to put on record a view which concurs with what Deputy De Rossa said and argues a little against what I have been saying to present a fair argument.  Paragraph 7.7 of the report says:</P>
    <P>On the question of the effects of violence on television on young persons RTE informed the committee that it is extremely difficult to establish any casual relationship.  It is extremely expensive to investigate this topic and it is conceptually difficult to link cause and effect.  In 1972 a US Government sponsored study, United States surgeon general's report on the relationship between television violence and behaviour, after conducting 23 prestigious surveys and spending over $1 million could only conclude that there was a preliminary and tentative relationship between violence and television viewing.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting that on record to balance what I have been saying.</P>
    <P>The whole question of violence, in particular in the case of video nasties and hard core pornography, need to be addressed by the Legislature in general. We have to look at the cause and effect before we can look for the solution, and this Bill is only a small part of the solution. So far as we can, we should look at the international classification of videos and we should not be too inclined to ban because that will only have the effect of driving the sale of videos underground.</P>
    <P>I hoped the Minister, as the Minister <Col N="2371" /> for Justice with overall responsibility in this area, would look at the broader problem of violence in the community, its sources, what causes it and what the effects are.  I would like him to tackle this problem from that point of view and not simply introduce a Bill on video nasties three years after the crimes' committee issued their report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental difference between the sides has been well thrashed out over the last hour or more, and it would appear that the Government and the Progressive Democrats have a different view of the legislation than the other parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hopefully.  It would appear that the Government's attitude is that the key element of the Bill is to outlaw the video nasties described by the Minister in his Second Stage speech as extremely violent film but in my view, the legislation is doing more than that. We should be dealing with the supply and control of videos generally.  That was mentioned in the opening paragraph of the Minister's speech when he said the purpose of the Bill was to regulate the sale, hire and supply generally of video recordings.  If we are to take that as the purpose of the Bill, we are doing more than outlawing video nasties, and if we are doing that, we have to think in terms of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to see how one side can say that once the video nasty is banned everything else comes under a general classification. I do not believe we can do that.  In my view section 3 (1) (a) (i) will allow us to do that because that paragraph by itself, goes further than simply outlawing the video nasty.  If we are going to pay particular reference to a piece of material that would be likely to cause persons to commit crime, whether by inciting or encouraging, we have to cut our cloth to suit our measure.  We have to include references to banning and outlawing the <Col N="2372" /> material where young people particularly are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to put a question to the Minister which will have an important practical effect.  Say a parent with his children are out for a Sunday afternoon drive and decide to take home a video for Sunday night viewing.  How does he know if this video is suitable for children if there is no classification on it?  It may be left to the Videogram Association to police this area, but I am not sure if that is sufficient. There is a need to have a clearly defined category shown on a film.  Deputy Taylor referred to the film &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo;.  I have not seen it but I have eaten an ice cream called &ldquo;Angel Heart&rdquo;.  The name of a film can be totally different from its content and we will not know what is in a film unless there is a system of classification. I see a role for the Film Censor here.</P>
    <P>The final question I ask the Minister is, what is the future role of the Film Censor to be on the passing of the legislation as it stands so far as classification is concerned?  I join in what previous speakers have said about the work and role of the censor in the past few years and the difficult task he has.  It is going to be more difficult now for the Film Censor to use the international code he has been using for classification of films for the big screen in the knowledge that he has passed the exact same material uncut, the exact same script from start to finish, under a general classification.  It is going to place him in a very difficult position.  It is also going to add an extra element of pressure in that he may now have certain doubts about a general classification that he would not have if he could include the &ldquo;under 12 with adult&rdquo; or &ldquo;over 16&rdquo; valve that is available in the event of a doubt appearing.  After listening here for a couple of hours my view is that the argument in favour of a blanket in or out is not particularly convincing when one looks at the role of the Film Censor as it is and the international coding referred to by the previous speaker.  I fail to see why that cannot be included for the benefit of the <Col N="2373" /> consumer as well as for the protection of society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has gone.  I agree entirely with what he has said about the problems we have in the modern world with the increasing number of satellite TV stations.  I made that point on Second Stage and suggested that if we could have a European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism we could also have a European Convention for the suppression of violence and pornography through our TV screens or whatever.</P>
      <P>In reply to what Deputy Colley and the Minister said in relation to bringing the law into disrepute, I would not like to be part of any legislature that would do that, but I believe we would have that result if he included classification.  Here we are talking about the supply, as with alcohol. Deputy Taylor made a very good contribution in that regard.  We are talking about controlling supply to certain categories of people and I do not think it would be possible for us to legislate further in this.  We cannot go into the home and legislate for behaviour in the home, but we can say in regard to alcohol, videos or whatever we are talking about that those who have under their control videos or alcohol for sale, hiring, letting or whatever have an obligation to society.  If the Film Censor says that in his opinion a certain video is not suitable for under 18s the person supplying that video has a responsibility to society just as legislators, the Garda Síochána and so on have.  That is all we are saying: you exercise that responsibility and do not supply that video to somebody under that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Censorship of Films Act, 1923 was brought in &mdash; I mentioned this on Second Stage &mdash; there were four categories of certificate that could be issued by the Film Censor in relation to films. He could issue a universal one certifying the film suitable for all, one regarding persons under 12 accompanied by an adult, one in respect of persons over 16 years of age and one in respect of persons over 18 years of age.  That was back in 1923 and it has been operating ever since. <Col N="2374" /> Generally the Film Censor uses his intelligence, skill and ability and there should be very little crib with the manner in which he goes about doing his work, whoever is in the post at the time.  The Film Censor has discretion.  He has four categories and he can say he thinks this film is suitable for anybody, or for people under 12 provided they are accompanied by an adult, for persons over 16 or over 18.  Deputy Flanagan made the real point. A person goes in with his family to a video shop saying, &ldquo;We will stay at home on Saturday night, have a meal and sit down and watch a video.&rdquo;  How is he to know what type of film this is going to be unless somebody gives some direction? At least if there is a little tab on the video which is there as a result of the Film Censor's opinion it is a warning sign.  You may still take it and show it to your kids, but at least there is a warning sign and we have done a job; we have said that this warning sign says what the Film Censor thinks.  You could have nothing or perhaps have to depend on a voluntary exercise on the part of the Irish Videogram Association.  I do not want to suggest for one moment that the videogram association as an association will not do their best to adhere to certain standards and my experience of them to date suggests they are responsible enough as a body, but that is not to say that some of their 600 members, whoever they are, may not remove tabs from videos, and it is not breaking the law.  You cannot really depend on voluntary effort in this regard. It is far more serious than that.  However, if at the moment they are providing a service, so be it, we must be pleased because no legislation is in place, but we are talking about passing legislation to do precisely the same thing and there seem to be grave objections to it.  I do not think we are going to bring the law into disrepute if we provide that the Film Censor has discretion and when he makes his decision we then talk about the supply of the video.  We do not talk about who is going to see it eventually but about the supply of it.  That is the point that must be taken into account.  After that it is <Col N="2375" /> really the responsibility of parents in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say in reply to a couple of points made by Deputy Mitchell of course we have regard to what is contained in the report of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism. There is no doubt about that and I said that on Second Stage.  With regard to another matter he raised which was raised also by Deputy Barrett on the type of material now available for TV having regard to the satellite television era which we are practically in, of course the responsibility for material available on TV in the home is a matter for the Minister for Communications.  We have been in touch with him because with major developments and expansion in TV broadcast services, particularly of a transfrontier satellite transmitted nature, there is concern with regard to standards of programming that may become available. This concern is not unique to ourselves. It is recognised in Europe, and the only effective way to ensure that reasonable standards of broadcasting are maintained is by taking action at international level.  The EC proposed to issue a directive aimed at establishing certain basic standards which member states will be required to impose on broadcasting services originating in their own state. As Deputy Colley said on Second Stage, standards that may be suitable and acceptable in Italy may not be suitable and acceptable here.  There are many problems there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned 30 titles on the British DPP's list.  They would in all probability have prohibition orders made in respect of them under section 6, but that would be a matter for the censor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me directly to a point raised by Deputy De Rossa.  I say to him, bearing in mind the purpose of the Bill with which we all agree, that I am more than satisfied we are bringing in the minimum. We are legislating only in the minimum area here, and there is no reason to be <Col N="2376" /> afraid of making more restrictive censorship. The censor will and must have the freedom to make decisions.  I would refer Deputies to page 5 of the Explanatory Memorandum which says:</P>
    <P>In all cases the existence of the ground will be a question for the Official Censor; and it will be for him to determine, as a matter of discretion, whether the objectionable feature in question is sufficiently serious to justify a refusal of a certificate.  (The Official Censor's decision will be subject to appeal to the Appeal Board under section 9.)</P>
    <P>That latitude is there and nobody will take that away from the censor.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that the legislation has to be realistic.  I am advised and I am satisfied, having given the matter very serious consideration, that the type of classification we are talking about here will not achieve the objectives of the amendments, and I know what the objectives of the amendments are; they have been well and truly stated.</P>
    <P>I can see merit in the suggestion that there should be classification for guidance purposes, and we may be able to get some common ground there; but in my view we should not take away from the role of parents in this area.  If we do that we are in difficulty because the problem lies in the viewing of these films, and parents must have a big influence here.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy De Rossa's point with regard to laying too much emphasis on delay and costs.  They are not that important but are just a small factor.  It is not something I would go to the wall on if additional costs were required to have a good scheme.  It is just a minor point that I made along the way.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to go back over points that have been made not once or twice but many times.  I accept the good faith in which they were made, but we cannot walk away from the basic purpose of the Bill which is to prevent pornographic and video nasty films being available.  We cannot move away from the self-imposed guidance which is necessary in this area.  Classification should <Col N="2377" /> not be seen as a way out for parents or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the discussions that have taken place, I could say that I would give consideration to the possibility of classification for guidance purposes but it would not be enforceable.  If the House feels that there would be some value in that I would be prepared to consider that.</P>

      <P>What we are dealing with now is the question of classification.  I have been arguing very strongly against classification on the grounds that it will not achieve the purposes that the people moving the amendments have been advocating and on the grounds that there is <Col N="2378" /> no way in the world that it would be enforceable.  A valid argument has been made that classification would be of help to parents.  I cannot accept the amendments as they are, but I would certainly be prepared to see if I can come up with something along the lines we have been talking about on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It would give us time to consider what is being proposed. It would certainly, to a large extent, overcome the problem which I foresaw in relation to how constrained a censor might feel if he was passing a video for general release which he felt would not be suitable for young people with no indication to parents or video shops as to who should or should not be allowed to rent it.  While the Minister is correct in saying that under the existing legislation and under the proposed legislation the censor would be free to make decisions, my belief is that as the Bill stands, without some form of classification, he would feel duty bound to restrict films or refuse to pass films which he felt were on the margin, which were not totally of the video nasty type &mdash; and it is a difficult area to judge &mdash; but which were such that he might feel adults in general should be allowed to view if they want to view that kind of thing but at the same time he felt that children under 18 should not be allowed to rent.  As has already been said we are, to a large extent, whether the <Col N="2379" /> law is there or not, depending on the responsibility of the video shop owner or operator in handing out material.  My initial reaction is that I would welcome a more specific idea as to what the Minister is proposing with regard to classification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also think the Minister's compromise is not unreasonable and would be worthy of consideration but I think the Minister is wrong when he says there is no way of implementing control.  I am not in favour of being over-censorious. I am not in favour of vigilantes but if the owner of an outlet must apply for a licence annually, and the granting of a licence is a reserved function of local authorities, at least we have a point of control.  A certain amount of moral pressure can be used to require people operating such outlets to adhere to the code laid down, even if it is not in a statutory form.  If the Minister is fearful that a licence holder may be treated unfairly, and may not have any confidence in the local democratic process, he should adopt the recommendation of the report of the select committee that such people be given a right of appeal to the courts.  If the Minister is prepared to consider that, the type of non-statutory classification now proposed might be acceptable</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on what the Minister means by his statement about classification for the guidance of parents. The notion of classification introduced might not face up to the fact that classification is required.  What is the difference between classification for the guidance of parents and classification on what will or will not be licensed?  There is a dichotomy of thinking there.  While classification is a help I do not think it goes far enough.  To what extent will such a provision influence the censor?  Will the censor say that a film he would otherwise ban will be permitted because he will be in a position to put an unofficial classification on it?  I do not know if the censor will work in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister mentions a <Col N="2380" /> classification system at all indicates that he is aware that videos fall into different categories and classes.  The Minister must have some doubt about the question because otherwise he would not mention classification.  Once we have classification and different clases we should face up to the problem.  The amendments are reasonable and as enforceable as any provision could be.  I agree that they may not be fully enforceable but they can be enforced within limits.  If enforceability is to be the test the Bill will be a complete failure.  It will not succeed if we are looking for a high degree of enforceability because we have not succeeded in dealing with the very large illegal operation that has been going on for years in regard to videos.  According to information furnished to me one-third of all videos that go through the channels are pirated and illegal.  We have not made any great stand about enforcing the law in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no legislation to cover them; the copyright Act does not deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The copyright Act makes pirating illegal.  That illegal operation involves huge sums of money and has been going on for years.  We should not say that because a provision will not be 100 per cent enforceable we should not have introduced it.  Otherwise, a lot of legislation would not be introduced.  The problem we face is twofold.  The Bill will not achieve what it sets out to achieve; it will achieve something it does not set out to achieve.  The Minister told us that the objective of the Bill is to prevent children viewing unsuitable videos.  However, the Bill does not achieve that objective in the context of cinemas.  A film, that may be banned for under 18s in cinemas may be readily available for 11-year olds on video.  Will the Minister say how the Bill will prevent children viewing unsuitable videos? In my view they will be licensed to view unsuitable videos.  The main thrust of the Bill is supposed to prevent children viewing unsuitable videos but it will do the reverse, it will give them a <Col N="2381" /> licence to see films that the censor has decided should not be seen by those under 18.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be doing something it is not intended to do, namely preventing adults from seeing films which are appropriate for them to see although there has not been any suggestion that the Bill is intended to stop adults seeing films that are proper for them to see.  There is a double flaw in the Bill and the Minister has not dealt with them.  The classification system will go a long way towards dealing with one of those difficulties.</P>
      <P>The extent to which pornographic films will be banned has been referred to.  Earlier I asked if the Minister had said anything about soft porn.  I should like to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 July 1987 by Mary Cummins to the effect that tough new laws to ban video nasties would be introduced in the Seanad by mid-September and would probably be in force before Christmas. According to that article, which was based on statements by the Minister for Justice the previous day, the laws would include soft porn and blue or hard porn movies.  It may be that comment was unfair and was not intended.  However, it is interesting to note that the same article stated that the Minister was hopeful of consensus on the matter and expected the law to pass through the Oireachtas relatively quickly.  It said that he was also open to taking on board amendments to the Bill.  It is important that he should be reminded of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that the censor must have the freedom to make decisions, and I accept that, but the question of his terms of reference arises.  They are crucial, as they were in connection with the revision of constituencies. People have different views as to what comes within the category of pornography. We have to remember that the censor, under the terms of this Bill, would be under intense pressure from those many organised groups, mostly those at the conservative end of the spectrum who would bring pressure to bear.  We have <Col N="2382" /> seen that before.  Those conservative and ultra-conservative groupings will be putting intense pressure on the censor where many of these videos would be concerned. They will say to the censor that this film, which might be a good film and quite appropriate for adult viewing, if it is licensed, children will see it and, therefore, it ought to be banned.  That is bound to be a telling argument with the censor and this is the nub of the problem. Whichever way you look at it you will cut out from adult viewing a large proportion of material without any justification, which is totally inappropriate, all for the sake of trying to control the young person's aspect of it, that is literally throwing out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>The objective of controlling these things for young people is correct.  We all support the Minister in that and it is needed.  The Minister is going too far down that road and he is saying that to achieve that end we have to cut out viewing for adults as well, right across the board, and that is where it becomes difficult.  There is no other way around that other than the classification arrangement. That was the position in the cinemas. It worked reasonably well.  The cinema is a controlled situation and I accept that but it depends on the honesty and the acceptance of the law by the cinema proprietors.  The letting out of video films is also controlled by the owners of the video shops.  One has to assume that while there will always be cowboys and bandits who will break the law, the overwhelming bulk of licensed video shop owners &mdash; as is the case with the bulk of cinema owners &mdash; will obey the law and if the restrictions are there they will have regard to them.  If they do not obey the law, under the licensing arrangements they can be made amenable and that might not be all that difficult. They might be worried about losing their licence if they were to break the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is some other way of dealing with this dilemma other than by classification.  If there is, I cannot think of it.  If anybody else can think of another way of doing it he should say so and we <Col N="2383" /> could look at it.  I can think of no other way.  Classification is not a perfect way either, it has its faults, but it is the best line open to us to give a balanced result, a fair result and logical result, particularly when compared with the cinema situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I would be only too pleased to co-operate in any way I could in finding a solution to this problem without having to vote certain measures through the Chamber.  Deputy De Rossa's amendment is very similar to mine.  We had included &ldquo;supplied or viewed&rdquo;.  I would be prepared to delete &ldquo;or viewed&rdquo;.  The Minister is talking about certification of video works and he is referring to a supply certificate.  We are dealing only with supply certificates.  We have made progress because the Minister said he would look at it and we have the option on Report Stage of retabling an amendment.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record that we reserve that right to retable our amendments. It is grand saying that the Minister is prepared to look at it in the context of giving guidance to parents.  Like Deputy Taylor, I cannot see how that can be done because what we are talking about here is the censor making a decision based on what he sees.  The censor is being afforded the opportunity of issuing a supply certificate &mdash; not a viewing certificate &mdash; and surely in addition to issuing a supply certificate he can issue a &ldquo;limited supply certificate&rdquo;.  In other words, the &ldquo;limited supply certificate&rdquo; would be that persons under 18 should not be supplied &mdash; not that they should not be allowed view it.  The only thing I can think of &mdash; and it is in keeping with what we have all spoken about earlier &mdash; is the farcical situation that could arise <i>vis-à-vis</i> films and cinemas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to enforcement, I would like to endorse what Deputy Taylor said.  If we are going to look at enforcement from the outside we will never get anywhere. I have yet to see a member of the Garda Síochána walking along a cinema queue asking people what age they are, if there <Col N="2384" /> was a sign up that this film is for over 18-year olds and over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor have I ever heard of a single prosecution in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>But the reality is that a large number of cinema proprietors will say: &ldquo;We will adhere to the rules of the Film Censor&rdquo;.  By and large you will not see 12 and 13 year olds getting into a film which has a certificate for 18 and upwards.  I cannot say it has never happened. I have never seen a member of the Garda Síochána walking up and down a cinema queue &mdash; I do not think any of us would expect them to, because they have plenty of other things to do.  There is always the option that if a cinema proprietor is constantly abusing the certificate that has been issued by the censor you can go along to the local superintendent and say: &ldquo;Would you ever do something about this?&rdquo; Then the Garda Síochána have the power &mdash; and that is the important thing &mdash; to go and do something about it with the cinema proprietor. Under this system the Minister will also have the power because he can make regulations under this Bill in relation to the issue of licences, and he can issue amending orders at any stage setting out under what conditions a licence will be issued.  If the Minister has not got that power he should give it to himself now.</P>
      <P>If the Minister finds that he is getting numerous complaints about a particular video shop and that they are not adhering to the law regarding a &ldquo;limited supply certificate&rdquo;, when the licence comes up for renewal he can always deal with that individual by not renewing the licence. He does not have to think about enforcing the law in terms of Garda Síochána time.  There are other ways of enforcing the law besides having members of the Garda Síochána visiting video shops every second day of the week.  I would ask the Minister, when considering this matter, to think about a supply certificate not a viewing certificate &mdash; and a limited supply certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2385" /> The debate this morning was worthwhile. We have said it all at this stage.  I would be prepared to postpone pressing our amendment if I thought that the Minister would give this matter genuine and serious thought.  He knows our feelings and I think we are trying to achieve the same thing.  We do not want to end up with legislation that looks foolish and we do not want to impose unnecessary restrictions.  Like Deputy Taylor, I have not yet come across any other method that can be used other than a limited supply certificate in order to achieve what we want to achieve.</P>

In both cases, the road has been raised over recent years but, while this action has reduced the extent of flooding, it has not eliminated the problem.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 10 and 54 together.  Following the severe weather last month, I asked local authorities in the affected areas to prepare reports on the extent of flood damage which had occurred.  I also sought their views on immediate remedial measures which they consider necessary and on the question of works which might usefully be undertaken to prevent a recurrence of flooding.  In addition, I <Col N="2391" /> asked the local authorities to carry out an investigation into the extent of flood damage to houses, to quantify the remedial work required and to identify householders who, through lack of insurance cover or otherwise, may now be suffering hardship.</P>
      <P>Reports relating to damage to public property have now been received from a number of the local authorities concerned, including Cork and Waterford County Councils.  I am now considering what further action should be taken in the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of EC funds, the EC has set aside a budget of 3 million ECU, approximately £2.3 million, in 1988 to allow the EC to come to the assistance of people in the Community who are victims of natural catastrophies which are recognised as being of exceptional scale and gravity.  Applications for assistance from the Disaster Fund is not appropriate in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) on the disposal of hospital waste in the Dublin area and to a survey carried out in that respect, indicating that the disposal of hospital waste at present is not being carried out in accordance with the highest possible standards and the present methods of disposal could lead to air or water pollution and to the possibility of toxins being introduced into the environment; the action he or any of his colleagues intend to take to remedy the situation, where hospitals designed to facilitate the highest standards of health care, may unwittingly be contributing to ill-health among the population on account of these deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers appears to be an internal report to a sub-committee of Dublin Corporation who are responsible under the <Col N="2398" /> European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of all waste operations in their area.  My Department are, however, at present in communication with the Department of Health in relation to the general question of disposal of hospital wastes including, in particular, a European Community proposal to include hospital and other clinical wastes in a new and extended definition of hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>As regards disposal of hospital waste by incineration, the Air Pollution Act, 1987 obliges the occupiers of non-domestic premises, including premises belonging to the State, to use the best practicable means to prevent or limit air pollution.  Hospital incinerators are within the scope of the Act and subject, therefore, to its general provisions.  I have recently made regulations entitled the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Licensing and Industrial Plant) Regulations, 1988 which established a licensing system for new plant to which the Act applies and for certain classes of existing plant in which specified processes, including the incineration of solid or liquid chemical waste, take place.  I intend that, in due course, all existing plant, including existing hospital incinerators, will be brought within the scope of the licensing system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the reference to &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; that perturbs me.  Am I right in saying that the nature of hospital waste is such that it contains, or can contain, serious toxins and carcinogens and that at present in the survey referred to here of 21 Dublin hospitals, very many of these had standards of incineration and disposal of wastes which were utterly unacceptable and illegal?  Am I right in saying that they would be likely to lead to the emission of the kind of substances to which I have just referred?  Would the Minister tell me what exactly he is doing immediately to deal with the crisis which some of these hospitals have?  In one place, for example, there are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious case, but I do not want to go on too long about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point of view on the matter that incineration of all kinds of waste is important, but particularly clinical waste.  It must be of serious concern and, as the Deputy quite rightly says, a few incidents did take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>A few that were brought to our notice, in so far as the disposal of clinical waste on landfill tips is concerned. That is why we are pursuing efforts to arrive at a defined code of practice with which the health authorities and medical staff generally should be obliged to comply, and they will be so obliged.  An important aspect in regard to the regulations, is that they will be applied to new plant as at 1 February but progressively after that to all existing plant, including incineration plant.  In support of that, the Commission itself is conscious of the very problem about which the Deputy has been talking &mdash; and I share his concern. A new hazardous waste directive is being put together which will include hospital wastes and how they should be dealt with effectively.  In the meantime we are getting a code of practice agreed on in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of a code of practice, but simply that the incinerators in many of the hospitals at present are, by definition of age and inadequacy as referred to in the report, simply not able to burn the waste at a temperature which would not allow toxins to escape.  It is not a question of a code of practice, but of plant being inadequate. Am I right in saying that there have been proposals in front of the Department of Health and perhaps the Department of the Environment for many months seeking permission to install incinerators <Col N="2400" /> which will do the job?  Would that not help to solve the problem?  Why does the Minister not act in that respect?  The directives in place at present are simply being ignored.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 19, 35 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my recent meeting with officials of local authorities who are responsible for administering the 1988 tenant purchase scheme which I introduced last February, I am satisfied that the scheme is proving very successful, with a record number of applications already received and that it will achieve its objective of enabling many more tenants than would otherwise have been able to do so to purchase their own homes. As the final date for the receipt of applications is 31 December 1988.  I emphasised to the officials the importance of again reminding tenants who have not yet applied of the terms of the <Col N="2403" /> scheme.  Eligibility for this scheme is confined to tenants of local authority dwellings at 1 January 1988 and I do not propose to make any changes in this respect.</P>
    <P>Authorities may include flats, other than those provided for and occupied by elderly persons, in their schemes. Recently Dublin Corporation sought and obtained my approval in principle for their outline scheme to allow tenants of certain flats to apply to purchase under the scheme.  I understand that the report of the working group on the sale of flats, which was delayed because tenant surveys were not completed by Dublin Corporation, is being finalised at present. When I receive the report, I will consider what further action is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does &ldquo;approval in principle&rdquo; to the scheme mean that tenants can now apply to buy their flats?  Because of staff shortages in Dublin Corporation many people who will have applied before the end of the calendar year will not have had their applications processed.  Will the Minister indicate their legal status in relation to their eligibility to avail of the benefits of the 1988 scheme when the year ends?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is yes.  In relation to the second question, because of the numbers involved all those who applied before the end of this calendar year will be eligible, even though it will take some time after that to deal with and finalise their applications. I seek the support of Deputies in making this widely known.  The whole business need not be completed this year, the important thing is to have your application in and staff will deal with the matter subsequently.</P>

It is not my intention to allow anybody else into the scheme other than those who were in occupation on 1 January 1988.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 97, 98, and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Details of completion are not available to my Department in the format requested by Deputy Sherlock.  In 1988 it is expected that completions overall will be about 1,500.  It is not possible at this stage to give precise figures for houses to be completed in 1989; however, it is anticipated that completions nationally will be in the region of 1,000.</P>
      <P>I expect local authority housing completions together with dwellings becoming available from the existing stock for reletting to provide a reasonably adequate level of housing provision in 1989 given the present reduced level of needs.  At 31 December 1987, the latest date for which details are available, there were approved applications for local authority housing from 3,951 single parents, 4,337 elderly and 13,706 families of two or more persons.  The numbers of local authority houses completed each year from 1980 to 1987 by individual housing authorities were given in reply to Question No. 218 of 19 April 1988; the number of dwellings commenced by each housing authority each year, 1982 to 1988 were given in reply to Questions Nos. 13, 20 and 120 of 26 October 1988.  Regarding completion this year, housing authorities provide details of activity on their housing construction programme to my Department on a quarterly basis.  In the nine months to 30 September 1988 1,095 houses were completed.</P>

I do not have to explain what that means but, in view of <Col N="2407" /> the fact that there has been a reduction in the number of local authority houses constructed because of the £5,000 grant made available by the Department to people who wish to vacate local authority houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the housing stock coming back to local authorities is very limited.  Will the Minister agree that because the local authority SDA loan is practically unavailable, there will be a greater need for local authority housing?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that housing is an important matter and that the number of houses becoming available for reletting is slowing down because of the end of the £5,000 scheme.  Local authorities are expected to make about 3,000 relettings from existing dwellings which become vacant this year.  That is a rough estimate but it seems to be adequate to deal with our requirements at present.  However, things are changing and the matter must be very carefuly watched.  I do not agree with the Deputy's remarks in relation to the SDA.  I agree that there is not as big a take-up of these loans despite the fact that quite a substantial sum of money was &mdash; and is &mdash; available.  That has been replaced by very active participation in mortgage funding by the other institutions. I understand, from notice given to me, that there is going to be quite an amount of increased activity by other institutions in that regard again next year.</P>

Would he agree that, as a result, in 1989 there will be in the region of 15,000 housing applicants looking for a local authority house while only 1,000 houses will be built.  This Government have laid the foundations for a housing crisis as we approach 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has any plans to provide for a greater role for local authorities in tourism development; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have a primary role in relation to the environment generally which is of crucial importance in relation to tourism development.  My Department have drawn the attention of the local authorities to various specific measures of relevance to them, including litter prevention, water pollution control, cleaning of beaches, as well as the need for proper maintenance of facilities such as car parks, public toilets, signposting and landscaping.  In addition, local authorities carry out long-standing programmes for the development of local amenities and the improvement of leisure and tourist facilities.  Proposals for the reorganisation of local government which are under consideration at present <Col N="2415" /> include wide new powers for local authorities to undertake, on their own initiative or in combination with other interests, measures for environmental improvement and the provision of facilities and amenities and will also provide a new legislative framework which will allow local authorities to play a role in relation to the overall development of their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister say that future reform of local government policy will provide for the involvement of local authorities in the promotion of tourism?  I am well aware of the involvement of local authorities in environmental matters, pollution and so on.  By reason of the very substantial public funding available for tourism and the fact that some regional bodies do not have contact with areas where there is such potential, would the Minister confirm that he will introduce some measure in order to give local authorities more say statutorily in the matter of the development of the tourism potential of their areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have a very important role to play in the development of the tourism potential of their areas and have always taken that seriously.  The Deputy might remember that I spent 21 years as a member of a local authority with a huge coastline, a high amenity area.  I might tell the Deputy that that local authority were not merely involved with the special committees dealing with tourism but regarded it as an essential part of their activities.  I would be taken aback if I thought that any local authority with representatives in this House were not taking that up as a serious challenge because the potential for tourist development is agreed by all.  A local authority is the premier authority in the area and can do an enormous amount in helping to provide the necessary facilities which render tourism really worth while.  I do not get the gist of the point except that I am fully in support of local authorities <Col N="2416" /> being involved in a very critical way in the development of tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there has been a reduction in the rates support grant that has been made available to local authorities.  I am saying that local authorities, just as every other authority in the country, have had to take their share of cuts in the pursuit of national recovery. We have had extraordinary good results from one initiative taken by local authorities, in co-operation with the agricultural sector and the Department over the past year, that was in relation to the whole question of the fish kills drama we had last year which has been counteracted. That has been achieved with the co-operation of farmers, local authorities who gave the lead in the surveys and <Col N="2417" /> enforcement of existing legislation.  That is an indication of what local authorities can do, particularly now when they are involved in the drawing up of recommendations for the regional plans under their advisory committees that will form part of the national plan, going forward to benefit from the new structural funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 34, 87 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent smog episode in Dublin has already given rise to breaches of the EC and national air quality standards for smoke.  Breaches of the daily value for more than three consecutive days were <Col N="2420" /> recorded in Ballyfermot, Cabra, Crumlin, Rathmines, Mountjoy Square, Quarryvale and Neilstown.  Breaches of the 98 percentile, i.e. where eight or more breaches of the daily value have occurred were recorded in Ballyfermot, Cabra, Crumlin and Neilstown.  These will be notified to the EC Commission as required when results for the year ending March 1989 are available.  Breaches for the years since 1983-84 when the directive came into force are set out in a table which will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Measures under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 to deal with the problem in Dublin are under way and, following my recent discussions with senior officials of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, the special control area order programme is being accelerated.  Other measures already taken or in hands are: new local authority houses in built up areas of the city and county to be so designed and equipped as to minimise smoke emissions; a programme will be developed for converting existing local authority houses and flats in these areas to smokeless heating systems through the remedial works scheme or otherwise; new house grants in these areas will be confined to houses with smokeless heating systems; a directive is being issued to planning authorities indicating that heating arrangements in new and substantially reconstructed domestic and other development in built up areas where there are smoke problems should be non polluting and a publicity and information campaign to encourage the use of smokeless fuels and heating systems is being prepared.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have had discussions with representatives of various sectors of the fuel industry resulting directly in a reduction in the price of smokeless coal and assurances of greatly increased availability and promotion of smokeless fuels generally.  Arrangements for a smog alert system have been agreed.  I am considering what further measures may be necessary to deal with the problem and hope to be able to make a further statement in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Following his meeting with officials of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation the Minister indicated that there would be some major developments.  What additional special controlled areas orders are going to be made?  The only change in the position since the Minister's meeting is that the special control area that is now in existence in Ballyfermot may be extended to an additional portion of Ballyfermot. No substantive action of any nature has been taken to provide either smoke free zones or smoke control areas other than the indication that it might be extended to another portion of Ballyfermot.  What other areas will it apply to, and when will the necessary action be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question about the making of the order is a matter for the local authority under the legislation.  At the meeting I had with the officials of the two authorities we discussed all the aspects the Deputy referred to.  I cannot give exact dates as to when the order may be made or modified as it is for another authority to take the initial steps and there will have to be submissions and publications, notices and possible inquiries or whatever.  I can say that the authorities involved will be considering the next area in Ballyfermot, about 982 houses and that it is their intention to be able to proceed with that matter before Christmas, with the proviso that I have already put in there.  A further 2,000 houses is contemplated in this regard in Ballyfermot and it is expected that that matter can be expedited and cleared before the middle of January.  Following on that Cabra and Crumlin will be considered <Col N="2423" /> but it is for the authorities to decide on the matter.  I have powers to give directions but good progress is being made.  The next areas to be dealt with will be Mountjoy, Rathmines and then Neilstown which is a big centre of 3,500 houses.  That order will have to be made by the county council and they are pursuing that actively right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that on the basis of what he is telling the House now, there is little prospect that orders will be made for any area other than the Ballyfermot area, this side of 1990?  Will the Minister use his directional powers to ensure, at the minimum, that immediate steps are taken to provide special control areas in Cabra, Crumlin, Rathmines, Mountjoy Square, Neilstown and other areas mentioned? Will the Minister indicate in what way his discussions with the council and corporation officials changed the situation from what it was before those discussions took place and if additional action is being taken by either local authority to tackle this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Action is being taken and the local authorities involved have indicated not just their willingness to pursue the matter but to expedite the question of making orders.  I at least would expect Deputy Shatter to understand that the provisions of the legislation should be applied and that if delays apply to the making and confirming of orders these delays are absolutely necessitated by the provisions of the legislation.  It is reasonable that when an order that affects the lives of all the individuals encompassed by it is being made, the steps should be properly taken.  One can speed them up but they should at least be taken properly. Once the order is made it is appropriate that it be published and it is proper that individuals, groups or organisations, should get the opportunity to object if they wish, not forgetting that the order that is now being pursued in Ballyfermot was subject to 12 objections, some of <Col N="2424" /> which came from the residents who were representing themselves.  It is right in a democracy that if people have an objection they should be allowed to put it. Once the objections have substance I am bound by the legislation to hold inquiries. So far as the first area order is concerned steps were taken expeditiously but naturally there are delays attached to getting things organised, hearing the evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the Government policy with regard to discouraging the use in this country of landfill as an appropriate dumping ground of all forms of untreated hazardous wastes which at present is the practice here; if his attention has been drawn to a recent speech by Mr. Thomas Voltaggio of the United States Environmental Protection Agency who said that hazardous wastes dumped as landfill pose a potential environment timebomb; that land filling of untreated hazardous wastes has been outlawed in the United States in view of the major possibility of groundwater pollution of leaking dumps and other hazards; what the Government's policy is in this respect; the numbers of dumps at present in this country where such practices occur; and his intentions in this respect for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no knowledge of the statements referred to.  I am assured, however, that properly engineered and properly managed landfill is internationally accepted as a technically sound and environmentally satisfactory means of disposing of an extensive range of industrial waste, including certain hazardous wastes.  There are, of course, <Col N="2426" /> many wastes which are definitely not suitable for landfill.</P>
      <P>Under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, each local authority are responsible for the planning, organisation and supervision of operations for the disposal of any toxic and dangerous wastes which arise in their functional area.  In practice, about two thirds of the hazardous wastes which arise in this country are suitably disposed of by the producers.</P>
      <P>Most of the balance is exported for treatment and disposal abroad and only a small percentage is landfilled.  I am not in a position to give details of the number of landfill sites at which hazardous wastes are accepted for disposal.  There is no evidence, however, to suggest that other than satisfactory disposal standards are employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not stand in the Chair's way.  The Minister said he was not in a position to give details of the location and numbers of landfill sites at which hazardous wastes were dumped. That was in my question.  May I ask that the Minister either now or at a future date supply that information to the House because he should be anything but consoled about the open season in terms of dumping of hazardous waste and toxic waste all over the country, particularly when such practices are banned in other countries and are not accepted internationally, as his reply says.  When he stands here and admits that he cannot even give the number of those sites, that is alarming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the action, if any, he proposes to take to reduce the level of fatal road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Road accident rates in this country compare favourably with rates in other member states of the European Community.  Between 1978 and 1986 road deaths declined by 39 per cent and injuries by 17 per cent.  While this steady decline was interrupted in 1987, figures for the first nine months of this year would suggest that the accident rate this year will be broadly in line with last year. I am not at all complacent about these figures, however.  There are a number of areas where I have recently taken action, or which I am having examined or where action is contemplated on a community-wide basis.</P>
      <P>On a broad front, improvements in our roads infrastructure by eliminating danger spots and reducing traffic flows through our towns and cities should have a beneficial effect on road safety and I have comprehensive proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" /> I have introduced regulations providing for the introduction of ramps and bollards, primarily to reduce excessive speeds in residential areas and I have commenced an experiment in the use of evidential breath testing, on a voluntary basis, with a view to providing the Garda Síochána with a more effective means of detecting and consequentially reducing drink driving.</P>
    <P>Measures which I am having examined include the introduction of a new range of speed limits, which will be rigorously enforced and regulations to control the parking of heavy goods vehicles in urban areas.  Measures contemplated on a community wide basis include the provision of rear seat safety belts and the extension of the compulsory testing for road worthiness of mechanically propelled vehicles.</P>
    <P>Finally, the promotion of programmes aimed at heightening public awareness of the causes of road accidents and educating the public to preventative measures will continue to be undertaken by the National Safety Council.  I intend to launch their Christmas drink-driving campaign on Wednesday next.  I hope it is a big success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in 1986 387 people died on our roads and that the corresponding figure in 1987 was 462?  The Minister is indicating a similar number will die this year.  In effect, more people die on our roads than die annually in the tragic Northern Ireland conflict. Would the Minister indicate what additional sanctions he intends to introduce into the law to prevent people driving while drunk, placing the lives of every person at risk?  Would he consider extending the community service order scheme so that those convicted of drunken driving are not simply fined but face the possibility of the sanction of having to undertake community service?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many landlords of private flats are refusing to rent their property to prospective tenants with young children; if he will take any action to ensure that this form of discrimination against vulnerable families and young children in need of housing will be prevented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Tenancies in the private rented sector are a matter for arrangement between the landlord and the prospective tenant, subject to the provisions in landlord and tenant law which are in general the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  It is my view that undue interference or stringent regulatory measures discourage the provision of accommodation for renting and lead to an imbalance between the supply and demand which is not in the best interests <Col N="2430" /> of persons seeking private rented accommodation. The Government's approach has been to encourage the creation of conditions which are favourable to private investment in the provision of rented accommodation including tax incentives as a means of increasing the supply of such accommodation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not recognise two things: first, there is a problem in the urban areas and second, he has within his specific power the right to ensure that any landlord or developer who benefits from any form of tax allowance or other type of fiscal benefit from the State by way of grant should be prohibited from introducing discriminatory renting practices of the kind I have mentioned in return for receiving such allowances?</P>

    <P>Tenancy agreements are private contracts between landlords and tenants and landlords have some discretion in the letting of their properties.  What we are trying to do is increase the investment from the private sector to make such tenancies available, and we did that with the section 23 type of arrangement, trying to draw in more money to provide the <Col N="2431" /> accommodation necessary to deal with what is a growing demand.</P>

Would he not recognise that if it is proper for a local authority to interfere in the market supply of properties by specifying certain standards of accommodation, it is equally proper for the Minister for the Environment to interfere in the market supply to protect the rights of citizens who have children and cannot afford to get a mortgage on their own?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased in my new role as Minister for Energy to pick up where my predecessor left off and to advance this wide-ranging legislation relating to Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be seen as a major step to provide the board and management of Bord na Móna with some of the main tools they need to restructure and revitalise the operations of the board, in order to deal with their present great difficulties. The Bill's main purpose is to provide greater flexibility in the ways the board may adopt to reorganise and restore their core peat business to a sound financial basis, to enable them to engage in other activities in which they have acquired particular expertise; to enable the board to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies and to enter into joint ventures, to exploit cutaway bogs and other bogs not required for peat production; to undertake engineering and building works not related to peat; and to engage in consultancy, advisory and training activities.</P>
      <P>All this is to lay a sound basis to preserve jobs and long-term viable employment and to contribute to regional and national prosperity.  At the same time the opportunity is being taken to effect a number of other minor amendments relating to pensions, accounting procedure and pay policy in the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Bord na Móna were first set up in 1946 their functions were restricted essentially to the extraction, production, marketing and sale of turf and turf products and all ancillary requirements necessary for this purpose.  The board have, therefore, no power at present to engage in any activity not strictly related to peat. In this new Bill, an opportunity is being afforded to the board to extend themselves further into peat-related developments, and into areas which, though not peat-related, are areas where the board have acquired or are likely by the nature <Col N="2474" /> of their operations to have potential expertise.  The Government's commitment to the future of Bord na Mona is clearly in evidence.  The board believe they can exploit their opportunities.  This Bill is designed to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, this Government have sought with outstanding success to regenerate the economy by creating a climate conducive to economic growth.  Central to efforts to achieve our full economic and social potential is the better utilisation of our resources, human and natural, and the fullest application of science and technology. To further that aim State-sponsored bodies are being actively encouraged and facilitated to develop and diversify their economic activities in the interest of job creation.  Where new legislation is required to achieve this the Government undertook to bring such legislation forward.  This Bill is a measure to do that and indeed, specifically, a number of development proposals submitted as part of the board's contribution to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> require legislative changes to make them possible.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the board will be permitted to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies, either within the State or abroad.  The power of State-sponsored bodies to form or take part in subsidiary companies is nothing new. Earlier this year my predecessor gave the necessary statutory power to the ESB to set up companies.  With this Bill I am now giving similar powers to Bord na Móna. The board will, therefore, have flexibility to develop new emphasis, particularly in marketing, which I see as a vital ingredient in securing the future of the board. These new powers will be of major assistance in the exploitation of new business opportunities, not only at home but abroad.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the remit of Bord na Móna up to this time was restricted. Through this new Bill positive encouragement is given to the board to expand their activities and to take advantage both at home and abroad of the expertise they have acquired as one of <Col N="2475" /> the world's leading peat producing companies. Now, with this extension of commercial freedom the board can broaden the scope of their activities and take advantage of their expertise in production engineering, mechanical and civil engineering, in horticultural products marketing, resource management, operations management, project management, personnel management and training.</P>
    <P>With reference to horticultural markets in particular, of which the board's peat moss is an outstanding success, I note that this is seen as one of the more promising areas for development by the board under the new powers.  I am pleased to see that horticultural peat products are currently the most dynamic and encouraging component in the company's product range.  Indeed, I understand that Bord na Móna are the international brand leader in this market with sales of £22 million, 90 per cent of which is for export.  This clearly therefore is an area with great potential in which future success will demand flexibility in strategy, pricing and organisation as is provided under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also permit Bord na Móna to engage in joint ventures in relation to their business as extended and defined in this Bill both here and abroad.  Obviously it is intended that the board should participate only in companies or joint ventures which will be able to pay their way and in this regard participation in joint venture is subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy and of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In order to optimise the potential benefits of this new remit, clearly the current position of Bord na Móna with their adverse financial position must be improved.  Improvement of their core business and diversification into profitable new ventures are the keystones and the latter should not occur at the expense of the former.  The board themselves have accepted that in order to address their strategic weaknesses a change in corporate culture is required.  Bord na <Col N="2476" /> Móna must be transformed from a production-oriented organisation, their traditional role, to one which is market led. They must face the increased challenge of hydrocarbon fuels greatly reduced in price, and likely to remain so.  They must cut costs and become more competitive. They must cope with their heavy indebtedness and high interest charges.</P>
    <P>As part of the fairly far-reaching transformation seen as necessary, this Bill will allow Bord na Móna, subject to my approval, to delegate certain of their functions to sub-boards.  The powers of Bord na Mona can, under the 1946 Act, only be exercised through the main board, but this Bill provides the main board with power to adopt another route by permitting the establishment of sub-boards and authorising the exercise of some of their powers through them.  The drafting of this section of the Bill, however, reflects my belief that these sub-boards should only have powers as defined for them, and conferred on them, by written delegation of the main board. These sub-boards will be appointed by the board themselves, and the members will be drawn from the membership of the board.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress also that these sub-boards will not, of course, be empowered to do anything which is not within the power of the board at present.  Their purpose is to ease the plenary board's workload, to reduce the time necessary to get through the business, to enable the sub-boards to give more concentrated attention to particular areas of problems and to facilitate a speeding up of the decision making process.  I accordingly propose to supply the required power, which is rather similar to that commonly found in the rules of management of private sector companies.  Furthermore, this particular provision is not intended to indicate my approval of any particular restructuring plan for the activities of Bord na Móna.  The Bill enables routes to be adopted if that is what is finally decided as in the best interests of the board.  I would not be prepared to consider sanctioning changes until the consultants, who have been commissioned <Col N="2477" /> by the Minister for Energy to undertake a review of the board's operations, have reported to me next March.  I will refer in more detail to that consultancy study later.</P>
    <P>At present the board may only exercise certain of its powers within the State. This was unduly restrictive in the effort to develop new markets abroad.  Section 4 of this Bill allows the board subject to ministerial approval to exercise the necessary powers abroad and to enable them to exploit foreign market opportunities.</P>
    <P>In considering the options for the board's future one obvious question is the future uses of bogs from which the commercial quantities of turf have already been extracted and which are not suitable for forestry purposes.  In July 1987 the Government decided that the Bord na Móna cutaway bogs which were suitable for forestry were to be transferred to the Forestry Service of the Department of Energy.  This decision applies to those cutaway lands at present available for planting and to those areas of cutaway which will become available in the future. The acreage involved to date is 3,770 hectares of which 2,824 hectares has been transferred to the Forestry Service.  This area will rise in the future as more and more bogs are depleted in so far as commercial exploitation by Bord na Móna is concerned.  That decision was taken primarily out of the Government's concern to ensure a measure of alternative employment in these areas.</P>
    <P>At present, the board's own activities on cutaway bogs are largely for research purposes.  The board have no statutory power to use cutaway bogs to establish any activity unrelated to peat production for which there may be a commercial opportunity.  This Bill provides the board with such power but, I must emphasise, that as far as cutaway bog is concerned, the power applies ony to cutaway which is not required for forestry purposes and there will be no departure from the earlier Government decision or from the administrative arrangement set up thereunder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2478" /> In this context I wish to draw the attention of this House to the fact that the Bill provides that all cutaway bog no longer commercially viable for the exploitation and extraction of turf must first be offered to Coillte Teoranta.  Only when that body have indicated that such cutaway is not required for their purposes, may Bord na Móna engage in developing its potential in other areas.  Such other cutaway and bogland other than cutaway which Bord na Móna might also wish to develop commercially, and not likely for any valid reason to be used for peat fuel development, if a viable opportunity presents itself, is open to such use by the board under the Bill's provisions.  Among possible options under consideration by Bord na Móna are the development of wetlands and lakes that would have considerable tourism and recreational possibilities.  Such developments which might combine peatland resource and interpretative centres for specialist study and targeted tourism packages, could have useful employment content and could add significantly to the tourism potential of the Midlands region.</P>
    <P>One of Bord na Móna traditional areas of expertise relates to the development of engineering.  Since their inception the board have had the power to manufacture plant and machinery in the preformance of their functions.  They did this with competence and great technical ingenuity. They pioneered many machines.  Clearly they have potential in this field for machinery development generally.  We, as a country, have a huge import bill under this heading.  Part of it must be capable of home production.  The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> specifically sees the development of a strong indigenous component to the mechanical engineering industry as essential to the development of the manufacturing sector generally because of the industrial support services it provides. The particular expertise and specialist knowledge of Bord na Móna in this sector is acknowledged in the programme. The board have already submitted initial proposals for development and diversification under the <i>Programme <Col N="2479" /> for National Recovery.</i> Some of these potential projects are dependent on the new powers provided in this legislation if they are to proceed.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides the board with the power to undertake consultancy work.  The board have often received inquiries on this subject from abroad but could respond only by way of secondment of Bord na Móna staff to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A threefold expansion of consultancy work abroad by State agencies is foreseen in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The provision will enable Bord na Móna to play their part in that programme.  It would be my wish that the board should export services in that form, on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>I believe the board should concentrate their activities on their area of proven expertise.  It has never been my intention that their diversification should be pursued to an extent which would downgrade their peat business, but through their involvement in peat development, the board have accumulated a great deal of expertise in other areas.  The board believe they can build on this; the Bill provides for that.  The board are one of the leading peat producing companies in the world and have led the way in peat technology.  Other companies, including the Finnish Peat Board, have used many of the board's techniques in establishing their own operations.  As I have already indicated, it is in these technical and engineering areas and new product development where the board have gained a particular expertise, that I wish to give the board the necessary latitude in this Bill to pursue business opportunities. However, these new powers will be subject to ministerial control.</P>
    <P>I consider these ministerial controls to be necessary not to inhibit entrepreneurial spirit and drive within the board but to ensure concentration on the core business of Bord na Móna, the exploitation of Irish bogs.</P>
    <P>While I have concentrated so far on the main elements of this Bill, there are, of course, other amendments of a more <Col N="2480" /> routine nature provided for in relation to superannuation, pay, and the format of the board's accounts.  Under sections 5 and 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953 Bord na Móna are empowered to operate superannuation schemes within the approval of the Minister for Energy and the concurrence of the Minister for Finance. At present the Act provides that benefits under the superannuation schemes can only be paid to full-time members of the board and their permanent employees.  This excludes benefits for spouses and children.  However, a non-statutory widows' and children's pension scheme for employees has been operated by Bord na Móna since 1970 with ministerial approval.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has been concerned for some time at the non-statutory basis of the existing widows' and children's pension scheme.  As auditor of the Bord na Móna superannuation schemes, he has reported to the effect that an amendment to the Turf Development Act, 1953 is required to enable formal ministerial approval to be given to the scheme.  Section 6 of the new Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>The section of the 1946 Act which deals with the accounts and audits of Bord na Móna provides that the board should keep, <i>inter alia</i>, a capital account and revenue account.  Such accounts are no longer common in conventional accounting practices.  In this Bill section 3 provides for the necessary amendments in order to permit a change in the format of the board's accounts in line with the more conventional practice.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 9 relating to pay, this will formalise the controls relating to the remuneration of the employees of Bord na Móna and is in line with Government policy in regard to the public sector.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that all aspects of Bord na Móna would at this important juncture be taken under full review, my predecessor, Minister Ray Burke, commissioned a wide ranging consultancy study.  The study will review the existing operations of Bord na Móna and will recommend such changes as may be necessary.  The consultants are due to <Col N="2481" /> complete their report early next year. Their report and the board's own task force report will assist me in deciding on the measures to be taken in all necessary spheres.</P>
    <P>I believe that this House is well aware of the contribution by Bord na Móna to the economic life of this country and to the Midlands in particular, since their creation in the mid-forties.  Indeed, in the wider context they have contributed to the national economy through oil import substitution, diversification of fuel sources, and optimisation of indigenous resources.</P>
    <P>Because of their wide economic and social role in the Midlands and the implication of their activities for the community there, I have no doubt that the board will make every effort for the reconstruction and improvement of their position and so secure their future.  This indigenous resource must be developed to the benefit of our economy but that must be done in the changing and increasingly competitive market place.</P>
    <P>The past few years in particular have been difficult ones for the board.  Problems will not be solved even if one could assure improved harvesting seasons. Work methods to improve output and to reduce poor weather impact, are factors which merit increased attention and I can assure the House that the board and the consultants which my predecessor appointed, will rigorously examine all possible approaches.</P>
    <P>Another major influence on commercial performance is the high cost of servicing the loan capital by which the board are financed.  In the last year I understand that this amounted to about 15 per cent of revenue.  This is one of the matters being addressed by the consultants in their study.</P>
    <P>The implications for jobs of the board's financial difficulties is obviously of great concern.  Given the large share of annual expenditure accounted for by manpower, the board's cost reduction programme means that reduction of the workforce, on a voluntary basis, is unavoidable.  A voluntary early retirement scheme has been agreed which will greatly facilitate <Col N="2482" /> the reduction of costs and overheads.  It is to the credit of the board, and their staff, that despite changes and some unpopular measures being taken, the dedication of the staff to the commercial success of the board has never been in question.  I believe that all parties are to be commended for this and I hope and trust that the future can be faced with the same dedication and forbearance.</P>
    <P>EC assistance, through the Valoren scheme, is being provided to Bord na Móna for the development of more than 8,600 hectares of additional bogland over five years at a cost of £22 million.  The employment provided under this programme, when new jobs and jobs which would otherwise disappear are taken into consideration, accounts for almost 500 jobs.  I am happy to say that the development is on target and is one of the board's contributions to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>On a wider plane, I will be pursuing vigorously the possibilities under the economic and social objectives, and indeed the R&amp;D objective of the European Regional Development Fund, to see what financial assistance will be forthcoming to assist this major industry with its significant economic and social implications. I believe that the peat industry, employing thousands of people, affecting a notable percentage of our national product and touching the lives of people in an extensive region of central Ireland, merits the greatest possible support.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should mention that I have just now received from Bord na Móna some proposals for the amendment of this Bill.  I will be looking at these sympathetically and I may have something further to say on these matters on Committee Stage.  I will, of course, be very pleased to listen carefully to contributions from Members of this House and to consider any amendments they may wish to put forward.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I am sure the House would wish me to congratulate the Minister on having introduced his <Col N="2483" /> first piece of legislation as Minister for Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had an opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I should like to warmly repeat that on the occasion of his first presentation of a Bill as Minister for Energy.  Unfortunately, my comments on what the Minister has had to say today will in large measure be critical but I hope he will take them in the constructive way they are intended.  There are three points I should like to make about the Bill.  First it is ridiculous that the Dáil should be debating a restructuring of Bord na Móna in the absence of an awaited assessment of the board's future.  That is turning the order on its head, putting the cart before the horse.  The second point I should like to make is that the Bill fails to address the key strategic issues that face Bord na Móna.  The Minister mentioned the problems the board have but the Bill does not address them or provide a framework for resolving them.  The third point I should like to make is that even on the very narrow terms that the Bill adopts, the proposals contained in it are full of ministerial involvement.  They betray a lack of trust in the ability of the management and board of Bord na Móna to get about their commercial business. That is something I am critical of.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the Bill, without having seen the important report on the future of the board, is quite out of line. Throughout the past year the Minister's predecessor refused to answer parliamentary questions from concerned Deputies about the future of the board on the grounds that he had appointed the much vaunted consultants to assess the issue.  However, the Minister today is expecting us to approve proposals for legislative restructuring of the entire board without seeing the results of that consultancy work.  Frankly, the introduction of the Bill is premature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been the practice in this House, and in most parliamentary democracies, that when major plans, such as the restructuring of an industry, <Col N="2484" /> are proposed they are preceded by the publication of a policy White Paper.  We have the reverse in this case.  The Minister is seeking approval for the legislation and promising to carry out the policy assessment analysis afterwards.  That is a crazy order of things.  The Bill, as it stands, is an empty shell and the debate we will have on it will be barren because we will be trying to analyse structures and relationships whose real purpose are still unknown to us.  It is like being asked to examine the bone structure of a skeleton when the real issue that we are all concerned with is the life, health and strength of Bord na Móna as a living organism. That cannot be done in the absence of the type of analysis the Minister recognises as being essential.</P>
    <P>There seems to be something of a sham in the Minister introducing a Bill that is designed to all intents and purposes to the outside viewer to set up a structure to have subsidiary companies with separate profit centres, companies that would be production and market oriented in their separate areas of responsibility, and yet telling us that he would not like it to be taken that he believes this is the way to go.  What is the point in asking us to approve this if the Minister does not see the way for Bord na Móna to go in the separate profit centres and so on?  Even the Minister for Industry and Commerce has gone on record as saying that the ideas of the board are on ice but the Minister for Energy is asking us to debate what anybody outside would interpret as the enabling legislation for such a structure. Frankly, I do not understand why we are considering this if the Minister has not made up his mind about the future approach for the board.</P>
    <P>In many ways the strange approach I described, the Minister putting the policy analysis after the solution to the problem, would not be so serious and might be overlooked if it was not for the fact that there is a crying need in Bord na Móna for a recovery plan of some sort.  We all know that.  The board put such a plan in place, and the Minister intervened and blocked that plan.  That is what he is there to do and he put in his own consultants <Col N="2485" /> but I cannot understand why he should go ahead and produce these proposals without the benefit of the report of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The problems of Bord na Móna are obvious.  First of all, they are almost 60 per cent dependent on the ESB contract which, as we know, is set at an uneconomic price from the point of view of the ESB relative to the much cheaper fuels than when the contract was signed. The board have also sustained losses of £33 million in the last two years and, again, that is a serious problem.  They have borrowings that are equivalent to almost 90 per cent of their capital employed.  In terms of gearing of the company that is a very precarious situation for the board to find themselves in.</P>
    <P>In spite of the obvious gravity of the problems facing the board the Bill, frankly, does not address any of the strategic ways in which the board can get out of those problems.  It is disappointing in that sense.  It is worth dwelling for a moment on the problems the board face. Obviously, the ESB contract is one of the major ones.  Recently an economist calculated that the cost handicap to the electricity consumer of the peat generating stations was £55 million per year. I would have no doubts about the validity of the precise figure but it gives an order of magnitude to the size and scale of the problem we face.  It is easy, when looking at the published figures, to see that milled peat is being delivered to the ESB at a price that is about 30 per cent dearer than natural gas or oil and about 65 per cent dearer than coal.  It can be seen that the thermal efficiency of the peat generators is 24 per cent compared with 35 to 36 per cent for coal, gas and oil.  This is another indication of the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>To give the board their due, in their own proposals for restructuring which are now put on ice, to quote the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, they were taking this very seriously.  They have proceeded with rationalisation proposals and they are modelling a lot of their <Col N="2486" /> recovery plan on the notion that the finished system which relies heavily on subcontracting and different harvesting techniques is the way forward.  They are to be commended for that.  Equally, the board find themselves in difficulty in their other significant market, that is the domestic fuel market.  With the growing consciousness among the domestic public, particularly here in Dublin, of the smog problem an enormous marketing opportunity is now open to the board if they can exploit it.  I hope that will be the direction they will take.  Similarly, it is very important that they exploit the marketing opportunity that is available to them in the horticultural market.  The idea of separate profit centres with production obviously geared to the markets' needs is the way forward but the Minister, despite apparently giving some <i>imprimatur</i> to that in his Bill, says that we are not to interpret it as his support for that idea.  We do not really know what the Minister's intentions are.</P>
    <P>The board need a long-term national policy framework in which the key issues that face them can be reconciled.  There are key conflicts in the whole area of the production and use of peat.  I have already mentioned the heavy cost to the electricity consumer.  On the other hand, we all know this is an industry of enormous strategic importance to the midland region and other areas where it is difficult to get alternative industry to establish. The other area of conflict with highly fluctuating fuel prices which we now have is that it is impossible to expect an industry, such as Bord na Móna, which is a labour-intensive production industry, to be able to be put up on a hook and taken down off a hook, to fill gaps in the market, depending on the price of alternative fuels.  We need a national approach to this issue to say what is the proper depletion and production policy in times of fluctuation prices for alternative fuels.  We need to be able to look at what is the social role of Bord na Móna and to what extent should that be met by direct public subvention.  The present situation, as the Minister is aware, is that we do not know.  Economists quote figures which <Col N="2487" /> the Government have never confirmed or denied.  We do not know to what extent Bord na Móna are being heavily supported by the ESB consumer.  It would be far more healthy to have the Minister speaking to us today about what he believes the cost of supporting peat production is, what his analysis of their problem is, where their future lies, whether we should be considering above the line subsidies to Bord na Móna, setting them targets of fuel-related prices, perhaps related to coal and so on.  That has not been addressed either in the Bill or in the Minister's speech.  Basically, we have no proper long term framework established by the Minister.  That is a sad reflection.</P>
    <P>The midlands area will be poorly served in the long run by the lack of a proper analysis of this problem because the peat industry will not last for ever. As people have said, we should have a proper regional strategy with Bord na Móna placed in the context of that regional strategy that can maximise the development of the midlands in a cost-effective way.  I am sad to see that the Minister has not addressed this issue.  The whole question has been swept under the carpet today as far as the Minister is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another area where the Bill has completely missed the boat.  Everyone is saying that the future for Bord na Móna is to take a much more commercial and market orientated approach to their business, but there is no clear commercial mandate given to the board by this Bill; indeed the opposite is the case.  At every hand's turn the commercial discretion of the board has been circumscribed by the requirement of not just one Minister having to give sanction but two Ministers having to give sanction.  Almost before they can scratch their noses they will have to go to the two Ministers.  For issues of very minor intent they will have to go to the two Ministers.  For example, if they want to engage in research and to quote the terms of the Bill, &ldquo;research of whatsoever kind&rdquo;, they will have to go to both Ministers to get approval.  They are already carrying out valuable research <Col N="2488" /> without the involvement of the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Energy but that will no longer be the case when this Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is no framework for deciding on what depletion strategy should be adopted in this country.  We have to bear in mind the cost of competing fuels but we also have to bear in mind that there are pressures on wetlands that are of ecological importance.  We have not seen in this Bill any provisions that would protect wetlands of ecological importance.  There are, I understand, ten sites which are regarded as being of particular importance which are under threat.  This is another issue that one would have expected the Minister to address in designing the strategic way forward for the board for the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>Another area to which there has been a very weak response in this Bill is on deciding the priorities for development of cutaway bogs &mdash; this is the land left after the peat has been removed.  The new forestry board are being given the right, within 12 months, to veto all development on land that is available for further use.  I believe this is a recipe for over-extraction of peat as Bord na Móna would try to maximise to the very end their use of the resource while they still have it and the ultimate dereliction of the cutaway bogs.  Effectively, the forestry board will be able to lock out any alternative use if they so wish.  If there was an area where the Minister should rightly have become involved in the activities of Bord na Móna it was precisely here, to decide when and where it is in the national interest to use these cutaway bogs &mdash; should they go to Bord na Móna for uses that they identify or should they go to the forestry board for uses that they have identified?  That is an area in which I could understand the Minister assessing their alternative contentions and coming down in favour of one or the other, but that is not what we have in this Bill. The Minister, uniquely in this area, has decided not to get involved.  He is saying that the forestry board will be able to put an order on all cutaway bogland and say <Col N="2489" />&ldquo;hands off&rdquo;, to Bord na Móna.  The Minister was vaunting the new powers in this Bill as if the board were now going to have new powers to develop the cutaway, when, in fact, the reverse is the situation. They will lose any possibility of using the cutaway because the forestry board will have the right to block any such development and knowing the way these things happen they will always want to keep that reserve open to them.  They know neither the day nor the hour when they might want to use them.  When it costs nothing they will certainly keep that reserve on it.</P>
    <P>People who read the Fianna Fáil manifesto dealing with the future of Bord na Móna will be dismally disappointed by this Bill.  It is worth recalling to the House what the Government said about the future of Bord na Móna.  They said they would be examining Bord na Móna to see how Bord na Móna could be developed into a resourcist development corporation with the responsibility for both forests and bogs.  Not only does the Bill not extend the role for peat development into the area of forestry but it has virtually excluded the board not only from forestry but effectively from any exploitation of cutaway.  The manifesto also said they would provide a new and wider brief to fit the organisation for the years ahead. The so-called new and wider brief which we have here today amounts to virtually nothing at all.  The board are already involved in training and in consultancy. They are already involved in research without ministerial sanction from two Ministers and they are already marketing their products overseas.  There is nothing new about these so-called new powers. Perhaps the Minister is <i>ex post facto</i> giving them a legislative base for things they are already doing.  The manifesto indicated that this would be a new and wider brief but this Bill does not live up to that.  Basically, no future has been defined for the board as was promised by this Government when they were coming into office.  This is a disappointment. They have closed off opportunities for Bord na Móna instead of opening them up for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2490" /> I would like to turn to the specific contents of the Bill.  Even on its own narrow terms the proposals put forward in this Bill are bureaucratic and portray an unwillingness on the part of the Minister to trust the management and the board of Bord na Móna to conduct their business properly.  If State bodies are to be developed successfully two basic ingredients are essential.  The first is that they be delegated commercial responsibility free from political interference, and, secondly, that there be a balancing requirement of accountability for the responsibility entrusted to them.  Despite the Minister's sincere statement that he wants to see State boards contribute to economic development in this country he has failed in this Bill to provide those two basic requirements &mdash; properly delegated commercial responsibility free from political interference and the balancing requirement of proper accountability for the responsibility entrusted to the State board.  This is tragic because effectively the dead hand of departmental control is going to be extended under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Not only will the Minister appoint all the members of the board, he will also appoint all the members of the sub-boards. No new blood will be brought in. The Minister is not going to allow either executive directors or non-executive directors to be brought in.  The reason he gave for the establishment of the sub-boards is that he wants to try to reduce the burden on the existing directors at their plenary sessions but he will be over extending those same directors if he expects them to be also members of these new sub-boards.  If there is any sense in having new sub-boards it would be that it would provide the opportunity to bring new blood into the company, people who could provide the company with a new commercial approach in relation to these specific activities.  This cries out for the introduction of executive directors in the areas concerned.  If there are to be sub-boards for horticulture, peat, the domestic briquette market and the home heating market, executive directors with expertise in those areas should be <Col N="2491" /> appointed to the boards along with non-executive directors who know something special about these areas and who would bring something new to these activities. Again, this opportunity has been denied under this Bill.  It seems the only reason for this is that the Minister wants to retain tight control over these activities.</P>
    <P>In this legislation we are seeing for the first time ministerial control being extended to the payments of the chief executive.  This flies in the face of commercial realities.  If we want to see our State boards have the best management, see them succeed, set up new enterprises and new ventures we have to be willing to offer to the chief executive the kind of rewards they will get elsewhere.  Once again, we are seeing the dead hand of departmental control being extended to block off this opportunity.</P>
    <P>The sanction of two Ministers is now going to be needed where the board wish to engage even in the most basic activities. As I have mentioned already, if the board wish to engage in research the sanction of two Ministers is going to be required.  If the board wish to get involved in small scale joint marketing efforts so as to launch an attack on the Dublin market the sanction of two Ministers is going to be required.  If the board wish to get involved in a joint effort to exploit some bog the sanction of two Ministers is going to be needed.  If the board wish to engage in even the tiniest activity overseas the sanction of two Ministers is going to be required.  There is nothing in the Bill to suggest that, for instance, the Minister for Finance would only get involved in cases where the figure exceeds £10 million, £15 million or £20 million.  Therefore, if the figure is £1 or only 1p, the Minister for Finance would have to get involved.  This is crazy if we want to see State bodies develop.  The Minister should look again at this matter.</P>
    <P>My third point is that there has been no proper accountability.  This may fit in well with the fact that the Minister is not willing to delegate any responsibility but I hope the Minister will think again about this.  If he does go along that road which <Col N="2492" /> I hope he will, he should look for a much more rigorous system of accountability, in respect of performance, to the taxpayer. Quite honestly, no one has any chance whatsoever of making sense of the annual report of Bord na Móna in that there is no analysis of the performances of their separate businesses contained in the report.  We do not know what businesses are making money and what businesses are losing money.  This is not good enough.  While the Minister is taking the opportunity to establish sub-boards he should also, at the very minimum, make provision for separate accounts to be published by those sub-boards and for these to be made available to the public.  There is no such provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister is making provision for the parent company to make concessionary loans, grants and cross-subsidies available to any new ventures they might establish.  If the Minister wants to see commercial ventures established by Bord na Móna, instead of the proposed sanction of the Minister for Finance, it would be far better to remove from them the right to get involved in cross subsidisation as between one business and another.  I do not see any reason for giving the concessionary loans.  Surely in any new ventures established by the company they would subscribe to shareholders' capital. I do not see why they should be allowed to pay subsidies which amount to cross-subsidisation so that the consumer in one market would effectively be propping up another business which is not successful. Obviously the dangers in this case are not as great as they were in the case of the ESB to whom the Minister has given the same power but it is wrong in principle to give this power.</P>
    <P>There should be a provision in the Bill which would allow for a review of the performances of any new ventures the board establish.  If the board decide to establish new companies there should be an obligation on the board to come back after perhaps five years and account for the success or otherwise of the business. It is only right that a board funded by <Col N="2493" /> taxpayers' mnoney should behave in that fashion.  This Bill should provide also for proper tests of performance so that we would see, for example, how Bord na Móna fare in regard to production and harvesting when compared with Finland which is being held up as a great example.</P>
    <P>The taxpayer would like to be able to assess how the board are doing compared with Finland.  We would like to be able to assess how the different businesses are doing.  We should give the companies much more commercial freedom and allow them to decide on what research needs to be carried out with perhaps sanction being sought where they wish to get involved in projects of a large scale which may have implications for the Exchequer.  We should trust their commercial judgment but at the same time we should be looking for accounts of their stewardship.  On Committee Stage I will be putting forward a number of far reaching changes to try to enshrine in the legislation the idea that Bord na Móna would not have to look for ministerial sanction at every hand's turn but that they would be responsible for results and would be paid for achieving results.  That is the way in which business works and that is the way in which a successful State sector will work.  If that is what we want to cultivate, that is the system we should put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say I find myself in considerable agreement with the previous speaker.  The Minister in introducing this Bill said that its purpose is to amend earlier turf development Acts in order to broaden the remit of Bord na Móna.  While there are some welcome features, if I could describe them as such, in the legislation before us, it certainly does not go far enough.  What is needed is a fundamental recasting of the legal and capital base of the company conferring on them new objectives as well as new powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not do that.  It is purely enabling legislation and it merely allows Bord na Móna to form companies, engage in joint ventures, acquire assets, etc., but all of these activities, including the day-to-day decision-making of the <Col N="2494" /> company, will still be strictly subject to the approval of the Minister and the Department.  Much more fundamental changes other than those outlined in the Bill are needed.  Bord na Móna must be established on the same basis as any other commercial State-sponsored company. They must have a clear mandate to achieve certain policy objectives and they must be given commercial freedom to make management decisions in pursuit of those objectives.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a no-change situation for Bord na Móna.  Even though the company may become incorporated they will still be subject to the control of the Department and civil servants and all decisions relating to the day-to-day operations of the company and the pursuit of their policy objectives have to be approved by the Department and the relevant Minister.  How can a business be run commercially and viably when those kind of constraints are laid down for it? As Deputy Bruton pointed out, in theory under this Bill and under existing legislation Bord na Móna could not buy even a ream of paper without first getting approval to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to expect a committed management team to function properly under that sort of regime.  It must be disappointing for the new Minister, who I presume had no active part in the preparation of this Bill, to introduce in the Dáil as his first piece of legislation a Bill which I think he knows is clearly inadequate.  As I said earlier, presumably the Bill was put together by his civil servants who appear to want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> which exists and to continue to exercise control over all aspects of Bord na Móna's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to say, the Progressive Democrats will not be supporting this Bill.  It fails to define a new remit for Bord na Móna, giving them a clear set of economic, social and environmental targets and providing a realistic statutory framework to enable them to achieve those targets.  Obviously I can understand the <Col N="2495" /> need for ministerial approval in cases where Bord na Móna require Exchequer funding or where they would be giving guarantees on behalf of the company in relation to borrowings, but it is a different matter altogether when approval is required for every commercial decision the board have to make in the normal course of their business.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have definitely outgrown their present framework and they should be reformed into a publicly owned company run on conventional equity lines like any other State company, for example, Aer Lingus.  At present Bord na Móna are a statutory body and are heavily reliant on State funding and borrowings. Loans have to be repaid at commercial interest rates and are a dominant feature militating against the company's attempts to change from a production-orientated company to a market-orientated enterprise.  New markets are now opening up for the company within the EC, notably in France, in the Middle East and even in the United States for both fuel and horticultural products.  The company should be put on a proper footing in order to respond to those market opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the study being carried out by the private consultants who were commissioned to examine the entire operations of Bord na Móna and the previous speaker also referred to this study.  All of us would agree that the study is necessary and is recognised as such at all levels within Bord na Móna.  We are told that the study will take account of developments in peat technology in Ireland and overseas, will focus in on management structures, financing, planning, research and marketing and other areas of the organisation where change is deemed necessary.  The report is eagerly awaited and I assume it will analyse Bord na Móna's performance and look objectively at the company's trading operations.  There is no doubt that the performance of Bord na Móna in the solid fuel and horticultural products markets needs to be improved and it is <Col N="2496" /> also clear that there must be less dependence on ESB contracts as the artificially high prices paid by the ESB only add to the cost of electricity to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bruton, I am curious as to why the legislation has been introduced at this time, given that we are still awaiting the report by the consultants.  I presume the report is well advanced and I ask would it not have been better to await publication of the report prior to the introduction of any necessary amending legislation?  It is expected that the consultants will identify the need for rationalisation and restructuring in the long-term interests of Bord na Móna and their workforce.  It is widely anticipated that the report will recommend dividing the company's operations into three distinct areas relating to energy products, horticultural products and the management of the lands owned by Bord na Móna. This would seem to be a sensible approach.  Separate companies should be formed to carry out those individual aspects of the company's business.  When these companies are established I do not see why they should not be offered for sale and privatised.  I would have thought that it would have been logical to await the publication of the consultants' report, which will address the future of the company and set out clear policy objectives for them, so that the Minister, having received that report, would be in a better position to introduce meaningful legislation which would put in place a structure that would be capable of meeting those policy objectives.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the present structure of the company and to some of its operations.  I believe Bord na Móna employ 6,000 people, almost all of whom are concentrated in the midlands and additional people are employed in neighbourhood power stations which are fuelled by turf or milled peat.  Turf supplies will begin to diminish in due course and it is estimated that they will be fully depleted in about 40 years time. A new strategic plan needs to be drawn up for Bord na Móna &mdash; I assume this is another matter which will be adressed by the consultants and that the Minister <Col N="2497" /> will look at it also.  The plan must take into account the fact that on the one hand peat is a diminishing resource and on the other hand that large tracts of cutaway bog are gradually becoming available for alternative use.  This land must be used to create new employment opportunities for many of the existing workforce.</P>
    <P>I know much research has been done into the potential use of cutaway bogs. One of the main proposed uses is the development of forestry which has rightly been identified as a major growth sector for the Irish economy.  I believe research has also indicated that there is very good potential for horticultural, vegetable growing and grassland development. However, it is disappointing to note that the potential for short-term rotation crops to be used in the pulp industry or biomass production for use as a primary energy source for electricity generation seems to be limited at this stage.  While that is my understanding I should like the Minister to enlighten me otherwise.  In fact I would welcome it very much if research was indicating that biomass was now becoming worthwhile.  It is very important that we speed up and co-ordinate research in all of these areas and establish a national plan for the use and development of this valuable resource by both the public and the private sectors.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the depletion of bogs, and in particular I would like to make the point about the depth of peat which is being left on cutaway bogs.  As I understand it, there is no requirement on Bord na Móna to leave a minimum depth of peat when carrying out their harvesting operations. There is a requirement that an average depth of a half metre of peat should be left, but average can often mean that there are vast areas with much less depth of peat than that.  There should be an urgent examination to establish what optimum depth of peat should be left. This would ensure that the full range of options for the use of cutaway bogs, particularly for forestry and horticulture, can be facilitated.  There is obviously little point in harvesting the last half metre of peat because of its fuel value, even <Col N="2498" /> though it would be quite economical to do so, if the end result is that we are creating large tracts of barren land that will have no further useful potential.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned some land that would never be suitable for use as grassland or for forestry.  Such lands could be very suitable for amenity use. As the Minister pointed out, it could enhance tourism prospects in the midlands. These lands, if flooded, could be used to provide amenity areas for fishing and other water-based activities.  Pension funds, banks and multinational companies could well be interested in developing these lands in a joint venture with Bord na Móna as, indeed, is provided for in this Bill, even though in a very restrictive way.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have rightly been accused of being inefficient.  There is major scope for improvement in all sectors of their operations.  They are using outdated technology to harvest their peat crop and there is poor labour productivity performance.  Peat harvesting in other countries, notably Finland, is carried out much more cost-effectively, even though weather conditions there are less suitable than in Ireland and the harvesting season is much shorter.  I understand that Bord na Móna, in an effort to reduce their production costs, are considering contracting out their harvesting operation and employees would be given the opportunity of working for the company on a contract basis using Bord na Móna machinery which they would maintain and could use for their own private use and undertake other contracts for private sector companies.  I would be supportive of this type of development as it would undoubtedly lead to cost-effectiveness and make the company more competitive.</P>
    <P>Improving competitiveness in their existing energy activities and expanding their markets for fuel must be a major priority of Bord na Móna.  At present &mdash; and Deputy Bruton referred to this at some length &mdash; the ESB are Bord na Móna's single largest customer, purchasing, I think, about 60 per cent of their milled peat output at prices in excess <Col N="2499" /> of what they would have to pay for alternative fuels such as coal or oil.  The ESB have been required by the Government to enter into contracts to buy peat at a price which related to historically high oil prices.  These contracts are coming up for renewal shortly and they should be reviewed on the basis of the market price for these fuels as distinct from the artificially inflated price.  As I said earlier, an artificially inflated price for the Bord na Móna product is leading to a cost handicap on the consumer when he is buying electricity.  I do not think it is right that Bord na Móna should be protected in this way.  They should stand on their own two feet in the commercial world and not be given a privileged position in the marketplace. They are at present relying for profit on their captive customer the ESB and the electricity consumers are, effectively, subsidising their activities.</P>
    <P>The whole question of generating electricity using turf as the primary energy force should be re-examined.  It is inefficient and produces electricity at a cost greater than that at which the electricity is subsequently sold.  The ESB have enough installed capacity already to meet some 75 per cent more of the peak demand for electricity and do not need to rely on expensive and inefficient generating stations. I know that the argument for retaining these stations is a social one, based on the unemployment that would result if these stations were closed down. However, it must be asked whether it is right to maintain an inefficient system of production when the result is that you are imposing a cost handicap on our economy, threatening existing jobs in industry and, indeed, limiting the prospects of creating new jobs because of the resultant high energy costs.  It would be far better to reduce these electricity costs and devote some of the savings made to providing alternative types of employment in the affected regions.</P>
    <P>Another case of Bord na Móna's failure to exploit the energy market relates to the sale of their peat briquette products. We are all aware in this House of the recent very serious smog problems <Col N="2500" /> in Dublin and other population centres throughout the country which have been brought about by the burning of bituminous coal and other high smoke-content fuels.  Bord na Móna have only about 8 per cent of the Dublin fuel market at the moment, yet they have not capitalised on the major opportunity now presented to them arising out of the Confirmation (Smoke Control Area) Orders.  Bord na Móna, first, have an indigenous fuel. There is no import content in it.  It is providing jobs for Irish workers but, much more importantly, in relation to smoke control independent testing has established that peat briquettes emit up to 70 per cent less smoke than Polish or English coal which is extensively used here, and briquettes are well within the smoke emission levels laid down by the EC.  Furthermore, the use of briquettes does not require any capital expenditure on the modification of existing fireplaces.</P>
    <P>In effect, we have an ideal fuel which meets all the requirements of the new statutory smoke control area orders and there is no requirement on the State to spend further money on grants for conversion of existing fireplaces.  I would have thought that this was an ideal opportunity for Bord na Móna to penetrate this captive market but this has not happened to date.  There is still consumer resistance to peat briquettes because people are not familiar with them, particularly in Dublin.  They are also considered to be less value for money than coal.  People need to be convinced that there will be an adequate supply available and, above all, the briquettes need to be delivered to the doorstep, as many people living in high density housing estates, which are the places affected by smog, do not have cars available to them to go to the local supermarket and pick up a bale of briquettes.  There is no doubt that more widespread use of peat briquettes has been hampered by Bord na Móna's poor marketing and distribution and the price of the product compared with that of coal is another factor which militates against it.</P>
    <P>Improvements in production costs would, of course, enable Bord na Móna <Col N="2501" /> to reduce the price of their produce.  I know that the management in Bord na Móna are now guaranteeing that they will deliver briquettes to the door at a price at least equivalent to that of coal, based on the calorific value of both fuels. However, the distribution network and delivery system need to be greatly improved.  In the Ballyfermot area, for instance, some 80 per cent of fuel is delivered in small lots to the householder and a weekly credit facility is also available. If Bord na Móna are to penetrate this market, they must develop a similar distribution and delivery system.  These are the challenges that the management must rise to.  It should not be beyond their ability, given that they are dealing, as I have said earlier, with a captive market which must comply now with compulsory smoke control area orders.</P>
    <P>Similarly, Bord na Móna must expand their markets for horticulture and organic based peat products which at present represent 18 per cent of their sales.  The Minister has said that 90 per cent of these are exported.  However, private sector operators in the peat moss business in Ireland have a greater share of the market in the UK than Bord na Móna. The failure of Bord na Móna to expand their market for energy and horticultural products &mdash; in the case of the energy products given the favourable conditions I have already outlined &mdash; underlines the necessity for totally revamping the whole structure of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is a committed and skilled management team in Bord na Móna and they must be given the right framework within which to operate on a truly competitive basis.  I note that the Minister said he had been contacted by Bord na Móna and that they submitted proposals for amending the Bill.  The Minister did not say what the proposals were but I imagine they are to the effect that the board are not satisfied with the provisions of the Bill and consider them entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the Bill meets the needs of Bord na Móna although it contains some useful provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2502" /> However, they are not catered for in a meaningful way and a much more fundamental restructuring is required.  As I said earlier, we will not support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, in form and content, is relatively minor and I will deal with its broad principles.  The timing of the Bill in relation to the consultants' report leaves me somewhat puzzled. There is no doubt that Bord na Móna need to be restructured, that their <i>raison d'être</i> is changing and that it is timely to look at their overall operations.  We have been told that a group of consultants are looking at Bord na Móna to bring back recommendations to the Minister with a view to setting the terms of reference, skills and guidelines for the company which will take them into the next century. At the same time, the Minister is looking for rather minor powers to broaden the statutory remit of Bord na Móna, which, in effect, are long overdue. In that respect, Bord na Móna have no choice but to look beyond their current activities if they are to continue to play a very important role in our economic life.</P>
      <P>In general, I am supportive of the Minister's intention.  The Labour Party and I are supportive of the idea that semi-State enterprises should be allowed and encouraged to compete in the open market.  They should not be inhibited in any way from developing the range of products and services.  Over the years Bord na Móna played a very important role in the economic life of the country in the area of energy and fuel provision, particularly in the midlands.</P>
      <P>Some Members oppose the Minister's intentions but I see little reason for doing so at present.  We are not getting the full picture, which is unsatisfactory, but the Minister has signalled his intention to work on the report of the consultants as soon as possible.  I am in a position to offer help and encouragement in relation to anything he might need to bring before the House because the remit of Bord na Móna needs to be sharpened for the difficulties that will face them in the nineties and the next century.</P>

    <P>In general, perhaps all Governments <Col N="2503" /> after initially setting up companies like Bord na Móna, have not been very helpful to those companies.  There has been a lot of confusion in relation to the aims and powers of these companies and, on occasions, undue political interference in their management.  At times, these companies were not allowed to conduct their affairs in a strictly commercial manner. Bord na Móna have played a remarkable role in our economic life, particularly in the midlands.  It is all very well for the previous speaker to say that the generating stations in the midlands should be closed down because of the uneconomic nature of the fuel supply.  That will happen in due course but I would like to impress on the Minister the necessity to start making provisions now and to have strategic planning in relation to replacing the activities of Bord na Móna and the ESB which will come to a natural end in due course in the midlands.  There are approximately 4,000 people involved in the activities of Bord na Móna and the ESB in the midlands and we will be faced with a very severe crisis there in relation to employment.  The matter should be tackled now because it is not satisfactory to carry on in our merry way.  The bogs will eventually cease production and milled peat will not be available for the ESB.  Consequently, the power stations will have to be converted or, more likely, technology will have developed to such an extent that they will be closed down and scrapped.  We will then be faced with huge unemployment in the midlands.  We could, indeed, given the basic make-up of the midlands where vast tracts of land are covered in peat, be faced with a wasteland.  It is very important now, in terms of development of the region, for the Government to address themselves to alternative employment opportunities and policies for these areas so that we will not be faced with the gloomy prospect I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address the overall funding of Bord na Móna and the imbalance in the debt equity ratio in the company. The Government have not given enough thought to this because quite <Col N="2504" /> often public enterprises are so heavily in debt that it is very difficult for them to service the debts and to work their way out of them.</P>
    <P>The marketing area will also have to be scrutinised by the Minister and his Department.  If we took on a detailed examination of the marketing skills and abilities of Bord na Móna, would we be satisfied that what they had been doing in the past was satisfactory?  If we are dissatisfied with their activities in the past, what changes will be made in relation to their new powers under the Bill?  Have they, for example, presented the Minister with a strategic plan in relation to sales abroad?  The activities for which they are looking for power to engage in will entail working in the markets abroad and I question their record to date in relation to some of their activities abroad.  It will require the best marketing skills in relation to their sales efforts in the UK and France.  Perhaps the Minister will address this in his reply.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have had a rough passage over the last number of years.  There is little we can do in relation to the type of summers we have had which put enormous strains on the financial resources of the company.  There have also been enormous tensions between Bord na Móna and the ESB in relation to pricing policy for fuels, the amount of fuel to be taken by the ESB and the price for it. Obviously, the board have had extreme difficulty in the last number of years but they have shown their resilience.  The workforce of Bord na Móna have made enormous efforts in the past two to three years to overcome the difficulties facing the company and caused mainly by the weather, totally beyond the control of the company.  The workforce in Bord na Móna, after some initial lack of direction, did a good job in those years in pulling together to take on the problems caused by the bad summers which we have had over a two to three year period.</P>
    <P>There are enormous possibilities for the board in relation to the problems being experienced in the city of Dublin in the last number of weeks but they will not fall into Bord na Móna's lap.  They <Col N="2505" /> will have to compete with the coal cartel which exists in this city and country and they will have to take on well-organised and efficient &mdash; albeit a monopoly situation &mdash; coal companies in Dublin.  They will have to change their marketing policy, as has been said, to reach those people living in vast housing estates in Dublin who at present are not convinced that peat briquettes are as effective as coal, who find it difficult to get adequate supplies of peat briquettes or machine cut turf on a regular basis from Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>These are matters of planning and marketing which the board will have to take on.  If they do not take them on they will not succeed in the very difficult marketing battle and they will not get their share in the marketplace because they have to compete against some of the strongest companies in operation in this country.  In that respect the board will have to change.  They will have to stand their existing marketing policy on its head, examine it critically and come up with a realistic and viable marketing programme which reaches into the homes of the many potential clients in the city of Dublin.  I do not believe enough effort has been made in the past and this is borne out by the figures available for the amount of peat briquettes and peat burned in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In terms of environmental protection, the minimising of the smog in Dublin in recent weeks has perhaps given the board their best and long-awaited marketing opportunity in recent years.  There is at present a focusing on the smog problem and the alternative fuels available.  In recent times the board have produced statistics on the comparisons to be made in relation to the environmental impact from the various fuels available to householders in Dublin.  These are matters which the Minister may have an opportunity to comment on when replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the overall direction of the Bill is to be welcomed.  It does not set out clearly the future direction of the board.  I gather from the Minister's <Col N="2506" /> speech that it will not be possible to outline to the House what will be the direction of the board until he receives, studies and comes to his own conclusions on the consultants' report.  The board have had enormous successes down the years, for example, in the development of peat technology.  I wonder if we were to compare the peat technology available at present, for example, in Finland, Russia and North America with that which we are using, would we still be able to claim that we have in Ireland the leading peat technologists in relation to machinery? We may have allowed ourselves to slip back in this regard.  We also have to consider that we are dealing with different environmental conditions.  Perhaps in Finland, where by and large there is a different type of bogland, different technology has been implemented.  I would like the Minister to outline to us if he and the Department of Energy have made an assessment of where Bord na Móna stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> other competing peat production companies worldwide.  Are we still a leader in this industry or have we slipped back from the position which we occupied in the thirties and forties in world peat production?</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to give a more specific idea on what markets are available to the board.  Are there markets in Europe and abroad, and what steps are being taken by the board to prepare themselves for these markets?  Have the board considered joint ventures?  Perhaps the Minister could inform us of the type of companies abroad, public or private, with whom Bord na Móna are in discussions in regard to sharpening up their marketing activities.  I would also welcome from the Minister an indication of the type of amendments which are now being sought by Bord na Móna.  That would certainly be beneficial and helpful to the Opposition parties in respect of the contribution we will make on Committee Stage.  As I have said, this is a minor Bill but it could have very important positive consequences for Bord na Móna and therefore I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Since their formation <Col N="2507" /> in 1946 Bord na Móna have played an important role not just in providing an important alternative native source of energy but also in providing a significant number of jobs in areas in which, in most cases, there was no alternative source of employment.  The importance of peat in Ireland is emphasised by the fact that one-sixth of our total land area, amounting to three million acres, is covered in peat land.  Bord na Móna are currently involved in extracting peat from 200,000 acres of bogland purchased from private landowners.  This obviously is only a small fraction of the total amount of peat land in the country, most of which is either completely unused or very poorly used in relation to its economic potential.  There has been very little private bog development. Private enterprise has shown little inclination to get involved in the area, presumably because the profits would not be big enough.  It is fair to say that had it not been for the establishment of Bord na Móna, this vitally important resource would have remained undeveloped and certainly under-developed.</P>
      <P>In the year ending March 1987 Bord na Móna employed an average of 4,688 workers, rising to 6,146 at their peak period.  Sales amounted to almost £110 million.  Bord na Móna are a unique company in that they are totally dependent on the unpredictable nature of Irish weather. They have faced major problems in this regard in recent years when we experienced summers ranging from poor to abysmal.  Despite those problems the board have made a major contribution to otherwise poor areas in which emigration was a constant feature prior to the advent of Bord na Móna.  In addition, peat-fired power stations employ in the region of 1,000 people.  The board have made a major contribution to our economy over the years, through export sales worth £16.25 million in the year to March 1987, and through savings in fuel imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also the company have been a major centre of technological innovation with a worldwide reputation in that field.  To the extent that the provisions of this Bill will allow Bord na Móna to promote, form, <Col N="2508" /> take part in and acquire companies and engage in activities not strictly related to peat, that is a welcome development. Allowing Bord na Móna to delegate some board functions to sub-board level is a welcome development also.  However, that cannot be viewed in isolation from threats to divide the company into three separate ones &mdash; which would not be a good thing &mdash; or from attempts by the board to shed permanent staff and replace them with contract workers.</P>
    <P>A number of other problems confront the board which are inadequately addressed in the Bill, such as that of the underlying problem of funding of the board and the future of cutaway bogs. Apart from climatic problems the major contributory factor to the board's financial difficulties has been the requirement to fund their operations almost totally by way of costly borrowing from the commercial banks, which now involves approximately £20 million per annum in interest payments.  The board referred to this problem in their report for 1985-1986 when they said that this unbalanced capital base increases the financial vulnerability of the board in periods of difficulty such as the two production seasons, 1985 and 1986.  In that report the board called for a conversion of existing Exchequer loans to equity and for an injection of new State equity.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Government have failed to respond to a fundamental review of the capital structure of Bord na Móna. If Bord na Móna are to survive and develop they must be provided with a proper financial structure, releasing the company from their crippling debt-interest burden.  It is important to remember that Bord na Móna do not have access to the type of generous financial supports given to private companies. The company have been a consistent provider of jobs with a good technological record.  Yet they receive no money from the IDA who have provided hundreds of millions of pounds in grants over the years to fly-by-night operators such as Hyster, Mostek and so on, many of whom remain here only as long as such hand-outs are provided for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2509" /> The Bord na Móna group of unions in a recent submission set out proposals to put the company on a sound financial footing.  We completely support these suggestions which include, first, the conversion of the £25 million Exchequer loan into equity; second, an injection of new State equity; third, access to the full range of Government and EC supports as are available to the private commercial sector and, fourth, the refund to Bord na Móna of EC interest subsidy rebates confiscated by the Government and the direct payment of these moneys to the company.  Unless the fundamental financial problems of the board are addressed by the Government they will continue to experience major problems and their real potential remain untapped.</P>
    <P>The other key issue affecting the future of Bord na Móna which needs to be sorted out without delay is the future use and control of cutaway bogs.  Between now and the end of this century it is estimated that an area larger in size than County Louth will become available for alternative use as Bord na Móna complete their turf cutting operations in areas in the midlands.  Such a large tract of land becoming available will afford tremendous opportunities for major developments in agriculture and related areas. There has been considerable research carried out already by Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais into possible alternative uses of such land.  There is a number of possibilities, including horticulture, biomass, conventional forestry, grassland and amenity use.  All of these offer advantages and disadvantages.  The best usage of cutaway bogs may lie in a mix of options, allowing a degree of flexibility which would take into account local circumstances and changing conditions. It is vital that an early decision be taken as to who should have responsibility for the development of cutaway bogs in order to allow the requisite planning to begin.</P>
    <P>There have been predictable calls from the farming organisations that cutaway bogs should be divided into small units and handed over to existing or aspiring farmers.  I contend such a move would <Col N="2510" /> constitute a retrograde step as it is clear that cutaway bogs will need a centralised drainage system individual farmers would be unlikely to be able to provide.  To reap the best return from cutaway bogs substantial investment and a high level of technical expertise will be required.  It must also be said that the vast majority of farmers have shown no inclination to develop bogland.  To allow individuals now reap the benefit of the work undertaken by Bord na Móna would be unfair and economically senseless.</P>
    <P>Another factor to be considered is the position of the very large number of generally highly skilled employees of Bord na Móna and ESB employees in turf-burning power stations who depend on peat for their livelihood.  Steps must be taken to ensure that cutaway bogs are developed in such a way as to provide the maximum employment opportunities for those who might lose their jobs when the present phase of bog development has been completed.  I contend the most sensible approach would be to give Bord na Móna overall responsibility for the development of all cutaway bogs.  At a time when State companies in general appear to be fair game for every right-wing politician and pundit it is worth reminding the House that Bord na Móna's record, despite Irish climatic conditions, has been good and that private enterprise has shown little or no interest in bog development.</P>
    <P>In that context we are concerned about the provisions of section 7 which appear to place an obligation on Bord na Móna to hand over cutaway bogs to the new State forestry company.  We supported the Forestry Act, 1988 and look forward to the early establishment of the commercial State forestry company for which the provisions of the Bill provided.  But why is it necessary to compel Bord na Móna to hand over to that new company areas of cutaway bog?  We totally acknowledge the need to expand our overall forestry area.  Indeed the amount of Irish land under forestry &mdash; at approximately 5 per cent &mdash; is the smallest within the EC and needs to be expanded rapidly. <Col N="2511" /> There is no shortage of land here, privately-owned bogland and marginal land, which is either under-used or not utilised at all and which should be acquired by the new forestry company without having to take cutaway bogs from Bord Móna.</P>
    <P>If the jobs of Bord na Móna workers are to be protected, as the current phase of bog development is completed, the board will need to be in a position to consider all possible options for the use of such cutaway bogs.  As I understand the position, the new forestry company will be involved in all facets of forestry and wood processing.  They will grow their own timber but will also purchase timber from privately owned forests. Therefore, why not allow Bord na Móna become involved in the forestry area if they should decide that that would constitute the best option for the usage of cutaway bogs?  Why not allow them to sell the timber they produce to the State forestry company in the same way as any private forestry company?</P>
    <P>This Bill is published against a background of changes which the management of Bord na Móna are seeking in the nature of the workforce in the company, particularly the proposal that much of the permanent workforce should be replaced by contract workers.  I assume that the company's management would not attempt to move in this direction unless they had been given the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>It should be acknowledged that the trade unions in Bord na Móna have adopted a flexible approach to the changes and to the modernisation process necessary to ensure the future of the company. In 1974 and again in 1979 major agreements were concluded providing for increased productivity and flexibility in the production, transport and processing areas.  The extent of the concessions made by the workforce is indicated by the fact that the permanent workforce was reduced by some 800 between 1984 and 1987 while production targets remained constant.  I understand that the management put forward a 37-point list of changes which they are seeking, to <Col N="2512" /> improve productivity and achieve more flexible work practices, and that the unions have indicated their willingness to negotiate on these matters.  However, it is also clear that if the management go ahead with proposals to shed almost 700 permanent jobs and 400 temporary posts and replace them by contract workers, they will be strongly opposed by the unions, and there is a grave danger that this will plunge the company into serious industrial conflict.</P>
    <P>The trend of replacing permanent workers with contract employees has been well established in the private sector but it is alarming to see this practice spreading to the State sector.  While there may be short-term financial savings for the board in such a practice, in that they do not have to pay PRSI and pension payments for contract workers and they get away with paying less to temporary staff than to permanent staff, the long-term implications of such a development for the company would be disastrous. The Bord na Móna workforce has loyally served the company over the years and in many respects the workforce is the company's greatest asset.  It is not likely that contract workers will show the same commitment and loyalty to the company. Bord na Móna can have a very positive future if the correct decisions are made now.  There is still enormous potential for their products and there is considerable scope for diversification.</P>
    <P>The low smoke content of their products is becoming increasingly important in the context of the serious smog problems in Dublin and in other urban areas. With the expansion of smoke controlled areas the potential market for Bord na Móna products is increasing dramatically. Against this background it would be sensible for the board to increase production of briquettes and consider going ahead with the construction of the deferred briquette factory at Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on Bord na Móna and other State companies in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to consider ways of expanding their areas of economic activity, creating additional <Col N="2513" /> employment.  Apart from the use of cutaway bogs, Bord na Móna have considerable expertise in engineering and consideration should be given to expanding engineering activities either through direct engineering production or through contract or consultancy work for other companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often this House is criticised for passing legislation considered to be too little too late.  It is not often that we have the opportunity that we have today to make decisions of major importance which will have far-reaching consequences.  That is why I welcome this Bill.</P>
      <P>I also take the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister on his portfolio and to wish him well.  Knowing his capabilities I am sure the Minister will fit very well into the brief and that he will have a long and successful career in this area.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very important.  The implications of our decisions will be far-reaching for Bord na Móna.  Our decisions will decide on the very survival of the company.  Few would deny that Bord na Móna are at a crossroads and that urgent decisions need to be taken.  There is no doubt that structures must be changed and that the company must be geared to current and future challenges.  This Bill gives us the opportunity to streamline an organisation which has served us well for the past 40 years and which, properly structured, will continue to serve the nation well in the challenging nineties and into the new century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, as legislators, must offer every facility to the board and management to ensure that the company operate to their maximum potential in a highly competitive environment.  The present structures of the company will not allow them to operate to their maximum potential when facing challenges.  We cannot expect management to operate within archaic structures, structures which were suitable for the forties but which bear little relevance to the eighties and even less relevance to the nineties.  Because of developments by Bord na Móna the <Col N="2514" /> structure of the forties has already proved inadequate.  This has forced Bord na Móna to adopt a new approach to parts of their operation, particularly international marketing and trade.</P>
    <P>The management and workers of the company must be complimented for the way in which they have adapted to the new situation and have spread into the international scene.  The fact that they did this successfully showed that the expertise is there, and that the skills are there, but it underlined the fact that current structures are inadequate.  This Bill addresses that major problem and when passed will allow the Minister and the company to adopt structures which will be vital for the future survival and expansion of the company.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way denigrate the proud tradition and record of achievement of Bord na Móna so far.  In the context of the present Bill, lest I am seen to be criticising the company, I will comment on the history and achievements of the board.  The company were established under the Turf Development Act, 1946, with a specific task of maximising the benefits to the nation of the exploitation of the natural peat resource.  The company were very successful and quickly took a position of pre-eminence among the world's peat producers, in terms of bog husbandry, the technology employed by them, the production techniques adopted, and the restoration of cutaway bogs and production development.  They also attained a certain pre-eminence in environmental and conservation matters. Their achievements in taking undeveloped peat lands to the current state of development is impressive and is recognised throughout the world.  Bord na Móna are recognised as one of the foremost companies in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to production, the company also have a very proud record as an employer.  They have sustained employment throughout their history and, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, they have a relatively trouble free industrial relations history.  They have contributed to the economic life of the country through discharging their remit <Col N="2515" /> to develop our natural peat resources, but they have also made a huge social and economic contribution at local and community levels in areas which, it would be fair to say, would be otherwise severely disadvantaged.  There are many areas that would be economic and social wastelands but for the employment and social contributions made by Bord na Móna, and this House should recognise that.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies from all sides fear that any changes in the structure of Bord na Móna would seriously affect their areas. When the time comes to review the existing position in the light of future requirements, they fear the past will in some way be denigrated by such a process of examination.  However, the majority of people on reflection will not take this view but will recognise this move for what it is &mdash; an attempt by a successful company to reorientate and to adapt themselves to a changed environment.  I have no doubt that Bord na Móna will use the qualities so evident in the past to meet a new set of challenges in the future.  These factors which must be faced, and the factors which underpin the successful past performance of the company, do not to a large extent apply to the existing situation or to future developments.  The challenges I speak of are in the external environment and market areas.</P>
    <P>The company have to face the challenge and respond radically to it to ensure their future viability.  The change is already underway and so far, within the constraints imposed on them by the 1946 legislation, Bord na Móna have tried to adapt to these challenges.  A number of areas of significant progress have been noted over the past few years.  A number of key management posts have been filled and initiatives are being taken in critical functional areas, such as marketing. More recently the company have attempted to reduce costs through a voluntary redundancy and early retirement package.  A number of the uneconomic sod peat works are scheduled for closure or have already been closed, and a number of new systems aimed at gaining <Col N="2516" /> efficiencies in production and lessening the effects of weather dependency are being pilot tested.</P>
    <P>According to Bord na Móna and somewhat in anticipation of this Bill, a number of opportunities for profitable participation in new industry areas are being pursued.  I am sure Members will be very much aware that a number of initiatives are being taken to exploit market opportunities in Europe, and particularly in France.  I mentioned the changes that have occurred to illustrate and underline the fact that the board are willing to change and to adapt, and they have done that within the constraints of the Act, but just as important is the change of attitude among staff and management.  This has allowed changes which would probably have been unheard of in years gone by.</P>
    <P>Members will probably be aware of this but over the past number of years Bord na Móna have shown themselves to be more ready to open their doors to the public and have adopted a more vigorous public relations and public information initiative.  This in itself can only be good. The changes I mentioned are welcome and significant in the context in which Bord na Móna are working, but I contend that they do not go far enough to meet the challenges I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the structures of Bord na Móna and the possible improvements that could be brought about by this Bill, it is necessary to address some key strategic issues which will have an impact on the type of structure required to face up to the future challenges to which I referred.  The basic issue which must be faced is the fact that the company are responsible for exploiting what is a depleting natural resource.  Estimates of the remaining life of the reserves are very difficult to make because they are so dependent on projected usage and extraction rates.  They can also vary as a result of the type of products that are developed.  However, we must now address the choice which must be made on where and how to maximise added value and gain the maximum return for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2517" /> One of the unique aspects of a bog is that it is capable of producing different products at different stages of its development. It is fair to say that up to now we have concentrated largely on the extraction of a rather limited range of products. Future development will require a different type of strategy, one which will be a mix of the more traditional areas with a certain bias towards the high value added products.  It is also likely that the development of bogs will lead to the development of a new product range and totally new businesses.  This is why I feel the current legislation is so important.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent Bord na Móna are hamstrung by current legislation in that the company were set up solely for the purpose of exploiting our natural peat resources.  In this day and age it is too restrictive and the legislation before us will allow for considerably more flexibility. If the company are to develop new products they will require the flexibility to be able to set up new companies or to engage in joint venture activities.  They will also need these companies to develop and market the product and the legislation before us will help to facilitate that process.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of research has gone into the development of peat for anti-pollution uses and a very active research project is well advanced.  The research appears to indicate that peat can be used in a revolutionary new way to prevent pollution.  If that research is successfully concluded it may be necessary to set up a new company to exploit the research fully by marketing the finished product.  This new product would be completely different from anything the board are involved in at the moment, and obviously different strategic approaches and responses to the market-place will be required.  The company should have freedom to set up the structures which would allow them to exploit that fully.</P>
    <P>That is only one area.  There are many others some of which we are aware of and some of which we probably are not aware of at present.  The key point here is that if the board are to develop new products they will have to be allowed <Col N="2518" /> develop structures that will exploit them adequately through sales, marketing and so on.  At present Bord na Móna are involved in a variety of activities.  They are involved in the commodity-energy industry, to some extent the agriculture-horticulture industry and the solid fuel and domestic heating industry.  They are developing in the pollution control industry, and only time can tell us what other industries they may become involved in. There have been many changes in these industries over the past number of years and there are potentially very many more changes in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In the commodity energy industry, that is the supply of milled peat to the ESB for electricity generation, the major market forces are world energy prices and exchange rates.  In addition, there are wider national, economic, financial and social considerations.  However, the future forecast for trends in world energy prices indicates that this industry will have to aim at a price structure which will be more in line with general commodity-energy prices.  In order to achieve that, maximum efficiencies will have to be obtained and these will have to be reflected in reduced costs.  Performance in that area is not dependent on just direct cost reduction but calls for reinvestments of profits in production technology. From my limited knowledge of this area it appears to be seriously under-funded and in many cases machinery used in it is either ancient, or, some would contend, obsolete.  That in turn reflects itself in major costs, such as transportation and maintenance, and as long as it remains it will affect the company's ability to achieve any sustainable cost reductions.</P>
    <P>Horticulture and garden industries are probably one of the most exciting areas that Bord na Móna are becoming involved in at home and internationally. It is an area that presents Bord na Móna with a golden opportunity for growth. However, it is also a highly competitive area in which Bord na Móna to some extent are a late arrival.  The company so far have shown themselves capable of competing with the best in Europe but <Col N="2519" /> the key issue for the company in this area relates to their potential to market their product internationally but particularly in Europe.  A new and fresh marketing approach is needed and so is diversification into high value-added products. The company need to build on the niche they have created for themselves in Europe.  In this area another matter that has to be faced is the price sensitivity of the market and, as in the commodity-energy industry, cost containment is very necessary here.  Again this can be achieved through increased efficiency and increased productivity.</P>
    <P>The solid fuels area is one of the most serious challenges facing Bord na Móna because the markets worldwide are contracting. For that reason this industry presents its own challenges.  It is inevitable in a contracting market that in future there will be fewer suppliers.  The challenge in this case for Bord na Móna is simply to survive.</P>
    <P>The briquette business needs to succeed in volume sales not just at home but abroad because of the relatively high cost and the growing strength of competitive fuels like gas and privately cut peat. Again, the major issue to be faced here is the need to reduce prices and to create an attractive product.  Indeed, probably at present in this country one of the strongest selling points the company have is the relatively low smoke emission from burning briquettes.  In the current controversy Bord na Móna should capitalise on this, not just in Dublin but in other cities and towns around the country and internationally. The recent decision, belated though it might have been, to include briquettes under the smoke free zone legislation is a major bonus for the company, and I venture to say that without it the solid fuel business would have found itself in very serious trouble.</P>
    <P>In the sod peat area the biggest problem is the inroads being made into this market by private producers who are estimated at the moment to produce about 1.5 million tonnes per annum.  In the peat area productivity will have to be increased.  I read recently that 1,750 <Col N="2520" /> tonnes of turf per worker are extracted here and the comparative figure in Finland is almost double at 3,450.  That may not be a reflection on the workers but it refers back to the point I made about equipment and so on.</P>
    <P>In agriculture a unique opportunity is presented to the company to develop the cutaway peatland areas.  The Government have already decided that some sections of the cutaway bogs will go to forestry and will be handled by a new State company.  This has caused certain problems and, as Deputy Sherlock said, there are quite vociferous groups saying it should not happen.  I understand clearly that the areas that will go to forestry will be suitable for forestry and not good agriculture land.  In addition, there has been criticism of the decision because some people feel that the fact that some of this cutaway bogs has been given over to forestry and a separate semi-State company is in some way a reflection on Board na Móna.  I do not take that view. I feel it is more a signal of the Government's commitment to the development of the indigenous Irish timber industry to which the Minister was very deeply committed in his time as Minister of State.  However, it might be no harm for Bord na Móna to take some note of the fact that the Government have decided to allow the new State company to develop some of the cutaway peatland areas.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, Bord na Móna have developed no overall strategy for land utilisation and there is a danger that if they do not do that sufficiently quickly other interests may put forward proposals that would leave them out in the cold. Therefore, the decision by the Government might be a timely warning.  I am aware that Bord na Móna have been considering, for a considerable length of time, a strategy for land utilisation.  It is time now that they produced the goods and produced some kind of document that can be worked.</P>
    <P>On strategic issues under the heading of other industries, expanding and developing the range of products capable of being produced from the bog <Col N="2521" /> presents its own opportunities for profitable participation in other industries.  I earlier cited the pollution control industry as an example.  This Bill will allow Bord na Móna to participate in other industries in a variety of ways, for example, by way of joint ventures or setting up other companies, etc.  The legislation will facilitate this, and from that point of view it is good.</P>
    <P>It would be very difficult to talk about strategic issues in relation to Bord na Móna without referring to the problem of debt facing them.  This is the major factor underlying all of these other strategic issues.  It has had a considerable impact on the past, present and future performance of the company.  There is a necessity for price competitiveness and profit performance and these are affected by the very high level of payments needed to meet interest and capital repayments on past loans.  The figure for 1986-87 is about £22 million.  Repayments of this order have arisen because the company are entirely founded on loan capital on the basis of Exchequer advances and commercial loans backed by State guarantee.  Because of this approach the accumulated debt has reached a stage where it is no longer feasible to expect the company to carry the burden.  The level of debt is a major contributor to the price levels which are too high right across the total product range.</P>
    <P>Servicing a debt of that level also has other effects.  It has a major effect on cash flow.  It also prohibits reinvestment which, in turn, is essential to contain costs and reduce prices.  In addition it gives rise to short term cost cutting exercises which cause problems in subsequent years.  In many cases the quality of products is reduced affecting sales and continuing the spiral.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are involved in a high risk business.  At all times they are trading in very difficult circumstances.  They are seriously affected by the weather not just in the production process where a wet summer will have serious effects but also in the domestic heating area; if we have mild winters it is bad news for Bord na Móna.  Because it is a high risk business <Col N="2522" /> it should not be financed by loan capital but by equity.  If this were the case the company could pay a dividend in years of high return and could prevent a further increase in losses during a bad year.  At the moment in a bad year the situation is made even worse in that losses that occur are adding to an already incredibly high loan situation, and again the cycle continues and worsens.</P>
    <P>I realise that in the current economic climate what I am suggesting will have implications for the Exchequer; but we have to face the reality.  There is little point in gearing a company to meet the major challenges facing it in the market place in the years ahead if these structures are to be based on a foundation of debt.  The foundation is very shaky and I would urge the Minister to have a look at this to see if there is some way to get Bord na Móna out of this loan situation. I understand the current level of the loan is around £170 million and the repayments are about £22 million a year.  No company could be expected to survive under that load, still less improve their situation to meet the serious challenges they face.  The Bill will allow the Minister to take some action in this area.</P>
    <P>So far I have outlined the challenges facing Bord na Móna and the strategic issues that need to be addressed urgently to allow the board to face those difficulties and challenges.  I would like now to turn to the structure of Bord na Móna and the options which the Bill before us leaves open.  It is the inclusion in the Bill of possible options of change in the structure of the company that has caused most comment and given rise to fears of privatisation or that certain segments of the company would be sold off.  It has generated some controversy.  It may be appropriate in the present context that the debate may have generated a little more heat than light.  All sorts of claims and counter claims are being made.  No matter how attached people have become to the old Bord na Móna with their fine traditions, if the structures do not change we will be left precisely with that, a fine tradition, and little else.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us leaves two options <Col N="2523" /> open to the Minister: the board to remain more or less the same and the various enterprises to be organised and run by sub-boards or possibly limited companies formed under a group structure.  In that context I feel that the way forward is for the company to adopt a group structure with Bord na Móna becoming a holding company and operating initially with three separate limited liability companies set up under the Companies Act.  These three companies would deal initially with the milled peat, horticultural-agricultural area and solid fuels.  This approach would lead to regularisation of the current position with regard to the UK and European subsidiaries.  Each of the three companies that I have referred to could be autonomous in that they would have a board of directors and a management structure and would be able to operate as a separate company.  That type of structure would allow the holding company, Bord na Móna, to operate at a strategic level deciding on general policy while the individual trading companies would be involved in the day-to-day management of their specific areas of responsibility. There is no doubt that such a structure would allow for more efficient use of resources and would gear the company to the competitive atmosphere in which it will be operating.</P>
    <P>The type of structure I have outlined would give sufficient flexibility to allow the different industries in which Bord na Móna operate the opportunity to grow and develop.  It would also allow flexibility for the development of new industries &mdash; I already mentioned some of them &mdash; once the initial research into their viability has been concluded.  Such a structure would also allow for product development and technical innovation to be provided for in the most effective manner for all companies.  In addition it would help the individual companies to concentrate on their own markets and try to develop them.  That is particularly important in the horticultural-garden area where development in the European context is vitally important.  The proposed structures would also broaden the <Col N="2524" /> range of options for future development and allow the company to develop in various fields as the need arises through joint ventures and acquisitions.</P>
    <P>An important point in relation to operating under separate companies is that such a structure would give a clear picture of the performance of each sector and ensure that each company operated in a more commercially orientated way. Obviously, a certain discipline would be imposed on each company to produce the goods because if they did not that would be obvious.  Such a structure is important because the management skills and techniques needed to sell turf are completely different from those for the development of horticulture.  The companies, if set up individually, will have an opportunity to develop their own speciality and be more responsive to market conditions.</P>
    <P>The alternative to such an approach would be to make structural changes internally and, possibly, to appoint sub-boards to look after the various sectors. That would not be a proper response to the challenges facing the board and would lead to the continued centralisation of power in the company with a consequent danger in that it would mean less accountability by individual groups and management. I suggest that if we are setting up three separate companies a portion of the Baggot Street office should be retained for Bord na Móna and the other companies should be located in appropriate centres around the country.</P>
    <P>The key to the Bill is its flexibility.  It gives the Minister and senior management of Bord na Móna flexibility. There is flexibility for the undoubted talents of the management and executives of Bord na Móna.  If the new structure is set out executives will be able to specialise and shine in their own areas.  That would be good for the company and for the country.  Most of my contribution has been devoted to the structures of Bord na Móna with emphasis on the need to make it a profit-making concern.  I may have concentrated on economic issues but, like other Members, I am aware of the contribution by Bord na Móna to the social life of the country.  I referred to <Col N="2525" /> that briefly and my brevity should not take from the fact that I have a lot of regard for what Bord na Móna have done down the years.  They ensured the survival of many rural communities.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point in regard to section 9 which deals with the remuneration of officers and servants. The provision, a standard one in Bills of this type, states that the remuneration and allowances to be paid to officers or sevants of the company should be subject to conditions which the Minister may lay down and take cognisance of the nationally agreed guidelines set down from time to time.  I am not sure that that is the best type of approach for our semi-State companies.  We should be aiming to attract the best people into those companies and to rewarding them accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We tie the hands of those who have an obvious contribution to make by saying that they should be paid a certain level of remuneration.  If we must insert such a clause we should add a provision allowing for a bonus and penalty scheme.  If an individual delivers the goods he should be rewarded.  I would be more in favour of appointing such people under contract, pay them accordingly and reward them with bonuses.  If they do not deliver on their contract the obvious option is open to the board. There are people who would be interested in such positions and would probably accept a salary lower than they could command in the private sector. However, we should give them a reasonable chance.  It is wrong that we should continually tie their hands by including provisions like in section 9.  A person who proves successful should be paid accordingly. If we are to get anywhere after 1992 we will have to have a look at the salary structure of the executives of semi-State companies.  We will have to pay people according to their ability and their performance.  I do not think our semi-State companies will survive if we continue to pay their executives what <Col N="2526" /> amounts to a pittance when their salaries are compared to what is available in the private sector.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and, for everybody's sake but particularly for the sake of Bord na Móna, I hope it receives a speedy passage.  The sooner the structures are put in place the better for the company, their management and employees but most of all for the communities that Bord na Móna have served so well in the past 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is refreshing to hear a Deputy on the other side asking the Minister for Energy to change section 9 of this Bill.  When I put a similar request to the Minister during the debate on the Coillte Teoranta Bill he dismissed it out of hand. I hope Deputy Dempsey has more success than I had.  It is refreshing to hear a man on the other side of the House talking about the change-over that is required for semi-State companies to provide a future for themselves.</P>
      <P>This Bill is another effort by the Department of Finance to put their tentacles around all the activities of the State.  The terminology used in this Bill is similar to that used in the Coillte Teoranta Bill.  The Minister was anxious to get that legislation passed as there was an urgency on the forestry side in so far as there was a need to move on as promises had been made and they were fulfilled.  I appreciate the Minister doing that but I question the timing of this Bill. We all know that Bord na Móna have considerable difficulties.  The former Minister in his wisdom appointed consultants and gave them a wide-ranging brief and asked them to look into Bord na Móna and its future.  I wonder why this Bill was introduced before the consultants' report became available.  When replying perhaps the Minister would say if the consultants have seen this Bill, have they examined it, have they made comments on it, have they approved of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Bruton, pointed out there are many limitations in this Bill.  It expresses almost verbatim <Col N="2527" /> what the Minister and his party said about the scope for growth in peat.  They said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil remains committed to the maximum utilisation of our peat resources.  Bord na Móna is on the threshold of great change as its peat production phase approaches maturity.  Its future role needs to be clearly defined and we will provide a new and wider brief to fit the organisation for years ahead and make it fully market orientated.</P>
    <P>These are laudable aspirations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled by the initiative in this case because if the former Minister decided to spend enormous sums on a consultants' report &mdash; I doubt if it was out of friendship that he appointed them, I would not say the Minister would do that but he would do it in the interests of Bord na Móna &mdash; why did the Minister proceed with this Bill at this time?  I do not understand it, especially when the consultants' report is expected next January. Is it right that we should rush a Bill through the House about changes in Bord na Móna and pack in Government Deputies praising the Minister for his initiative, the company's wide expansion, their commercial orientation and all the rest of it?  Indeed, all the other Deputies praised it.  Next February or March we will have a total change as a result of the consultants' report about the position in Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that Bord na Móna cannot meet their debt.  If we were serious about the future of Bord na Móna we would first tackle the major problem of the financial difficulties in which the board find themselves. I am not going to say that every political party in this House can wash their hands of the problem and say they <Col N="2528" /> did not do anything about it.  The Minister can say to me when the Coalition were in power they did not do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I got out a number of Bills and looked through them to see what went on, and I am not satisfied with what went on in the time of the previous Government either. This Government laud themselves about their realism and the new beginning and all the changes and the challenges we will have in this community and they leave a company and their employees, who are dependent socially on it, in limbo with a new Bill that is just putting in order things that have existed for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about their great progress, the progress on the horticultural side, the forays into Europe and so on.  Deputy Dempsey said that this would be a new development.  This is something that is there already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is something else wrong.  There is a serious debt problem in the company.  That was the first problem that should have been faced by the Minister before bringing in a Bill for Bord na Móna &mdash; and I think Deputy Dempsey proposed a solution with which I would not disagree.  He talked about the position of the debt in Bord na Móna and how this liability could be reduced. The National Planning Board indicated a formula by which the Minister and his Government might consider a degree of write-off in the debt because this is an untold burden.  The board of directors and the management are tearing their hair out every day trying to find ways to make ends meet.  How will they say to all their employees in counties Offaly and <Col N="2529" /> Laois and in all the other constituencies in which Bord na Móna operate, &ldquo;How can we guarantee continuity of employment?&rdquo; One way of doing it is to accept the recommendation of the National Planning Board and to examine its efficiency.  I presume this is going on with the Minister's consultants and I presume that when the Minister reports he will be able to say to us: &ldquo;We will be able to put Bord na Móna on a profitable basis&rdquo;. The aim should be that they would be commercially viable and the balance of debt should then be written off.  When replying to Second Stage I hope the Minister will say to the House that he will examine that objective.  I join with Deputy Dempsey in reminding the Minister that he should tackle that matter.</P>
      <P>As far as progress on the social side is concerned, that is the reason there is a reluctance to make any massive changes in Bord na Móna.  I am aware of the great benefit Bord na Móna have been to the midlands.  When I was in my youth I spent a few summers around Tullamore and I realise the effect of summer employment on the economy of that town.  It is necessary that alternatives be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is commendable that Bord na Móna have become involved in the consultancy, horticultural and engineering fields.  They deserve great praise for this.  The Minister agreed that the Minister for Finance would join with him in overseeing small areas of activity.  I do not see the necessity for this.  A long list of areas of activity, such as the manufacture of plant and machinery, the erection of buildings and the undertaking of hire purchase schemes is given in the Bill but why should the Minister for Finance have to be consulted in relation to these activities?  Is it necessary for Bord na Móna to go cap in hand to Merrion Street to obtain permission? As Deputy Bruton said, it would be reasonable for the Minister to include some limit, say, up to £20 million, but it should not be necessary for Bord na Móna to go cap in hand to Merrion Street to obtain permission.  I know from sad experience what treks to Merrion Street can do even to a Deputy.  They will keep <Col N="2530" /> putting one off.  If any good ideas emanate from Bord na Móna or from the new sub-boards they will spend a lot of time in trotting to and from Merrion Street to obtain permission to go ahead.  I would ask the Minister to take another look at this provision and to insert some reasonable figure into the Bill, say a figure above £15 million, but if the Department of Finance do not agree to this, the sum of £10 million would appear to be a reasonable figure.  Bord na Móna are not going to go wild in the way B &amp; I or Irish Shipping did.  They committed themselves to contracts of enormous proportions. Apologies will not be accepted any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I know he is well able to fight his corner.  He has proven this in the past.  His progress to date would also prove this.  The former Minister, Deputy Burke, may have been misled but for the sake of the future of Bord na Móna can the Minister not ask the new Minister for Finance to reconsider his position on this matter and agree to the insertion of the figure of £10 million? Perhaps Deputy Bruton would not agree with me on that as he suggested a figure of £20 million.  Deputy O'Malley suggested a figure of £15 million, but let me suggest a figure of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for a borrowing facility.  I agree with Deputy Bruton when he says that making available such a borrowing facility is wrong. If Bord na Móna wish to set up companies they should be set up and given the capital <Col N="2531" /> to operate on a commercial basis without interference.  In the previous turf development legislation before the House permission was sought to increase the subsidy to Bord na Móna from £100 million to £180 million.  This Bill makes provision for a borrowing facility and everyone knows the consequences of making mistakes in this area.  It would be easier to lend money or to provide letters of comfort but in doing so we may end up in a worse position.  It would be preferable if we were to say to them that this is their limit and if they wish to engage in a joint venture later they should go ahead because we believe that they provide a good service and have a good product. I am disappointed with the Government's approach towards semi-privatisation of semi-State bodies.  I do not know if Deputy Cowen understands when I say it is another half-way house. The Minister for Finance does not want to let go of the goodies while the Minister for Energy feels he must be there with him.</P>
    <P>One aspect of this matter which has not been referred to is that Bord na Móna made a submission about four years ago to the Oireachtas joint committee in which they recommended that they be given the borrowing powers that are being provided in the Bill.  As I said earlier, they should be allowed to avail of commercial opportunities.  Everyone has praised Bord na Móna, yet they say that we should look to Finland for our model. In 1946 the Government established Bord na Móna and at that time there was no such thing as peat production in Finland.  In fact, they looked to us for advice and borrowed our techniques. Now we are looking to Finland for advice. What has happened in the meantime? Where are the astute Irish now?  I would have to conclude that limitations have been put on Bord na Móna, that the legislation establishing them has hamstrung them, that they have been prevented from carrying out necessary research and development and that they have suffered from a lack of capital. Under this Bill the Minister is proposing <Col N="2532" /> that Bord na Móna may establish new companies in the same old mishmash way.  I wonder will we be able to look to Finland for advice on horticulture or engineering?  I am sorry to be derisory towards the Bill because I feel that the Minister can do a great deal better.  He is well capable of doing a great deal better.  He understands commercialism, why then is he asking people to suffer this again?</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the operations of Bord na Móna with which I am very disappointed and that is their investigation of new products.  There are those in this country who have an interest in using peat or in using peat along with other products.  Instead of objecting to this proposal they should have considered a joint venture arrangement.  I believe this would have been the most progressive way to approach the matter. Alternative fuels are in demand at present.  As we know, smog is a problem in Dublin city in particular and if a manufacturer comes up with a formula whereby the amount of filth in the atmopshere in Dublin can be reduced I believe that that initiative deserves to be supported. Even if peat products are produced by a person in the west of Ireland this development deserves to be welcomed and supported.  I was disappointed that Bord na Móna adopted a niggardly approach to this development.</P>
    <P>I believe our spokesperson on energy, Deputy Bruton will be putting down admentments to the Bill.  It is difficult to know whether one should vote for the Bill on Second Stage after all the heavy criticism it has received, but in the interests of the people who are employed in the consultancy, horticultural and engineering areas who need a way out of the quango they are presently in, I suppose we should pass the Bill.  I believe we rely too much on the mandarins in the Department of Finance to get advice on every aspect of living in this country. They will really be poking into our pockets because of the way legislation is coming before the House.</P>

      <P>Before beginning my contribution on this Bill, which has very important implications for the people in my constituency &mdash; a Bill which allows us to deal in detail with the specific provisions contained in it and the general change which will be brought about by its passing, and I believe this Bill must be passed by anybody who has the interests of Bord na Móna at heart &mdash; I want to preface my remarks by publicly, as I have done privately, offering my sincerest congratulations to my friend and colleague Deputy Michael Smith, on his appointment as Minister for Energy.  I have every confidence in the Minister for Energy's ability and capacity to pull together the various strands of interest involved in trying to grapple with the very serious situation which has developed within Bord na Móna.  I am confident that when the consultants have reported to him he will be able to come forward with proposals to ensure the company's long-term viability and the continued immense contribution which they make to the economy of the midlands.  I am sure the Minister will justify that confidence we are placing in him even prior to those decisions being taken.  He is a man who understands very clearly that this semi-State body is the life-blood of the local economy in many parts of my constituency and in County Offaly in particular.  This company have served us very well down through the years and it would be remiss of me not to pay a genuine and special tribute to everyone who has worked in that great company, even prior to the introduction of the Turf Development Act, 1946.  I am glad to say that in the local public life in my county there are people who started on that long road many years ago in building up what was to become one of the flagships of semi-State companies in terms of their success and contribution. Men like Pat Andrews and others led the way in making the company the great company which they were and I believe they can be as great in the future if we as legislators give them the power to direct their efforts in view of the changed market conditions, the need to be competitive and the need to get out and win <Col N="2534" /> a greater share of the market for the products which they manufacture.</P>
      <P>I have listened intently since 3.45 p.m., and it is now 6.45 p.m., to every contribution which has been made on this Bill and it is my intention to listen to all the contributions on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  It is with that sort of genuine concern that I should like to make my contribution.  As a Deputy from the constituency which will be most affected by any changes or rationalisations which take place as a result of Government action or internal management action, I hope these will have the approval, consent and goodwill of the workforce who will follow on in the footsteps of those who were there before them.</P>
      <P>The first point I should like to make is that a distinct attempt has been made by some Opposition speakers to attribute to this Bill purposes and objectives which patently are not relevant.  The explanatory memorandum to the Turf Development Bill, 1988, says:</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is the amendment of the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1983 in order to broaden the statutory remit of Bord na Móna to allow it:</P>
      <P>&mdash;promote, form, take part in or acquire companies;</P>
      <P>&mdash;delegate some of the functions of the Board to sub-boards;</P>
      <P>&mdash;engage in activities not strictly related to peat.</P>
      <P>Those are the specific parameters within which the discussion on this Bill must be kept if one is to make a contribution which is relevant to this legislative proposal. It is clear that the bringing forward of this Bill and this Second Stage debate give is all an opportunity to assess the present state of the board, their operations and the future of those people who will be working in Bord na Móna after this Bill has been passed, after the consultants have reported and various key strategic management decisions have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2535" /> While we may place different emphasis on the terms of the Bill, I think almost all of the Opposition parties are in agreement with us that rationalisation is necessary to secure the long-term viability of Bord na Móna and that Bord na Móna should continue to make a significant contribution given the social realities which are involved in the midlands economy and that the imminent demise of Bord na Móna or the ESB power stations which are related to the company, and which take the milled peat from Bord na Móna, should not even be considered as an option or regarded as a possibility in terms of the overall review which will take place both in this debate tonight and during the coming months.</P>
    <P>I was astounded at the contribution of Deputy Pat O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats spokesman on energy.  I regard Deputy Pat O'Malley as a personable and genuinely nice man but one of his statements caused me great concern and as a constituency representative I believe it is a point which I should bring to the attention of my constituents so that they will understand and realise from the very outset the Progressive Democrats position on this Bill.</P>
    <P>This evening in the House Deputy O'Malley asked the following question: &ldquo;Is it right to maintain an inefficient system of production when you are imposing a cost handicap on our economy and threatening existing jobs in industry, indeed limiting the prospect of creating new jobs because of high energy costs?&rdquo;. The important reply to his own question was: &ldquo;It would be better to reduce those costs and devote the savings to providing alternative types of employment&rdquo;.  It was definitely the gist of what he was saying that the Progrssive Democrats had in their minds the possibility that it would perhaps be better to close the power stations that would have a limited life anyway, and forget about the milled peat being supplied by Bord na Móna stations, whether it be Boora, Derrygreenagh, or Blackwater.  It is incredible that any politician or any party should consider that that econmic activity should go and that <Col N="2536" /> from whatever increased revenues resulted from the reduction in energy costs alternative employment would be provided.  In other words, they would make the midlands a wasteland.  They would write it off in terms of its participation in energy production and they would wait for some guardian angel to appear who would provide alternative employment for the 4,000 to 6,000 people involved in this industry.</P>
    <P>This was simply another example of the Progressive Democrats ideology running away with itself and forgetting that ordinary people are involved.  Many families whom I represent are very much affected by that sort of talk and the implications of that sort of policy being generated publicly on Second Stage of this Bill by a party who claim to aspire to obtaining a seat in my constituency in the next election.  I want to make it very clear tonight that I and everybody in my organisation will be putting forward precisely what the implications of Progrssive Democrats policy would be in my constituency if that type of approach were to be adopted.  It has always been Fianna Fáil policy and will remain so to recognise the strategic importance of those two industries to our economy.</P>
    <P>When people had a chance to focus their attention on that point before in the 1984 by-election, when I was elected with the highest number of votes ever obtained by a by-election candidate in the history of the State, that was the issue on which the election was decided.  In future elections it will always be an issue. Only a person living in that area and working there as a constituency TD would know how significant this industry is to the constituents whom he represents and many more besides in outlying counties.</P>
    <P>When we talk about Bord na Móna and how important it is to Offaly <i>vis-à-vis</i> any other county, some very simple facts will enlighten people as to just how great that contribution is.  The annual industrial employment survey of 1987 stated that there were 1,678 people from County Offaly employed by Bord na Móna and 561 by the ESB giving a total <Col N="2537" /> of 2,239 people.  When you consider that the total number employed in manufacturing industry in County Offaly, both foreign based and indigenous, is 2,684, it is quite clear that here is a county where 50 per cent of the workforce in manufacturing industry are employed in Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Therefore any strategic decisions that are taken, any rationalisations that are to take place will be monitored by me and by my constituency colleagues and by my organisation, as we have done since August when the voluntary redundancy package was announced.</P>
    <P>We understand the significance and importance of this industry to the people we represent.  There is no ideologue or no so-called progressive party who will intimate, and expect it to go unchallenged, that it is possible even to contemplate the destruction of that industry on the basis that alternative employment will be provided in the future.  That will not happen so long as I am a Deputy or so long as there is a Fianna Fáil organisation in County Offaly and I speak on their behalf tonight, also.  We accept that if one is to be really interested in the long term viability of Bord na Móna there must be rationalisation.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anyone who wishes to inform himself of the facts and the realities of the financial situation within Bord na Móna and the way in which the costs of production are made up, that rationalisations will mean job losses and have meant job losses.  Last August, under a voluntary redundancy programme there was a tacit agreement with unions that 690 permanent workers would be let go and 404 workers would be let go overall throughout the board.  The take-up on that voluntary redundancy package outstripped those numbers.  What happened was that many more than that number left.  I do not think that I am too far out in this, but I think there are probably 650 permanent jobs gone in County Offaly. Other seasonal workers will no longer be taken on as a result of that package. That has very serious implications for the people and the communities I represent. I assure this House that I will use my <Col N="2538" /> influence for whatever it is worth at every level within this Government to make sure that an alternative regional strategy is agreed and implemented within the lifetime of this Government.  That is the mandate which comes not from me but from my constituency organisation.  I will be constructive and realistic and, most importantly, I will be supportive of the present Minister and of Government in that task.  It is imperative on me, as a constituency TD for the people of Laois-Offaly, to stitch that into the record of the House, on the Second Stage of this important legislation.</P>
    <P>There are proposed rationalisation procedures which are outlined by an internal management plan and are radical proposals. They must be given careful consideration.  There also are, and will be, proposals from trade unions representing workers in this industry.  I am a great believer in the consensus approach in order to achieve the goals set out for us which we know must be achieved if we are to maintain a long term, viable Bord na Móna operation.  It is possible, and I hope that there is sufficient goodwill and sufficient agreement between all parties, to ensure that we get agreed structures and an agreed way of moving forward so that we can deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>The important point is that we must restore the morale within Bord na Móna and ensure a common sense of purpose at all levels within the company so that the loyalty that has been the trade mark of that company will be in each worker, each staff member, each manager, to overcome the difficulties that face them. We are all too well aware &mdash; politicians, management, unions and workers &mdash; of just how important this industry is to the midlands economy.  It has been said that the ESB are Bord na Móna's largest customer and that is true.  In 1986-87, £45 million out of total sales of £98 million were sales to the ESB.  When you consider that of the total payroll of the board of £60 million, £19.6 million goes to workers in County Offaly, you get some idea that, despite the fact that they are a semi-State company there are areas in the <Col N="2539" /> midlands which are very heavily dependent on them in terms of maintaining economic activity and keeping up spending power.  There are towns and villages in County Offaly built around this company which built houses in north, south and west Offaly and into south-west Meath to ensure that their workforce could live in the area and earn a living.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that this important matter is being debated here this evening.  After the salutary experience of smog in Dublin up to last weekend and the reactions which it provoked from all sides, I look <Col N="2540" /> forward to putting on the record my plans to ensure that the adverse effect of any future combination of smoke levels and weather conditions will be minimised.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the other contributions to this debate, especially those from members of the Opposition, who have not been slow to demand action in the last few weeks but who did virtually nothing to deal with the problem when they were in power.  Let us not be misled into believing that our recent serious smog was an isolated incident requiring hasty decisions and imprudent measures. Dublin's smoke problem has been in the making for generations.  How can it be otherwise when so many people in the Dublin area burn bituminous coal as their primary heating fuel?</P>
    <P>The recent smog, admittedly of a sustained and serious nature, is simply the latest in an annual &mdash; though usually more short-term &mdash; occurrence.  There were similar incidents in the last five years including those in which the Opposition parties were in Government.  Indeed breaches of the EC levels had been reported to the European Commission every year since 1982.  I realise, however, just as I am sure the Opposition realise, that there is no easy solution to a problem of such origins; 80 per cent of the smoke in the Dublin area comes from domestic coal fires and every fireplace in which bituminous coal is burned night after night during the winter and in greater quantities during cold dry weather conditions which give rise to smog.  If all those who burned bituminous coal switched voluntarily to burning smokeless coal an immediate improvement would be evident.</P>
    <P>I am realistic enough to acknowledge that this will not happen overnight.  I must, however, applaud the efforts of residents' associations &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; local groups and individuals who decided to take immediate responsibility for improving the air in their own areas by switching to smokeless coal either for the whole winter or when conditions suggest smog.  Laudable as these efforts are and much as I welcome them, the need in Dublin to deal directly <Col N="2541" /> with the main source of air pollution by ensuring arrangements for space heating, domestic in particular, which will eliminate our smoke problem once and for all, is what we are considering at this time.  It cannot be done overnight but we must put in place measures which will enable it to be dealt with in the shortest possible term.</P>
    <P>Let me explain the strategy to date.  On 8 November I confirmed the Ballyfermot special area control order and put in place a scheme of grants to allow people in the designated area to change over to heating systems which will make sure that there will be no further smoke problems in that part of Ballyfermot.  Everybody has accepted that that should be done.  This is the first such area designated under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, a measure which was the first legislation brought to the Dáil by the Government.  Special control areas are the means envisaged to deal with serious air pollution of long standing and localised areas.  Ballyfermot was one such area with the worst record in the long history of the city's smoke problem. It is not right to say that trans-boundary air pollution can somehow cause a continuation of the situation.  Smog is localised; when the temperature is around 40º and the wind is at 5 knots or less, you get smog.  However, it does not travel very far, it is localised and, consequently, people can make a significant contribution to ease the situation in their own areas even in the short term.  Even to change to smokeless fuel for a few days in those conditions would make an enormous contribution.</P>
    <P>Combined with the funds available for grant purposes for 1988 and 1989, £1.25 million in total, the designation of the first special controlled area gives the necessary impetus to Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to advance measures to deal with the smog problem in other areas of the city where monitoring has shown persistent breaches of the EC limit values and our national air quality standards for suspended particles, including smoke.</P>
    <P>Last week I met the officials of Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation <Col N="2542" /> to discuss progress with the special control area orders.  I was assured that the implementation of the Ballyfermot order would proceed very quickly and that no time would be lost in bringing forward further orders for designation.  I understand that an order for a second area of 900 houses in Ballyfermot will be discussed by Dublin Corporation inside a week and that plans are at an advanced stage for the designation of a further 2,000 houses in the Ballyfermot area and some 3,500 houses in Neilstown, Cabra and Crumlin.  Possibly a central area such as Mountjoy Square should follow as early as possible in 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand his problem. Designation involves the imposition of a legal requirement to convert heating systems, where necessary, and it is part of the answer to smoke pollution in seriously affected, localised areas.  It is not, however, the only measure on which we can or should rely because it will not solve the problem.  Smoke levels, combined with weather conditions in Dublin in November, gave rise to breaches of the EC limits sufficiently serious to require notification to the Commission as required under the relevant directives. Breaches have occurred in Ballyfermot, Cabra, Crumlin, Mountjoy Square, Rathmines, Quarryvale and Neilstown already, although we do not have to report to the Commission until next March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be quite clear about our position <i>vis-à-vis</i> EC requirements.  The start we have made in controlling the smoke problem is part of a plan which aims to eliminate the Dublin smoke problems permanently in a controlled manner in order comply with the EC directive by the end of April 1993, ten years after adoption of the directive &mdash; the period <Col N="2543" /> recognised by the Commission as necessary to solve the problem, not just in Dublin but in the other cities in Europe where levels have been exceeded.  I did not hear much bleating about it until this winter and when somebody is doing something about it by way of legislation and action people are trying to get on the bandwagon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have lost no time in bringing forward measures to control Dublin's smoke.  These measures include the prescribing of air quality standards, including one for suspended particles and smoke, as well as issuing a ministerial directive related to monitoring and the putting in place, after the completion of statutory procedures, of the first special area order.  In addition, I have recently made regulations which will introduce a new licensing system for industrial plants that may cause air pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I announced on 8 November that I had confirmed a special control area order for part of Ballyfermot I made it clear that this was only one of a number of measures I planned to put in place to solve Dublin's smoke problems for once and for all, and not just when it was present.  When the wind comes up my <Col N="2544" /> resolve does not go away.  It is appropriate that I should describe these measures which will, I believe, lead to further significant reductions in some levels in the future.  First, I announced that the new house grants in the built-up areas of Dublin city and county would in future be confined to houses designed and equipped with heating systems which will not add to the smoke problem.  Detailed arrangements are being worked out to get this new system into place.  At the same time similar measures will be taken in relation to new local authority dwellings in the area.</P>
    <P>Secondly, to back up the action taken on the housing grants side I am issuing a general policy directive under the Planning Acts to all planning authorities, requiring that, in areas where smoke emissions are a problem, decisions on individual planning applications, whether for new developments or for major reconstructions, should take account of the smoke problem and in particular should take account of the need for combustion appliances and fuels in these areas to be non-polluting.  This measure, coupled with the action being take on the housing grants side, will ensure that as new developments take place, whether in the suburbs or on infill sites around the city, they will not add to the existing smoke problems.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I announced that action would be taken either through the existing remedial works scheme or through a special scheme to convert Dublin Corporation's houses and flats to smokeless heating systems where major refurbishment work is being carried out.  That is expensive, I have already discussed this aspect with the city manager and I expect to see proposals for particular schemes coming forward without undue delay.</P>
    <P>Fourtly, I announced that an information campaign would be developed to advise the public of the advantage of smokeless fuels and heating appliances and the conversion possibilities.  I have to put it on record that everyone whom I have met so far has responded magnificiently. That is evident on radio, television and in the newspapers, local and <Col N="2545" /> national.  The people have responded because they recognise there is a problem and they have some responsibility in that regard.  From the figures given to me by suppliers and the increased uptake of smokeless fuels I believe it is taking effect.  There has been an enormous upsurge in interest by way of buying smokeless fuels.  Deputies here know that to be so.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the campaign have already been sought from advertising agencies and I intend that a beginning will be made before Christmas in that regard.  That will be a critical time and that is the time we want to get the biggest impact of the publicity campaign for those who can afford to make the personal choice to remove this pollution from the atmosphere.  I will be looking particularly to local residents' associations and community groups around the city and county to support this campaign. I am happy to acknowledge that people are phoning and saying they are conscious of the problem and that they are willing to have these matters discussed at their residents' association.  They are prepared to take the matter into their own hands and solve their own localised problem. Once the level of smoke is down to a certain degree it will be possible, not in the long term but in a reasonably short period, to find a resolution to this problem that we all accept has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The smoke which pollutes an area during temperature inversion conditions is the smoke actually produced in that area.  Deputies here who visit their constituencies, residents' associations and other organisations should bring the message home to the people that the smoke is not blowing in from some place else; it is coming from their own street and their own district.  If those who can, take the remedial measures do so, if not over the whole year then just during the period when the alert is on, they can improve dramatically the air in their own areas.  This simple fact must be got across to every householder in Dublin.  Many of them who can afford smokeless fuels do not buy them and do not convert their heating systems to use other fuels <Col N="2546" /> because they do not realise that they are contributing to the smoke pollution which is destroying the amenity of their own locality and degrading the environment in which they and their neighbours live.</P>
    <P>I wish that people who have contributed so far had at least gone on record to say that they were personally inviting those organisations with whom they are closely associated to take that personal choice and initiative.  I sincerely hope that everybody, whether for or against the Minister, would state loudly and clearly on behalf of us all that he accepts this is one way of achieving a good result this Christmas and in the short term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting those who say it.  All I am asking is that there would be a consensus that we can relieve much of this problem in the short term.  I am having discussions with the suppliers to make sure that it is possible to make that conversion.</P>
      <P>In addition to developing measures such as the foregoing, I have had a series of meetings with representatives of almost all the major fuel suppliers in order to impress upon them once again the importance of making smokeless options readily available to the population of Dublin and promoting and marketing the smokeless options aggressively.  That is not always easy.  The question of supply has to be taken into account.  One can do drastic things but one causes more problems downstream. The best way to proceed is to use persuasion to get suppliers to make available these other alternatives in their own areas.  That is one of the things that we are achieving now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very large sums of money are clearly spent by the major public sector and private companies involved in the energy and fuel supply area in advertising their various products.  I want so see a large proportion of that money diverted to the promotion of smokeless appliances and products and to the development of <Col N="2547" /> special campaigns, creative publicity arrangements and so on.  Now is the time to do that.  This problem arises at certain times of the year and it is largely predictable. Long range weather forecasting is accurate enough now to be able to predict some of these times.  We must get the best advantage from the promotion and publicity campaigns.</P>
    <P>The fuel suppliers are willing to make money available to help out in this matter.  I am pleased at the way the campaign is proceeding.  There is not just one type of smokeless fuel, there are variations, some of which are not even as expensive as bituminous coal, as has been outlined in a full page advertisement in all the daily papers today.  There are alternatives available.  They may not be as broadly available as we would like but I am discussing that matter with the suppliers at present.  I want to ensure that they have sufficient stocks and that they are available in every outlet which supplies fuel.  The publicity campaign will then come into effect and will pin-point the people who have the choice and who will not be very much worse off financially, if at all, because of it.  We are asking people to make a personal investment in their own good health and everybody should be supporting that.</P>
    <P>Smog affects many areas of the city including those areas where people can well afford to take responsibility for eliminating their contribution to smog by burning smokeless fuels.  It is vital that individuals make the connection between the environmental problem we are faced with in Dublin and their own actions.  I have already mentioned the commendable efforts of local groups and individuals who have taken the initiative in this regard, but I want people to remember that even when the smog is dispersed the underlying problem remains, that of excessive use of bituminous coal in ordinary open fires.  The problem will not be solved overnight. It is possible to make a big dent in it. Certainly it is possible to have the matter well cleared up before 1993.  It will require the co-operation not just of the <Col N="2548" /> Minister and the Government &mdash; by way of financial involvement &mdash; but also that of local authorities, fuel suppliers and, more than anybody else, the 300,000 householders in the greater Dublin area who use fuel.  They do not all use bituminous coal but many of those who do could make the choice this evening to effect the change that would bring about breathable air in this city.</P>
    <P>There are many for whom the option of converting to smokeless heating systems, such as gas, oil, electricity, or a closed solid fuel burner may be too expensive but who could use smokeless fuel in their existing fireplaces at least during smog episodes.  Then we could tackle the long-term problem to convert so that they would not be placed under any pressure in the longer term.  But in the short term, within the capabilities of their existing heating systems, they could make that choice even for the few days at a time that becomes necessary.  It does not constitute a solution but would certainly be taking a positive initiative.</P>
    <P>An essential element of my information campaign will be the message that smokeless fuel can be used by anybody with an open fireplace and that it is value for money.  There are stories put about that it is difficult to light, that it does not have this or that output.  The truth of the matter which will be brought home in the course of the campaign is that, with a little experience, it is quite easy to light and, in most cases, has a greater output. I grant it may not have the same flame effect; not all of the smokeless fuels do but when people understand how to make the best use of it I believe they will make the choice, not merely for the sake of the smoke emitting from their chimneys but because of the heat value that will be radiating from the burning of that type of fuel.</P>
    <P>I will be counting on the assistance of the coal industry in this endeavour, on all the coal importers.  There are other fuels as well.  I have already secured the agreement of the importers to promote smokeless fuels.  I have secured the agreement of one coal distributor to reduce significantly, by 55p per bag, the price of <Col N="2549" /> smokeless fuel during this campaign.  It is not an easy thing to achieve in any circumstance &mdash; to get any people in commercial life to take a voluntary cut in the price of their product, sometimes below their profit margin.  At least it constitutes a major recognition by the fuel suppliers in this city that they have a responsibility, they know there is a problem, they know that people's health is at risk and they are prepared to do something about it.  I have had other people come to me in the Department who have indicated that they will follow suit.  Over the next week or two there will be many advertisements promoting smokeless fuels at reduced cost, making it possible for people to make the choice without a fianancial penalty. That constitutes real progress.  I should like the House to support it and continue the good work.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for the introduction of smog alerts in recent weeks.  I recognise that such measures can be useful in allowing preventive action to be taken on behalf of those most at risk from smoke &mdash; the very young, the elderly and those with severe respiratory conditions.  I am happy to report that a meeting has taken place already with representatives of the Meteorological Service, Dublin Corporation and the Department and that agreement has been reached on a refinement of existing arrangements to allow for clear early warnings of smog.  That is absolutely fundamental &mdash; that people would know as long as possible in advance that it will now happen because of the climatic conditions and the temperature control.  That will be the time &mdash; even if for a short period only &mdash; to make the special effort because, in the short term that will reap the result we want.</P>
    <P>All of the measures I have mentioned form part of the plan that will substantially reduce the smoke problems in the short term and eliminate them by 1993.  Merely throwing money at the problem, contending that perhaps 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 houses should be designated smokeless, could not achieve that result this winter despite the fact that it might cost £17 million, £18 million or <Col N="2550" /> £20 million.  Let us at least be practical and realistic: it will cost money &mdash; I accept that in the short and long term &mdash; but the problem cannot be resolved overnight. The most effective way to bring about a solution is to adopt the measures I am now suggesting.</P>
    <P>Other measures which could form part of the plan are being considered.  Some of the suggestions made by Deputy Jim Mitchell last evening are being considered. Some of them would be drastic in many respects.  Some Deputies asked me to take action which would not be permissible under the law as it stands. Nonetheless I am considering them. Even with the best will in the world, with a bag full of money, I cannot resolve this problem overnight for the very reasons Deputy Mitchell mentioned himself last evening &mdash; the availability of plant, conversion prospects and so on.  It will take a little time but, collectively, we are on the right road and, if we can get consensus, we can do it.  These are all concrete measures to ensure that the problem will be solved within the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I am also considering what further options may be available to ensure there is no repetition of the extremely high smoke levels of last week, and they were high last week.  I shall be announcing the outcome of these deliberations in due course.  In the meantime I have no doubt that the accelerated designation of special area orders, the grants available for adaptation, the promotion of smokeless fuels and the other measures to which I have referred, together, can make a significant difference in the short term.</P>
    <P>This is not a new problem.  I has been growing for years and we all knew about it.  It will be solved within a short time. It has to be solved before a particular date in 1993.  It can be solved within a shorter period than that, of course it can, but not overnight.  People should not endeavour to imply that it could be resolved by some ministerial stroke of the pen or magic wand that no Minister or Government has because it rests on 300,000 people.  It is not possible to dictate to them overnight to do anything. <Col N="2551" /> However, I am asking them to make certain changes.</P>
    <P>Smog has been growing in Dublin for 20 years, indeed long before I came to this city, 30 years ago.  When the smog arose it was always put down to bad weather. Today people know about cause and effect and they want action.  I agree with them.  I support the publicity about how bad this is.  Greatly heightened environmental awareness has only come to pass in the past year or two.  It was brushed aside by many administrations but not by this one.  Indeed it will affect all of our decisions in the future, not just about smog but about water, air waste and everything else.  For the first time since the foundation of the State more time is spent in my Department doing something positive about environmental matters whether it be air, water, waste or anything else.  Everybody knows that. That is why there is so much talk about it.  That is the reason we are devoting more time here to talking about it.  I welcome that fact but let us be realistic that we cannot change things overnight.</P>
    <P>What was important about last week was that it marked our environmental card for the future.  Until very recently the environment was a minority issue only.  Now everybody wants to talk about it, it is affecting everybody, and people realise that there is cause and effect, that decisions can be applied that will change the environmental baddies.  They see that it can be done.  They are asking us to do it, to put our money where our talk is and that must be done too.</P>
    <P>Some people advocate that, under section 53 of the Air Pollution Act, the Minister should ban coal or do something drastic like that.  In the circumstances that would be crazy unless other products could replace it.  Such alternatives are not available this evening and will not be in the immediate future.  It may very well happen that one day that will be the position but it cannot be done until such time as there is an alternative so that people are not disadvantaged or discriminated against in any way.  Also, remember, that if one did that there would be talk about <Col N="2552" /> free trade, about interference with people's rights; I get that all the time. People raise the prospect of job losses or whatever.  We do not want to encourage smuggling rackets.  We do not want to have measures we cannot enforce.  We do not want to be unreasonable with people who cannot afford to make choices now but we must press them to do something to help themselves.</P>
    <P>The smokeless alternatives are there and will be as cheap as I can possibly make them.  I can tell the House that they have been difficult meetings, perhaps not 100 per cent successful but by and large, successful, much more so than anybody might have predicted.  The climate, literally and emotionally, has changed so far as the environment is concerned.  This is an environmental problem that has to be solved just like the others whether it be waste, fish kills or whatever, and if one puts certain structures in place one can bring about a good result.  The package is already announced, to which hopefully we can add with the support, not merely of the Department, the Government and local authorities but with the consensus of this House, and more particularly that of the 300,000 people who enjoy the warmth and comfort of their fires but who must recognise once and for all that these fires are emitting smoke &mdash; even if not in a designated area &mdash; that is contributing to the overall general level of smog or smoke in this city.  In the light of the financial resources available to those people to change to smokeless fuels, I am asking them to take the initiative, to set the good example already set by several residents' associations on the south side of the city and by a couple on the north side also who are contemplating the same action.  Is it not much more important that people would take the resolution available into their own hands, rather than always depending on the Government?  Despite our best efforts we cannot do everything.  The problem, like many others we are facing, comes down to individual choices.  It is extraordinary that everywhere I go people are talking about the smog problems and this is making them make the choice.  That is <Col N="2553" /> why the volume of briquette sales and sales of coalite and other smokeless fuels has risen.  The volume has risen so much that special orders are being placed today to cater for the demand.  I welcome that upsurge in demand; we will benefit from it.  So far as I am concerned, smog exists in this town.  For the first time people are talking about it and about environmental problems.  We cannot buy comfort or jobs at the expense of the environment.  I have put that marker down for the past couple of weeks and months.  We will not sacrifice the environment for comfort or jobs.  The solution to this problem is in our own hands.  Let us here in the House make the choice this evening to take a stand for the environment and ask everybody to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on this motion.  The Minister said that everybody is talking about the problem.  Of course they are.  It has reached crisis proportions now and we have breached EC limits on smog and smoke pollution on a number of days to the extent that we are now required to formally report the matter to the EC. That is an indication of the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will willingly give that information to heighten awareness of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need to have our awareness of the problem heightened.  We are all familiar with the major problem we have.  What we are doing tonight is trying to find ways to address that problem.  The motion on the Order Paper notes that the Minister has taken only token steps to address the problem and it points out that the pace of progress set by the Minister is too slow. The Minister has not just taken token steps in relation to the long term solution. The Air Pollution Act and the area control order he confirms under it, will in time provide a solution to this major environmental and health problem.  What we should be doing here tonight is <Col N="2554" /> addressing what needs to be done in the short term to address the problem that has now reached crisis proportions.  We must home in on that while accepting that the legislation now in place will in the fullness of time present a solution.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister and some of the Fine Gael Members having a slight argument about whose fault all this was and there was some discussion as to which of the former Governments did not tackle the problem with the energy with which it should have been tackled.  Successive Governments are to blame for this problem. Indeed in the seventies Governments did not face up to the problem because the oil crisis at that time caused problems and grant assistance was made available to householders to instal chimneys. That exacerabated the problem because, as we know, it is domestic fires that account for 80 per cent of smoke pollution in this country.  Unfortunately the fuel used most frequently in open fires is bituminous coal which is the one that causes the greatest amount of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1987 Air Pollution Act is enabling legislation which provides the Minister with a framework whereby he can issue directives to local authorities and make orders that local authorities should implement.  There are major powers in that Act.  Under the Act the Minister could dramatically reduce the levels of the predictable pollution when certain weather conditions prevail.  The Minister must realise that the smog problem in Dublin and in other densely populated areas has reached crisis point and emergency action is needed to eliminate the resultant very serious public health problems that are being created.  Last week the limits were exceeded regularly.  This week the weather is milder and the problem is not as great, but it is likely to get worse in the immediate future, because the weather is bound to get colder which will give rise to conditions where temperature inversion is likely to occur.  This is something that is predictable and we should devise an action plan that will address the situation we know is about to occur, because we have the capacity now <Col N="2555" /> to be accurate in our weather forecasting and consequently we know that if action is not taken the smog problems will get out of hand.</P>
    <P>The smoke control order confirmed by the Minister on 8 November last for the pilot scheme in Ballyfermot which comprised about 840 houses has been the first practical attempt by the Government to tackle the problem using their powers under the Air Pollution Act.  The Minister knows that this order has run into practical problems on the ground.  The Minister will recollect that with a deputation from that part of my constituency, I had a meeting with him yesterday where certain views were expressed about the difficulties in complying with the conditions of the order.  I know the Minister has undertaken to examine a lot of what was said at that meeting and to come back in due course having considered it, but he is obviously aware that things are not going as smoothly as he and I would like them to be going.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the order has a very limited area of application and its extension to other areas as far as I can gauge will be very slow.  One of the very important things about these orders is the time at which they become effective.  We have to wait for six months after the Minister signs the order before it becomes compulsory and has to come into effect.  At that rate the first area order will not be compulsory until 31 May next and people will not have to convert to approved fuels or appliances until then.  This is well into the summer and it is too late to deal with what is mainly a winter problem.</P>
    <P>The area orders are also causing a problem in another respect.  I consider the order in Ballyfermot to be somewhat counterproductive in that we are now bogged down in discussions about what level of grant will be available for conversion to approved heating systems. Householders outside of the designated areas who had intended converting to gas and other approved fuels on a voluntary basis will now adopt a wait and see attitude until they discover what level of <Col N="2556" /> grant will apply.  The slowdown in the voluntary conversion rate to clean fuels is unfortunate, but it is a consequence of introducing the area order in Ballyfermot. As I said, I think the level of grant is a problem for the people who intended converting voluntarily.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the short-term problem has to be addressed in a fairly dramatic way.  The Minister mentioned the importance of a campaign to inform the public how necessary it was that they should convert to clean fuels, but we need a major public health awareness campaign on the health aspects, particularly on the problems that arise out of the smog we had in the recent past.  I do not believe the availability of money, or who qualifies for a grant, is relevant when we measure that against the prospect of shortening people's lives or bringing about an increase in respiratory illnesses. There are many people in the Ballyfermot area who suffer from those illnesses. We cannot lose sight of the fact that on an ongoing basis health care costs will be much more expensive than the long-term solution in eliminating the smoke problem.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to bring in an outright ban on bituminous coal and other high smoke content products when temperature inversion conditions are forecast.  There are only a few of these days each year, but this move would have the effect of reducing the very severe health problems that arise from smog when temperature inversion conditions exist.  As I said, the effective way to fight smog is to ban outright the burning of high smoke content fuels at that time. This has been the experience in other countries.  They got rid of their smog problems by implementing an outright ban on days such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The crisis of the last week underlines the fact that we must take dramatic action.  The Minister might ask what would be the consequences of an outright ban, and particularly how would it affect people who might have difficulty in meeting the extra expense in buying low smoke fuels.  As I suggested before, such people should be assisted through the <Col N="2557" /> local supplementary welfare allowance scheme to purchase smokeless fuels which are more expensive than bituminous coal.  I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that we do not get temperature inversion conditions lasting for more than a few days.  To ensure that we do not have a repeat of the conditions of last week, it is necessary to have an outright ban on high smoke content fuel.</P>
    <P>People have other options.  About 99 per cent of houses have electricity and the Minister said that people who can afford to use clean sources of heating should do so.  This brings me back to the public information campaign on the health aspects of this problem and the need to convince people that it is in their interest and in the national interest to opt for smokeless and clean fuels wherever they can.</P>
    <P>Another source of fuel the Minister touched on briefly that would comply with the requirements under the area order he confirmed in Ballyfermot, were Bord na Móna peat briquettes.  Earlier today we debated the Turf Development Bill and I had some words to say about Bord na Móna's performance generally, but I also mentioned the problems in relation to peat briquettes.  As a result of the Minister's area order we have a captive market for a fuel like this.  It is disappointing that Bord na Móna have been unable to respond as they should have done.  This is an indigenous fuel which emits smoke levels well within EC limits &mdash; I think the smoke levels are about 70 per cent less than for Polish or English coal, large quantities of which are burned in this country.</P>
    <P>As I see it, there are two problems with peat briquettes.  The first is the cost factor.  The company have stated they will supply peat briquettes at a cost equivalent in calorific value terms to coal, and that is an improvement, but there is a resistance to briquettes in the Dublin area, basically because people are not as familiar with them as they are in midland areas, and they feel they are not getting good value for money.  It is up to Bord na Móna to convince the consumers.  They need to heighten their campaign and to <Col N="2558" /> bring about a greater awareness of the benefits of using a native fuel like peat briquettes which comply with the smoke level limits the Minister's order demands.</P>
    <P>The second problem about Bord na Móna briquettes in an area like Ballyfermot is that there is a need for a distribution and delivery system which suits the people there.  They do not have cars. They cannot go to the local supermarket and pick up a bale of briquettes.  They are used to having coal delivered regularly in small lots &mdash; by the bellman system, as it is known.  Bord na Móna need to get such a system in place to penetrate that captive market.  As I said, I am disappointed that they have not made the progress they should have done.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the legislation undoubtedly provides a solution but it will take time to come into effect, and I can understand that.  I can also understand that there are periods within which people affected by the area order have to be given an opportunity to have their say, but a short-term solution should be implemented, particularly on days when weather conditions cause problems.</P>
    <P>Natural gas is an obvious solution if it were used in areas which at present burn high smoke content fuels.  Here again it is a matter of bringing together the energy agencies and getting them to put their heads together, especially on the pricing system.  This applies particularly to the gas industry.  Gas is a major natural resource, it is in abundant supply and it does not emit smoke.  It is highly efficient and there is an extensive distribution system already in place.</P>
    <P>On the pricing side, the gas company operate a multi-tiered pricing structure and the domestic rate is the most remunerative for the gas company.  Any significant uptake by the premium, domestic market would have a major beneficial effect on the gas company's revenue and should lead to major reductions in price.  I know the Minister does not have direct responsibility for energy, but in relation to this issue it is very relevant.</P>
    <P>It is also possible to bring about a conversion to gas much more speedily than <Col N="2559" /> was the case previously.  The Minister will recall that the entire conversion to natural gas in Dublin was carried out on time and within budget within a two-year period.  It is perfectly feasible to use the same methodology and contractual approach to provide new connections now as was used for the whole conversion process in Dublin.  Obviously you must start with the smog-sensitive localities.  If you adopted a blanket gas connection programme the cost effectiveness of doing it in that way would also be greatly improved.  It would be much more effective in terms of cost to do it that way than by the <i>ad hoc</i> system we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Gas is available in 235,000 houses out of the 300,000 houses in greater Dublin.  It is not always easy to get people to use it, but I take the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking here now about connections.  It is an education process and so on that the Minister spoke about earlier.  On the cost of gas, I have mentioned the necessity to change the pricing structure in favour of the premium domestic market.  I have not heard the Minister say anything about it; if he has done so I have not been listening, but the cost could be further defrayed by having some EC funding available to us. The prospects of getting EC funding for this should be very good in that it complies with directives from the EC regarding maximum utilisation of indigenous European resources.  It complies also with other directives regarding improvement of environmental standards.  Maybe the Minister should tell us his plans <i>vis-à-vis</i> getting funding for conversion to a clean system of fuel like gas.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the House tonight.  I would like to talk briefly about appliances.  They should qualify, too, for EC funding if the energy source itself is going to qualify.  The net cost of an <Col N="2560" /> appliance to a householder could be greatly improved also by long-term, low interest funding and there are various institutions like underlent building societies who could block lend to the gas company. Consumers could then purchase their appliances.  The cost would be amortised over a period of years and the consumers would pay for their appliances through the normal gas billing system.  It would make it easier, in other words, for people of little or low means to avail of such a system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell in talking about gas last night commented about gas meters. Ideally, people who have not a high income have always preferred to pay for fuel as they consume it and the old gas meter with the shilling in the slot no longer exists.  It has been taken away for various reasons, one of which was a great deal of deal of vandalism. There were numerous break-ins and money was being stolen.  There are ways around that to enable people to buy gas as they use it and the gas company informed me today that they are now looking at a new meter operated on a disc basis.  In your local shop you can buy a disc for £4 or £5, you put that in the meter and it will give you £4 or £5 worth of gas. Also there is being developed elsewhere an electronic card which seems to be the way of the future for paying for gas as you consume it.  These kind of things need to be planned for and co-ordinated. Maybe certain aspects of what I am talking about are not within the Minister's brief; they tend to be energy matters but they are relevant to the smog problem and the desire to get clean fuels in place instead of using bituminous fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Progressive Democrats will be supporting the Fine Gael motion.  I reiterate that I think it very important that we have an emergency system in place to deal in the short term with the problems which arise when particular weather conditions prevail.  I have said there should be a compulsory ban on the burning of all bituminous coals and high smoke content fuels at that time.  The Minister has indicated that he is talking <Col N="2561" /> with suppliers to ensure they are going to have readily available sufficient stocks to meet the demands that would arise when those conditions obtained.  Of course, other options are available, like electricity which is in virtually every house, and I have said those who have difficulty in paying for any additional cost arising out of such a ban should be assisted through the supplementary welfare scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the problem is being taken seriously.  Other countries have found that the most effective and best way to deal with it is to have a blanket ban on the use of certain fuels when certain weather conditions prevail. I do not see why the Minister would not consider that as a perfectly reasonable thing to do, given the crisis that existed particularly in Dublin last week.  It is a serious health matter and we have to use emergency means to redress it.</P>

      <P>I conclude by restating what I was saying when the Minister entered into dialogue with me.  I believe in a blanket ban on the days I have indicated. With weather forecasting systems nowadays it is possible to predict that inversion conditions will arise and on those days a ban should be introduced and any expense involved for people who cannot afford it should be met through the social welfare system.  That would be a very effective way of eliminating the problem.  It has been done in other countries and if we are to take the issue seriously we have to address it in a serious way.  The main cost in society as a result of not doing that is we are going to have major health problems; we are causing problems for young and old people and we are prolonging and giving rise to further increases in respiratory disorders for people who have to live in smog conditions. Such conditions warrant the bringing about of controls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>We might be able to learn <Col N="2563" /> from the past and we are here tonight discussing this matter, the seriousness of it, the concerns we have and the decisive action that is needed.  One would assume this has occurred only in 1988, but let us look at what has been happening in recent years.  A very informed article in this morning's <i>Irish Press</i> states:</P>
      <P>It may be cold consolation to choking Dubliners, but the city has experienced worse smog levels than those which have provoked an outcry in recent weeks.  The worst on record was in January of 1982, when a smog level of 1,800 micrograms per cubic metre was recorded in the city...</P>
      <P>in my constituency&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the Neilstown area of Clondalkin last weekend, a level of 1,352 was recorded, more than five times the EC limit...</P>
      <P>To be fair to the Minister for the Environment, he has put on the record that the releasing of the factual detailed statistical information has created this great awareness, plus the excellent medical attention that people are getting in St. James's Hospital which is directly affected by the problems arising in the Ballyfermot and Clondalkin areas.  Medical people are highlighting the problem, and hopefully now we are going to do something about it.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that people in his Department and people at environmental engineering level in the local authorities have been ignoring this problem for some time.  In the Neilstown and Rowlagh areas many of the houses are no more than ten years old.  We were well aware of the difficulties of other European capitals in that period, yet very little in the way of proper engineering design and facilities was provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The root of this problem is in the oil crisis of the seventies.  In my own constituency in one 400-house estate that had warm air electric heating installed, this was ripped out when there was a hike in oil prices and there was a reversion to <Col N="2564" /> solid fuel and open fireplaces.  What the people with full-time responsibility in the local authorities were doing in relation to this problem, I do not know.  Perhaps they did give warnings but were ignored. In any event what happened showed a great lack of awareness of what was likely to develop.</P>
    <P>We are now addressing the situation and it will be difficult.  The Minister has put on record here this evening certain actions that can be taken.  I fully agree with him and welcome the programme of Dublin Corporation to address this issue by ensuring that upgrading of flats and other housing stock will include facilities that will not add to the air pollution problem. This Minister for the Environment brought in the Air Pollution Control Bill last year and it is now on the Statute Book.  He is now following up with these various smokeless zone orders.  I think it is ill advised and negative on the part of Dublin Corporation to take a square block of 800 houses in an area of up to 6,000 houses in Ballyfermot and go forward with that sort of limited smokeless zone area.</P>

      <P>We will not get into an argument.  We are now all aware of it and are debating it and are going to take some action on it.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that whatever scheme is being introduced it does not end up with a whole lot of excessive costings.  So many of the grant schemes that we abolished on coming back into power were overspending and wasteful and I have a feeling that we may rush headlong into the <Col N="2565" /> same situation again with prices for various pieces of equipment being automatically jacked up because there is a grant scheme.  The Minister met a delegation from an area in my constituency in Ballyfermot and they explained to the Minister the quotations they were receiving for fixtures and fittings, and he is grant-aiding to the tune of 100 per cent. There seem to be anomalies emerging already in the figures.  The Minister and his officials took note.  I would like to make sure that we are going to get value for money.</P>
      <P>I would also like to know what EOLAS are doing on this testing.  How long more is it going to take to test this smoke eater or whatever the unit is?  Why was it not done long ago?  What have they been doing for all of the eighties?  What were they doing in 1982 when the levels were as high as they were?  Where is the urgency at official level?  The debate is going on now at a political level, but there are people with full-time responsibility for these matters and they have failed us miserably.  Dáil Deputies representing Dublin west, including Ballyfermot, Neilstown and Rowlagh felt quite aggrieved on seeing in recent days and weeks the problems we are having with smog in those areas.  We should endeavour to reach a consensus here tonight on the element of self-help in this situation. People can improve the environment.</P>
      <P>Then there is that select group of people who require protection and who cannot afford to buy the products that we would like them to buy.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that any support mechanisms he introduces will be effective and practical.  I would also like to ensure that no PR company now embarks on a national television advertising campaign when we could focus on a practical localised campaign which would bring about a much more decisive solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has highlighted about 800 homes in the Dublin area and that is where the spending and awareness campaign should be carried out.  It should be a community-led campaign of awareness, a clean air campaign in these areas.  I sincerely hope that the programme being <Col N="2566" /> drafted and the campaign envisaged will be carried out in the areas where its impact is most needed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Malley's comments as to what the ESB and Dublin Gas were doing.  Here are two national bodies with basic resources.  The ESB have surplus electricity generating capacity and will not provide it at an economic rate to people who could use storage heating.  Dublin Gas now cannot keep up with the demand to pipe the gas into homes.  Why did we not make it a condition of every planning permission in the last 15 or 20 years that houses would be piped for gas just as they are piped for television?  Now we will be going out digging up every side street and road in the county to try to put in gas and so forth. It amounts to absolute mismanagement and incompetence.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister, in overseeing this campaign, will not be overly dependent on those who helped to get us into the dilemma we are in in this city and in my constituency in particular.  Why cannot the Dublin Gas Company, who tell us the banks are stuffed with money, put some imaginative package together in co-operation with the banks or with building societies, or provide for payment for equipment by putting it on the price of the therm to rapidly grapple with the problem and bring about an eventual solution?</P>
    <P>It might not be practical to put a total ban on the sale of the fuels that cause the real problem.  If we could do that, would it not be better to ban it outright and to have a whole publicity campaign with grant schemes and spending of money so that one fell stroke could do the job?  I appreciate the Minister's dilemma.  If we rush into a total ban there could be smuggling and illegal trading and all sorts of problems and we would replace money lending with illegal coal sales or something.</P>
    <P>The House should accept that the Minister is now taking decisive action, however belated, to deal with the problem and should be supported.  I feel the House should not divide on the issue. I appreciate my constituency colleague, <Col N="2567" /> Deputy Mitchell, put down this motion and gave up his party's time on Private Members' Business and wishes to push it to a vote.  If that is the way it is to conclude, be that as it may.  I would prefer that we could be seen to be tackling this problem as one.  I would urge the Minister to take note that the ESB, Dublin Gas and environmental experts in the local authorities and in his own Department are the people who should be taken to task for creating the situation that has arisen.  Secondly, the operations should be overseen so that they do not waste taxpayers' money and fail to solve the problem.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the action he has taken. There is not an instant solution to the smog problem but the Minister has taken a major step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to touch on a point referred to by Deputy Lawlor and others and it relates to the question of a ban.  I do not think the introduction of a ban would be a practical proposition.  In fact, it would mean that we would be returning to the era of the &ldquo;glimmerman&rdquo; of old.  I do not think it would be possible to police such a ban and it would create a whole new bureaucracy which we cannot afford.  The most regrettable aspect of the issue we are discussing tonight is that the high smoke levels leading to smog have been around Dublin for the last two decades.  Notwithstanding that nothing has been done to effectively arrest that problem.  Measures have not been initiated to remove the root cause of smog in our cities, particularly in Dublin. We had to wait until the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, took control of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cities abroad affected by smog took initiatives to deal with it.  I am referring to cities like London, Glasgow and Belfast.  I understand that Belfast hope to be smog-free in six years time, some 25 years after they established their first clean air zone.  I make those points about those cities because, just as the problem has been recognised in regard to Dublin, <Col N="2568" /> it is one that cannot be solved overnight. It will take a long time to solve it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has shown by the urgency of his actions that he intends to ensure that major improvements will take place soon.  It is worth noting that 300,000 homes in the Dublin area burn solid fuel and that much of it is heavily laden with ingredients which under certain weather conditions clog up the atmosphere and give rise to smog. There is no doubt that smog worsens the health of men, women and children. Therefore, it behoves all of us to work together to try to deal with that problem and not have our hospitals filling up with people suffering from the effects of smog.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge that many people contacted me expressing their concern about this problem.  I have been asked by them to convey to the Minister the need for urgent action.  Many of those people have offered to help to alleviate the problem in their own area.  As the Minister said, the problem of smog is very much a localised one and we must welcome the offers of help from local associations and others.  I am pleased that the Minister has adopted such positive steps to date and committed resources to try to deal with the problem.  He has put money on the table for the first time.  His determination to make progress in the matter is well documented and he has outlined the measures he proposes taking, particularly the allocation between 1988 and 1989 of £1.2 million to support the schemes he has introduced. The Minister has said he hopes to extend those schemes to areas outside Ballyfermot in the months ahead.  He was referring to areas such as Rathmines, Mountjoy Square and Neilstown where Dublin County Council will have a role to play.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we must work together.  A team effort is required if we are to eliminate smog.  I should like to touch on the role that energy agencies can play in regard to this, with particular reference to Dublin Gas.  I should like to appeal to that company to develop their own plan to extend the gas grid to housing estates in Dublin that are not connected <Col N="2569" /> to the system.  In some estates underground gas supplies are available in certain houses but not in others.  Dublin Gas should participate in the Minister's scheme.  They should extend underground gas supplies to all the houses referred to by the Minister.  The Minister told us that 237,000 houses in Dublin have gas but I would like to see the gas system extended to them all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a positive commitment to eliminate smog and it is supported by the allocation of money.  He has given us an indication of his commitment to deal with the problem and if he gets the support of the energy agencies and of local associations, who have pledged support, we will eliminate the problem once and for all.  It is important to point out that we will not be able to eliminate it overnight but it can be done over a short period.  The Minister has made a good start by putting money on the table and we must support him, and the Government in their efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Minister's ability to troop his Deputies into the House and into the lobbies, to reject the notion that he has been delaying on this issue.  Members present in the House for the Order of Business in recent weeks will recall that he sat smiling as he was asked what he intended to do about smoke-free zones, regulations and so on. There was not a budge out of him.  The plain truth is that the measures he announced tonight will only work in the long term, and in the very long term at that.  He referred to new house grants, new buildings, refurbishing of houses and flats in Dublin but that is pie in the sky. It will not happen between now and the end of this winter and the Minister is aware of that.  The Minister is aware that <Col N="2570" /> the areas zoned by him will not be smoke-free between now and the end of the winter.  They will not be smoke free until late next year.  The plain truth is that the Government have at their disposal methods to deal with this problem promptly and effectively.  Under section 25 of the Bill referred to the Minister has the right to put in place a regulation dealing with emission levels of smoke from premises during smog alerts.  That power can be used by the Minister tomorrow morning and during smog alerts people would be required to burn non-polluting fuels.  That applies to industries and householders.</P>
      <P>A Deputy suggested that that might bring back the &ldquo;glimmerman&rdquo; but, obviously, we will not seek to enforce this by locking people up in our jails.  It is important to remember, however, that there is a lot of moral support for a change.  There is a need to give clear leadership in view of the urgency of this matter.  Smoke-free zones in two per cent of the city will not give an indication of a degree of urgency.  The extra cost maximum for a full week of smoke alert for a householder would be £1.50.  For those heating their rooms by open fire &mdash; that represents 40 per cent of Dublin houses &mdash; it would be cheaper for them to switch to direct electric or bottled gas heating for the week.  We are not talking about enormous costs on householders. Those on social welfare and eligible for assistance under the fuel scheme should be aided by the Minister for Social Welfare. The Minister for the Environment should suggest that those people be given extra money if it is needed during smog alerts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other instrument immediately available to the Government is to change the ridiculous tax structure on home heating fuels.  Oil, a clean fuel, is taxed at 23 per cent and coal, the main polluter, is taxed at 10 per cent.  That is ludicrous and it should be reversed.  It could be done by order of the Minister.  To be fair I must say that the Minister has to carry the can for the Minister for Energy who repeatedly in the last two years refused <Col N="2571" /> to do anything about an effective conservation policy.  Burning fuel in an open fire is massively wasteful.  As a country we are wasting up to £100 million per year by using fuel in open fires in a way that creates a maximum amount of smog and the least amount of heat.  I have been trying to get the Minister to cotton on to that but he has refused to do anything about it.  In his book conservation is the lowest of the low in priorities.  Now we see that it is a real issue and it has taken the smog alert to bring it to the fore.  The Minister should consult with the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Social Welfare about the problem.  It is about time that instead of perpetuating low income families on bad heating systems we had a decent fuel programme for them that will provide insulation and a clean and efficient heating system.  They are being given £5 per week to use the worst possible fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to be conscious of what our motion is about.  Our motion refers to the Minister taking only token steps to address the problem and it is critical of the Minister for the lack of progress he has been making.  I want to recall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that for weeks from the commencement of this Dáil and, indeed, during last spring until the Dáil went into recess, members of this party, including Deputy Mitchell, regularly raised this issue.  Indeed, it took a number of weeks for the Minister to make the Ballyfermot order, limited though it is, following regular calls from Opposition Deputies to make that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 November last Deputy Mitchell and I again raised the problem of smog in Dublin on an Adjournment debate. The busy ministerial meetings that have been taking place in the last ten days, when the Minister has been meeting corporation and county council officials and directors of the various firms who supply fuel in this city, only took place as a result of our raising the problem on an Adjournment debate, on an evening when this Chamber was filled with the smog that was polluting Dublin.  I want <Col N="2572" /> to reiterate what I said that night.  It is clear from everything the Minister said today, both in the context of Dáil questions on the issue, and in the context of his response this evening, that he still does not have in place the necessary comprehensive Dublin action plan that is required to tackle the problem of smog that is polluting the city and county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have a temporary release from the problem this week because of the change in the weather.  It will be back with us again, if not next week, then the following week.  What is being done at this stage still does not recognise the urgent necessity to take immediate action.  In response to Dáil questions today the Minister indicated that the Ballyfermot area order may be extended in the months ahead when Dublin Corporation finally get their act together.  He indicated that maybe by February or March he would be considering orders to cover Cabra and Crumlin despite the fact that he mentioned Rathmines, Mountjoy Square, Neilstown and indeed other areas, as suffering smog pollution away above EC limits in the last three weeks.</P>
    <P>There is no plan to indicate by what date smoke-free zones, or smoke controlled zones, will be extended to those areas.  What we need to do is to extend dramatically the smoke-free zones or smoke controlled areas, throughout major portions of the city and county of Dublin.  If the corporation and county council officials are not showing the necessary urgency, the Minister has the power to issue directions under the Air Pollution Act to require that speedier action be taken.  We have invited him, from this side of the House, to bring in amending legislation so that the necessary lengthy procedure we have under the Air Pollution Act &mdash; a procedure which is not designed to deal with an emergency, which is what we have in Dublin city and county &mdash; can be reduced and so that the timescale for making smoke controlled zones, or bringing them into being can also be reduced.  The necessary legislation should be brought <Col N="2573" /> before this House and it would be supported, I have no doubt, by all parties. There has been no indication that he intends to bring such amending legislation before this House.  There is no indication that he will use the necessary speed required to extend smoke free zones or smoke controlled areas; I would predict that if the Minister is still Minister for the Environment this time next year this city and county will have exactly the same problems as some of the areas have experienced in the last few weeks and smog levels well above EC limits.  This time next year they still will not be within smoke controlled zones.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister should raise the matter again this evening. The approach he has taken is to urge people in Dublin to take voluntary action themselves.  I agree that they should.  There are many people who can take voluntary action, but what is extraordinary about the Minister raising it is that two weeks ago it was pointed out to him in this House that regulations he has introduced to provide grants in the Ballyfermot area are a direct disincentive to anybody, anywhere else in Dublin, taking remedial action to provide new forms of heating in their houses.  The reason is that people in Ballyfermot who converted to gas during the summer have been told that they are now excluded from the financial assistance that is available to those people who did nothing until the smoke controlled zone order was made.  People living in Neilstown, Crumlin or Cabra who do not have the finance to change their heating systems easily but who would like to see this done will not do it this week, or next week, or next month but will wait until the Minister gets out of his lethargy and turns their areas into smoke controlled zones.  The grant system that is operating is a direct disincentive for those people who are suffering most from smog taking action themselves, within their own community, to turn to alternative heating systems.</P>
    <P>During the last three weeks we have had regular stories in the newspapers about the fact that the Minister is about to act, he is about to do this and that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2574" /> Indeed, we have seen some national papers being confused by running similar stories on a daily basis, written by different reporters about the action he is about to take.  In effect, the people and the citizens of Dublin have been subjected to what could best be described as a political smog screen, a smog screen designed to cover up a lack of action on an issue that requires immediate action and requires a degree of priority being allocated to it that has not been allocated to date.</P>
    <P>It is very sad that the Minister should come into the House this evening and tell us that the aim is to eliminate the problem by 1993.  There are elderly people suffering from respiratory problems.  There are people who suffer from bronchial conditions.  There are people whose lives are being placed at risk by the type of smog we have experienced in Dublin.  We have a duty in this House to take action to ensure that this problem will be eliminated before 1993.  In so far as existing legislation is inadequate to tackle the problem, we have an obligation to change that legislation.  In so far as there is lethargy on the part of local authorities or, indeed, on the part of the officials in the Department, we have an obligation to shift them out of their lethargy and require the extension of smoke controlled zones throughout the city and county where they are most needed.</P>
    <P>In the context of educating the general public to take action themselves Deputy Mitchell and myself, on 15 November, urged that a television advertising campaign or a radio advertising campaign, to urge people, where they can do so, to use smoke-free fuels should be undertaken. We pointed out how ludicrous it was for the State to be sponsoring a campaign to encourage people to use lead free petrol, which is virtually unpurchasable in the State because there are so few garages that sell it, at a time when there is a need to urge people to use smoke-free fuels. The Minister came into the House this evening and told us there may be an advertising campaign around Christmas, because that is the time when people burn most coal.  I have news for the Minister. If next week or the following week the <Col N="2575" /> weather goes as cold as it was last week people will be burning the same amount of coal in early December as they may burn at Christmas and they will be burning it in January and in February.  When the Minister made that remark I was wondering whether he was making a prediction that the next weather inversion will take place on 25 December next. Has somebody indicated to him that the weather is not going to deteriorate again before 25 December but on Christmas Day we will have another inversion and it will not happen again thereafter?</P>

My concern about the future of the cardiology unit in the South Infirmary-Victoria hospital complex arises from a recent media report which suggested that this unit was being transferred to the Cork Regional Hospital.  Since then my fears in this regard have been confirmed by news which is circulating and information which was given to me as a member of the board of the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital complex on Monday last.  I would be very happy if the Minister were to tell me that my information is unsound, that there is no foundation whatsoever for this fear and that it is not his intention nor the intention of his Department to transfer this unit to the Cork Regional Hospital.  If the Ministers can allay my fears I will be very happy.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked in Cork if the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital complex is going to go down the same road as the North Infirmary and if once again, Cork is to suffer at the hands of this Government.  I think it is worth bearing in mind that this is no ordinary hospital in so far as in that hospital we have the merging of two traditions, Catholic and Protestant, who have worked out a very satisfactory arrangement.  The chairman of the hospital is the Minister's colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Lyons.  I think we have proven that we can provide a worthwhile service in the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that and the Minister of State has the co-operation of his colleagues in all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be said that the South Infirmary promoted the idea of a special <Col N="2580" /> cardiology unit in Cork before any other hospital took the initiative.  It highlighted the need for the service in the area at a time when people were not conscious that the service was required.  This service pre-dated the opening of the Cork Regional Hospital which is now endeavouring to control cardiology in the Cork area.  This is what concerns me.  This service was being provided in the South Infirmary before the merger with the Victoria Hospital and before the Cork Regional Hospital was opened.  I would question the rationale behind this move.</P>
    <P>The first question would have to be what the cost per patient will be.  It will be far more expensive to treat a patient at the Cork Regional Hospital than it is at the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital.  Will it provide a more efficient service?  Will there be better patient care if it is in line with the type of service at the Cork Regional Hospital where you have what is called a five-day service which is, in fact, a four and a half day service?  If you take into account admission on a Monday morning and discharge on a Friday afternoon, there is no justification for the hi-jacking of a cardiology service from the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital, now that this unit has been proved successful in providing a very valuable service.</P>
    <P>There are those in the health board who feel that this unit is theirs to ride roughshod over.  It is worth considering the manner in which it was funded. Unlike Cork Regional Hospital, which received 100 per cent funding from the State, the community rolled in behind the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital to the tune of £350,000 to £400,000.  This was matched pound for pound by the Minister of the day and I am glad to say that it was my colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, who was instrumental in providing these funds.</P>
    <P>The South Infirmary enlisted the support of the business community and people in the community at large who are very generous in this regard.  The State provided the equipment and staff which now consist of one cardiologist, one registrar, one nurse and one receptionist.  The <Col N="2581" /> position of technician has been approved but has yet to be filled.  Ultra-sound equipment has been provided and, as a member of the board, the Minister's colleague, Minister of State Lyons, will bear out the manner in which the members of the board look upon this unit.  It is the flagship of the hospital.  If it is to be removed it will have a detrimental effect on the morale of people working there.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give consideration to and examine carefully proposals now being put before him as being viable, because I do not think that it is in the best interests of the people of Cork or the patients who have occasion to require the services of this unit in the future that the unit should be moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, you enter politics to achieve.  As an achiever you often in public life taste the bitter pill of disappointment.  In my 20 years as a Dáil Deputy for the north side of Cork city there have been few events more traumatic than the closure last year of the North Infirmary which served the people of the north side of Cork for generations. We now have the threatened removal of the cardiac unit of the South Infirmary to the Cork Regional Hospital.  The South Infirmary cardiac unit handles more patients than all the combined hospitals in the Cork south-west region.  Also, the cost per patient in the South Infirmary is approximately £300 less than for the Cork Regional Hospital.  Where is the logic in that move?  When we were in Government a special cardiac and out-patients' unit was built at the South Infirmary at a cost of £250,000.  The local community contributed pound for pound to build this unit.  Once again, after recently sanctioning the amalgamation of the South Infirmary and Victoria Hospital, the Minister wants to close down the main artery of this complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like at this juncture to pay special tribute here tonight to Dr. Noel Cahill, the cardiologist, and his specialist staff at the South Infirmary for their tremendous care and attention to all their patients.  There is many a family in Cork that has cause to be eternally grateful to <Col N="2582" /> this unit.  As a former patient, I cannot emphasise too strongly the importance that I attach to its retention.  The cat scan facility which is located at the Cork Regional Hospital is readily available to patients from the South Infirmary, an arrangement which is working perfectly and, in my view, there is full co-operation between the two hospitals for cardiac patients.  It is a callous, uncaring way to treat these people.  It is at times like this that one must feel inadequate as an achiever when something one cherishes and admires, like the cardiac unit of the North Infirmary, is put at great risk.  It is a time for battle and the people of rebel Cork will make sure that there will be a battle on.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy's question relates to compliance with the bathing water quality standards I prescribed in regulations which I made in May 1988, for the purpose of giving effect to the EC directive on the quality of bathing waters. The regulations set standards for 13 parameters and identified 15 bathing areas on the east coast to which the standards apply.  The waters at 12 locations achieved full compliance with the quality standards &mdash; Clogherhead and Seapoint in Louth; Laytown, Meath; Skerries, Portmarnock, Portrane and Killiney in Dublin; Brittas Bay and Silver Strand in Wicklow; Courtown, Curracloe, and Rosslare Strand in Wexford.  In the case of three bathing areas, Donabate, Dollymount and Burrow Beach, Sutton, there were occasional breaches of a small number of parameters which resulted in the overall level of compliance being below that required by the regulations.</P>
      <P>Where waters at a bathing area do not comply with the standards, the regulations require the responsible local authority to take the necessary measures, to ensure that the standards are complied with.  In this regard, my Department have asked Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation to investigate the reasons for the failure to achieve full compliance in the case of all parameters at the three areas already mentioned and to indicate the nature of the measures which may be proposed to secure compliance in the future.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 13, 17, and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the networks of non-national main and county roads rests with the local authorities.  Under existing arrangements, the cost of works on these roads falls to be financed by a combination of local resources and State road grants, including the block grant, the county road strengthening grant and special improvement grants.</P>
      <P>The extent to which local resources are used for road works is a matter for determination by the local authority. Because of my concern about the condition of county roads, the provision for the county road strengthening grant for 1987 was £15 million, compared with £5 million in 1986.  A further £15 million has been provided for 1988 and I have allocated £19.5 million for county road strengthening in 1989.  This grant may also be used, at the discretion of local authorities, for strengthening works on non-national main roads.  I have also decided to allocate £500,000 next year for improvement works on access roads to forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 October 1988 the block grant and county road strengthening grant allocations for 1989 were notified to local authorities.  The 1989 block grants are the same as for 1988 and amount to £0.522 million and £1.890 million for Cavan County Council and Cork County Council respectively.  The 1989 county road strengthening grant allocations for Cavan <Col N="2434" /> County Council and Cork County Council are £0.625 million and £2.650 million, respectively.  The allocations under this heading for 1988 are £0.480 million and £2.040 million respectively.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the replies to Question No. 146 of 15 March 1988 and Question No. 218 of 19 April 1988 which set out, respectively, the background to the scheme of St. Laurence's Park, Drogheda, and the number of approved applicants on local authority waiting lists for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position in relation to the scheme at St. Laurence's Park, is that the National Building Agency, on behalf of Drogheda Corporation, have submitted a revised layout and cost plan in respect <Col N="2438" /> of the scheme.  The documentation is currently under examination in my Department. Even if the technical aspects are found to be satisfactory, it will not be possible to issue sanction this year as it could not be funded from within the overall capital allocation for local authority housing construction in 1988.  Pending the receipt and examination of the capital claims for the local authority housing construction programme in 1989 it is not possible to indicate what funds will be available to the individual authorities to finance their housing programme in 1989 and, consequently, what schemes may be allowed to commence.</P>

The export of hazardous waste from Ireland is subject to control under the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1988 which came into operation on November 1988.  These regulations provide the legal framework <Col N="2440" /> for this country's participation in a community-wide control system under which hazardous waste movements, including any exports to non-member states, are subject to pre-notification and acceptance requirements.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the new controls is to ensure, in advance of any waste movement, that proper contractual arrangments have been made for disposal, that the proposed disposal arrangments are acceptable to the authorities in the states in which the waste is intended to be disposed of and that adequate technical capacity exists for such disposal.  There is an additional obligation on the waste exporters to ensure that confirmation is given to the local authority concerned that the waste has reached its proper destination.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems which exist in Britain with regard to contamination of some groundwater sources by agricultural activities and industrial effluents resulting in the presence of high levels of nitrates and pesticides.  Intensification of agricultural production here has not reached the level attained in Britain, nor are the application rates for nitrogenous fertilisers, which are thought to be contributing to the problems there, comparable.  I am satisfied from the information available to me that our groundwater is generally of a high quality and that we do not have problems of the nature or on the scale of those in Britain. The report &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland&rdquo; published by An Foras Forbartha in 1987 notes that while fertiliser usage may have raised the background level of nitrate in groundwaters, there is not significant contamination of the aquifers.  The Geological Survey of Ireland has concluded from the information available to it that, for most of the country, groundwater is pure and safe to drink but there are small polluted pockets beneath septic tanks and waste storage areas on farms.  Such polluting sources could be eliminated by a greater awareness of the importance of groundwater and care in the location of waste storage/disposal units and wells. Approximately 25 per cent of drinking water supplies in Ireland are obtained from groundwater sources; the great majority of supplies utilise surface sources (lakes and rivers) instead.  It is a matter for sanitary authorities, under the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, to monitor <Col N="2448" /> all water intended for human consumption and to ensure that such water meets the quality standards set in the Regulations.  These standards cover a wide range of substances, including pesticides and related products, and toxic and other undesirable substances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare, in view of the obligation on parents to maintain dependent children up to the age of 18, if he will take steps to ensure that (a) dependent child benefit will be payable to recipients of unemployment benefit/assistance in respect of unemployed non-school-going children aged between 16 and 18 years or (b) the qualifying age for unemployment benefit/assistance is reduced from 18 to 16 years.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable in respect of children up to age of 16 or in the case of children who are in full time education or who are handicapped, 18 years.  Increases in unemployment benefit and assistance in respect of child dependants are payable up to the age of 18 years in all cases.  The personal rates of unemployment assistance were increased by 11 per cent and the rates for child dependant increases were increased by 6 per cent from July as compared with the 3 per cent increase in rates of payments generally.  Further increases in these payments would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2462" /> Persons aged 16 years or over who are in employment are covered by the social insurance system.  If they become unemployed they may sign on the live register and they would qualify for unemployment benefit if at least 39 contributions have been paid in respect of them.  Otherwise they would be eligible to sign for credited contributions.</P>
    <P>Persons aged under 18 years are not entitled to claim unemployment assistance. To give entitlement under the scheme to persons under 18 years with no previous attachment to the labour force could have the effect of encouraging young persons to leave the education system prematurely.  This was also the view of the Commission on Social Welfare. To give such an entitlement would have very significant financial implications. There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has recently introduced the Youth Reach Programme to cater for young people who leave the education system without qualifications.  Under the programme an estimated 6,000 young people will be offered up to 24 months education and training selected to suit their particular needs.  While on the programme they will be paid a weekly allowance on the same basis as FÁS trainees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance on 29 June 1988, but her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment due to domestic commitments.  Following a change in her circumstances her <Col N="2463" /> claim was allowed from 23 July 1988 subject to review in two months.  On review, her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer from 16 November 1988, on the grounds that she was not genuinely seeking employment as she had made insufficient efforts to obtain employment.  She has appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her case heard by an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>In the period from 1 January 1988 to 25 November 1988, payment of approximately 16,000 allowances ceased because of the death of the beneficiary, change of address, termination of qualifying payment, etc.  Approximately 7,000 were terminated as a result of the Department's ongoing control and review procedures which revealed that the conditions for receipt of the allowance were no longer satisfied.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the functioning of the Casual Trading Act, 1980, and I have no proposals to amend or review it at present.  I am aware of the powers of local authorities under the Act. Indeed, these powers were given to the local authorities because problems relating to casual trading are of their nature, local rather than national.  It was considered appropriate, therefore, that local authorities rather than central Government should have the power to regulate trading in their own localities.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's reference to defects involves a court case against Tullamore Urban District Council. As this case is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court I cannot comment on it.</P>

      <P>This case involves two companies, one of which was put into receivership and subsequently sold off to the second company, which has itself since been put into voluntary liquidation.  Employees of the first company were re-employed by the second which continued their original pension scheme.  My Department received an application on 26 September 1988, from the liquidator of the second company for payment under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, of arrears of contributions to that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should explain that under the 1984 Act the function of the Minister for Labour in regard to pensions, where the employer concerned is a company in liquidation or is otherwise covered by the Act, relates only to outstanding contributions relevant to the year prior to the date of insolvency.  It is necessary also to establish the precise amounts of such <Col N="2469" /> contributions.  The reasons the contributions are outstanding in this case have not been indicated to my Department.</P>
    <P>The application received was completed by the trustees of the pension scheme and submitted, as is appropriate, through the liquidator of the company. However, it was incomplete in that it did not state the precise amount of pension contributions outstanding.  There was also a problem as regards the period to which outstanding contributions were stated to relate.  The period indicated was from 1 April 1985 to 1 September 1985, but this did not coincide with the period of claim allowable under the Act, i.e. a year prior to the date of insolvency (5 May, 1986).  The application form IP6 was returned to the liquidator on 8 November 1988 for appropriate revision in this regard.  The liquidator was also asked, in association with the trustees, to supply some further necessary information concerning the pension scheme.</P>
    <P>When the further information is received from the liquidator together with the amended form IP6, the application will be processed without delay by my Department and if in order, payment will be issued, in accordance with the statutory regulations, to the liquidator. In turn, the liquidator will be responsible for passing the funds, as appropriate, to the trustees of the pension scheme.  It is a matter for the trustees and members of the scheme as to how any moneys paid will be applied.  I have no function in that regard.</P>

      <P>An inquiry was received in my Department about the provision of an extra room at Canaholly national school, County Mayo, to serve, I understand, as a general purposes area for the school and as a meeting place for the local community. As the school in question is a two-teacher one, with two classrooms, grant assistance could not be afforded. My Department indicated that it would <Col N="2472" /> have no objection to the erection of an additional room at local expense, and was prepared to offer any technical assistance which might be sought from its local professional advisers.</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question in relation to Saint Coca's primary school, Kilcock, County Kildare, I confirm that I recently visited the school in question.  I will not be in a position to deal with the remaining points in the Deputy's question until such time as my Department's architect has viewed the buildings and has reported to me.</P>

      <P>My Department provides grant-aid to youth organisations under the youth service grant scheme.  Moneys are not, however, paid to regional affiliates of national youth organisations where the national body is already being funded under the scheme.  In this instance therefore any application for funding from the Dublin Youth Theatre could be considered only in the context of an application by the National Association of Youth Drama under the 1989 scheme.</P>
