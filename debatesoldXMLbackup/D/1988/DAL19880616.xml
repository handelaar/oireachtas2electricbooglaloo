    <Title>Córas Beostoic agus Feola (Amendment) Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: <Col N="619" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979, in order to confer on CBF responsibility for the promotion of pigmeat in addition to their existing promotional role in relation to cattle and sheep.  Provision is made in the Bill for the introduction by CBF of a levy on pigs of 20p per animal and for increasing the existing levies on cattle and sheep from £1 and 10p respectively to £1.50 and 20p. The opportunity is also being taken to introduce certain provisions which will facilitate the collection of levies by CBF.</P>
      <P>CBF were established under the 1979 Act and replaced CBF Teoranta, a company limited by guarantee.  Heretofore, their purposes, broadly, have been to promote the export of cattle and sheep and their meats and to furnish promotional and marketing support to exporters in addition to the promotion of beef, mutton and lamb on the home market.  The role of CBF in relation to cattle and sheep could be defined as follows: To adopt a position of leadership which will be instrumental in guiding the industry towards meeting market requirements; to provide processors and exporters with specialist marketing support services; to build an information bridge between the market and the producer.</P>
      <P>In so far as pigmeat is concerned, for some time past there has been no body responsible for the overall promotion of pigmeat.  Córas Tráchtála Teo have been doing very valuable work in assisting individual pigmeat firms in their export endeavour.  However, CTT have no function in relation to the home market which accounts for some 70 per cent of our pigmeat output.  This has been a matter of considerable concern to me, as indeed has the fact that the industry must now also meet the competition at home from imports from some other member states of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware of the major development and rationalisation programme for the pigmeat sector which is <Col N="620" /> already underway.  This programme involves a total investment of up to £140 million, including very substantial inputs by the Exchequer and FEOGA.  The main elements of the programmes are the establishment of about eight centralised slaughter units, each with a minimum capacity of 6,000 pigs a week, which will cater for their own needs and for those of surrounding processing plants.  All of these premises will meet the highest standards prescribed by EC and third country importers particularly the United States and Japan.  The successful implementation of the plan will require a substantial increase of pigmeat output from 2.2 million pigs a year at present to nearly 3 million by 1992.  All of this extra product will have to be exported and increased exports of £100 million are targeted.</P>
    <P>I regard the efficient promotion of pigmeat as an essential element in the success of the programme.  Hence this Bill, under which CBF, which has done such fine work in promoting beef and lamb, will take over the promotion of pigmeat on the home and export markets.  CBF will provide the necessary assistance to those firms which will be adopting strategies and programmes to market in the most effective way the increased output which will result from the development and modernisation programme.  The decision to extend the role of CBF to cover pigmeat has, in general, been well received by the various sectors of the industry.</P>
    <P>As regards the funding of the activities of CBF in relation to pigmeat, it is proposed to introduce a levy by CBF of 20p per pig.  This will yield about £400,000 in a full year.  In addition, a further £400,000 is being transferred from the grant-in-aid of Córas Tráchtála to CBF for the year 1988.  This latter will enable CBF to meet commitments already entered into by CTT in the pigmeat area and will fund further activities by CBF later this year.</P>
    <P>I am also taking the opportunity to provide for CBF to move into promotion of other meats at a later stage should the occasion warrant it.  The growing interest in deer farming and the export prospects for venison as well as the possibility of <Col N="621" /> further developing poultrymeat exports &mdash; turkeys and ducks in particular &mdash; along with the need to retain the share of the domestic market for chickens are examples of further complementary activities for CBF in the meat area.  These are medium&mdash;term possibilities for which provision is now being made.</P>
    <P>As the House is, of course, aware, the board of CBF are at present representative of the sectors of the meat industry with which it deals.  It is accordingly proposed that, since CBF are taking over the promotional functions in relation to pigmeat, the number of ordinary members of the CBF be increased from nine to 11 to allow for an additional producer representative and an additional exporters representative.  Provision is also made to further increase the number of board members by order if additional types of livestock and meat are included in CBF's functions at a later date.</P>
    <P>As regards CBF's present functions in relation to cattle and sheep, their corporate plan for the years 1986-1990 envisages a significant increase in funding to enable them to expand and develop its promotional work.  They will have an important role to play in the years ahead in identifying trends in overseas markets and in seeking out new outlets for the products of the industry.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Córas Beostoic agus Feola Act, 1979, provides for the payment of levies on cattle and sheep slaughtered in the State or exported live.  It also makes provision for the amendment of these rates by ministerial order.  The current rates of levy, which have been in force since 1 January 1985 are £1 per head for cattle and 10p per head for sheep.  I am taking the opportunity in the Bill to update the amounts of these levies by increasing them to £1.50 for cattle and 20p for sheep.  The board of CBF which includes both industry and farming representatives was unanimous that the levies be increased to these amounts to enable them to expand and develop their promotional work.  There is broad industry acceptance of these levels of fees. Current CBF levies on cattle and sheep <Col N="622" /> yield approx. £1.9 million.  The increased rates proposed should yield some £3 million. Taken with the proposed levy on pigs, estimated total levy income will amount to approximately £3.4 million.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Bill, which is divided into 12 sections.  Section 1 simply refers to the original CBF Act, 1979.  Section 2 amends the definitions of &ldquo;livestock&rdquo; and &ldquo;meat&rdquo; to cover pigs and pigmeat.  It also provides for the inclusion of other species of animals and meat by regulations at a later stage should the remit of CBF be further extended at some future date.</P>
    <P>Section 3 increases the number of ordinary members of the board of CBF from nine to 11 to allow for representation of the pigmeat sector on the board.  The board will then comprise, in addition to its Chairman, four producer representatives, three exporter reprepresentative, one livestock export trade representative and two members appointed by the Minister.  The number of ordinary members may be further increased by regulations.  This is to provide for the possibility of the promotion of other meats being assigned to CBF later on.</P>
    <P>Section 4 details the amounts of levies payable in relation to bovine animals, sheep and pigs.  This section also makes provision for a levy, to be determined by order at the appropriate time, on other animals if considered necessary.  It further provides that rates of levy may be varied, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 to 10 are designed to improve the efficiency of CBF's levy collection system.  They provide, in general, for increased penalties for contravention of the Act and firms will be required to retain records for four years.  Provision is also made for the appointment by the board of authorised officers who will be empowered to enter premises and inspect records.  The board may also estimate the amounts of levy due where firms fail to furnish the appropriate returns.  In addition, officers of corporate bodies will, in future, be answerable, in addition to the body, for offences under the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> The remaining sections relate to general provisions and there is little need to refer to them further at this stage.  These, in summary, are the main provisions of the Bill which I now commend to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The integration of pigmeat into the operations of CBF is a rational development and one which I support in principle.  The responsibility for promotion and market development of pigmeat products has been in limbo and it is high time the issue was resolved. The Bill was circulated by the Minister only two weeks ago but Fine Gael will facilitate its passage through the Oireachtas to ensure its enactment before the summer recess.  While I approve of the decision to extend the role of CBF to cover pigmeat and I am glad that the unseemly wrangling between Government Ministers on the issue has ultimately been resolved, I would stress that the case for the closest co-operation between CBF and CTT, at home and particularly abroad, has been considerably strengthened as a consequence of the debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no case for wastage of scarce national resources and rivalry between semi-State bodies chasing markets abroad for Irish products.  The Government have taken the opportunity to establish a levy by CBF of 20p per animal in respect of pigs and also to increase the existing CBF levies on cattle and sheep from £1 and 10p respectively to £1.50 and 20p.  This decision raises the issue as to whether the increased sums available to CBF will be available for market development and will, therefore, be additional to their existing resources or whether the additional moneys are merely to substitute for the existing Exchequer subvention.  There is a strong case for a continuation of the existing Exchequer support to CBF which, at a sum of less than £1 million, is merely sufficient to cover the fixed costs in administration, salaries and offices both at home and abroad.  If this sum is not continued it raises the question as to whether <Col N="624" /> CBF should be structured on the basis of being a semi-State body.  It is also relevant to compare the amounts available to CBF with the State contribution to CTT; the comparison is a figure of £915,000 as opposed to £20 million available to CTT.  Almost half our exports net of import content and profit repatriation are in the food and drink sectors.  A significant proportion of such exports is covered by the CBF mandate including £1 billion for beef alone.</P>
    <P>The Government have stated in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that they have high aspirations for the food industry.  The £1 million State subvention to CBF is a good investment as part of the developmental function of the State. It is fair comment to say the decision made by the Government in the original 1988 Estimates, where it was proposed to slash the subvention to CBF by half while maintaining a sum of £66.5 million to cover the bureaucratic structure of Department of Agriculture and Food, was almost obscene.  I am glad the Government reversed engines on their earlier decision to have that support for CBF.  Cutbacks in Government expenditure should not be focused on such a relatively minor sum being made available to a body who have such a major role in export market development in the interests of the entire economy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the light of the attitude of the Government, which can best be seen in their protection of the bureaucratic structures of the Department of Agriculture and Food, at the expense of those bodies providing frontline services to farmers and the food industry, the question of whether CBF should be a semi-State body at all in future has to be addressed.  The Minister has a whole raft of powers under the Principal Act of 1979, setting up CBF, including the appointment of the board.  I know some of the members have to come from different sectors but the appointment is made by the Minister and he has control over reports, accounts and borrowing powers. Perhaps what is more relevant is that the remuneration and allowances paid to the <Col N="625" /> chief executive, officers and servants of CBF must have the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance.  I raise the issue as to whether these powers are appropriate now where, even with the continuation of the State subvention of £915,000, the State contribution will probably be no more than 20 per cent of the income of CBF.  A case is developing, now that the main income for CBF is from the industry itself, to free it from the bureaucratic shackles which are perhaps more appropriate to a body substantially funded by the State.</P>
    <P>Now that I have the opportunity of addressing the question of marketing and promotion arrangements for products abroad, let me say there is a strong case for the development of the Ireland House concept abroad.  Basic cost effectiveness would suggest the need for the closest linkages abroad between the various bodies working on behalf of the country. This, therefore, raises the issue of having all such agencies under one roof.  In Paris alone, I understand that nine separate semi-State bodies are operating, all at different locations.  Surely major cost savings would be involved in rationalisation and a sharing of facilities.  The lead in this regard must come from the Government if they are serious about cost cutting and cost effectiveness.  This is the kind of option that has to be pursued. The CBF offices in Dusseldorf and Milan are shared with CTT, yet their London and Paris offices are operated independently in cities where there is a plethora of other Irish semi-State offices.  This issue has now to be tackled seriously by Government not just in relation to CBF but to the whole range of offices directly or indirectly funded by the taxpayer, all chasing markets for Irish products of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is time for serious thinking, constructive research and positive action on the question of Irish branding on the &ldquo;Kerrygold&rdquo; idea for meat products.  The idea has been floating around for some time.  Respected marketers like Tony O'Reilly and David Dand have touched on this issue at various conferences.  I do <Col N="626" /> not underestimate the difficulties from the point of view of organisation or cost. I accept the need for proper grading standards followed by the removal of any franchise in the event of the high standard not being met.  Intervention will play a much less significant role in future, and this fact provides another reason for urgent, widescale debate on this issue. Again, the lead has to be taken by the Government and it is not just sufficient to continue the flotation of the idea.  Much detailed work and organisation will need to be put into the structuring of an approach which would lead to the kind of results I am talking about, but I believe the returns from the market would justify the effort and over time the premium available from the market would provide the central part of the necessary funding to establish such a branding approach.</P>
    <P>Since the principal purpose of the amending Bill is to extend the role of CBF to cover pigmeat it provides an opportunity for comment on the problems confronting the pigmeat industry in Ireland.  Unless these problems are confronted and a clear policy established, CBF will not have a pigmeat product to market abroad.  An integrated approach to production, processing and marketing appears to be the answer.  The industry is on the point of putting in place highly modern plants with the aid of the generous aid package negotiated by Deputy Austin Deasy.  Accordingly, provided CBF are successful in market development and the present Government make rational decisions, particularly in regard to the location of modern slaughterhouses, the major problem to be resolved will be raw material supply. Here, as in the beef industry, the Minister has been singularly lacking in ideas and effective policies.  There is now a real danger that we may end up with a number of modern, half-empty plants without the throughput to justify their construction.</P>
    <P>If we are to increase pig output to three million per year as has been suggested, we need to put in place the measures to provide stability and profitability for producers and thereby the incentive to expand numbers.  The issues have been <Col N="627" /> identified clearly in various reports. However, producers still face problems of high feed cost, variable feed quality, high energy and transport charges, poor feed conversion rates and question marks as to the genetic merit of existing breeding stock.  These are but some of the problems facing producers and action is now urgently required on the part of the Minister to provide a developmental environment for pig producers comparable to that provided by his predecessor for pig processors.  Therefore, I call on the Minister immediately to put in place a policy to encourage increased pig production.</P>
    <P>Overall, this Bill is one with which I agree in principle.  We are prepared to facilitate its early passage through the House.  I suppose it is appropriate to take the opportunity, now that we are discussing the role of CBF, to wish them every success in their efforts to establish Irish pigmeat abroad in a major way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on the Bill gives us an opportunity to focus attention on what continues to be our primary industry.  At the outset I should like to point out that we do not object to the principal aims of the Bill.  It is a welcome development to see the role of CBF extended to the pig and poultry sectors. What concerns me is the lack of Government commitment to the agricultural industry.  Although we are living in a time of over supply in regard to many products, there is still tremendous opportunity in the meat industry.  With the projected shortage of cattle in Europe there is plenty of scope for expansion for the sale of Irish beef and opportunities exist on the French market for our sheepmeat. Members will know whom to thank for opening that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the role of CBS is being extended to cover pigmeat I hope they will promote that product as an equal to Danish bacon because up to now there has been a perception that our product was not comparable to Danish bacon.  I hope the effect of the Bill will be to restore some badly needed confidence in <Col N="628" /> a sector that has been neglected over the years.  Our producers are finding it difficult to make ends meet and it is high time that the Government took this sector seriously.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increase in CBS levies, I should like to say that if the primary producer can see that Irish beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat are being marketed in an aggressive way those increases will not present any difficulty. However, it should be remembered that the primary producer will be expected to pay more by way of levies.  For example, a farmer sending his cattle to the factory can expect deductions of between £15 and £25 per head.  Part of the deductions will be made up in reduced VAT refund. It can account for between £7 and £10 per head.</P>
    <P>CBF have a vital role to play in Irish farming.  The meat industry is crucial for the country.  It is estimated that it is worth in the region of £1.4 billion, a staggering figure.  Undoubtedly, however, the potential is greater.  It is worth noting that 85 per cent of the 500,000 tonnes of beef produced here annually is exported and that less than 2 per cent of those exports are in the form of processed beef products.  That is not good enough.  In other member states the figure averages out at 23 per cent of their produce.</P>
    <P>The importance of improving our performance in this area is underlined by the fact that the Irish Meat Processors Association have estimated that if that sector of the industry is developed properly an additional 2,800 full-time and permanent jobs will be created.  Those jobs are badly needed.  Changes are taking place and progress has been made.  For example, our export figures from May to June for chilled boneless high valued vacuum packed meat were up on the same period last year.  In an economy such as ours which is crippled with unemployment no effort should be spared to encourage the full development of that sector.  Much of the responsibility for development lies with the Government and the EC.</P>
    <P>The current structure of MCAs, variable premiums and export refunds places <Col N="629" /> processors at an enormous disadvantage. We need to reform this sector if we hope to create employment.  A lot of the responsibility for the practical improvements will fall on agencies such as CBF through their ability to find and develop new markets and because of their role in developing market research.  I do not find the basic aims of the Bill objectionable but what I find objectionable is the attitude of the Government, and their predecessors, towards this primary industry. That attitude is clearly demonstrated in grant aids to our processors in the beef and pig industries.  Our priority should be to increase cattle, sheep and pig numbers because we are good at that.  Before we consider diversification into the production of deer, rabbits and so on we should try to capitalise on the areas of production that we are good at.  The Government's attitude has been clearly demonstrated by their support for the industry.  In contrast to the Government's contribution to CBF of £900,000 they have made £20 million available to CTT for administration and general expenses. Millions are spent on agencies looking after industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that while agriculture tightens its belt and looks after itself, no similar attempts are being made to make industry more responsible for its own promotion. That is regrettable.  We have highlighted on many occasions the need to come to grips with our cattle numbers. I was glad to learn that CBF agree with the sentiments expressed here in regard to that.  One of their biggest fears is that there will be a shortage of supply in the years to come.  With regard to the makeup of the board I do not see why the Government, who do not appear to have any commitment to the industry or CBF, should have any input into the membership of the board.  In my view the board should be entitled to elect a chairperson from its members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill which seeks to extend the ambit of CBF to include the pigmeat industry.  In fact, I suggest that there should be a further extension into other <Col N="630" /> meat marketing areas.  It is important to recognise with the approach of the internal market that heretofore we marketed our products with certain advantages and that we did not experience the full draught of the competition which will be working against us in 1992.  In the run-up to the internal market, and after, that will change and our producers and exporters will have to face stiffer competition. Our competitors will be given funds to get the maximum coverage for their products in the country targeted by them.</P>
      <P>Dr. Tony O'Reilly, in the course of a recent television interview, dealt with the importance of marketing and promotion and outlined the cost of such work.  He highlighted the fact that without concentrated and concerted efforts in the area of promotion, which had to be backed up with adequate funding, Irish food products would not make the impression needed on the European or world markets, with particular reference to the US market.  That, coming from a man who has more experience than most in the area of marketing and food processing, should be sufficient warning to all of us that what we will be facing from now on is much sharper and stiffer competition than we have had to face in the past.</P>
      <P>I hope our producers and our marketing experts will be able to evolve in a similar fashion to the manner in which our soccer team has faced up to competition. That is what it is all about.  The competition is getting stronger and we have two options; either to succumb or to get into the marketplace in the same competitive fashion and beat people at their own game.  There is absolutely no doubt but that we have certain natural advantages which we have not even begun to utilise which we should be utilising and which, if our competitors had, they would have utilised long ago.  We do not seem to make the most of those obvious advantages we have.  If we do not do that we will have a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of brand marketing relates not only to the pigmeat, beef and sheepmeat industries but right across all <Col N="631" /> food products.  Let us remember that in the 12 months ending 31 March approximately £1 billion worth of food products were imported into this country, into our small economy with a small population. Somewhere out there people had the marketing techniques and expertise to be able to launch onto our market food products to that value.  I know that some of those products could not be produced at home but quite a number of them could have been.  There are obvious implications for employment if we allow that trend to continue.  I agree with my colleague &mdash; I notice this was also mentioned by Dr. Tony O'Reilly and by the Minister of State at the Department of Food and Agriculture in the last few days &mdash; in regard to the advantages of brand marketing, of taking a well-known brand, pushing it further, attaching as many products as possible to it and ensuring that the maximum possible advantage is gained for those products by that brand. That was a simple technique employed by Kerrygold and Baileys.  Everybody knows about Ballygowan.  A few years ago people would have asked Bally what? Again, it comes back to effective and efficient marketing, identifying, meeting and feeding the consumers' needs on an ongoing basis.  If that can be done we can penetrate the market in the same way that our home markets have been penetrated in the past.  I keep coming back to that point and I emphasise it.  We should not have the degree of market penetration of imported food products that we have at present.</P>
    <P>Our population is very small.  We are an allegedly affluent society and we have high aspirations.  We tend to walk along by the supermarket shelves and if we can afford something we buy it.  That is marketing.  It is a natural progression and we have to accept it.  It is up to our own people who are in that business to be able to put those products before the consumer in the same fashion and give them the obvious advantages that they must have.  Obviously it will be cheaper to produce and sell products in our own land than it is to send them abroad and <Col N="632" /> sell them there because the same competition will exist in either location.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the concept of brand marketing and its utilisation to a far greater extent than has been the case up to the present.  Having got your market, one of the ways to keep it is obviously to supply the consumer with his or her needs.  We should make sure that the product is a residue-free, healthy product and that the producer and the country has every possible advantage in every way, whether in packaging, wrapping, the manner in which the sales are projected or whatever.  There are many advantages to be gained and all of them need to be taken on board.  It is important that we concentrate on animal health.  We should be able to convince the consumer that our product is healthy, drug free and residue free and is being delivered to them in the best possible condition.  We should be able to ensure that there is no fall down in that chain from the producer to the supermarket itself.</P>
    <P>It is not unknown, even in some of the best-known eating establishments, to come across food products, whether it be beef, pigmeat, sheepmeat, poultry or whatever, that are slightly past their best to say the least.  In this House it has been known to happen, I am quite sure that virtually every Member has had that experience at some stage.  There is no excuse for that at the present time.  We have all the modern conveniences in so far as refrigerated transport and power wrapping and packaging is concerned.  A simple system can be readily operated whereby shelf life is reduced to what is allowable and no more.  No product should be recycled on the shelves in such a way as to damage the market.  One of the easiest ways to mess up the system and to damage your own market is to put through the system products that are in some way deficient, have expired their shelf life, that have gone off and are not acceptable to the consumer.  It is all very fine to have consumer protection associations. They are very welcome and very important but there should not be a need for them in the food area.  We cannot afford and we should not allow any <Col N="633" /> excesses which would bring the industry into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to delay the debate. A new responsibility has been placed on CBF and, as a result, the pigmeat industry will be taken out of the limbo into which it was thrust after the demise of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I hope there can be devised some way of making it clear to the consumer that a product is appearing on the market which is of the highest quality, which excels in its own right, that is capable of competing and beating any competition at home or abroad and that is getting to the marketplace in the freshest and best possible condition.  That is most important.  The consumer should be satisfied and his needs should be met.  There is not much sense in having satisfied customers for nine, ten or 11 months of the year if for one month or for one day in one week the customer goes into the marketplace, whether at home or abroad, and finds that the product is substandard.  There is no sense in putting products like that onto the market because all they can do is damage it.</P>
    <P>I would like to think there will be a new boost in sales in the pigmeat industry at home and abroad.  I emphasise the importance of that with the approach of 1992, not only in relation to this Bill before us but in relation to the entire food processing industry.  There is a market of 320 million people in Europe.  There is considerable market penetration into our economy by food products from outside. If we do not shape up very sharply in the not too distant future the market penetration that will be generated by the expertise and the competition that is being forced upon the producers within that market &mdash; I refer in particular to the European market &mdash; will be too good for us and we will succumb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Like other speakers, I welcome the inclusion of pigmeat as part of the responsibility of CBF. Anybody who has studied the pigmeat industry over the last number of years will know that strong pressure was exerted to <Col N="634" /> have it included in the responsibility of CBF.  Everybody knows this meat can be sold across the counter but not everyone realises that as the basic ingredient in other foods it is becoming much more attractive.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we have not increased pig production over the last number of years. That was mainly due to the insecurity of the market.  For years the emphasis was on production, but now processing and presenting the product attractively to secure sales is very important.  Pig production has been very important in small farming areas.  For years Cavan-Monaghan and North Cork were the prime pig producing areas, but the emphasis has changed.  At one time there were 90,000 producers but that has been reduced to 1,000 or 2,000 at present.  These are very efficient producers and have made very big investments in this industry.</P>
      <P>There are a few areas which give rise to concern.  There are six or eight large plants which are in a position to set up the proper structure to meet the criteria of the American market, which we have been denied for so long.  However, we should move fairly slowly and ensure that we do not damage the small traditional areas of pig production and processing.  I relate this to my own areas where two pig slaughtering plants closed in 1987 &mdash; one closed through rationalisation and the other closed because of trading problems. Efforts have been made to have somebody take over one of these plants but we have not been successful to date.  It is very important that traditional pig producers should stay in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for the IDA to sit down and mark certain areas on a map, but if they encourage centralised slaughtering farmers in the peripheral areas like my own will withdraw from pig production. I made this point very clearly to the IDA recently.  In our discussions it was brought home to me very forcefully the importance of food processing in my constituency. About 10 per cent to 12 per cent of our workforce are employed in foreign-owned industries, but 88 per cent depend on the production of pigmeat, turkey, rabbit and so on.  While nobody <Col N="635" /> wants to vote extra funds to CBF, in the present situation we should be very free with the money because employment is dependent on these areas of production.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the growing interest in deer farming and the export prospects for venison as well as the possibility of further development in poultry exports.  Poultry exports have been developed to a terrific extent over the last number of years.  Grove Farm, a mile from where I live, employ about 300 people.  Fifteen years ago this firm started by rearing a few turkeys in a loft and that firm has been acquired by Kerry Co-op for approximately £20 million.  That firm was built on grants and grants-in-aid provided by the IDA and FEOGA.  This is a success story.  This shows how much can be done.</P>
    <P>A few years ago we developed a mushroom industry.  This industry also had a very small beginning and has an employment potential of 200 permanent employees and 700 temporary workers, including housewives and young children. The importance of this market could not be overemphasised.</P>
    <P>Another area which is very important is the production of rabbits for sale at home and abroad.  There are approximately 100 farmers who breed rabbits. An entrepreneur has at substantial cost, set up a processing plant in Castleblayney. They are having discussions with the Department at present because they are facing problems as there is no veterinary expert available to help deal with infections. They are sure that when this problem is resolved they will have a very profitable enterprise.  Then not only will they be able to sell whole rabbits but they will also be able to sell rabbit portions, as is happening at present with broilers and turkeys.  There is a great opportunity here for downstream production.</P>
    <P>If the CBF take this industry under their wing they will be providing a great service for the small farmers who are compelled to go into other areas of production. A farmer with 40 or 50 acres will not be able to earn his livelihood and rear his family if he is involved only in the <Col N="636" /> traditional areas such as milk, where the quotas are being reduced.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister introduced the suckler grant for every cow after the first ten.  This will help milk producers, because these farmers have to move into other areas and the natural one is broiler, turkey, pig, deer and rabbit production. In my county we cannot increase turkey production.  There are advertisements in the papers asking for turkey breeders in Cavan, Fermanagh and Louth but not in County Monaghan because there is the danger of disease if there is an over-intensification of production in the area.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the meat trade covered in CBF's report last year showed signs of great improvement.  The meat plants are continuing the export of cattle and supplies increased over the previous year from 82 per cent to 86 per cent of the total cattle available.  A high percentage of these exports are in the form of vacuum-packed beef.  Despite our European Community contacts, Britain continues to be our main export market, accounting for one-third of our total exports.  Sales of Irish vacuum-packed beef to Britain in 1987 rose by 42 per cent in volume to 20,000 tonnes.  This satisfactory result reflects the efforts being made by CBF and the on-going arrangements for direct retail sales.  The Continent accounted for 20 per cent of Irish beef exports.  Vacuum-packed beef sales expanded by 30 per cent to 17,500 tonnes in 1986.  In total, chilled boneless beef exports increased by 40 per cent. This trend will have to be followed in regard to pig meat and sheep meat. Slaughterings of sheep for export reached the record figure of 1.3 million.</P>
    <P>A cloud hangs over the agricultural industry due to the reduced numbers in the national herd, despite the strenuous efforts by the Department and the Minister. There is no instant solution, especially when cattle are selling at premium prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a general reduction in milk supplies throughout Europe and it is very difficult to switch to using maiden heifers for one calf, then going into beef.  It is difficult to get people to change to other systems.  The natural instinct of most farmers when their milk quota was reduced was to buy an extra calf.  The result was that calves became scarce.  However, I believe an improvement is being made.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacSharry went to Europe in 1981 and negotiated the £300 million Western Package, which included substantial grant aid for a calf to beef system. I welcomed that scheme but criticised the number of restrictions which deterred people from applying and made it difficult to qualify.  The number of people who applied in any one county could be counted on the fingers of one hand and in some counties nobody qualified for this assistance.  The scheme is now being reintroduced and this is an ideal opportunity to promote the calf to beef system. Deputy O'Keeffe wants the Minister to wave a magic wand and have the Western Package introduced overnight.  The Minister says it will be in operation within about a month.  I have never witnessed an EC measure being introduced more quickly than that.</P>

      <P>We found the dates had been mixed up.  We are satisfied that EC approval was secured only two months ago.  The Minister will deliver a package which will enable small farmers to get substantial grant aid for the erection of effluent tanks and cattle buildings suitable for the calf to beef system.  This will provide an opportunity for the meat plants.  These plants should act more responsibly and should not compete against each other when there is buoyancy in beef prices.  They shouild behave as others do in the poultry sector and other sectors where customers are paid premium prices.  Competition in the beef market has made it very volatile and has not done anything to improve prices or confidence in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Feed prices here during the past few years have been higher than in most other producing countries.  This is especially the case in regard to pig production where feed inputs account for a substantial amount of the overall cost.  Whey and skimmed milk were heavily subsidised but that will not be the case in years to come due to the growing demand for skimmed milk powder.  Even though the pig producers, who were getting a heavy subsidy which enabled them, most of the time, to have a very profitable enterprise, are faced with having to improve the quality of the feed themselves since the subsidy is no longer there.  From discussions with producers I know that many of the cheap imported feeds contain fillers etc. and this is a big problem.  The quality of such feeds is not properly monitored and checked.  It should be closely and regularly monitored and there should be, on the outside of the bag, a list of the full <Col N="639" /> contents so that people will know that they are getting what they are paying for.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is that over the last few years the Dutch have had rapid growth while we were static. The Netherlands export about 60 per cent, Denmark export about 80 per cent and our exports are something like 14 per cent.  There is room for improvement. We have the know-how and the capability. We need to be able to get these together in conjunction with the CBF as a marketing body so that we will be in a position to compete with the best.  By doing that we will be giving additional revenue to the country and additional income to our producers here.</P>

      <P>Go raibh mhaith agat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  This Bill is clearly designed to strengthen the role of CBF and to increase the resources available to it and as such is to be welcomed by anybody who wants to see the proper development of Irish agriculture and the food industry.  The inclusion of pigmeat within CBF's mandate is particularly welcome and this has been an especially neglected and underdeveloped area.  Hopefully the power available to the Minister under the Bill to give CBF responsibility also for poultry and other meat products such as venison will be used as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a strong promotional and marketing arm of our meat industry is vital if it is to be developed and provide the jobs for workers and the income for farmers that it should.  The failure of successive Governments to ensure the proper development of our agriculture in general and the meat industry in particular is a disgrace and reflects what can <Col N="640" /> only be described as a lazy and indifferent attitude to what should be our most important industry.  The result of this has been that tens of thousands of Irish workers have been deprived of jobs in the food industry.  Many farmers have been driven unnecessarily from the land despite the fact that hundreds of millions of pounds have been poured into the farming industry from both Government sources and the Common Agricultural Policy.  We had an abysmal level of productivity, a declining number of jobs and a smaller return to the community from this sector in terms of taxes and investment. All the signs are that the Common Agricultural Policy as we know it is going and particularly the days of massive sales into intervention are numbered.  In this situation the role of CBF takes on an additional importance.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to face up to and to deal with the continuing massive export of cattle on the hoof from this country.  Exports of live cattle which, in the early eighties, reached half a million per year are still running at a huge level. In 1986 we exported 322,000 live cattle. While this trade makes fabulous profits for a handful of exporters and has found favour with some farmers who appreciate the less rigorous requirements of the live cattle trade it is selling workers' jobs down the river.  Exporting cattle on the hoof means exporting them in the least profitable state.  It is of negligible value to the country compared to the employment that could be created if the cattle were slaughtered here and the meat exported in a processed state.  The Confederation of Irish Industry estimated some years ago that if the cattle now being exported live were to be processed at home it could earn another £45 million each year for the Irish economy.  It is also estimated that 3,000 additional jobs could be created even if all these cattle were slaughtered at home in this country.  The aim should be to ensure that no cattle are exported live and that all the slaughtering and processing is done in this country.</P>
    <P>In this context it is worth referring again to the need for an identifiable brand name for Irish products.  This is a point <Col N="641" /> that has been made over and over again and it was made very strongly by CBF in the international meat symposium in Killarney last week.  While it is an idea that everybody seems to agree with there seems to be no progress in making it a reality.  There is no doubt that the Kerrygold butter brand has been one of the real successes of Irish food.  Why can that not be emulated in terms of a similar brand for meat?  This is particularly important as it is estimated that within ten years 60 per cent of our fresh meat sold in supermarkets will carry a consumer brand.  This is an issue that I hope CBF with its increased budget and strengthening mandate will tackle.  If we have a brand name for meat products it is essential that it be recognised as a quality brand.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest selling points of Irish food products generally is the fresh, clean, pollution-free image of this country.  This is an image that needs to be protected. It is an image that is being endangered abroad every time there is publicity about yet another incident of pollution in our rivers and lakes.  It is also important that the hormone-free image of our meat be protected and there are alarming reports of the widespread availability and use of illegal hormones.  Late last year there was a discovery of more than 1,000 cattle which had been given illegal doses of hormones in a feed lot at a meat plant in County Kildare.  This was not some small fly-by-night operation.  It was in a feed lot of one of the biggest meat processors in the country.  We were promised an investigation into the circumstances of this discovery; we are still waiting.  We are entitled to know who are responsible for this disgraceful behaviour and if they will be brought to court.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the levies that farmers will have to pay for slaughtered cattle, sheep and pigs.  I hope this will be accepted by farmers because it is in their interests as much as anyone else's that CBF be developed and given the resources necessary to do the job. People can hardly complain about these small charges considering that the <Col N="642" /> incomes of the farmers rose by 20 per cent last year, an increase that nobody will begrudge them, considering that they had a succession of bad years recently.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill also provides for a substantial increase in fines for a failure to make returns or pay levies.  It is appropriate that these fines should be increased as, unfortunately, many meat plants have a reputation for wholesale abuses and dishonesty, involving not just failure to make returns on levies to CBF but in many cases wholesale fraud, especially involving EC payments.  There is a need for improved supervision in the meat industry to ensure that there is no evasion of the payment of levies and that all fraud is stamped out.  I hope these issues will be tackled by the strengthened and developed CBF.  We support the Bill and hope that it will pass through both Houses as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this legislation.  We have had quite a few opportunities in recent times to speak on agricultural matters.  Quite recently we had Bills brought before this House to set up the new body Teagasc, which relates to the advisory and experimental side of the agricultural industry. That was major legislation.  However, I do not think that this legislation before us is in anyway, less important.  The marketing of our agricultural products is of paramount importance.  I do not wish to use clichés, but I would say that the greatest national scandal in this country over the years has been the inadequate way in which our agricultural products have been marketed, not just at home but primarily abroad.  The necessity to fund bodies such as CBF must take priority when we consider the agricultural industry and, for that matter, industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that only since the eighties have we attempted to get our act together in this most important sector.  One wonders what we were doing during the seventies and sixties when we knew that we were going to join the EC and did join it. Deputy Sherlock mentioned the problem of exporting jobs because of exporting so <Col N="643" /> many cattle on the hoof, live cattle.  He is a little out of date in that that practice has almost ceased completely.</P>

      <P>When we joined the EC, about 70 per cent of the beef that we produced here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>We exported a great deal between 1983 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that when we joined the EC in 1973 about 70 per cent of the beef that we produced here was exported live.  Now that figure is less than 10 per cent and rapidly diminishing, for which we are thankful.  We have overcome that particular problem which was a very major blot.  It was not just the export of cattle, but the export of jobs.  Now we have a highly sophisticated beef industry which is able to match the best in any part of the world.  The most sophisticated beef industry that one can find is here in Ireland.  While there are begrudgers who might object to monopolies or near monopolies, I can only admire, as can most fair minded people, the work which has been done by people like Mr. Larry Goodman and others in the processing industry.  They have brought Ireland to the forefront in this sector.  The days of exporting live cattle are now in the past.  Our beef is being exported to Europe in the ultimate form of processed beef, that is, vacuum packed.  We have had an outstanding degree of success in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a disturbing factor in our beef industry which was highlighted at a conference in Killarney this week by the Assistant Director General of the European Commission for Agriculture, Mr Peter Pooley, who pointed out that despite the decrease in cow numbers in the Community and in the beef herd, the amount of beef going into intervention was never greater.  At the end of April the amount of beef in intervention in the Community was 755,000 tonnes.  He made the point that it looks as if we will <Col N="644" /> have a million tonnes in intervention by the end of the year.  That is a particularly dangerous direction in which we are travelling. It could have dire consequences for our beef industry and farmers.  If the stocks of beef in intervention keep increasing at that rate, it means that the Commission will act to undermine the intervention system for beef.  They threatened that very strongly in recent times and we should take due cognisance of that threat.  It will have very serious consequences indeed for the price of cattle here if it comes about.  It is not to be under-estimated.</P>
    <P>The lunacy of advocating that we should use hormones with regard to the rearing of beef is beyond comprehension. We may not worry, as a race &mdash; although I am sure that many do &mdash; whether the cattle are treated with hormones or not, but those upon whom we depend to buy our beef, the people in continental Europe, the Germans in particular, are very concerned.  West Germany is our major market for continental Europe and it will not entertain beef which has been treated with hormones.  If we think that by injecting beef with hormones, thereby increasing the weight and reducing fat content, we are doing ourselves and our farmers a big favour, we are fooling ourselves. Of course we want to eliminate fat, but we will have to do so by conventional methods.  We cannot depend on artificial systems such as hormone injections.</P>
    <P>The German Minister for Agriculture told me three years ago, when this debate was in full swing in Europe: &ldquo;You farmers had better realise that the German consumer will not accept beef which has been treated with hormones&rdquo;.  Hence, what is the point in producing a massive amount of product if we cannot sell it?  That is really what it boils down to.  There is no point in our producing massive quantities of a product which is not saleable because it is not acceptable to the consumer.  The consumer decides whether your product is acceptable.  There is a real problem in regard to the massive amount of beef in intervention in Europe and we must ensure that we can sell all the beef we <Col N="645" /> produce on the open market.  The sooner we get away from depending on intervention, the beter.  That is why I cannot advocate the increase of the levy from £1 to £1.50 per head of cattle because it is absolutely essential to get the beef moving in the marketplace.  CBF are the vehicle by which we do it.  They have done an excellent job and it is a pity that they were not in existence 20 years ago. However, better late than never.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to certain individuals but I will do so in a complimentary manner so the Chair should not object.  The Department of Agriculture recently suffered a body-blow in the areas covered by the Bill.  We lost the Secretary of the Department, who is probably the most respected civil servant in the agricultural scene in Europe, Mr. Jimmy O'Mahoney, who has retired.  The person who was effectively in charge of the beef division, Gerry Hoey, who was also a member of the board of CBF, is taking up a new career in the private sector.  These are devastating blows to the structures in the Department, although I am confident that there are suitable replacements.  In the pig and poultry division, also covered by the Bill, the man who did so much to highlight Ireland's need for further structural aid in this regard, Liam Butler, has also left the Department to set up his own private consultancy.  The sectors we are discussing today have been affected because the key people, the &ldquo;hot shots&rdquo;, in the Department have left recently. They were regarded in Europe as being among the best and will be difficult to replace.  However, I hope the problems caused by their departure will be temporary.</P>
    <P>I do not see why there should be any objection to raising the levy for each head of cattle from £1 to £1.50.  It is a bit childish of the farming organisations, particularly the IFA, to object to these levies.  They seem to think it is incumbent on them to object to everything, good, bad or indifferent.  They should be more discerning, object to what is bad and applaud what is good.  While nobody wants to pay more, the money could not <Col N="646" /> be used in a better cause, because marketing is the Achille's heel not just of the beef industry but of the agricultural industry in general, indeed probably of industry generally here.  Anything we can do to improve marketing is to be applauded and welcomed.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, in the agreement of December 1986, after a meeting in Brussels which lasted for 60 hours &mdash; I see one is threatened in Luxembourg this weekend to last 72 hours &mdash; we got the beef premium, which is worth £15 per annum for each head of cattle.  Farmers were very blasé about that &mdash; they seemed to think they were entitled to it &mdash; but, when it comes to paying 50p extra on any animal slaughtered or exported, there is an outcry.  It is so childish and immature that it is hardly believable for people looking at us from outside.  It is incredible that we could be so narrow minded and short-sighted.  It is vital that CBF are properly funded.  The chairman, Denis Brosnan, and the chief executive, Paddy Moore, are outstanding and dedicated and there could not be a better pair at the helm.</P>
    <P>I have one serious objection to the structure of CBF, which was alluded to at considerable length by the Minister of State.  The board of CBF comprise nine members and the Bill proposes to increase that number to 11.  I would not recommend this board in their present form to anybody.  I made this comment in the discussion on the Bill setting up Teagasc and I will repeat it now.  It applies to CBF more than to any other board of which I am aware.  There should not be nominated to a board representatives from different sectors of the industry because it guarantees that you will end up with a bad board.  Increasing the number from nine to 11 is totally unacceptable. There should be no question of going to a farming organisation or a representative group in the agricultural industry and telling them to nominate a member who will be put on the board.  That is how the board of CBF are constructed; it is lunacy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be over-dramatic but much of the good work which this body <Col N="647" /> do is being seriously eroded by the makeup of the board.  The Minister should say that he wants a board of three, five or, at the very maximum, seven.  I would favour five and he should pick people who know the industry and who can represent it effectively.  They should see that the money is spent properly and that the promotion of the beef, sheepmeat and pigmeat industry is carried out effectively. They should be business people with a capacity for selling, people who know the marketplace, who understand what is happening abroad and who can speak at least one or two &mdash; preferably three or four &mdash; languages.  The present system is madness and I am surprised that more Members have not expressed their views on it here today.  When sectors of industry are asked to nominate somebody the old pals act comes into force and quite often you end up with a number of people who are over the hill.  It is a return for favours done in the past.  If someone is president of a farming or a meat industry organisation and if they have been assisted in getting to that high position somewhere along the line, there is a natural tendency to repay the person for the favours.  Quite often such a person is totally unsuited to act on a board of this nature.</P>
    <P>It is marvellous to see the income of CBF being increased from £1.9 million to £3 million and, with the addition of the pigmeat levy, to £3.4 million.  It is great to see that much money being made available but I contend the Minister should have gone the full way, seeing to it that there is a board in place which can spend that money to greatest effect.  We should not have to repeat that it is the largest and by far our most important industry.  It is the most lucrative, with everything being produced at home.  The computer and chemical industries can show massive export figures but it is not the same thing because much of the raw materials and basics in those industries are imported and the bulk of their profits exported.  It should be remembered that beef exports alone amount to over £1,000 million per annum and are growing rapidly. It is imperative that the people who <Col N="648" /> manage that industry should be the cream of our business executives.  I think I have made that point adequately and I hope it will be listened to.</P>
    <P>I contend that the provisions of this Bill will achieve a small amount only. Why not go the whole hog and do the thing properly?  Last year for example, we imported over 1,000 tonnes of bacon. That is not good enough.  We also import bacon from Sweden and Denmark, although Sweden is not a member of the EC.  In view of the new 75 per cent FEOGA grants system I hope the pigmeat industry will really take off.  It should be remembered that we have a tremendous advantage in this area in that our pigmeat is absolutely the best produced.  The Japanese recognise that fact.  It was another scandal that, up to last year, there was not one pigmeat plant here licensed to export to the United States, the largest market of all. I am glad to note that this new 75 per cent grant is being taken up by a number of individuals, co-operatives and business interests because there is a great future in it.  Perhaps Jack and the boys will bring home the bacon in large quantities next Saturday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that effective international marketing will be the key to Ireland's success not only in the immediate years ahead but certainly post-1992 and the establishment of the single European market.  Nearly all contributors have pointed to the fact that perhaps it has been our major difficulty to date.  We have the raw materials, the commodities, the capacity to add value but we have fallen down dramatically over the years in relation to our ability to get our produce on to supermarket shelves abroad, to have a strong identity in the minds of the international consumer, particularly the 320 million consumers who now form the European market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us &mdash; which I support without equivocation &mdash; mainly purports to help in relation to, and I quote the Minister &ldquo;the efficient promotion of pigmeat&rdquo;. It also allows the CBF to become <Col N="649" /> involved in the future in the area of deer and venison products and in various aspects of the promotion of poultry.</P>
    <P>At a recent management conference I was particularly struck by the contribution of one individual who asked us to turn our attention to the difference between generic marketing of Irish products and specific brand marketing of Irish products.  I think surveys have been undertaken abroad, particularly in Europe, as to what is the Irish identity in relation to certain aspects in this area. Really it is a tragedy that most people can identify brand names, such as Guinness, Kerrygold, Bailey's Irish Cream and Waterford Glass but that, thereafter, they dry up; they are among our leaders, producing products of which we are extremely proud.  When one looks to the agricultural sector &mdash; particularly to beef, pigmeat and sheepmeat &mdash; one finds a general assumption abroad that there is a ring of good quality about Irish bacon but there is no brand name for the marketing abroad of bacon, or beef.  I put it to the Minister that perhaps no other country produces the quality bacon, beef and sheepmeat that we do.</P>
    <P>To date the CBF have performed extremely effectively.  In relation to our range of semi-State and State companies they must be one of our more successful outfits.  For some reason attention has not been turned to date &mdash; although we are beginning to hear people talk in those terms now &mdash; to the fact that we need to market our beef under a brand name that hits the consumer between the eyes, that is synonymous with a quality product produced in an environmentally-pure and clean country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all part of the story. My greatest plea to the CBF at this point would be that they should turn their attention and efforts to this area.  No matter what work is done before or post the farmgate, unless we can concentrate resources, getting the different companies and producers together to market under a brand name, we will lose out <Col N="650" /> post-1992, as effectively we have lost out since 1972.  There appears to be an assumption that the agricultural sector, and Ireland generally, did well since our entry into the EC in 1972.  However, if one analyses it, one finds that is not the case at all.  The high agricultural prices and their general application through the Common Agricultural Policy have actually distorted our food industry in particular by pushing back growth in commodities. We know the story of butter mountains and sides of beef in intervention.  They have, if you like, distracted attention from the proper and aggressive marketing that is necessary in the open markets, in the United Kingdom, Europe generally and indeed further afield.</P>
      <P>We are also aware of the fact that the higher prices farmers received post-1972 actually fuelled farm debt.  Many farmers in my own county of Wexford and elsewhere are still reeling, trying to shoulder the difficulties they brought on themselves through expansion that perhaps was not carried out on the best of advice. With hindsight we can all criticise and point the finger.  It is a problem many farmers, particularly the more progressive ones, find themselves saddled with, those very farmers we will be expecting to help in terms of increasing the beef herd, for instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I was alluding to that when I said that perhaps the advice was questionable.  I accept fully what Deputy Higgins says, that the banks and financial institutions, indeed agricultural advisers generally, encouraged many of our better farmers to expand, to increase their land and engage in capital investment of one type or another.  It was badly needed but perhaps those operations were carried out a little in haste, that the debt-equity ratio of those operations was not examined as it should have been.  Indeed, there was a time in the seventies when farmers were being told they could finance debts. At one stage they were told they could incur debts of between £1,500 and £2,000 <Col N="651" /> per cow, that they practically get away with that.  One wonders where the wisdom for that sort of advice came from. However, that is history.  It is part of the mismanagement of the higher prices the agricultural community received from CAP post-1972.  Why I am pointing to that now is that we have to be sure that we manage what is before us, post-1992 and the single market, to far greater effect, learn from the mistakes of the post-1972 position and make sure that it does not happen again.  The Bill before us is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The efficient promotion of pigmeat will now be part of the terms of reference of CBF.  The pigmeat industry has had many very difficult years.  There is difficulty in terms of cost effectiveness on the production end, there is difficulty in the processing sector and there have been and still are difficulties at the marketing end of the entire equation.  Let us hope that CBF will get marketing up and running as quickly as possible.  I hope we will have a brand name for Irish bacon through which all Irish bacon will be exported and which can take its rightful place on the supermarket shelves of Ireland.  I hope also that is the way we will handle the future marketing of beef products and beef from the cattle industry.</P>
      <P>I would draw attention to the fact that one of the aspects of our entry to the EC that attracted me most and in theory still attracts me, even though I see little evidence of it working in practice, is the premise in the Treaty of Rome that we should concentrate production in the areas of greatest natural advantage.  If our grasslands are not among our greatest natural advantages or are not one of the greatest natural advantages of Europe, I do not know what is.  If we are not in a position to concentrate production on commodities based on our excellent clean grasslands, I do not know what Europe holds for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see our foreign and our farm Ministers when they sit at the Council of Ministers insisting that this premise is held to very strictly.  We will never be able to compete with the zero <Col N="652" /> grazing intensive farm management of our European neighbours.  They depend on imported soya and on other feedstuffs. They do not compare to Ireland at all. Where we will always have an advantage over nearly all of our European neighbours, in terms of the production of beef and other agricultural products, is in relation to climate, the soil and our environment. We have to get our act together in protecting our environment, not just for the sake of the quality of life of our people and the quality of life offered to tourists, but for our prime industry and its products, the agricultural industry.  This week again every newspaper carries further tragic evidence of difficulties in coping with the disposal of farm waste, industrial waste and human waste which puts pressure on the environment.  Particularly at this time of the year, when silage making is just beyond its peak, we have to help the farming community to protect the environment, particularly our inland waters, in the interests of society generally and in the interests of farmers and the products we want CBF to market abroad.  With the introduction of the super-levy some years ago and the implications that that has had for our national herd, the importance of attention to this area has not been lost; and, to be fair, it has not been lost on the present administration or on the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy.</P>
    <P>When one looks at export figures here and analyses the impact of agricultural exports on the overall figure, and if one further breaks that down in terms of beef and beef products, the enormous importance of maintaining the national herd cannot be underestimated.  With the slaughter of cows on many farms to try to comply with the various quota restrictions that have now been imposed, not sufficient attention has been given to the encouragement of the suckler beef herd. Quite frankly, it has not paid.  If we do not get our act together in that area we will not have the products to export and the work of the CBF will be totally wasted.  It is part of the overall equation of gearing our agricultural primary produce and exports for 1992 and being <Col N="653" /> in a position to avail of that internal single market, particularly in the area where we have greatest natural advantage in relation to production.</P>
    <P>There have been record levels in recent years of EC beef production generally but it is expected to decline post-1988. We are the largest net exporter in the Community of beef and beef products and the opportunity will be ours to increase our market share provided we have the raw material and provided we are producing the cattle and can meet the demand of the export markets.  If we do not do it and if the EC does not satisfy its own demands, we can be sure that outside countries, particularly South America and Australia, will be able to pick up the slack and fill a niche in the markets of Europe which rightfully should be ours.  That niche is ours if we support the premise that one concentrates production in areas of natural advantage, if we are prepared to organise and be in a position to take it up.  Nobody will wait for us to get in.  Nobody will come looking for us as a nation to get in. We will have to be vigorous and aggressive in marketing our products.  This is what we will be demanding of CBF in the future.  Indeed, to date they have done an excellent job and I am confident that they will be able to fill the demands we have to put on this organisation for all our sakes, given the importance of exports to our country.</P>
    <P>We give a lot of lip service from time to time to the national debt and to our huge unemployment figures.  Since we entered the EC in 1972 we have virtually the same number of people in employment in this sector.  Progress has not been made to the extent we expected in this area.  There will be no easier or better way of resolving the national debt and our general difficulties with employment than by exporting products we can produce better than anyone else in Europe at the moment.  By increasing our exports we will be resolving to a large extent the problems of financing the national debt.  Not enough attention has <Col N="654" /> been given to that aspect of the importance of our exports and the export market in resolving our financial problems.</P>

When considering other manufacturing export industries and the importance we attach to them and the great service the IDA do for those industries, particularly in attracting foreign industrialists into our country, we sometimes forget that more attention to this indigenous industry would reap far greater dividends due to the fact that we have the ideal soil, climate and environment for production and because we do not need imported raw material to prime the industry itself.</P>
      <P>In 1987 we witnessed a strong performance in this industry generally with prices having been maintained.  We have had growth in the value of our beef exports and further expansion in the sheepmeat sector.  I hope we have witnessed the first decline on the dependence of intervention.  In the last year or so we have seen pigmeat, kill lines and processing facilities up and running under the FEOGA 75 per cent grant aid.  It is appalling that, to date, despite the history of pig production in this country we have had no USDA licensed pigmeat plants.  I commend the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, for his attention in this area and, indeed, the present Administration for recognising the importance of rectifying this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, we must remind ourselves of the enormous responsibility that CBF will have to shoulder.  I have indicated that I attribute enormous importance, as does everyone in this House, to the value of our agricultural exports, particularly our beef, lamb and pigmeat.  We will have to reward quality production in this area. CBF will have to be able to market top quality products.  They will have to find our place on the supermarket shelves of <Col N="655" /> Europe and beyond and they will have to gather together the sheep producers, the beef producers and the bacon producers under brand names in their respective categories so that every consumer, and particularly every housewife in Europe, will be able to identify Irish bacon, beef and lamb under a single brand name in the future.  If we get our act together we will not see the same mistakes being made in 1992 and post 1992 as were made in relation to post 1972 when we entered the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I welcome this Bill to amend CBF's funding and to extend their role to cover the promotion of pigmeat, venison and poultry. I know the farming community and the farm bodies are in general agreement with the thrust of this Bill.  They realise full well that their future lies in premium prices in the market place and in further processing.  In looking at CBF we should not confuse their role with that of the role of actually selling.  CBF's role, as I understand it, is to promote and to market rather than to sell.  Their role is to make Irish meat, whether it is beef, pork, bacon, mutton or lamb, a premium product in the eye of the consumer in Europe.  They must bring before the European consumer the Irishness and the naturalness of the product and the fact that it is grass fed, processed in modern licensed plants and that it is hormone free.  In this very intensive competitive market we must make these points known, accepted and appreciated if we are to get the premium for our products which is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that within Europe alone, in the poultry trade, the Dutch pay three times more for free range chickens than they do for house reared chickens.  The demand for free range chickens is so great that they are sold out within a day of being supplied to the Dutch market from France.  It is a point worth considering.  It goes to show how the consumer in Europe is thinking in terms of the food which the housewife buys.  It is fair to say that the same claim <Col N="656" /> could be made about most of the meat which we are selling in Europe, particularly beef and sheep.  It is in this area of market perception of free range production, in properly controlled and fully licensed plants, that the future for us, in terms of return both for the industry and for the primary producer, must lie.</P>
    <P>The budget which will develop from the increased levies of about £4 million is still pitifully small for the job that has to be done and the competition which Irish products have to meet from multinationals from South America, Australia and the US which, to a certain extent, are selling into some of the markets and competing with us.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of brand naming. Brand naming is a very specific field and is one in which I would advise CBF to go into with great caution.  Our brand name should be Irish and what it entails.  The brand naming of particular products at present can cost up to £100 million in the food consumer market.  The success rate is about 10 per cent so one could be talking about spending £1,000 million in getting one successful product into the market place.  The way we are going about it, which requires more money, is the right way in that we have shortened the chain between the consumer and the producer by being able to sell directly to supermarket buyers, particularly within the lucrative European market.  The type of product which they require on a day-to-day basis is a chilled fresh product for which the processor will be paid within a specified time and he knows he has a market for the production he is undertaking. It helps his cash flow problem, his quality image and his marketing because he is now in contact with the person who is buying for the housewife.  The benefits from this type of arrangement can be enormous for Ireland and as the years go by they are getting better.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that about 70 per cent of the fresh produce consumed in West Germany is purchased by five groups and we are talking about a market of 76 million inhabitants.  We are no longer prepared to put our destiny in the hands of local agents but rather to <Col N="657" /> promote actively abroad what we stand for and that is the kernel to the type of success and the premium price which we need to get.  It is interesting to note &mdash; and I am not sure of the figure but I know that I am within bounds when I say &mdash; that since their inception the cumulative budget of CBF would not have been more than £40 million.  Since 1974 Bailey's Irish Cream has had a cumulative budget for promotion of £150 million for one single product.  It is that type of money that has given it the pre-eminence it has in European and world markets as a quality product from Ireland.</P>
    <P>That level of investment was required for the success which undoubtedly has been attained.  We trot out names like Waterford Glass, Guinness and so on who have traditions behind them but the cumulative promotion budgets involved in bringing them to this State were enormous. In the context of the budget we have had for meat marketing and promotion the success has been high.  In future if we are to get better returns in the market place for pigmeat, sheepmeat and beef, as with every other product sold in the international market today, a greater percentage of the realised price must be put into promotion and marketing. We have the money in place for the factories.  We talk about the 75 per cent grants which certainly have been an incentive to upgrading food processing plants and they were badly needed.  Many of them were far below international standards which we need in order to promote our natural products.</P>
    <P>With those factors in place, there is to some extent a shortage of raw materials. I will not go into this; it has been referred to by many and I do not want to make political capital out of it, but it must be redressed nationally.  One of the key factors after having spent a great deal of money in establishing a name and the supply is the continuity of that supply, not a seasonal job, not when it suits you to sell or when you are going to get a suckler grant.  You must be able to supply the product you have contracted to supply so that you gain the confidence of <Col N="658" /> the buyers and the consumers in other countries for your quality and supply.</P>
    <P>This year under the budget allocated to CBF about £0.25 million is being allowed for promotion and advertising in our most lucrative growing market which I believe is West Germany.  That is not a great deal of money.  Individual farmers this year will consider spending £0.25 million on acquiring a farm of land.  In the context of trying to make that farm of land pay at the end of the day at the premium price which the output from that land can make, £0.25 million is pitiful in trying to promote the produce of an entire nation where the exports, as has been pointed out by other speakers, have a content sourced within the country of at least 80 per cent and worth about five times more per £1,000, or whatever unit you want to take, than the products of multinational companies, who are located in this country and whom we welcome.  It is worth making the distinction that if you are going to get into the business it is not just about &ldquo;down on the farm&rdquo;, it is about &ldquo;on the supermarket shelf&rdquo; where the consumer is buying the product.  From that point of view future returns will have to reflect the higher costs that we will have to accept will be required for marketing.</P>
    <P>Between now and 1992, there will be harmonisation of taxes, and MCAs will have to be dismantled. &mdash; they are a positive disadvantage &mdash; and we will have to be very careful about devaluation of the green pound if we do not see a similar devaluation in other countries.  If we are to talk about the future of an industry whereby we are accepting that we must in time move into production which will have a processing content, which I accept is the Government's strategy and I concur fully with it, where the MCAs do not relate to these processed products we are at a tremendous disadvantage in exporting. As it stands today with most products within the package of EC products, we are at a 13 per cent disadvantage in ingredients in the processing of food products compared with our nearest neighbour, Britain, and that is not taking <Col N="659" /> account of all the utility costs and transport across the sea because we are an exporting country.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  In future we must pay far more attention to the fact that if our future lies in Europe it is not enough to be talking about it.  We must promote it actively if we are to put our products where the money is and where the premium price will give the return to the farmer for the raw material in the produce and to the processor who has invested his money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to the debate on this very interesting Bill, I speak on behalf of the small farmer who has been squeezed out of pig production completely by the policies of successive Ministers for Agriculture.  This was a very lucrative end of the small farmer's production. When he was trying to eke out a livelihood the bacon industry proved of considerable benefit to him.  It is amazing to think that within a span of 20 years pig production has completely vanished from the small farmyard and gone into major units.  What was the result?  A product not as good nor as tasty has evolved and it was to the detriment of agriculture that the small farmer was squeezed out of this very valuable industry.</P>
      <P>We are only skimming the surface as far as pig production is concerned.  Denmark, which is not as big as Ireland, produces 17 million pigs a year.  We in the Republic of Ireland produce the miserable figure of approximately three quarters of a million pigs.  This is the bottom of the barrel.  We should at least be able to produce the same number of pigs as the Danes produce.  Until such time as the Minister takes off the kid gloves and encourages pig production in an effort to put the industry back on a sound footing there is little hope that it will prosper.  Will the Minister explain why farmers have given up the ghost as far as pig production is concerned?  It is obvious that they were squeezed out of pig production by major combines and I do not think that was to the benefit of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> While a member of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture in the last 25 years I have seen a thriving pig industry being strangled by the bureaucracy of the Department.  The premium boar scheme, which was essential for the improvement of pig production, was discontinued, and that proved a setback to the farmers. Without foundation stock we will not have a viable agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister is taking steps to abolish county committees of agriculture, bodies that were responsible in no small measure for the improvements in the bacon and poultry industries. I watched with sadness in the last two decades as those industries declined. We are all aware of the vital role that the turkey cheque played in the household budget of farmers at Christmas time.  We can all recall the succulent turkeys that were produced on family farms but today we have mass produced turkeys displayed on supermarket shelves or in deep freezers and the one attractive feature about them is the price.  The quality is not the same.  The change has taken place because the turkey producing industry was stifled by red tape under successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>I was accustomed to purchasing high quality turkeys from farmers' wives at Christmas time and I can vouch for their high quality.  There was a great demand for them, but unfortunately we fell down on marketing arrangements.  I accuse the Department of Agriculture of not co-operating with the farming community in regard to the production of turkeys.  They strangled the industry.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the change in the system of turkey production has resulted in a greater demand for turkeys, but we are all aware that the mass produced product cannot match the quality of the free range bird.  Until the Minister, who is responsible for the bacon and poultry industries, realises that there is room for expansion and takes appropriate action, we will not make a break-through.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill, but they fall short of what is needed if we are to revitalise an industry that was so <Col N="661" /> important to our economy.  We should not cod ourselves into thinking that pig production is improving.  It is declining annually, mainly through a lack of finance and guidance from the Department. Small producers have gone out of business due to a lack of guidance.  We have lost a saleable tag on the international market, the free range tag.  Wives of farmers in Connemara, on the Mizen Head and Bear Island played an important role in the production of free range turkeys 20 years ago.  I cannot understand why they were penalised and why the Department have failed to give them assistance.  The huge drop in turkey production on farms was caused by a lack of finance and guidance from the Department. Successive Ministers have neglected the poultry and pig industries. They placed more emphasis on milk products and beef production.  Assistance was not given to a vital element of the agricultural industry, poultry and pig production, which should be playing an important role in our economy today.</P>
    <P>I can recall exiles in Britain requesting Irish produced turkeys at Christmas time, but today Irish housewives have to be content with imported turkeys.  It is hard to understand why we must import turkeys from Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  The Department are not tackling the problem and we need to put more emphasis on free-range products.</P>
    <P>We must make it attractive for the Irish farmer and his wife to get back into pig and poultry production.  It is no good to say that there are three or four major units in the country producing the same product.  They may be producing it but it lacks flavour and appeal to the housewife. That is why we in Ireland, free to a great extent from pollution and radioactive fall-out, can play a major role in bringing back that product.  It deserves more recognition from the Minister for Agriculture and Food and from the Department. Instead of abolishing committees of agriculture which we now seem to be happy about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;free range turkey, free range chicken or free range goose. We have no turkey cock station, gander station or boar station and yet we are bringing fancy Bills before the Dáil such as the Córas Beostoic agus Feola (Amendment) Bill.  Perhaps it has a great meaning but I would like to ask the Minister if the incentive is there to make sure that we get the industry back on its feet. It is futile for Members to be discussing today a Bill that has not a broader outline as far as poultry and pig products are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imports of bacon products into this country have been steadily increasing. You need only visit one of the supermarkets in Dublin and go to the bacon shelf to see Danish ham, Dutch ham and German ham and imported poultry products. If we are realistic and honest about advancing our agricultural products on the European market we should be exporting them to Germany, Holland and perhaps Denmark.  The Irish product, even though it may be far more superior, is not competitive in price with the imported product.  Perhaps Irish housewives can give the lead where the Department have fallen down.  I would appeal to them to purchase, from this day onwards, the Irish product where it is practicable to do so.  Make sure that the ham is not a synthetic product imported <Col N="663" /> from other countries.  Make sure it is produced on the farms of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a vast potential for bacon products in the USA and Japan.  Housewives in the great USA cannot get a decent rasher to put on their plates in the morning.  They are crying out for the superior Irish product to be put on the supermarket shelves in the USA.  The same applies in Japan.  The returned Irish emigrant or the Irish-American who comes home on holidays takes back a parcel of smoked rashers and bacon products. I have travelled in many parts of the USA and I have yet to find Irish bacon in the supermarkets there.  We are falling down in marketing as far as that product is concerned.</P>
    <P>My final words refer to venison.  This is a new facet to agricultural life.  If the Minister is serious about developing the industry he should start at the points of the industry we know something about, that is, bacon and poultry.  We should bring back the free range product to the shelves of the supermarkets and we should export our very valuable product to the great USA and Japan.  If we promote exports as far as possible in those two outlets we will be taking the first step in putting a major industry back into prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those who have made a very worthwhile contribution to the debate for the past three hours.  The positive attitude of Members of the House in their contributions clearly illustrates that they are very much in favour of what is being proposed in the Bill and denotes their satisfaction with the performance of CBF in their area of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the remarks of Members is that CBF will do a good job when they assume responsibility for the marketing of pigmeat.  Undoubtedly, this has been a problem area.  Structural difficulties have existed with pig production.  At primary production level the process of rationalisation that has taken place has got the <Col N="664" /> industry onto a firm footing.  The proposals that are in the pipeline for the very considerable investment in slaughtering and processing facilities &mdash; we envisage an investment package of £140 million in total &mdash; will put right that end of the industry.  The third most important element in getting the marketing strategy right will be provided for under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I will briefly comment on some of the matters which the Deputies have referred to.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the Exchequer contribution to CBF.  It is fair to say, and I am sure the Deputy will accept, that this is a budgetary matter for the Government in the context of the fixing of departmental Estimates.  I do not think it is relevant to the proposals contained in the Bill.  With regard to the continued State involvement in CBF, I consider that CBF have a very difficult task in reconciling often very different viewpoints.  I believe the present arrangements have worked very well.  All sectors involved in the industry agree that continued State involvement in CBF is essential.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-operation between CBF, CTT and other State organisations, this is already Government policy.  Considerable co-operation between them is already taking place and ways and means to achieve further co-operation are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons felt that the Government were not doing enough to get the national herd numbers up.  We have to be realistic.  The fall in beef cow numbers has been reversed.  Cow slaughterings over the last 18 months have shown a significant decline and the market for the foreseeable future is very promising. Recently, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced steps to increase cattle numbers when he decided to pay grants of £70 and £66 for the first time on beef cows in dairy herds under the 1988 disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe spoke of the need to ensure adequate supplies of raw material.  The Government are very conscious of this and the Minister set up the pig producer group to look at this and all other aspects of the pig industry.  I acknowledge that much has to be done at all levels of the pigmeat sector if target output is to be achieved and a profitable and stable industry secured.  The pig production group have identified the areas which need to be tackled if the pigmeat industry is to develop to its full potential and to achieve a real and lasting increase in export levels.  It is true that expansion will not take place in a vacuum, that the creation of confidence, added to the granting of incentives, will be required to draw forth the necessary response from producers.</P>
      <P>The State, through the IDA, is contributing very significant resources to the creation of a modern and efficient manufacturing sector.  State and FEOGA grants cover 75 per cent of the investment cost.  This is an exceptionally generous figure.  The Government will be requiring a return from their investment in terms of increased output, employment and exports.  We are therefore expecting those in receipt of grant aid to share the benefits with others involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be up to the slaughterers and processors to ensure that adequate pig numbers are available to take up the capacity which is being created.  One of the ways of doing this which has been <Col N="666" /> suggested by the pig production group is by paying a bonus for additional pig deliveries.  There are, of course, other possible systems and slaughterers and processors have been asked to prepare detailed development programmes which, among other things, address the question of encouraging increased pig numbers.</P>
    <P>Continued State support for individual processing plants will be dependent on their playing a full part in developing all aspects of the pigmeat industry.  The State has shown, and will continue to show, its commitment to the sector. Slaughterers and processors must be in the centre stage in encouraging the expansion of numbers and the improved practices which are necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government's commitment to the pig sector can be questioned. The development programme for the pigmeat sector unveiled last July envisages increased output of three million pigs per annum by the year 1992.  This increased output, amounting to 800,000 pigs, will have to be exported.  Marketing will be more important than ever and export promotion will have a key role to play in helping to find secure and profitable outlets for Irish pigmeat.</P>
    <P>As CBF have a record of considerable achievement in promoting Irish beef and lamb, it is only logical that the extensive expertise and facilities of CBF should now be made available to the pigmeat sector.  I have no doubt CBF will chalk up a record of achievement in pigmeat promotion equal to that already secured in the beef and lamb areas.</P>
    <P>If I might, I wish to refer to the USDA licensed plants, also referred to by Deputy Doyle.  There are two pigmeat plants, Galtee and Limerick Bacon, which have been USDA licensed since 1987.  With the new and modernised plants coming on stream later this year, we should increase the number of factories which can supply produce for the US market.  The Government will be doing all they can to have more plants of USDA licensed standard.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to brand marketing, particularly Deputy <Col N="667" /> Durkan and Deputy McCoy.  This is a very big question and I am not sure it is appropriate to the present proposal.  CBF will have their own expert view on this question and they will be aware of the huge amounts of money involved &mdash; Deputy McCoy touched on this point.  It is essential that we be aware of the limited resources available and it is for CBF themselves to decide how best to use available resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the need to ensure residue free products.  I fully agree with this point and I would like to take the opportunity to point out that my Department carry out a comprehensive residue testing programme not only for hormones but also for such substances as antibiotics, heavy metals and pesticides. I am pleased to say that the results of this testing give a very high degree of assurance that our meat products are free from harmful residues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard touched on the price of pig feed.  Undoubtedly, this has been a major inhibiting factor to the development of primary production in the pig sector.  The people who have looked at this have identified it as a problem area and hopefully will be recommending and taking the necessary steps to make changes. Irish pig feed costs have been very high and have placed us at a certain disadvantage in the import and export areas.  Strangely enough, the process of change has been relatively slow, despite the process or rationalisation which is taking place in the whole area of primary production.  When people realise its importance I am sure they will be making the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock referred to the high level of live cattle exports.  Live exports have been declining in recent years and in 1987 reached their lowest levels in modern times.  This is indicative of the increasing efficiency of our beef industry.</P>
    <P>The major remaining market for live exports is Northern Ireland.  With our land frontier with the North a continuing two-way trade is inevitable.  The direction of the trade is influenced by short term <Col N="668" /> considerations such as fluctuations in exchange rates and MCAs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard reflected on the importance of the pig industry as well as poultry production in Cavan-Monaghan. As always his contribution was constructive and worth while.</P>

    <P>I would like to draw the attention of Deputies to two points, however.  The first relates to the title and lay-out of the Votes.  Deputies will note that the Vote lay-out differs in many respects from that in the abridged Estimates volume published in October.  There are now four Votes instead of five Votes which we have become used to and the arrangement of the subheads within the Votes has also been changed.  This is the result of a decision which was taken in consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Finance and which was aimed at presenting a better overview of the education services in a format which matches as closely as possible the main programmes into which the services naturally fall.  The services formerly included in the Vote for special schools, from which many other services were transferred to the Vote for Health some years back, have now been incorporated in the Vote for first level education.  The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education has been retained and the former Votes for primary education, post-primary education and higher education have been replaced by Votes for first-level education, second-level and further education and third level and further education respectively. The distribution of the services within these Votes has also been rearranged. More precise details of the services which have been transferred to different Votes within the Education group are listed on an appendix which will be found on page 101 of the revised Estimates volume.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the actual provision.  The net voted provision in the five Education Votes shown in the abridged Estimates volume was £1,101.362 million.  The net voted provision now shown in the four revised Votes is £1,093.121 million.  Some considerable misunderstanding appears to have arisen when the revised Estimate volume was published and claims were <Col N="670" /> made at the time that the revised Estimates contained additional cuts.  This is not so.  The difference in the two amounts is readily explained.</P>
    <P>An estimating reduction of £5.5 million has been included in these revised Estimates &mdash; £3.5 million in the case of the salaries and allowances of secondary teachers, £1.5 million in the case of the pay element of grants to vocational education committees and £0.5 million in the case of higher education grants.  This is not a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and does not involve any reduction in the level of services.  It is merely an estimating revision reflecting the fact that the actual outturn for these services in 1987 was substantially less than that anticipated when the abridged Estimate volume was prepared.</P>
    <P>Because of changes in the operation of the Local Loans Fund, a provision of £9.064 million included in the abridged Estimates is no longer required and has not been included in the revised Estimates. Since 1983, capital for vocational school building has been provided directly from the Exchequer through the post-primary Vote and no new loans from the Local Loans Fund were drawn down. The servicing of existing loans continued to be a charge on the post-primary Vote, however.  As a result of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, these loans are being written off and no provision to service them is required for 1988.  This reduces the allocation required in the Vote for second level and further education by £9.064 million &mdash; £8.544 million in respect of VEC loans services from subhead F and £0.520 million in respect of loans raised by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the allocation of additional lottery funds, it was decided to transfer the provision for a number of services, amounting to £3.977 million from the Education Votes to the national lottery fund.  Consequently, this £3.977 million has been removed from the revised Estimates. This, of course, does not in any way affect the level of services provided but merely represents an alternative source of funding. The services concerned and the <Col N="671" /> amounts being provided in 1988 are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;The special provision for youth and sport activities hitherto included in the general provision for grants to vocational education committees &mdash; £1.7 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision for grants in respect of Institiúid Teangeolaíochta Éireann &mdash; £0.447 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision for publications in Irish, excluding salary and overhead costs &mdash; £0.453 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Grants to the Royal Irish Academy of Music &mdash; £0.635 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Grant-in-aid of cultural organisations &mdash; £0.042 million.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision for contributions to UNESCO and related scholarships and exchanges under cultural agreements previously included in the provision for international activities in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education &mdash; £0.700 million.</P>
    <P>Finally, as provided for in the budget, the allocation for the school transport service has been increased by £3.8 million and an additional £6.5 million has been included for primary and post-primary capital building work.</P>
    <P>The total gross provision in these four Votes is £1,176 million.  This includes appropriations-in-aid amounting to £82.7 million, giving a net Exchequer provision of £1,093 million.  In addition, a further £30.3 million is being provided from the proceeds of the national lottery.  Since 1982, funds have been provided for the education services from the employment and training levy through the Vote for Labour.  A total of £30 million is being provided in 1988 from the employment and training levy but it is being included in the Education Votes &mdash; £22.239 million in the Vote for second level and further education and £7.761 million in the Vote for third level and further education.</P>
    <P>The gross overall provision, including <Col N="672" /> the funding from the national lottery, therefore, will come to £1,206.3 million.</P>
    <P>It is customary to compare the Estimates in any year with the outturn for the previous year.  Normally this is useful and valid, but this method has its limitations. Capital expenditure by its nature does not have continuity and it is wrong to assume that a particular level of capital expenditure should be maintained year after year.  In addition, a true comparison, even in the case of current expenditure, requires that account be taken of any significant factors which distort the relationship between one year and another.  A number of such distorting factors are present this year.  The main ones are as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  A pay issue for national teachers, which normally would have been a charge on the 1988 account, had to be paid in 1987 due to the fact that January 1988 began with a bank holiday and a weekend.  This resulted in one extra payday in 1987 and one fewer in 1988 and an imbalance between the two years of some £37.5 million.</P>
    <P>(ii)  As already mentioned, Local Loans Fund loans will not have to be serviced in 1988, a process begun in 1983.  This saves £9.064 million.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Grants to Vocational Education Committees &mdash; subhead F. of the Vote for second level and further education &mdash; included a special non-recurring payment of £12.7 million in 1987 arising from ESF aid not received in 1986 and the Deputy opposite will know to what that refers.  This was approved in a Supplementary Estimate in 1987.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Rates of pay and pensions have been increased with effect from 1 January 1988.  Provision for this increase has not been included in individual Votes.  Instead, a global provision has been made in Vote 46.  The cost to the education services of pay increases not provided for in these Votes will be of the order of £24 million.</P>
    <P>When these factors are taken into <Col N="673" /> account, the overall 1988 allocation represents an increase of 2.5 per cent on the 1987 outturn of £1,258 million.</P>
    <P>The provision for capital expenditure in the Education group of Votes for 1988 is now £61.175 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the capital provision in the Education Votes, a further capital provision of £10.5 million has been provided from the proceeds of the national lottery for the further development of youth and sport projects.  The total capital provision, including the capital element of the national lottery funding, is £71.675 million.</P>
    <P>The total non-capital provision in the Estimates is £1,115 million.  When account is taken of national lottery funding, this rises to £1,135 million.  When the special factors mentioned earlier are taken into consideration, the overall provision this year when compared with 1987 shows an increase of 4.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>Staff constitute the main resources employed in education and not surprisingly, pay and pensions account for a total of £931 million.  This does not include the cost of increases in remuneration and pensions which will be met from Vote 46.  After adjustment for distorting factors, pay and pensions will cost 5.2 per cent more in 1988 than in 1987.</P>
    <P>A total of £186 million is being made available for non-pay expenditure in these Votes and a further £18 million from the national lottery.  The overall non-pay allocation thus comes to £204 million.  After adjustment this represents an increase of 2.5 per cent on the 1987 outturn even though it appears to represent a decrease of £16 million.</P>
    <P>Over 17 per cent of the total Exchequer spending continues to be devoted to education. The amount being provided for education in 1988 demonstrates once again the commitment of this Government to the best possible education service for our young people which can be made in the difficult circumstances in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I will now refer briefly to each of the individual Votes.  The net estimate for the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education is £50.2 million.  This provision <Col N="674" /> is required for salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education and for miscellaneous educational and cultural services.  A number of services hitherto included in this Vote have been transferred.  The provision for higher education grants and university scholarships, research grants and fellowships have been included in the Vote for third-level and further education.  The provision for grants for clerical assistance in national and secondary schools has been divided between the first-level and second level and further education Votes. Other services have been transferred to the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The provision for consultancy services is £250,000.  Portion of this has been allocated for the computerisation of the main process for the Examinations Branch.  At present work is proceeding as quickly as possible on the analysis and design and on the preparation of documentation necessary before issuing a request for proposals to the market later this year.  It is my intention to implement the computerisation of the examinations on a phased basis with the examination results being processed by computer from 1989. The services of consultants will also be used to carry out a data planning study. This study will provide the framework for ensuring that future computer systems in the Department are developed in a way that takes full count of overall requirements. I am very glad to be able to announce to the House today that the computerisation of the examination results is proceeding.</P>

      <P>One moment, Minister.  This debate is on education. One would expect that we would show our interest in and be looked upon as being worthy of the discussion and that we could carry it on in a civilised fashion. I would ask Deputy Hussey to please refrain from interruption.  Apart from everything else, in so doing you run the risk of inviting interruptions when you yourself are in possession presently.  The Minister, without interruption, please.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say I have no notion of going on my death bed.</P>
      <P>The net amount sought for the Votes for first level education is £405.5 million. When allowance is made for the extra pay issue in 1987, this provision actually represents an increase of approximately £5 million on the 1987 outturn of £437.8 million.</P>
      <P>The main difference between the new Vote for first-level education and the former Vote for primary education is that this Vote now includes, as subhead H, the services which formerly comprised the separate Vote for special schools and the provision for grants in respect of the primary teacher training colleges is now included in the Vote for third-level and further education.</P>
      <P>The gross pay and pensions of national teachers, included under subheads A and J, amount to £379 million or 93 per cent of the total net allocation for first level education.</P>
      <P>The net allocation sought for the Vote for second-level and further education is £422.862 million.  When account is taken of the distorting factors already mentioned, that is, the change affecting the Local Loans Fund which will result in £9.064 million less being required in 1988, the special payment of £12.7 million in 1987 and the provision for pay increases, this allocation represents a real increase on the 1987 outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difference between this Vote and the former Vote for post-primary education is that the provisions in respect of colleges administered by vocational education committees and of training colleges for teachers of home economics <Col N="676" /> have been transferred to the new Vote for third-level and further education.  The provision for related scholarships and grants to students which hitherto were included in the general grants to vocational education committees have also been transferred to that Vote.</P>
    <P>The gross pay and pensions allocation is £379.156 million and amounts to 82 per cent of the overall allocation for this Vote and 87 per cent of the non-capital allocation.</P>
    <P>The secondary teachers incremental salary grant will cost £204.82 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>Due to falling enrolment numbers in individual schools and changes in the arrangement for determining staffing levels in the past few years, a substantial number of secondary teachers, who hold permanent appointments, continue to be employed in schools over and above the numbers indicated by current staff quota arrangements.  There have been two significant developments in response to this.</P>
    <P>A redeployment scheme for lay teachers in secondary schools under Catholic management has been agreed on and will be in operation in the 1988-89 school year.  Discussions are currently taking place regarding a similar scheme in secondary schools under Protestant management.</P>
    <P>In addition, a voluntary redundancy scheme for secondary teachers will be implemented in 1988.  A total of 980 applications has been received and these are currently being processed.</P>
    <P>The provision for current costs of Vocational Education Committees and of community and comprehensive schools was made in the context of a number of cost-reducing measures decided on by the Government.  A pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 has been used in secondary schools since 1983 to determine staffing levels.  It was decided that this ratio should operate in all post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>Ex-quota posts for principals, and in special cases remedial, guidance and special resource teachers would continue to be additional to the basic staffing determined by this ratio.  Negotiations took <Col N="677" /> place under the aegis of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and settlement terms agreed by the executives of both the post-primary unions in relation to the implementation of revised staffing arrangements to be operational for the 1988-89 school year.  There will be more about that during Question Time.  In accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> my Department will be introducing measures to cater for the specific needs of disadvantaged pupils to ensure that they are not adversely affected by new staffing arrangements.</P>
    <P>As in the case of secondary schools, teachers with permanent wholetime posts continue to be employed in vocational schools and in community-comprehensive schools in excess of the numbers now warranted by pupil numbers. Schemes of voluntary redundancy in line with the general public service schemes are planned to be implemented in both sectors in 1988.</P>
    <P>The provision for post-primary schools assumes that all excess posts will be eliminated in 1988 through the operation of the various schemes of redeployment, voluntary redundancy, career breaks and job-sharing.</P>
    <P>The net amount sought for the Vote for third-level and further education is £214.44 million, a reduction of 1 per cent on the 1987 outturn.  This Vote differs substantially from the former Vote for Higher Education as it brings together the provision in respect of all courses in third-level institutions.</P>
    <P>Subheads A1 to A6 contain the various schemes of assistance to students attending courses in the general third-level area. Almost 17,000 students benefited from these schemes during the 1987-88 academic year.  The cost to the Exchequer in 1988 will be a massive £46 million.</P>
    <P>The statutory higher education grants scheme is the most important of these schemes and will cost £23.250 million in 1988.  Eligibility for grants under this scheme is determined by academic attainment and by means testing.  There has been considerable public unease about the operation of this scheme for some <Col N="678" /> time.  The perception is that the conditions of award allow people with substantial resources to receive grants while others with less resources but in different circumstances are refused.  The main problem lies in the exclusive use of income as defined for income tax purposes. This issue has been under examination for some time by a committee representing the Department of Education, the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare and the Environment and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. I have recently received a copy of their report and am at present considering their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to a number of issues which have been of particular concern and interest to me as Minister for Education.  Action of a very positive nature has taken place in relation to most of these issues and action is being planned for others.</P>
    <P>In introducing to this Dáil last June the Education Estimates for 1987, I mentioned that the principal educational objective which I hoped to achieve was the undertaking and completion of the review of the primary curriculum.  Since then much progress in this regard can be recorded.  The Primary School Curriculum Review Body, established in October 1987, have been given the task of undertaking a comprehensive review of the primary curriculum.  The review body are in the process of analysing the aims and objectives of the present curriculum and of assessing the degree to which these are being met.  They are also considering possible initiatives and innovations and examining possible evaluation/assessment structures.</P>
    <P>The review body have received a large number of submissions from individuals and organisations.  I expect to obtain an interim report later this year and a final report early in 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be fine.  I <Col N="679" /> have made reference on many occasions to the changing demographic trends which have great consequences for the education system.  In 1987 the population of our schools and colleges reached an all time high when some 975,000 were receiving full time education.  Due to falling birth rates, however, it is projected that over the next 12 years we will experience a drastic fall in school enrolments. Enrolments in primary schools will fall by some 100,000.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the Irish primary education system continues to serve the needs of pupils and parents I have initiated a major review and appraisal of the entire primary school system.</P>
      <P>Last autumn, when I reconstituted the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), I requested the council as a matter of urgency to complete an examination of the post-primary school curriculum.</P>
      <P>As a specific task I requested them to submit to me a unified junior cycle programme for all post-primary pupils as I had taken the formal decision to merge the group and intermediate certificate programmes into a new junior certificate programme.  I required that this programme be introduced into schools in September of 1989 and be examined for the first time in June of 1992.  I am indeed pleased to be able to say that these target dates will be met.</P>
      <P>It has been a constant source of concern to me that our involvement in Europe has not resulted in a greater number of students studying modern continental languages, other than French, at second and third level.  It is necessary now to place more emphasis in our schools on the need for diversification in this area &mdash; for both cultural and economic reasons.</P>

      <P>We will give the Deputy another minute, too.  Recently, at my request the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment organised a seminar to discuss this issue at which educational, commercial and industrial interests were represented.  At present, I am considering the report of the proceedings which contain a number of recommendations and plan to take a number of measures which will foster and promote the teaching of modern languages in our schools.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment also organised a seminar on technology and its implications for the school curriculum.  I am considering measures and strategies which could be implemented to incorporate more technology into junior cycle post-primary programmes.</P>
      <P>About 6,000 young people leave the education system every year without qualifications.  It is a matter for concern that only about 400 of these participate in the vocational preparation and training programme, the education system's main response to the social guarantee.  It is clear that the vast majority of these young people have limited prospects of securing stable employment and, indeed, that they are very vulnerable.  Accordingly, I have decided to make a joint proposal with the Minister for Labour for a special training initiative in their regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the difficult financial situation <Col N="681" /> which still faces our country, it has been more necessary than ever before to examine and review in detail the objectives of our educational system and the conflicting demands of its various sectors on limited resources, with a view to using them with optimum effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I have ensured by careful planning that, with the co-operation and support of the many committed persons in the education system, we can continue to maintain and even to improve the quality of the education programmes in our schools, colleges and third level institutes.</P>

      <P>The long preamble on what had happened to the different Votes and how the Department had changed the figures that appeared there could have been delivered in a letter which would have saved the House considerable time.  I was very glad to see that at last the Minister has understood that there must be computerisation in the certificate examinations.  The present Government cut out £500,000 from this programme when they came into office but have restored some of that money now.  It is very late in the day to be doing this, but I am glad that good sense has at last prevailed in that small area.  I am glad that the new junior certificate examination, which was designed and recommended by the Curriculum Examinations Board before the Minister came into office, will be introduced in 1992.  That is very important.  The schools will be very glad to hear that that is happening.  It is a pity that in the whole speech there was not one single original statement or suggestion, except a veiled threat to disturb in some way third level grants, with no indication of what might happen and no indication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This has been a year of the worst mismanagement in education in the history of this State.  The Estimates that the Minister has called out mask a picture of confusion and dismay.  Everybody in this House has spent a year going to mass meetings, looking at marches, trying to deal with distressed parents, anxious teachers, while the Government twisted and turned and changed decisions, announced threats and withdrew them.  The Taoiseach intervened; the Minister withdrew.  It has been an extraordinary attempt at bringing in an Education Estimate.  When that Estimate was announced on 13 October 1987, it followed a summer of rumours and scare-mongering, initiated, of course, by the Minister.  The Estimates were then brought out on 13 October.  They have been very much changed since then but the Minister has not told us how the various areas in which they have cut back have changed them.  She has completely ignored that and her speech was one of the most useless the House has ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, at the same time that there have been changes, hesitation, confrontation and debacles in the House &mdash; I particularly remember 24 November &mdash; climbdowns, U-turns and confusion, there has been a complete dead hand on any kind of reform or renewal, most spectacularly at the beginning of the year <Col N="684" /> by the abolition of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  That was one of the most retrograde steps the Government took and it was followed by many more. It set the pattern for the Government's fear of independent contribution to the kind of work that needs to be done in education.  I have been saddened to see all the reforms being set aside or turned back by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the decisions which lay behind the Estimates we are discussing today were made without any thought, consideration or the vaguest common good sense.  That is why so many of them have to be changed, either as a result of public agitation, mass marches, political motions in the Dáil, relentless pressing by parliamentary questions and debates and, of course, the disarray and dismay among Fianna Fáil backbenchers who were terribly embarrassed by the actions of the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a major decision to disimprove the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level.  The major decision to reduce vocational, community and comprehensive schools to a new pupil-teacher ratio has been dramatically changed.  The idea of keeping those new PTRs in <i>perpetuum</i> has been changed with a promise to return to the original PTRs in 1990.  There has been a restoration of the massive cut in school transport and the announcement that schools would lose their six year cycles was also changed.  Even at this point, in mid-June, schools have no idea of where they will stand in September.  Youngsters have gone on holidays without knowing what subjects will be available to them next year.  School principals are at their wits end as parents press them for information which they cannot give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legacy which Fianna Fáil left as a result of the school year 1987-88 is one of threats, disruption, confusion, marches, <Col N="685" /> mass meetings and general mismanagement. It is quite clear that no member of the Cabinet understands education and that the Minister, who is entrusted with the portfolio, has been either unwilling or unable to educate her colleagues in Government.  The pattern of blunder, second guessing and sheer contempt for education has been the most disgraceful of the actions in any ministry in the Government.  The confusion, unfortunately, continues to this day and, as I said, school principals are still unaware of what their position will be in September.  Teachers applying for the voluntary redundancy package have no idea if they will get it and schools do not know how many teachers they will have or what subjects they will be able to provide.  It is extraordinary that there should be such confusion in education.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been forced to change the worst elements of the 1988 Estimates. The Estimates are in tatters but we do not know the changes which all result from reversed decisions.  Not only are the 1988 Estimates in tatters, so is the reputation of the Government regarding education.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now embarking on her second summer in Marlborough Street and she will be discussing Estimates for the following year. Last summer the Government embarked on a series of decisions which were impossible to implement.  They were wrong in the first place but they refused to listen to people who told them so. Finally, after Dáil motions, marches and protests, they agreed to change their wrong decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister in her discussion of the next Estimates which, presumably, will be based on the Estimates for this year, should understand very clearly that education has taken enough punishment and urgently needs confidence restored.  She must immediately meet the management and principals of schools and establish the allocations for next year.  Let them <Col N="686" /> explain to parents and young people what they will be able to study next year.  Let them know what teachers they will have in their schools next year.  It is important that the Cabinet should not go into these Estimates discussions contemplating any other decisions which will further disimprove the quality of education.</P>
    <P>The Minister skated over the topic of language learning and there is no mention of new technology.  Two key words &mdash; imagination and urgency &mdash; are missing in the attitude of the Minister and the Government to those important areas. Question Time is coming up and we will be able to find out why the Minister does not seem to be a member of the 1992 committee which the Government set up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope so.  We have been waiting for a whole academic year for the establishment of two new technological universities, one in Limerick and the other in Glasnevin.  Their establishment was recommended by the report of an international task force set up by the previous Government and which was given to the Minister last autumn.  Why has there been no discussion or decision on this?  I call on the Minister to establish these universities.  Why do we not have a unified common central applications system for all third level colleges?  It should be in place for the 1989 leaving certificate candidates.  That has not been mentioned in the Minister's speech and I hope that this new idea of computerisation, even though it seems to be very half-hearted, will mean that all students will be able to fill up one single, common applications system form instead of going through the hoops as they do at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New legislation has been promised for a very long time to give new life and potential to the RTCs as industrial powerhouses in the areas in which they are located.  We have been promised the legislation since the Minister came to office and it was ready in the Department <Col N="687" /> when I left.  There is no action or urgency in regard to these areas.</P>
    <P>I am particularly disappointed that there has been no effort to eliminate sexism and sex stereotyping in education. The Minister will bear with me when I point out one single fact.  I choose my words with some care.  There has not been a male Minister for Education who has taken any initiatives in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I include all male Ministers for Education who did not take any initiatives in this area.  There is not the same interest in this area among the people who have been &mdash; or are likely to be &mdash; male Ministers for Education.  I should like the Minister to put that question higher on her agenda and I am sorry that the amount given for this area is so small.  I am also sorry that the primary and post-primary inspectorate, who spend their time talking to teachers, designing courses in schools and advising them have not, since the Minister came to office, had one single half hour's talk on the elimination of sexism or sex stereotyping. That was revealed to me in a parliamentary question yesterday and it is a sad feature of the Estimates.  I know the Minister deals with a very constrained budget but she must take an initiative in this area, where it is uniquely possible for her to do so, and where she will have my wholehearted co-operation and support and that of other spokespeople for education. I am asking the Minister to place it higher on her agenda, to do something strong and positive in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and her Department cannot pull themselves together this summer to undo the damage inflicted on education the system may never recover from this year of mistakes and confusion. We have a fine educational system.  It deserves better than the treatment it has received from this Government.  It is time we saw a completely different approach on the part of the Minister as she enters <Col N="688" /> the new Estimates debates with her Cabinet colleagues.</P>

      <P>It was resurrected in the course of the Minister's introductory remarks on this Estimate this afternoon. My first reaction is that, with the inclusion of moneys from the national lottery, those from the Department of Labour, the juggling about of figures from one subhead to another it is extremely difficult to make any kind of coherent response.  I find it extremely difficult to make any sense at all of what she has said.</P>
      <P>For example, the Minister has told us that an extra £5 million is being provided for primary education; undoubtedly that figure has been written into a book somewhere in her Department.  But, in the classroom, the reality is that this year there has been, and next year there will be, larger classes in every primary school. In the post-primary sector there will be larger classes and a narrower choice of subjects.  It is very difficult for the average person to respond to the contention that there is 2.5 per cent more money being put into education this year when, at every level, there is the apparent reduction of service to the consumer, the student, or parent.  I have enormous difficulty reconciling those varying facts and in making any coherent response.  In any event, in the time available to us, it is hardly possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be said that it is a sad and sorry time for education because of the cutbacks implemented over the past five years.  Since 1983 our educational system has been the victim of annual cutbacks. This has been the most difficult single year in education.  It has been a year of decision, indecision and revision of those decisions.  Never was there a time in the course of this school year when school principals and administrators were in a <Col N="689" /> position to plan coherently for a new school year.  They never knew with certainty what would be their teacher allocation or budget for a new school year. The least that could be done in a time of cutbacks is to inform, in time, principals, those who shape school programmes and timetables, of their reduced allocations, so that they could formulate some kind of school programme and plan to provide essential elements of education within those reduced budgets.  That has not been the case.  That practice should not be allowed to continue.  The salient feature of Irish education today is the level of anxiety built up in schools, homes and on our streets in the past year.  This anxiety hangs over our schools like a shroud. That cannot be conducive to proper planning for education in future years.  Nor is it conducive to a proper learning environment for young people whose futures are at stake, for whom so much is dependent on the kind of educational environment created at any given time, whether it be a time of recession or affluence.</P>
    <P>We must guarantee some degree of security for our schools, pupils and teachers. That necessitates informing school principals and administrators in advance of their allocations so that they can plan for the years ahead.  Deputy Hussey was quite right when she said that in September next there will be thousands of students returning to school who do not know, as of now, what subjects will be on offer.  Equally, thousands of young people have left school for the long summer holiday without having been given their books list &mdash; always given to pupils before they leave &mdash; to enable them buy their books so that, when they resume, they will be able to settle down immediately into learning and benefit from their school programmes.  I predict that in September next there will be long queues at the bookshops, students turning up in classrooms daily without their books and a delay in getting down to work.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that already we have the shortest school year in <Col N="690" /> Europe.  That school year will be considerably foreshortened because no real learning or study can commence until pupils have all their requisite books. Having had one disastrous and chaotic year in education it appears that the new school year commencing in September next will commence under equally chaotic conditions.  That should not be allowed to continue.  That is occasioned by the basic failure to plan properly in advance, to communicate proper and comprehensive information to the school authorities in good time.</P>
    <P>In order to be gracious about something, I should say I am very glad the Minister has at last decided to provide for the computerisation of examinations results.  I thank her for that.  It was long overdue.  It will make an enormous difference to students who have finished their second level education, who want to plan their place either in third level education or in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have noticed that we have been tied up constantly on issues relating to the financing of education with very little time, if any, being devoted to a discussion of any kind of philosophy of education.  That vacuum has left its mark on our educational system.  Whether we intend spending a great deal, or a reduced amount of money on education the single most important thing for all of us is to work out some kind of philosophy of education for future years.</P>
    <P>I would contend that the saddest feature of education today is the pressure being brought to bear on young people, especially those attending second level schools.  That pressure has never been worse than in recent weeks &mdash; and still obtains &mdash; with a number of students still struggling to complete their leaving certificate examination, many about to undertake their matriculation examination in order to achieve sufficient points for entry to third level education. This pressure is having a devastating effect on all education.  Any teacher, parent or outside observer will confirm that this type of pressure &mdash; brought about because of the demands of third <Col N="691" /> level education, because of the few places there are at that level in relation to the enormous and growing demands on those scarce places&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I responded to him, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  In any event, as I was saying, this pressure is taking a severe stranglehold on the whole second level system and is now beginning to reach down even to first level.  As the hectic battle for points grows in intensity, hundreds of students are, not alone compelled to spend long hours in intense study at school and after school, but thousands of students are now taking part in grinds and cramming sessions outside of school.  This cannot be good.  I would impress on the Minister and on everybody who is shaping our educational system that this growth of the grind industry is anti-social and it is inevitably having negative effects on the educational system.  I appeal to the Minister to apply all her energies to doing something to relieve second level education from the pressure being put upon it by the <Col N="693" /> demands of the third level entry requirements, and to do something to liberate second level schools and to enable them to design the kind of courses and programmes that will benefit all our children including the less academic among our children going to second level schools and that will enable second level schools to meet the legitimate requirements of students who do not want to go on to third level education but who have every right to get the most that can be got out of the educational system.  That cannot and is not being done.  The situation has got out of hand.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at this matter as one of extreme urgency.  This pressure is doing no good for anybody, even for those who succeed in getting places.  The intense competition among individual students means that we now have a system of education that breeds greed among the next generation.  We have a system where the highest number of points leads to the most highly paid profession and that has become the net ethic in education.  All emphasis on vocation and on aptitude is slowly being strangled and the inevitable result is that the only moral imperative we will soon have in our educational system is the race for results and points.  If that is the sort of education system we are offering to the next generation, I maintain that it is too dear at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another by-product of this emphasis is the inevitable neglect of students who have no interest in going on to third level education, students for whom we ought to develop some alternative courses.  I talk about students who have a less academic bent.  In this respect the ideal formula is in the VPTP programme.  I regret that there seems to be a movement afoot by the Minister to cut down on the number of students who will find places in those programmes.  The impression I get is that the intention is to take some of these programmes out of schools altogether and to give to people who are not within the educational system, who are in training courses, and whose qualifications are not always evident to me, a bigger and bigger role to play in designing and <Col N="694" /> providing VPTP courses.  If that is allowed to happen, it will be a backward step for a number of young people especially children who are educationally disadvantaged and children who have no real academic bent but who have the right to get a high standard of basic education in fields of literacy and numeracy.  That can only be given in schools.  That will not be given in any programme out of schools.  My fear is that if there is any cutting back in the £300 grant which was an essential part of the vocational preparation and training courses, inevitably the demand for these courses will drop off and the children will suffer.  As a matter of urgency the Minister should try to see her way to restoring that £300 grant to our students to enable more of them to benefit from the VPTP programmes.</P>

      <P>I have only one other point. An area that worries me deeply is the very small provision we have made in the Estimates of this year, last year and the previous year for in-service training for teachers.  We are being told that the Minister has great plans to introduce more learning of modern continental languages. The Minister has plans for the introduction of technology to schools and so on.  I cannot see how that is at all possible unless we have a sufficient number of teachers who are qualified in these subjects to bring these subjects to our students in the schools.  I see no evidence at all that there are sufficient numbers at the moment nor do I see any way to make that happen, unless the Minister is prepared to make adequate provision for in-service training for teachers to enable them to go away and become competent and proficient in these courses and then bring them back to the schools to enable principals of schools to make a timetable for these new subjects which are so relevant and so badly needed.  On top of what I have said about the VPTP programmes, will the Minister find her way next year to provide more money for <Col N="695" /> in-service training?  That is the key to providing new subjects.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt a single speaker in this debate so far, and I listened with more than extraordinary patience to the Minister's garbled, arid, barren, hopeless speech on education, with which I will deal in detail, in a moment.  I have time only to deal with a minor but fundamental omission from the Minister's speech.  Níor chuir sé iontas orm nár dúradh focal amháin i nGaeilge san ráiteas a chuir an tAire os comhair na Dála.  Chomh maith leis sin ní dhearnadh tagairt, fiú amháin, do cheist múineadh na Gaeilge, na coinníollacha taobh istigh de na scoileanna Gaelacha agus mar sin <Col N="696" /> de, agus tá mé lán-chinnte anois, nuair a thógtar é sin chomh maith leis an rud nach bhfuil díospóireacht faoi Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta againn, go bhfuil an Rialtas seo in aghaidh na Gaeilge, in aghaidh na nGaelscoileanna, in aghaidh mhuintir na tíre seo a bhfuil suim acu sa teanga, agus ní chuireann sé iontas orm ach an oiread nach bhfuil suim fiú amháin ag an Aire fós san Teach seo éisteacht leis an méid atá mé á rá.</P>
      <P>I have described this speech as not being confusing for me.  It is, in fact, something that would merit an accountancy footnote in a normal speech on the Estimates.  From my days of teaching commerce it is something on which a student of commerce would fail because of the kind of illiteracy that is contained in some pages.  Indeed, in one page there is a paragraph that speaks about estimating cuts and about changes in Votes which is totally incomprehensible.  It is almost a paragraph without a verb.  It states that an estimated reduction of £5.5 million has been included in these revised Estimates and it goes on to say, &ldquo;This is not a cut and does not involve any reduction in the level of services.  It is merely an estimating revision reflecting the fact that the actual out-turn for these services in 1987 was substantially less than anticipated when the abridged Estimate volume was prepared.&rdquo;  It is a meaningless, badly written, badly prepared, semi-literate, accountancy memo that might on a bad day for the Minister for Education merit the status of a footnote in a bad speech.</P>

      <P>The draft agreement was the result of prolonged discussions between the teachers' unions and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the one hand and Government Departments on the other.  It was accepted by all concerned that this was the best that could be achieved in implementation of the resolution of Dáil Éireann.  I wish to talk about that resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 9 March 1988.</P>
      <P>The implications of the decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio at second level were examined under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>These discussions resulted in the formulation of a draft agreement, a copy of which I am arranging to have placed in the Library of the Oireachtas.  I am sure the Deputies will agree that in offering such significant reductions in the number of teaching posts to be saved, the Government have more than honoured the spirit of the Dáil resolution towards ensuring that the burden of adjustment to the new pupil-teacher ratio does not fall on the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The draft agreement has been endorsed by one of the teacher unions involved but rejected by the other union. I have since met representatives of the latter union but they have reaffirmed their rejection of the draft agreement.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided, however, in the spirit of the negotiations under the auspices of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, to allocate teaching posts for the coming school year along the lines of the draft agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> While the discussions on foot of the Dáil resolution have come to an end, I shall be happy to consider any views which parents or teachers or management wish to put to me within the parameters of the draft agreement.  The discussions took place between the teachers' unions, ICTU and the Government Departments, which arrangement is allowed for under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>One of the questions which the Minister has taken is Priority Question No. 49 on which I have plenty of supplementaries to ask.  I have a supplementary question to ask on Question No. 1 in the name of Deputy O'Flaherty. In the draft agreement, of which I have a copy &mdash; it is rather late in the day to be putting it before the Oireachtas since it had been announced such a long time ago &mdash; it is stated that there will be a monitoring review group and that it will be representative of the Department of Education, school management, the TUI and the ASTI.  I should like to ask the Minister why the National Parents' Council was specifically excluded from that review committee when the parents' association representing vocational, community and comprehensive schools were generous enough to say that they would accept the draft agreement.  The Minister has, unfortunately, set back the movement of parents in this country. Why has she excluded them in the draft agreement and will she now include them in that review group?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer the allegation which was made that the production of the draft agreement was very late.  Quite obviously the unions had to vote and they did so last week.  The second question which the Deputy put to me asked why parents were excluded from the monitoring procedure.  The actual Dáil vote to which Deputy Hussey <Col N="700" /> produced the solution which won the vote was to refer the whole question to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Central Review Committee.  This was done and, therefore, we had to adhere to the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to the social partners who were partners to that programme.  That is set up.  The monitoring review committee was devised under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> under the Central Review Committee and, therefore, we live within that draft agreement.  As an addendum to that, I should like to say that I have already agreed to meet with the two bodies concerned, one is the overall umbrella group of the National Parents' Council at second level and the other is the Association of Parents of Students in Vocational, Community and Comprehensive Schools.  I have agreed &mdash; I do not have the precise date with me &mdash; to meet with those parent groups and to discuss with them the implications of the draft agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that school management are included in the famous review group from which parents are excluded, and school management are not part of the monitoring committee of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, why were parents excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have already met with parents on several occasions.  Following that draft programme I have instituted an immediate setting up of a meeting with the two parents' bodies concerned &mdash; the National Parents' Council at second level and the Association of Parents of Students in Vocational, Community and Comprehensive Schools.  I intend to discuss with them at considerable length the scope and nature of the draft agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to take any time from Deputy Hussey because I sympathise with her position.  Question No. 21 specifically asked the Minister what her proposals were in the wake of the rejection of the draft agreement which was on the table on the occasion of the talks under the aegis of the Central Review Committee.  I should like to ask her specifically why she insisted on offering the 400 odd posts in the form which she did when by making a different form of proposal she could have disposed of the posts across the vocational sector more generally?  Will she indicate now how she proposes to implement the redundancies arising from the change in the ratio?  What form of communication will she make in regard to compulsory redundancies?  Will she specify in which sector she is going to allocate the disadvantaged posts which I presume are part of the 400 posts of which she has been speaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as compulsory redundancy in the public sector.  The Deputy may have inadvertently used the word when he asked when I intend to implement the compulsory redundancies.  There are no such proposals in my Department or, I understand, in any Department or Government agency.  The second question was why we are agreeing to allocate those posts in specific ways.  That was on foot of the Dáil motion which won the vote on the night in question.  The ameliorations which would follow from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> discussions would be aimed at alleviating what would seem to be the adverse effect upon disadvantaged areas.  Two parameters were laid down there, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Dáil motion and in line with both of those the allocation of the 400 plus posts will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Dáil motion of 9 March did not mention disadvantaged areas but concentrated on the fact that the vocational sector in general dealt with disadvantaged students, there was no need <Col N="702" /> to interpret it in the way the Minister has just pointed out.  In view of the difficulty she has run into with the TUI, and I believe there is goodwill on the part of that union and on the part of the Minister, could she not look again at those 400 posts?  For example, there is <i>de facto</i> now a different PTR with the restoration of those posts.  I understand the PTR could be described as something like 18.2 to 1. Can the Minister tell the Dáil today that she will have another look at the allocation of those 400 posts so that she could come closer to the TUI's concern and we could have a peaceful beginning to the next school year instead of more difficulties ahead?  This will not cost one penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first put on record the goodwill which existed on the part of the teachers' union, the Government and the Government Departments involved in the talks.  An enormous amount of time and effort was given by all concerned and I thank all for their efforts.  Secondly, there is great goodwill between the TUI and myself, to allay whatever misapprehensions &mdash; I do not suppose they are fears &mdash; which may have arisen.  Following the very long meeting I had with the teachers' representatives last week I had a further long informal meeting with them at which various matters were discussed.  To go back to Deputy Hussey's question regarding the allocation of the 400 plus posts, I find this new development rather extraordinary on the part of the Deputy and other Deputies who may or may not raise it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We wished to target specifically the schools which would be at a disadvantage in a changed ratio.  Surely it cannot be but good that one would wish to do so.  The executive of the teachers' union and all concerned agreed with the layout of the draft agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They agreed with the <Col N="703" /> targeting of the posts which were to help the disadvantaged.  We left the TUI on whatever day we had the meeting on the clear understanding that they were going back to the full membership of their executive, where they would be having further discussions and then they would come back to us.  That is the situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat there is no change on this side of the House in the terms of reference of that Dáil motion. We are all clear on what we were talking about which was that the vocational sector in general deals with disadvantaged students on a non-selective basis.  I urge the Minister strongly to hold on to the special allocation within that 400 for the small rural schools who are going to have difficulties.  I ask her again if she will consider as a request from this House today looking again at the allocation of those posts because the teachers' union executive may have taken away that draft agreement but the teachers' union members have rejected it.  We need now a spirit of goodwill, co-operation and compromise and I am asking the Minister if she will bring that spirit back to her discussions.  May I have an answer to that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I ask the Minister how she proposes to inform those VECs of the posts that are to be reduced so that, for example, CEO's may know the position.  Out of the specified areas about 50 posts are left to go around all the other VECs.  What does the Minister propose and by what criteria is she going to inform the people involved?  Would she not agree that if she moved back from her rigid insistence on changing the ratio <Col N="704" /> she might get more agreement and some form of compromise proposal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is asking two questions, the first referring to voluntary redundancy.  If it refers to that, that is the subject of a separate question.  Secondly, the Deputy asked me to reconsider the allocation of the posts. I understand Deputy Hussey asked the same in an altered version.  As I said, the TUI executive went to discuss and debate with their greater executive and are to come back to the Department of Education again.</P>

      <P>I have a brief question to the Minister in relation to the dispute.  Is it true as I have heard at second hand that alternative proposals to reach settlement or at least agreement in the use of existing resources in a different way have been put to the Minister?  As I understand it, the basis for agreement exists but the Minister or the Department do not want to listen to alternative proposals which might be put forward within the existing resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the question. Deputy Hussey, and Deputy Higgins in a different way, spoke about this. It is not that we did not listen.  We listened for an inordinate length of time and it was all very productive with extreme goodwill on both sides.  The point of view was put across that in accordance with the provisions in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the executives of the unions <Col N="705" /> in line with their well known predisposition to serve the disadvantaged wish to see those posts given to schools which would labour under disadvantage when the altered PTR came in.  That was and remains our concern.  The TUI executive put forward the proposal that the same number of teachers would be evenly distributed all over the system, thereby effecting an altered downward PTR. That is the proposal referred to.</P>

      <P>A report has been prepared by my Department's curriculum unit based on a survey of mathematical attainment in sixth standard conducted in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> In general, the results show little change over the five year period since a similar survey was conducted in 1979. While there were some significant gains in relation to a number of the objectives, these were counterbalanced by reductions in regard to others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister said that the most recent report was issued in 1984. Is she aware of claims by a Dublin teacher, an acknowledged expert on the teaching of mathematics, that 25 per cent of students entering second level schools attain a &ldquo;no grade&rdquo; in mathematics?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the claim by that teacher that 33 per cent of students seeking places in secondary schools have attained a &ldquo;D&rdquo; grade, or below, in mathematics?  If that is so I should like to hear the Minister's response.  If the allegation is true it is very serious and needs to be investigated.  Has the Minister any plans to investigate that allegation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit I am not aware of the allegation or of the gentleman referred to.  However, if the Deputy says he is an expert in mathematics then he must be.  If I was to investigate every allegation made by teachers I would have a difficult time.  However, I share the Deputy's understandable anxiety about the alleged lacuna in mathematics attainments at primary level.  That is one of the issues that is being addressed by those reviewing the primary curriculum.  The report I referred to in my reply stated that when the 1979 and 1984 results were compared it was remarkable how closely the results mirrored each other for each objective.  It dealt with various concept developments, geometry, mathematics and metrics.  It stated that pupils can add, subtract and do long multiplication very <Col N="710" /> successfully but had difficulty with long division.  The publication of that report will heighten an awareness of the problems referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is foolish of her to ignore the statement I referred to, a copy of which I will pass on to her?  If there is any substance to the allegation, will the Minister accept that the matter is more urgent than she seems to realise?  If the allegation is not contradicted by the Minister it will be easy for parents to lose confidence in the primary school system and its capacity to teach mathematics sufficiently well.  In this era of computerisation, mathematics and physics are very important since they are the basic language of all computer programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to a survey (details supplied) which showed that Ireland came out bottom of the table in terms of attitude to equality of the sexes; if any special education programme or other measures aimed at countering this attitude are <Col N="711" /> planned; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey to which the Deputy refers found that, along with Germany and Luxembourg, public opinion in Ireland had a more stereotyped view of a woman's role.  The survey indicated that attitudes lag behind our legislation.  This will not be a surprise to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Changes in traditional attitudes are slow to come about.  The implementation of non-sexist policies in the education system is a crucial dimension of the change process.  The Government are, as the Deputy will be aware, already implementing such policies.</P>
      <P>The question of equal opportunities for girls and boys in education is seen as an extremely important one. Not only is it a question of ensuring basic human rights to young people but it is of crucial economic importance in terms of employment opportunities.  Accordingly, the Taoiseach has given special responsibility to this Department for the elimination of sexism and sex-stereotyping from the education system.</P>
      <P>A working group, representative of divisions within my Department, meets regularly to monitor progress and to co-ordinate activities within the Department relating to equal opportunities in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other activities which have been initiated in recent years include, <i>inter alia,</i> seminars for school authorities and teachers; application of the guidelines of the International Reading Association to the Department of Education examinations; revised arrangements whereby examiners of scripts can no longer identify the sex of a candidate by examination number; encouragement of principals and teachers to offer all optional subjects to boys and girls and, in particular, to offer and encourage girls to take up such subjects as physics, chemistry and technical subjects; encouragement of schools to share facilities; revised procedures for the selection and appointment of primary <Col N="712" /> teachers; encouragement of post primary school authorities to implement the Code of Practice of the Employment Equality Agency; review of guidance provisions; encouragement of day-time classes for women; convening of a European Community poster competition entitled &ldquo;Equal Opportunities for Girls and Boys in Education&rdquo;; and awarding of grants to mature women students at third-level.</P>
    <P>A sum of £30,000 has been allocated in 1988 towards specific projects in the equality area.  These are: (i) an action research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies; and (ii) pilot intervention projects in physics and in chemistry which were initiated in 1985 continue to operate.  While the project commenced in one region in 1985 a total of ten regions will be involved with effect from September 1988.</P>
    <P>The Government have already acted and will continue to act in the areas of legislation which provide for equal access to employment, of equal treatment in social welfare, of positive action in training and of equal opportunity practice as an employer.</P>

I would also draw to her attention that there is a worrying aspect to the report referred to in the survey &mdash; that while it showed that 36 per cent of men had no confidence in women as bus drivers, 50 per cent of women had no confidence in women as bus drivers.</P>

      <P>I do not know if we will go into that matter.  We have just dealt with that question.  The point raised by the Deputy is one of the huge difficulties which we face.  The whole area is fraught with assumptions which cannot be relied upon because they change and because perceptions change.  We cannot lay down rules and say that because we have introduced a woman on a VEC interview board it means that women would get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Even though one makes the effort in the hope that that will be the start of a spiral-out movement which will encourage more and more women, there are many areas of doubt and of further investigation to be found. I am of the opinion that the more women who get into public life and political parties at all levels &mdash; I do not mean just at cumann secretary or group secretary level &mdash; the more women who put themselves forward for local, general and European elections, the more chances there will be for that practice to spread within the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also asked me a question on monitoring.  There is within my Department, a special review committee for equality and equal opportunities. They meet regularly and monitor the efficiency and operations of the programmes that I outlined which are within my own Department.  I constantly find that those meetings end up in the kind of discussion such as we have had today. The whole question is huge.  All we can do is keep trying everything we can to <Col N="714" /> increase the participation of women in all areas of life.</P>

In view of the fact that not one seminar, talk, discussion or lecture has been held for the primary or post-primary inspectorate on this whole question of sexism or sex stereotyping since she came into office, what are the review group that she talked about doing and when are they going to start talking to the inspectorate who are the main people involved in this work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I consider inspectors to be most important people, I consider that the person in the classroom is the person in direct contact with the young girl and young boy.  That teacher, female or male, is the role model on whom the young child sees expressed daily, for five, six or seven hours, ideas, habits and methods of behaviour.  I am very glad to say that at my expressed wish no in-service course will be held which does not contain a module aimed at eliminating sexism.  I very graciously commend Deputy Hussey for the measures she took with regard to that matter and I have no hang-ups about it.  Why should I?  I am very pleased that she did so.</P>

      <P>The voluntary redundancy schemes for teachers in primary, secondary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools will apply only to the extent that the number of teaching posts in excess of quota/normal allocation in 1988-89 cannot be eliminated by other means such as natural wastage, redeployment, career breaks.  In the post-primary sector, voluntary redundancy can be allowed only on the basis that the teacher concerned will be replaced through a redeployment arrangement if the school or VEC is within quota/normal allocation, and will not be replaced if the school or VEC is above quota/normal allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding which teachers are to be offered the redundancy terms my <Col N="718" /> Department will have regard primarily to age considerations in the selection of national teachers, taking account of the numbers available for redeployment within each panel area.  For the other categories of teachers, my Department are taking account of the educational needs of the school, based on the recommendation of the school management, the circumstances of particular teachers and the overall cost.</P>
    <P>All the relevant circumstances will be taken into consideration before definitive offers of redundancy are made.  In view of the numbers involved it would not be practicable to institute an appeals mechanism for teachers who are not offered voluntary redundancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My Question No. 47 &mdash; I have no objection to the Minister communicating this to the Library later &mdash; requires a quantified answer.  It specifically asked the number of redundancies which would be offered in each sector and asked her to break this down in a very specific way.  I am happy if she does not want to give this information this afternoon, but I want this information supplied.  My question sought it.  My question concluded by asking if any consultation with the parents' councils, boards of management or others had preceded the establishment of the criteria by which she proposes to offer redundancies to those approved by her Department.  I would like her to answer the question as I put it down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said quite clearly, no definitive offers of redundancy have yet been made to any sector.  Therefore, I cannot tell the Deputy what I have not already offered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, when it comes to hand.  The Deputy asked if I or my Department had consultations with the parents' council about those to whom voluntary redundancy would be offered. I do not think it would be appropriate for <Col N="719" /> me to reply to that.  Thirdly, I said the view of the VEC and the school management in the post-primary sector would be sought in the normal quota allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the primary sector where there has been agreement between the union members and the Minister.  In the case of a small rural school &mdash; for example one in the constituency of the Minister of State and myself &mdash; a wall would have to be knocked down to restore the school to a one-teacher operation.  Is it not appropriate to listen to the board of management as to the implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the thrust of my question.  Since the Minister has not made a definitive decision yet, she obviously cannot make definitive offers.  I want the Minister's lack of definitiveness to cease before we go into the summer recess so that parents, boards of management and the schools will know where they will be in the autumn.  Will the Minister give that guarantee, before we go into the summer recess, and indicate the precise information my question sought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to which school the Deputy refers but we will make this a general question.  The Deputy asked if the recommendations of a board of management would be conveyed to the Department.  The Department have always been open to receiving recommendations and representations of such a nature.  The Deputy asked if I could give a guarantee.  I do not like giving guarantees because, dealing with the post-primary sector, the protracted talks on the proposals under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> only concluded last week and culminated in a vote.  We will endeavour to ensure that primary and post-primary educational management boards and committees <Col N="720" /> know their allocations as soon as possible, and that means those receiving voluntary redundancies will want to know also.  We are speeding up that process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the questions in this group are in the name of my colleague Deputy Seán Barrett.  Could the Minister be more specific about when she intends to make the first round of offers to the primary and post-primary teachers who have applied for voluntary redundancy? Will it be this week or next week? Secondly, could she clarify if there will be an appeal by teacher or school if an offer of voluntary redundancy is made. Thirdly, could she tell us the different steps that will be taken?  An offer will be made, but will there be an appeal?  What will happen if the teacher who put in for voluntary redundancy indicates he does not want it?  Will the Department offer that redundancy to someone else in order to reach their numbers?  These specific questions are worrying people who need to know the answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole operation is complex but the original principle I set down is the one that will decide the overall framework.  No teacher can or will be offered a voluntary redundancy should it result in the teacher pupil allocation being disrupted.  That will be the guiding principle.  The Deputy asked if the offer will be made this week or next week.  The primary sector will be dealt with first because the vote was taken back on 21 May and we hope to be in a position quite soon to offer voluntary redundancies in the primary sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would anticipate next week, but I would add this rider: it may take longer.  I do not want somebody standing up in this House next week and saying I gave a guarantee.  I am not giving a guarantee.  I say I anticipate the offers will be made next week.  As regards the teachers who have applied for voluntary redundancy and then decided they do not <Col N="721" /> wish to take it up, quite an amount has been done in that regard.  Many teachers have contacted the Department, some saying they are very interested and others saying they are not interested compared to the number we will be able to allocate. If we allocate a redundancy to a teacher who later decides he or she does not want it &mdash; as is their right &mdash; we will proceed to the next applicant and we will fill the quota.</P>

It is a disgusting sight for any public representative to see.  Poor ventilation is a problem which is always associated with pre-fabricated buildings.  It is a shame that we should ask young people and teachers to work in such conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points in this were answered in reply to a question by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>I am in close liaison with the working group which monitors progress and co-ordinates activities within my Department relating to equality of educational opportunity.  In 1988 there are two main activities with a budget of £30,000 in this area.  These are: an action research project designed to stimulate the interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies &mdash; this project is 50 per cent sponsored by the EC; and pilot intervention projects in physics and in chemistry which were initiated in 1985 continue to operate.  These projects are designed to encourage more girls in the senior cycle to study these subjects. While they involved one region in 1985 it is expected that ten regions will be involved with effect from September next.</P>
      <P>As indicated in <i>Women of Europe</i>, February-March 1988, p.23, all Departments will have to provide six-monthly reports to the Office of the Minister of State in the Taoiseach's Department. The first report is due in July 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for her reply and to assure her of my goodwill in her efforts in this area. I raise all these questions at this time because I am aware that the Estimates discussions are beginning and I would ask the Minister to make a very strong effort to increase that budget in 1989.  Arising from the answer I would like to ask some supplementary questions.  Has the action <Col N="730" /> research programme which is mentioned by the Minister begun already or is to begin in September 1988?  I see that the pilot programmes are to begin from September 1988.  Has the action research project begun, and how many people does it involve?</P>

      <P>The action research project designed to stimulate interest and encourage the participation of girls in school activities related to the new technologies involves four schools representing the main kinds of second level schools, voluntary secondary, vocaional, community and comprehensive, and the project is 50 per cent sponsored by the EC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning for it has begun.  I do not have information in regard to the numbers here but I will let the Deputy have it.  It is planned that the action research project will develop similarly to the way physics and chemistry have expanded and developed.  This is the path we also propose to follow in regard to the intervention for languages and the intervention for technology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand then that both of those projects have not yet begun. I asked about the steps taken in 1988, so we are talking about steps that have not yet been taken in regard to the report that is to be published or to be given as a result of the decision, presumably by the Taoiseach, to instruct Ministers to give a six-monthly report on the elimination of discrimination against women in their Departments.  In the publication which I quoted from, <i>Women of Europe</i>, it is certainly implied that those reports would be made public and that the public would be aware of what steps had been taken.  Will the Minister be making her six-monthly report public or will it be a secret report?  If it is not to be a public report will the Minister take steps to have this included in the next <i>Women of Europe</i> publication?</P>

      <P>I am not very much into secret reports.  The communication which we have received from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked us to make the six-monthly report.  I thought it was a very welcome development which shows the Government's commitment to the role of equality.  This was not done by previous Governments.  It is five months since the announcement and we will be compiling our report and issuing it as was wished to the Minister of State.  What will then happen is a matter for further debate but I will certainly speak with the Minister of State on the matter to see in what format she intends to have them published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister could she tell the House whether it would be her wish and her view that such reports, which are of course extremely valuable and a very good initiative, should be published.  I am sorry that I had to find it out in <i>Women of Europe</i>.  I am sure it must have been announced somewhere but I discovered it by accident reading this publication.  I believe it would be a good idea to make these reports public.  If the Minister believes that also, will she urge the Taoiseach to make sure that those reports are published next month or whenever they are available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>My personal view is that it would be a good idea because it would show the commitment and drive which the Government have to the promotion of equality.  I will certainly undertake to apeak to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and to the Taoiseach because I think the publication of such reports would show that we mean business in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is commendably brief.  Unfortunately it has bad news in it.  The fact that the Minister for Education is not a member of a core group dealing with the preparation for 1992 seems to me to be an extraordinary omission.  I would like to ask the Minister how she feels she can make a full input into one of the most important areas in Europe which is the question of our initiatives on modern language teaching without being a member of that core group considering, for example, that her own constituency colleague, Deputy Albert Reynolds, made a speech recently in which he condemned the state of language learning in this country.  I would like to ask the Minister what Ministers are in the core group and if at this stage she will now request the Taoiseach to insist that the Department of Education is made a member of this group in view of the crucial and central importance of the language area to our success in dealing with 1992.</P>

      <P>No.  The number of students who will take up other languages in September will have increased and from then on there will be a considerable increase.  When I was in Europe recently at the Council of Ministers I made a very strong intervention, both written and spoken, on the need for diversification in foreign languages.  The following week, Commissioner Marin was in Ireland and met with three Ministers, Deputy Ahern, Deputy O'Hanlon and myself.  My officials and I had a two hour meeting with him and separately with his officials in the afternoon on education matters and, in particular, on the matter of diversification in foreign languages.  That same night I was among a small number who met him for dinner and for later discussions on the same point.</P>
      <P>Europe is at present considering as part of its agenda the proposals which I put forward at that meeting in Brussels in May.  I am very pleased to be one of the Ministers specifically named by the Taoiseach in the Government decision, to be brought into the committee's deliberations when matters pertaining to education are being discussed.  Indeed, within my Department we are already taking steps to see that we will be taking the lead in the need for diversification. I thoroughly commend my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and discussed with him a speech that he was to make on foreign languages and on the need for diversification.  I told him that for too long that subject had not been addressed here.  It is a great pity that there is now this brouhaha in 1988, when we should have been in a similar state three or four years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very provocative, indeed.  When I came into office I had to undertake a complete change in all the curricula of languages which had not been touched by the former Government. Each one had to be brought into the 20th century.  Oral and aural examinations had to be introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This had been totally ignored by the previous Government. When the Minister has time to stop being provocative, would she agree that language learning and the leap forward needed to be taken in this country cannot be carried out exclusively in the classroom, that it must be carried out in very many other ways?  Will the Minister be applying specifically, through the Government, for increased regional and structural funds for setting up specialist language centres in the different regions of Ireland outside the schools, in order to give a special impetus to language learning?  These specialist language centres have been suggested by many more people than myself, although they did appear in the Fine Gael document, <i>Language Learning and Teaching,</i> which we brought out recently.  What specific initiative in terms of specialist language centres funded by the regional and structural funds will the Minister be undertaking in this year of 1988?</P>

      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second supplementary on specialist language centres, that will be forming part of the submission which we will be making in November to the European Commission and to the European Ministers.  There are very many strands to this, but the overriding thing is that we need these.  First, there will be provision at second level.  There has been much talk and many submissions have been received with regard to the provision of <Col N="735" /> French in the leaving certificate classes in primary schools but that is another matter altogether.  There is the business element and RTCs in general are very advanced here in providing commercial and business German, Spanish and Italian in some of these colleges.  There is the need for language centres which would allow business people to partake of commercial and business Spanish, German and Italian education.  These are the various initiatives which we are at present preparing within the Department. I shall be taking specific steps in September which I have outlined and from then on we shall be rolling ahead with all our plans for language diversification.</P>
      <P>I told Commissioner Marin when he visited us that not alone were we pushing this matter &mdash; the day of his visit was the day the Fine Gael document came out &mdash; but that there was unanimity among all parties across the Parliament in approval of whatever measures could be introduced by Ireland, or whatever resources could be obtained by Ireland towards language diversification.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before Question Time I was addressing the general nature of the Minister's speech, saying that its methodology was far less than one would have hoped for from a Minister for Education. I have no need to repeat myself, except to say, as summarised for me, that I have seen matters that did not need 17 pages put more succinctly in the footnote to a table in my day.  I also referred &mdash; and I repeat it now again in English &mdash; to the fact that there is not a single word of Irish in the speech and not a single reference to the teaching of Irish, or to the Irish language.  This does not surprise me, although it does give me great disappointment.</P>
      <P>I now want to turn to what we can glean from this extraordinary excursion into internal departmental accounting confusion which has been presented as a ministerial speech.  Will the Minister or the Minister of State, whoever will reply, explain exactly what are the implications of the following:</P>
      <P>The total gross provision in these four Votes is £1,176 million. This includes appropriation-in-aid amounting to £82.7 million, giving a net Exchequer provision of £1,093 million.  In addition, a further £30.3 million is being provided from the proceeds of the national lottery.  Since 1982, funds have been provided for the education services from the employment and training levy through the Vote for Labour.  A total of £30 million is being provided in 1988 from the employment and training levy but it is being included in the Education votes &mdash; £22.239 million in the vote for second level and further education and £7.761 million in the vote for third level and further education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will the above fit in with previous expenditure and so forth?  I do not mean <Col N="780" /> to fall into the trap set by those who wrote the Minister's speech, which is to enter into accepting the invitation to wrestle with a ghost about the way the figures have been done.  I shall make this comment on the matter.  I referred to one speech which is already meaningless, but I must say that from an accountancy perspective the Minister cannot be claiming, in her revision of the 1988 Votes, benefits that will hide the effects of cuts and at the same time want to have claimed them in 1987.  I invite commerce students all over the country, preparing for next year, to take the 1987 Estimate speech and compare it with the 1988 Estimate speech.  They will find, like the commerce paper recently, that the figures do not balance.</P>
    <P>This has been an extraordinary year in Irish education.  I have only so many minutes and want to use them as wisely as I can.  I would just contrast two papers that I have before me, the Minister's speech delivered today and the speech of Professor John Coolahan which has given at the INTO Conference in Bundoran on 27 November 1987 titled <i>In the Shadow of the Guillotine &mdash; the Development of Irish Education</i>.  The paper by Professor Coolahan, Professor of Education in Maynooth College, has been printed and is available, I presume, from the INTO, with whom the Minister has a better relationship perhaps than she has with others.  Professor Coolahan drew our attention&mdash;those of us interested in education&mdash;to the difference between quantitative and qualitative provisions in education.  He spoke of Irish education being a kind of skeletal service in relation to many crucial aspects of education.  He asked if we were at a crossroads, would the demographic trends not provide us with a wonderful opportunity of doing those things in which we had been lacking in the past.  There are many such things. For example, comparing the amount of money spent per pupil in certain kinds of activities, we are near the bottom of the league by comparison with Europe in some specific activities.  Could we not now hope to address these issues?  In other words, could we not allow the new <Col N="781" /> conditions to enable teachers to teach better, to allow pupils to have a better experience in the classroom, to allow greater participation and a better kind of curriculum?  Instead of that, in a totally suppliant attitude towards this appalling brand of ignorance coming from the new Right by which you attack the poor in the name of making, sustaining and reproducing the riches of the rich, there is a decision to abandon all the educational arguments.</P>
    <P>Lest I should not be here again, I should like to list the educational principles which have not been addressed by the Minister for Education.  There is not a word in her speech about access to education.  If you comb through this strange document, you will not find anything as to whether access to education by different socio-economic groups will be made more easy.  You can take that at all levels in terms of, for example, the motivation of better learning at primary level, at second level, where there is the question of the transport system and in the vocational, comprehensive and community sector where there is the question of materials.  At third level there have been increases in student fees which are three and four times the rate of inflation. The capital programme in relation to third level has been abandoned.  Standing over all this, like a great figure with a sickle, are the Minister's proposals for pupil-teacher ratio change.  Her proposals in that regard in Circular 20/87 brought out people, who never thought they would have to do so in the eighties, to defend class sizes at primary level.</P>
    <P>At second level, there are proposals to demolish over 700 posts in the vocational sector which will in reality amount to far more; 200 teachers are to be taken from community and comprehensive schools with a destruction, in turn, of subjects. There has been a forcing of classes into rooms which were not built to accommodate them and there is an imperilment of the extension in the vocational schools of education to groups in the wider community. People are even wondering if the schools will be adequately heated and they write to me about the absence of <Col N="782" /> materials and so on.  In the new conditions, there has been no defence of education and the public have been forced to defend it.  As I announced before Question Time, the Labour Party oppose this Estimate for more or less the same reasons as they opposed them last year.  We object to the cuts in education because of their general and specific effect.  Let me list these neglected issues.</P>
    <P>Would one not expect from a Minister for Education the word &ldquo;access&rdquo; even once in her speech instead of a long mumbo-jumbo about shifting money from one vote to another like a bad apprentice for the three card trick?  The neglect of access means that we are moving back from an adequately funded public education system and drifting inexorably to a privately purchased narrow educational system.  We are being pushed more and more into the question of provision.</P>
    <P>Did any part of the Minister's speech deal with conditions?  Did she have the courage to justify the pupil-teacher ratio at any level or sector?  No.  Was there any reference to buildings?  Was there even regret expressed about the abandonment of the capital programme?  Was there an expression of regret about the shortages being experienced?  Was there even the jaded bit of wry optimism thrown in now in Government speeches that there would be a better day for somebody, somewhere? Was there a reference to emigration? It is now acknowledged that 30,000 people will emigrate every year up to 1992 and that 25,000 people will emigrate annually from then to the year 2,000.  They will not only leave the country that has failed to make any provision for them in terms of employment, but will be forced to leave because the educational system has been cut back.  They will go away, like the Minister's problems, and she will be left skittishly repeating her figures to herself.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech left me in a state of anger.  There was a reference to the curriculum but if education is not about quantity, is it about the qualitative experience?  The Minister established the primary school curriculum review body <Col N="783" /> in October 1987 and she is setting up more advisory mechanisms.  Let us be clear about what this Minister has done. A sub-committee of the curriculum review body that worked for years produced a draft syllabus for political and social studies for the curriculum.  They completed their work, submitted it to her Department and, in an action perfectly consistent with the attack on the Ombudsman's Office, the Department decided to drop political and social studies in the curriculum.  It is an attack on citizenship, on political literacy and on the capacity and the right to participate in society.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of the curriculum, the Minister has abolished the statutory basis for which we had hoped. If they produce documents such as her speech, I am afraid to think of the consequences. What has happened to the notion, for example, of creativity and educational experience?  What is the status of all those documents about moving provision for the arts and music and other things &mdash; which had all been prepared &mdash; from private purchase provision by parents into the classroom so that we might have some kind of adequate, full, personal development for our children, even if they did have to leave this country?  They do not even merit a reference.  It is as if we were at some kind of a wake without the body. There is no reference to a single, educational principle in the speech.</P>
    <P>At the end of an 18 page document, three pages are grandiloquently titled &ldquo;Some General Issues&rdquo;.  Modern languages, technology and initiatives are mentioned.  There is a specific implication, as well as a general one, of the cuts in education.  It affects the lower socio-economic groups and it is they, primarily, who will emigrate without certification because there is a nine to one difference, at least, between the top two groups and the lowest two groups if you divide the country into seven socio-economic groups.  The Minister is moving resources out of the control of the Department of Education and shifting <Col N="784" /> them to other Departments.  Anyone caring even a little for education should consider all these matters that I said were not mentioned once in the Minister's speech and contrast that with the number of times the national lottery was mentioned. References to the national lottery occurred throughout her speech again and again, as resources were moved from regular, accountable expenditure by a Department of Education, being replaced by certainly very far from accountable national lottery expenditure.</P>
    <P>My final comment is that I would like to see a restoration even of the argument for education.  At every level in every sector there is the anxiety mentioned earlier. Even as I say this I know the degree of concern there is all over the country in relation to certification of the qualification for points.  There is a tension and anxiety being created that could wreak havoc on people's expectations of education. There is not a single educational issue addressed by the Minister.  Instead, there is a badly-drafted internal memorandum for the Department of Education masquerading as a ministerial speech.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing the Estimate.</P>

      <P>The Worker's Party will be opposing this Estimate, as we opposed the education cuts in the course of the past year.  They have had the most traumatic effect on education, on parents and on society as a whole.  Indeed they have revealed many things to many people, particularly the basic class nature of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there have been some honourable compromises &mdash; as they have been described &mdash; arrived at.  Certainly I do not contest the right of the relevant unions, the INTO or the TUI, to conclude agreements on the industrial relations aspects of the cutbacks.  The fact remains that those cutbacks are still being enforced on a somewhat lesser scale than was originally intended.  However, despite the concessions made by the Government, those cutbacks will still lead <Col N="785" /> to an unacceptable deterioration in the standard of education available in our primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that, as a time when we have the highest pupil/teacher ratio in Europe, the Government should have set out deliberately to effect a further deterioration of that ratio.  Judging from experiences in my constituency I would contend that these cutbacks are having a particularly severe impact in working-class areas.  The pupil/teacher ratio in these areas is already bad and any worsening will severely affect children already disadvantaged in very many ways, as I will point out in a few moments.</P>
    <P>The public clearly demonstrated their opposition to the cutbacks in primary education in a series of huge demonstrations involving teachers and, predominantly, parents.  Parents became more involved in education over the past year than ever before.  In fact, if there is one good point to be made about all of this it is that parents have taken a greater, very definite interest in what is happening in schools and have learned a tremendous amount of what is going on there.  They are now more than ever aware of the importance of education and of their need to fight for the proper education of their children.  The potential of education as an equalising force in Irish society has been destroyed by these cutbacks.  I do not know if the importance of education has been seen by any Government in any political context as an equalising force in our society.  I do not know if any Government have ever tackled the whole ideological concept of equality in education. Certainly this Government have tackled it in the reverse way, by creating more inequality in our society, in education. Clearly there is now developing a two-tier educational system, just as there is developing a two-tier health system, indeed a two-tier system in society overall. Yet, we are told that there are no class differences in our society.  There are very clear class issues involved in the educational system which have been clearly demonstrated.</P>
    <P>I want to dispel a myth that has been <Col N="786" /> developed over the past year or so by the media and others about how marvellous it is that our young emigrants are such a highly educated group of people.  The fact is that the vast majority of them are not highly educated.  No more than 20 per cent are highly skilled or highly educated. Anybody in London will tell you that that is the case.  In America there is being developed the theory that they are a whole new yuppie class of society, highly educated young people who will make a great breakthrough all over America whereas in New York and Boston it is precisely the same, no more than 20 per cent are highly skilled or have high educational qualifications.  At least 80 per cent or more &mdash; certainly those in the London area &mdash; are badly educated, in very many cases leaving school with little ability to read or write.  That bubble should be burst and that myth dispelled before people get the impression that all pupils in our schools are receiving a marvellous education, all being highly educated when they leave.</P>
    <P>My constituency stretches right from the inner city, in James's Street, out to the Meath border within which there are two growing towns, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown. They are rapidly expanding areas with young parents and many young children where both the primary and post-primary populations will be increasing for many years to come.  Yet, we are being told that the number of school-going children or population is falling. Certainly it is not falling in those areas. Those areas were classified as disadvantaged with unemployment among parents ranging between 60 and 80 per cent.  There has now been devised a new definition of &ldquo;disadvantaged&rdquo;.  A school is regarded as being disadvantaged now only if it has an ex-quota remedial teacher.  In the Clondalkin area there is a primary school, the junior level of which is not regarded as being disadvantaged while the senior level is &mdash; there are two separate categories of schools there because there are so many pupils.  I contend that all of the schools in that area would be disadvantaged, <Col N="787" /> requiring a high level of remedial teaching and a schools psychological service which I understand the Minister will initiate.  I understand it is her intention to introduce that service in two pilot areas. I would request that one of those be Clondalkin or Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>The position is precisely the same in the post-primary sector.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> speaks about ensuring that the disadvantaged are not affected, whereas every single cutback has affected the disadvantaged more than any others.  For example, Collinstown Park College, the senior college in Ballyfermot, Riversdale, a new community school in the Corduff area, the VECs, the Palmerstown Community School, Pobailscoil Isolde, all are losing remedial teachers on account of the cutbacks being implemented in the post-primary level under the new unacceptable scheme put to the TUI.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a specific point in relation to disadvantaged second-level schools.  The £30 allowance for the VPTP programme has been abolished.  Without that £30 allowance there will not be very many pupils in the VPTP area.  It is no wonder the Minister is so liberal in allowing 200 teachers for this area.  She knows that the abolition of the £30 allowance for disadvantaged pupils for whom the programme was designed, will mean that they will not continue the courses.  The Minister is well aware that this rapidly growing area which has over 30,000 students will rapidly diminish without the £30 grant and that they will not need the teachers.  The Minister can come along and say to the TUI without any fear that she will allow an extra 200 teachers for the VPTP programme knowing they will not be needed.  Unless the £30 allowance is kept, disadvantaged people will become even more disadvantaged.  They will leave school early and will continue to be disadvantaged without the benefit of these programmes, despite what the Government says about the disadvantaged not being put at risk.  I know my time is limited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Chomh maith leis an Teachta Higgins, tá an-díomá orm nach raibh faic le rá ag an Aire faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna. Bhí mé ag caint le déanaí le Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge agus tá go leor moltaí acu siúd faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus go mór mhór ta siad ag moladh go mbunódh an Roinn bun-aonad pleanála agus monatóireachta a bheadh freagrach do Runaí na Roinne. Tá an Chomhdháil ag caint ar son gach eagraíocht beagnach atá ag seasamh ar son na Gaeilge agus d'fhéadfadh leo siúd bheith ag labhairt don bhun-aonad seo faoin sórt syllabus a ba chóir a bheith ag an Roinn faoi mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus módhanna múinte na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>De réir mar a chloisim uathu múintear an Ghaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí díreach mar a mhúintear í sa Ghalltacht anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Ba chóir an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh sna Gaeltachtaí díreach mar a mhúintear an Béarla sa Ghalltacht, mar is í an Ghaeilge an teanga a labhartar sa bhaile, cosúil leis an mBéarla anseo.  Ba chóir na módhanna múinte a bheith mar an gcéanna leis an mBéarla.  Tá an syllabus céanna ann le 30 bliain anuas gan athrú dá laghad.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh slí éigin ag an Chomhdháil agus ag Comhchoiste na Gaeilge anseo san Oireachtas labhairt leis an Roinn faoin syllabus, faoi na módhanna múinte agus chuile rud mar sin.

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened, like a number of Deputies, to the Minister's speech.  I agree with the comments made by a number of my colleagues here that it certainly does not reflect the chaos in education throughout the country.  The Minister has dealt with global figures and has given a round figure of £1,200 million being available for education this year, and £5 million extra being made available <Col N="789" /> to primary education.  What the Minister said is at variance with what is going on in the country.  I, and I am sure other Deputies and Ministers and Ministers of State, have had the experience of attending more meetings to do with education, the difficulties in education and the concern and anxiety of educationists, parents and everyone concerned about what is going on at the moment, than we have attended in the previous five years.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech did not mention the primary schools where the pupil-teacher ratio is being adversely changed again.  Many teachers throughout the country in national schools, large and small, do not know whether they will be employed next year.  As Deputy Quill said, pupils are getting their holidays and are leaving school at the moment, and because of the uncertainty as to what staff will be available, they do not know what subjects they will be taught next year, who their teachers will be and they have not been given a book list.  We can all envisage the consternation and the queues and difficulties there will be in September.  Over the years it has been the practice that pupils knew what subjects they would be taught during the coming academic year and what books they should get, so that everything was arranged when the school year started in September.  Regrettably, that is not the case this year and parents and others are very concerned.</P>
      <P>Another problem not mentioned in the Minister's speech is the almost complete abandonment of the school building programme. Few schools are being built in any part of the country now and that is in sad contrast to the record of the previous Government.  When they were in office fine new schools for primary and post-primary education were built all over the country, including my constituency.  The only activity in this area now that I see are Ministers and Ministers of State opening schools that were allocated and built by the previous Administration.  I wonder when they will be in a position to open schools they have sanctioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An aspect of education for which I have responsibility relates to youth and <Col N="790" /> sport.  While there are significant funds available in these areas this year, it is a retrograde step that for the first time since I came into this House there is no mention in the 1988 Estimates of youth activities.  There is no subhead for youth under the Education Estimate.  That is a backward step and is a failure to recognise the educational input of the youth services.  I know they are getting money out of the national lottery but we are getting near to the time when we will debate the Estimate for 1989 and I hope the Minister and the Department will consider giving back to the youth services the recognition they have had, and that they will have a place in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State can say that moneys are available from other channels, namely the national lottery. That has its difficulties as well, as we have experienced last week or the week before.  I have in mind certain minority interests and churches in this country who have a difficulty in accepting lottery funds.  They do not agree with the concept of the lottery, they do not agree with gambling.  Their principles are strong enough to refuse to accept this money.  If the Minister was to have a subhead for youth funding in the Estimates this year it would relieve this difficulty. I hope that careful consideration will be given to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>It is a source of dismay that the national youth policy which was being implemented by the previous Government has been abandoned and put back on the shelf.  It will be remembered that in 1983 or 1984 the National Youth Policy Committee was established under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Costello.  It deliberated for a year and consulted all shades of opinion, and the report was welcomed when published and eventually it was adopted as Government policy.  It was welcomed by all youth organisations and people interested in youth activities. Now we find that that programme is on the shelf and that very little is being done. Certainly, money has been given but there is an absolute necessity to have a policy.  There is no use in giving out <Col N="791" /> money here and there unless there is a policy to be implemented.  Local youth service boards were established in about 15 counties and other local authorities were in the process of setting them up. Now they are being discontinued and the youth are suffering as a result.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the area of sport.  This week there is no necessity whatsoever to mention the importance of sport to the people of Ireland.  It would not be proper to let the occasion pass without congratulating our own Irish team on their efforts in Germany since last Sunday.  We all hope their success will continue during the remainder of this tournament.</P>
    <P>At present we have the opportunity of revolutionising sport in Ireland because we have more funds available than ever before through the national lottery.  It is not sufficient to hand out money here and there to facilities, to football fields and to clubs throughout the country.  We must have a more organised approach to the entire matter.  In view of the available funds, and the importance of sport, it is about time we had a five or a ten year plan.  It is not sufficient to pour these resources into facilities, football fields and so on.  We must also have the personnel to organise these activities, to look after the facilities and to ensure that the money is economically and well spent and that there is no duplication.  One of the difficulties we have at present is that four or five activities may be grant-aided in one area.  We must rationalise our approach, develop a centre in each area and have no duplication.</P>
    <P>In referring to the matter of lottery funds there is concern throughout the country at present at the manner in which these funds are being allocated.  It is the concern of all political parties, even some people on the Government side, that it is not good enough that Ministers look into their own hearts and say that £100,000 should go here and £50,000 there.  We should have some more constructive way of making these allocations.  We have witnessed in the past few weeks projects receiving funds for which they did not <Col N="792" /> even apply.  We, on this side of the House, would be in favour of having some authority, body or monitoring board that would monitor and assess applications very carefully and would give out this money on the basis of need rather than any other consideration.  We have all read and heard of Ministers going out and handing over cheques.  I do not think we can tolerate that sort of activity. It is not good for the lottery and it is not good for sport.  It devalues the entire concept and the sooner it is brought to an end the better.  I hope the Minister and the Government would think of this and devise some better way of organising the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt an Teachta Higgins agus daoine eile, tá díomá orm nár labhair an tAire in a hóráid aon fhocal Gaeilge.  Tá a fhios againn go léir na deacrachtaí atá ag an Ghaeilge faoi láthair sna scoileanna. Tá an Ghaeilge faoi ionsaí agus is beag atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas nó ag an Taoiseach, atá mar Aire na Gaeltachtá, faoi choinne í a chur chun cinn.  Sílim go bhfuil géarghá rud éigin a dhéanamh faoi théacs leabhair.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Teachta Higgins anseo sa Teach a bhfuil an oiread sin suime aige sa Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil sé mar chathaoirleach ar fhochoiste a bhunaíomar inné chun breathnú isteach sa cheist iomlán seo, an Ghaeilge sna cúrsaí oideachais, téacsleabhair agus mar sin.  Guím rath agus bláth ar a shaothar agus más féidir le héinne sa Teach gaisce a dhéanamh is féidir leis an Teachta Higgins é sin a dhéanamh.  Tugaim buíochas agus focal molta do mo chomhghuaillí féin, an Teachta Gemma Hussey, a chuir páipéar ar fáil seachtain nó coicís ó shin ag moladh go gcuirfí feabhas ar mhúineadh na Gaeilge agus ag moladh breis airgid a chur ar fáil maidir le múineadh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become too parochial but I would like to mention one particular school in my own constituency which was promised more than two years ago on the island of Arranmore, oileáin fíor Gaeltachta. There are 80 pupils leaving that island every Sunday evening and returning to the island every Friday evening <Col N="793" /> having to go to the mainland to avail of secondary education.  It is bordering on the disgraceful that little or no progress has been made in the past two years in providing a school on that island.  There have been talks about sites and so on.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State present to cut through the red tape, get on with the provision of that school and provide that much needed facility for the children of Arranmore island who have to cross the channel twice a week to get to and from school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with one of the points raised by Deputy McGinley regarding the inclusion of youth and sport in the Estimates. The fact is that youth and sport is probably the one lucky area in the finances of the State that it is not included in the Estimate because then it would have to suffer the same public expenditure cutbacks that every other area has had to endure.  I was pleased that at my request the Government included youth affairs as well as sport in lottery funding.  The result has been this year a massive increase up to £27.14 million available for youth affairs and sport.  Broken down this means an increase from £3.7 million for youth affairs last year to £10 million this year.  The allocation of this money means we can now introduce initiatives which will allow the development of a comprehensive youth service targeted in the first instance at those young people most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that this year we have been able to allocate some £4.86 million for the provision of special services for disadvantaged young people.  For the first time we are going into the deprived areas, particularly the city areas where young people simply have not got a chance because of the level of deprivation and underprivilege they have had to endure. We have tackled the cause of that deprivation and underprivilege.  This is one of the most innovative schemes ever introduced in this country and I am confident it will give a major return in investment to the State because for the first time <Col N="794" /> those deprived young kids are getting the money they sorely need to give them some kind of basic, reasonable lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that this money is being used in a preventive way in tackling the problems of homelessness, substance abuse, lack of education, training and job opportunity and lack of leisure and sporting opportunities.  We are giving a new lease of life to those young people and I am confident that this expenditure will keep them out of trouble and save this country millions of pounds which would have to be spent in trying to cure the problems now being generated to an alarming extent by such young people who are socially deprived and disadvantaged. Since I got this job I feel that had I come from the background they come from I would be worse probably than they are.  For the first time a Government have given a considerable amount of money to help the have nots. That has proved possible because of the national lottery, and what better way to spend the money?</P>
    <P>Contrary to accusations about money being spent by Ministers, I set up an interdepartmental committee of five Departments, Education, Health, Social Welfare, the Environment and Justice, to ensure we had a co-ordinated approach to those young people and their difficulties. Rather than abandoning the previous Government's youth policy, we are implementing it in full.  I have used the Costello report as my Bible since I got this job.  That was the basis of the previous Government's youth policy and I am carrying out in full the proposals in that report and the proposals in the policy document of my predecessor, Deputy George Birmingham.  It is totally incorrect for Deputy McGinley to allege that that policy has been abandoned.  It has not.  It is being implemented efficiently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>What about local youth services and sport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  I am providing an extra £1 million to develop mainline youth services for voluntary youth organisations. <Col N="795" /> I am not proceeding with local youth boards because I do not believe we need yet another structure, another bureaucracy. We need an innovative approach to youth work which was started by you, Sir, on the basis that you develop voluntary effort on a base of good professional back-up.  In that context we are setting up local youth service councils who will simply integrate properly at voluntary and statutory levels all the people who are operating on the ground in local areas.  We do not need another structure. We need funding to be made available to the people on the ground doing the work, particularly volunteers who are doing such a fine job in the provision of mainline youth services at present.  Considerable extra money is now being made available to those organisations without the necessity of further bureaucratic structures.</P>
      <P>We are developing a youth information service right across the country.  We are developing youth international exchanges and I am developing further the Irish-Franco cultural agreement on youth affairs.  This week in Germany I reached agreement with my German counterpart on significant developments in German-Irish youth exchanges and a considerable increase in the German-Irish cultural exchange agreements which have been on the shelf since 1983 and are now to be moved forward with the exchange of young people in youth affairs and sport, coming from Germany to this country and going from Ireland to Germany. We propose to make available through the youth exchange bureau, now in the process of being finally put on a statutory basis, youth exchange opportunities to other countries throughout Europe and further afield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with Deputy McGinley in connection with the development in sport. Again, as a result of the national lottery we have been able to provide significant moneys for the development of sport.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as probably the most eminent Minister for Sport you will appreciate, and this will serve to illustrate, that sport is probably the most <Col N="796" /> important medium for the development of morale, not alone in this country but in the development of Ireland's image abroad.  I join with Deputy McGinley in congratulating the Irish team who put up such a great performance.  One would need to have been in Germany, as I had the opportunity to be, to understand fully what this game meant for Ireland, and not alone that but what the performance of our 15,000 Irish people meant for Ireland.  Never have I seen such a wave of goodwill as I have seen for the past five or six days by the German people towards Ireland, because of the behaviour of our fans, so much so that last night the city of Hanover simply rose to the Irish fans who were celebrating in that city.  It was interesting to see cars literally coming to a standstill so that their occupants could talk to the Irish because in five days they had made such an impression as people who are good-natured, happy and simply good.  What better way to enhance the image of Ireland?  The coverage on German TV of the fans and their behaviour has been significant and that is not in any way to take from the supreme effort of the team. Again, right across Europe the image of Ireland has been enhanced by their performance.  If I may make a prediction, I am convinced we will get at least the one point we need on Saturday and we will be in the semi-finals of this competition. What a performance for a country on the edge of Europe.  We were disappointed yesterday evening in Hanover that we only drew with the Russians but when one thinks of that, we are in a wonderful situation.  Consider the performance of an Irish team with only a couple of hundred thousand people playing soccer playing against one of the super powers with a population of I do not know how many million.  It was a great performance.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that sport is probably the greatest medium for the development of morale at home and the development of the image of Ireland abroad.  I want to thank the Minister for Education in particular and the Taoiseach for seeing fit to provide sufficient money through the <Col N="797" /> national lottery for the development of sport.  I do not doubt it will prove to be the best investment of any made in this country this year.</P>
    <P>Much work is going on behind the scenes and I have paid particular attention this year to the development of a youth policy in sport right across the board.  We are putting significant extra amounts of money into the development of sport among young people.  We have selected a number of new sports in addition to the traditional sports such as athletics, swimming and boxing where individual performance can be enhanced. We are paying attention to the development of tennis, golf and yachting and we will, in association with the Irish Tennis Foundation and the ILTA, be putting significant resources into the development of tennis.  Let me take that one game as an example.  This week I reached agreement with the German Minister for Sport that Ireland can have a direct link into German tennis coaching and tennis education system.  I had the pleasure of meeting the coach to Steffi Graf and Boris Becker when they were juniors, who agreed readily to take youngsters from Ireland to Germany and coach them free of charge and only at the cost of their stay while they are in Germany.  I have reached agreement that the whole coaching system in tennis in this country will be examined by the German experts and that we will receive significant support from the German experts.  This is geared towards children between the ages of 10 and 14.  I have no doubt, and this relates to just one sport, that this will result in Ireland becoming a major force in tennis in the next ten years.  We are not so naive as to think we can do so in a shorter period but unless we are prepared to develop a policy which is equal to the best in the world we cannot expect to succeed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say we have a significant coaching and development programme for youngsters with the FAI.  We have given £120,000 to the GAA to bring down the cost of hurleys and ensure that the decline in popularity of our national game is halted.  We want that game to grow in <Col N="798" /> popularity.  Cospóir, the national sports council, are involved in a series of programmes this year and I am glad to say that we are providing £313,000 for their development programmes.  A &ldquo;Sport for All&rdquo; Day was held in primary schools on 24 May and the intention was to encourage more young people to get involved in sport.  I have given funds to organisations such as Minisports who are promoting in national schools mini-tennis, mini-hockey and mini-basketball, with the emphasis on getting young children involved in sport.  It is important that young people should enjoy and become more proficient in the sport of their choice.</P>
    <P>My most important objective is the promotion of sport for all.  The &ldquo;Be Active Be Alive&rdquo; Week, Cospóir's main promotion, was a great success.  It encouraged many people who were not involved in sport to participate.  We are anxious to continue with that type of programme.  We want to get those over 40, housewives, the unemployed and people who up to now have not been involved in sport, to participate in some type of activity.  The long-distance walking groups, promoted by Cospóir, have proved a great success.  I am glad that Bord Fáilte have at long last produced a brochure for that activity.</P>
    <P>The most significant development in sport this year was the commercial development.  Sport can provide a very worthwhile spin-off for the country.  The Government have agreed to provide £500,000 for the commercial development of sport.  We want to develop facilities and a marketing programme so that sport will become an important aspect of our tourism industry.  In Germany this week I visited several golf clubs in an effort to promote the facilities we have here.  I have no doubt that tourism in the future will depend on our ability to sell leisure programmes based on sport.</P>
    <P>This has been a great year for youth affairs and sport and it has been made possible by the national lottery.  It is important to emphasise that.  I should like to refute categorically allegations made in the House, and outside, that national <Col N="799" /> lottery funds were being abused by me or my Department.  We have £4 million to spend on local capital projects but applications submitted to us would cost £40 million.  Those applications are worthwhile but we must make arbitrary decisions in regard to the allocation of the money.  I will stand over every decision I have taken.  We have allocated the money fairly geographically.  It was given to deserving projects that complied with the scheme operated by the Department of Finance for many years.  We have not done anything different from any Government since the scheme was established in 1980.  I accept that the Minister has discretion but I have been careful to use that discretion properly and in the best interests of all.  I must refute the allegations made here and outside by Opposition Members that we have used this as a slush fund.  That is not the case and I stand over the decisions taken by the Minister and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House on this Estimate.  I note that details of expenditure on new schools and school extensions are not contained in the Estimate.  For a long time I have been making representations to successive Governments regarding Gaelscoil Mhíde in my constituency.  Due to an extreme accommodation crisis the very existence of Gaelscoil Mhíde is threatened.  This growing all-Irish primary school is temporarily situated in the Baldoyle area.  A small school, it is divided among four buildings with its 182 pupils housed in an old convent school, providing, two classes, an old community hall containing four classes and two prefabs in the convent school grounds.  Worse again, the school is separated by a dangerous and busy main street and its junction with Willie Nolan Road, Baldoyle.  If equipment has to be transferred from one section of the school persons must cross this busy and dangerous main street to gain access to the other section of Gaelscoil Mhíde.  School children face danger daily crossing this hazardous junction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infant classes in the old convent school <Col N="800" /> are using upstairs classrooms and teachers must accompany the pupils when using toilets which are situated downstairs. I understand, according to Department of Education rules, upstairs classrooms should not be used where infants are involved.  An old hall, an old convent school, and two prefabs are just not good enough in this day and age to provide the proper environment for teachers and pupils to work together successfully for the full development of students. The board of management, staff and parents of Gaelscoil Mhíde are demanding that the school be housed under one roof in suitable accommodation not too far from its home base in Donaghmede until permanent accommodation becomes available for it in Donaghmede.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education recognise the right of Gaelscoil Mhíde to be in one unit but they have thus far failed in their efforts to find a suitable building for the Gaelscoil for the new school year. There are only 12 weeks between now and September.  The parents of the pupils of Gaelscoil Mhíde are very angry at the treatment they and their children have received and at the lack of positive planning for the Gaelscoil's future.  A very telling example of this is the fact that the permanent location of the Gaelscoil has still not been clearly established seven years after the founding of the school. Another example is that the Gaelscoil will have five different buildings for its 200 pupils in September, if proper accommodation is not provided.</P>
    <P>In 1986, during the term of office of the previous Government, negotiations were at an advanced stage to purchase 2.5 acres in the Donaghmede area from the Irish Christian Brothers.  The parents helped negotiate a favourable price for the site &mdash; I understand a price of £17,500 per acre was agreed.  However, after the election the Government imposed severe cutbacks and the purchase of this ideal site fell through.  There are four schools in the Donaghmede area and there has been a decline in pupil numbers in them. The Department have indicated that space may be available in Scoil Caoibhín <Col N="801" /> but I cannot see Scoil Caoibhín providing the space until 1992.  Scoil Íosagáin in Kilbarrack could provide temporary accommodation from September until a permanent home is found.  Will the Minister let me know the position in relation to this school?  Has it been offered for sale by the Department?  Surely the Gaelscoil Mhíde should be offered this school as a temporary measure?  The parents are demanding that the Department provide free transport for the pupils of the Gaelscoil to wherever they may be temporarily accommodated until the problem is resolved.  The parents are suggesting that a scheme similar to that operating in respect of Gaelscoil Inse Chór be introduced for their area.  They are seeking funding so that the children can take a bus to school.  There is a precedent for this in Gaelscoil Inse Chór for which the Department have provided that money.  If it could be provided in this case it would be a great help.  I would urge the Minister to resolve this problem and to find a permanent home for Gaelscoil Míde.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech she mentioned that negotiations took place under the aegis of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and that settlement terms were agreed by the executive of both post-primary unions in relation to the implementation of revised staffing arrangements to be operational in the 1988-89 school year.  The union has asked me to get the Minister to clarify that. They say that no arrangement has been made.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate today on the Estimates for Education.  All the Members in this House constantly show a very keen interest in educational matters and it is my duty to record my appreciation to those who contributed.  Before I go into the general points raised by the various spokespersons I will just answer Deputy Cosgrave.  The Deputy asked me specific questions which I cannot possibly answer because I was not aware that he <Col N="802" /> was going to raise them in an Estimates speech.  Had he raised the questions on an Adjournment debate I would of course have been able to answer them.  I can tell him that I have followed the case of Gaelscoil Mhíde and my Department officials are at present very busy in negotiations on various matters concerning it. Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, my colleague in the Dáil, is very interested in this matter and has arranged with me in meeting with the interested parties within the next ten days.  I have conveyed to him that I would be agreeable to meet with the interested parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;my Department are very busy on the issue.  Very great interest was expressed in the debate by the Deputies who contributed to it. Deputy Gemma Hussey wondered about the changes in the education provision. Any changes which have been made were brought about subject to very reasoned debate to which all parties in the House contributed.  Quite clearly, a climate of consensus is one that is very conducive, and so some of the Dáil debates have proven.  As well as discussing the Estimates, an hour and a quarter of Question Time was also allocated to education. Many of the points which arose in the earlier debate on the Estimates were duplicated at Question Time.  I have explained quite clearly that the lateness in notification and issue of the post-primary allocation of teachers was because the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> led to protracted talks.  Deputy Hussey said that the voters would hold us in very poor <Col N="803" /> esteem.  I am not trying to be cantankerous but at present, thank God &mdash; God is still with us &mdash; Fianna Fáil are standing very high in the poll estimation and I think that will continue.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous Ministers for Education, I have met constantly with all of the interests in education.  There is never an occasion on which I do not agree to meet with somebody who wishes to see me on a genuine matter, be that an individual or a person representing a group. I find that enormously beneficial and it has eased my path on many occasions, in that as I go around I meet with these people again and they are appreciative of the fact that I am open to discussion and to recommendation.</P>

      <P>We had a very interesting discussion and very worthwhile points were raised.  I commend them for what they have produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey also raised the question of legislation for RTCs.  She said that Deputy Cooney had left it in train when he left office.  Of course he did.  It was quite horrible legislation, legislation with <Col N="804" /> which I will not be proceeding.  I will be proceeding with my own legislation which is entirely different and does not involve the total abolition of the VECs but the merging of VECs.  Deputy Hussey spoke about sexism.  I am in total agreement with her on this.  We found ourselves <i>en rapport</i> across the floor of the House, as I am sure other Deputies did.  Since I came into office, I have had the elimination of sexism very high on the educational agenda.  The issue of third level grants was also raised by Deputy Hussey. I am quite startled that the Fine Gael Party would object to any measures which sought not to give grants to people who are not eligible.  It would be an extraordinary statement which I know would not find favour in any other parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill, spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, referred to the general provision of education.  She said she did not understand that there was an increase of 2½ per cent over the 1987 budget in the 1988 budget.  I fail to see why she did not understand.  They are the figures and I have quoted them.  I will be referring to them again when replying to Deputy Higgins.  The figures are as stated in the budget.  This country is spending over £1,200 million this year on education. That is the second highest percentage of GNP spent on education within all EC countries.  Bearing in mind the relative affluence of some of those countries, it is an amazing achievement that this country can do so in spite of the economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill, like Deputy Hussey, quite rightly asked for the post-primary allocation of teachers as quickly as possible. She recorded generously the appreciation of the work of computerisation which will now go ahead. She spoke of the need for planning in the educational process.  I am glad to inform her &mdash; this factor was not in my speech &mdash; that within the Department of Education we have set up a five person planning group, in the light of demographic trends, changes and needs, who will target in particular the planning process for education in the next decade.  There is no doubt that this is needed.  Were all the <Col N="805" /> money in the world to be available to education one would still need to plan realistically and correctly and we are setting about doing that.  The Deputy spoke very feelingly &mdash; one would know she had been in the education system &mdash; of the pressure on young people sitting the current examinations and the pressure of the path for third level entry.  She spoke about grinds and her abhorrence of the grind system.</P>
    <P>As we are speaking about examinations, even at this late stage I wish good luck to the students in the remaining subjects in the State examination.  All the young people in particular seem pleased with the type of examination questions on the papers, the curricula reflects the various changes which have occurred in the various subjects.  The Deputy put particular emphasis on in-service courses for teachers and I agree they are necessary. There is not enough money for in-service courses for teachers.  More money should be made available and I will endeavour to see that this is done.  If changes are to be made in education there would have to be changes in the needs of teachers who will have to adapt themselves to the changing environment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy Michael Higgins.  &ldquo;By Mac and O you'll surely know true Irishmen are they.&rdquo; Deputy Higgins for the Labour Party spoke of how he found the speech &mdash; I hasten to add not my spoken words but the written words &mdash; to be illiterate.  I find that extraordinary.  I cannot alter the figures.  They are as set out in the Estimates and they are there to be read. He took particular pages as examples of where he perceived this to so be.  Irrespective of whether figures are dry, it is <Col N="806" /> the allocation which decides what services will be given to the Department.  At Estimates time, it is incumbent on the Minister to give what are dry figures.  I do not particularly like reading figures, but it is a matter of necessity in the production and delivery of an Estimates speech.</P>
      <P>I must correct Deputy Higgins who said we are forcing teachers out of the system.  I have to put this on the record.  The scheme is one of voluntary redundancy and is over-subscribed three times. I am beset by teachers who cannot get voluntary redundancy and wish to get it.  Far from forcing teachers out of the system, they seek voluntary redundancy. I want to put that on the record.</P>

      <P>By your deeds you shall know them. Since I came into office I have authorised a considerable number of scoileanna lán-Ghaelacha, primary schools.  That has been recognised publicly by the umbrella group for such schools.  I hope Deputies would not fall into the élitist trap of thinking that one must always speak Irish to be seen as having a commitment to the cause.  My commitment to the cause of the Irish language is absolute and untarnished.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla mentioned the use of lottery funds and the overall level of funding for education as well as the pupil-teacher ratio.  Deputy McGinley spoke about the youth and sport element of the Department, and my Minister of State responded accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,813,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>Because of the time limit I will restrict my comments to Energy and leave my colleague, Deputy Smith, to deal with Forestry.  May I take this opportunity of paying a very special tribute to the work my Minister of State, Deputy Smith, has done in the last 12 months and, in a very special way, for the introduction of the forestry legislation?  May I also thank the secretary and staff of the Department of Energy &mdash; taking in the Forestry staff &mdash; for their loyalty, support and courtesy during the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gross expenditure in the Energy Vote for this year shows a 4 per cent drop on the outturn for 1987.  Expenditure on this Vote now is practically the same as it was in 1980 when the Department of Energy <Col N="809" /> were first established.  In real terms it is, of course, very substantially less.  The Vote itself is small in relation to the total Estimate for the Public Service &mdash; the expenditure is put into context when it is considered that it represents less than 1 per cent of the total Public Service Estimate.</P>
    <P>However, it bears no relation to the extent of the Department's actvities.  This point is highlighted by one simple statistic. Between 1984 and 1987, Exchequer expenditure on the Energy Vote was of the order of £44 million but in that same period the activities for which my Department exercise responsibility generated income of nearly £260 million for the Exchequer.  Unfortunately some elements of that revenue, primarily BGE transfers to the Exchequer, will not recur in the short term, but on a general level I do not consider it imperative that Departments, particularly in the current budgetary climate, should maximise revenue and I am quite satisfied that my Department have done their fair share in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1988 are further evidence of the Government's commitment to controlling public expenditure and placing the economy on a sound footing from which it can grow.  The Estimates procedure, the individual Votes and the total Estimate for the Public Service are being increasingly fine-tuned to ensure a more rational use of available resources and to ensure that taxpayers get the best value for their money.  Good management of the public finances has ensured that we achieved the stringent targets which we set ourselves last year and we intend to achieve our targets again in 1988.  Indeed, the process for 1989 is already well under way.</P>
    <P>The credibility which we have re-established by meeting budget targets has demonstrated our determination to take the necessary decisions and follow them through and has generated respect and renewed confidence.  We are already seeing signs of success in terms of reduced interest rates and continuing stable low inflation.  The economic environment being created by our policies has put hope <Col N="810" /> back into the system.  Our committed approach to identifying and stimulating growth sectors of the economy including, for example, tourism, forestry and the Financial Services Centre, to name but a few, gives me the confidence to be optimistic about employment prospects.</P>
    <P>The year 1992, the Single European Act and all that this implies are now looming large on our horizon.  The actions which we are taking on the economy will have the additional benefit of producing a fit body to play in this tougher game.  The economy must be fit, industry must be fit and the public sector must be fit.  The energy sector must play its part in making the economy competitive and all of our actions must bear this in mind.  I see it as an increasingly important part of my responsibility to ensure that the areas of the economy under my aegis should optimise their contribution to the national challenge to meet the opportunities presented by the Single European Act fully and successfully.</P>
    <P>In returning to details of my own particular responsibilities, I want to reiterate that hydrocarbons exploration and development is one area to which I attach considerable importance in terms of our future national economic development. In moving the Estimate for my Department in 1987, I stated that it was my intention to take the necessary steps to ensure that our licensing terms for oil and gas were clearly seen to compete favourably with regimes elsewhere.  I have since taken those steps and I am happy to say that the introduction of the new terms in September 1987 has resulted in a positive response from the oil industry.</P>
    <P>My aim as Minister for Energy is to have the investigation of the potential of our offshore completed and to achieve commercial developments.  The revision of terms was a necessary and vital step towards this goal.  The omens for exploration a year ago were far from favourable. Interest in our offshore was falling away and several companies were proposing to depart our waters.  There was a distinct possibility that exploration might <Col N="811" /> simply dwindle to zero over a short period.  It would have been far more difficult, if not impossible, to win back the exploration companies if they had left the Irish scene.  My actions in revising the licensing terms were urgently required and the case for doing what I did was compelling.</P>
    <P>The new terms have indeed given a much needed impetus to exploration and a number of new drilling commitments have been entered into as a direct result. Of the three wells currently under way at this present moment, two would not have been commenced if the terms had not been revised.</P>
    <P>However, there is a substantial part of the Irish offshore already under lease which is considered to be prospective and in which no attempt has been made to carry out further drilling.  This situation is not acceptable to the Government who are conscious of their duty to protect the national interest in matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>At the present time, we have only one hydrocarbon producing field, namely the Kinsale Head gas field.  The beneficial contribution which this resource is making to the economy demonstrates in a most emphatic way the importance of developing our natural resources.</P>
    <P>Natural gas now accounts for about 14 per cent of our primary energy requirement and is available as an energy choice to 300,000 homes (about 30 per cent of the total).  The use of Kinsale gas contributed over £100 million in savings on our oil import bill in 1987.</P>
    <P>Present indications are for continued steady growth in sales of natural gas particularly in the premium sector in Dublin.  About £15 million of BGE's £33 million capital programme for 1988 will be expended on the distribution systems of Dublin and other areas.  In 1988 the target length for mains/service replacement and network renewal in Dublin is three times as great as it was in 1987 and greater in one year than the total for the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>New gas legislation which I introduced during 1987 cleared the way for BGE to commence operating for the first time as <Col N="812" /> a gas distributor in their own right and in November last BGE concluded the contract for the acquisition of the assets of Dublin Gas.  I expect BGE to create and maintain a viable and expanding gas distribution business in Dubliin capable of paying its own way and adequately remunerating the capital invested in it.</P>
    <P>This House will be well aware of the concern which I have for safety issues, not just of nuclear safety on which I will speak later, but also in relation to gas.  I am pleased to say that all of the gas recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report have been implemented and that the implementation of the gas-related recommendations of the other safety reports is progressing very well and is within the recommended timescale for completion.  In addition, I announced in October last a portfolio of 34 new gas standards produced by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A major project extending the gas network northwards from Dublin to the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk is currently underway.  Spur lines are also planned to get within reach of population centres and the horticultural industry in north County Dublin.  Access to secure, clean, efficient energy along this route will, no doubt, contribute to the economic stability and development of the region and it is scheduled to have gas flowing by the end of this year.  This major project is creating an average of 200 jobs and is costing in the region of £30 million of which £12 million has been approved from the EC Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that some time ago I set up a working group to examine the questions of interconnection of gas and electricity with the UK or mainland Europe.  I have just received the report of this group and it is appropriate that I indicate briefly its conclusions.  Before doing so, I want to say that the report contains sensitive commercial information supplied by the State companies concerned and also a certain amount of strategically sensitive material.  I do not, therefore, propose that it be published.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that decisions on gas and electricity interconnectors are <Col N="813" /> independent of each other and can be considered on their individual merits.</P>
    <P>In the case of electricity the report concludes that 1995 is the earliest date by which the ESB are likely to require new plant and, depending on growth rates in electricity demand, it could be as late as 2001.  It appears at this stage that the most attractive available option would be a 600 megawatt high voltage DC cable to the UK.  There is also a strong economic case for restoration of the link to Northern Ireland, if and when this becomes feasible.  The question of proceeding with pre-contract phase studies and discussion merits early consideration because the lead time for any such project is several years.  The report concludes that there is no economic justification for an electricity link with France.</P>
    <P>In relation to the long-term future for gas, clearly further indigenous supplies would be the best solution.  If these do not materialise, any gas import project would need to be onstream by 1997.  A decision on gas imports is not required until 1991 or 1992 and the matter should be reviewed in detail again in three years time.  A decision as between piped imports and liquified natural gas is also premature at this stage.  The report examines the gas market and possible importation projects in considerable detail.  It concludes that a gas industry based on imported gas could be viable under certain conditions.  The price of imported gas, the maintenance of adequate margins on sales and the volume of gas sold to the premium market sector are the most relevant factors.  The sales targets which BGE need to achieve have been identified and can, therefore, be monitored.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Professor Conniffe, and the members of the working group for their efforts and for their fine report.</P>
    <P>The House should not be in any doubt about the concern which this Government have on nuclear matters.  This concern is reflected in the commitment we have given to our campaign of initiatives designed to ensure that nuclear installations in other countries do not pose a <Col N="814" /> threat to the health, safety and environment of the Irish people.  International and bilateral initiatives I have been taking are proving very encouraging and I believe that real progress is being made in heightening the general level of awareness about the dangers of radiation in general and Ireland's concerns in particular. The Government will continue with their campaign for the closure of the Sellafield reprocessing plant, the old magnox nuclear power stations in the UK and the cancellation, not merely the postponement, of the planned experiment at Trawsfynydd.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to the protection of the Irish people from the hazards of radiation, and have approved the heads of a Bill to set up the national radiological protection institute.  Unlike the NEB, it will not have any function in relation to the development and regulation of nuclear power, but it will take over the responsibilities of the NEB in relation to the control of radioactive substances and will have the capacity and expertise to advise the Government on nuclear developments which could have implications for Ireland.  I will be putting the legislation before the House during the next session.  It is now with the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <P>I have included a sum of £250,000 in this year's Estimate for the first phase of the nuclear accident emergency plan. This is another important part of the Government's commitment to protect the public from the effects of nuclear accidents abroad.  Some elements of the plan have been put into place already such as extra office and laboratory resources for the Nuclear Energy Board, monitoring equipment for the Civil Defence, communications links with the International Atomic Energy agency and arrangements for the urgent calling together of key personnel.</P>
    <P>The plan has been approved by the Government.  The question of whether it should be published will be decided after a test of the plan which is scheduled to take place later this month.</P>
    <P>Turning to the minerals prospecting and mining sector, 221 new minerals <Col N="815" /> prospecting licences have been issued by my Department since January 1987 giving a total of over 500 licences currently valid.  I have also approved the grant of some 250 other licences and these are in process towards issue.  A projected figure of over 700 licences in place in 1988 compares very favourably with the figure of 341 valid licences in January 1987.  While the speed with which licences can be issued does not depend exclusively on matters within the domain of the Department, I have done everything possible to ensure that minimum delays occur on our side in processing applications.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that encouraging results have been obtained by a number of companies exploring for gold. While I am sure we hope that all their efforts will be crowned with ultimate success, nonetheless we must bear in mind that minerals exploration is a very high risk unpredictable business.</P>
    <P>The naturally high profile given to gold exploration must not, of course, divert our attention from the fact that Ireland is a proven base metals province and that we have a number of encouraging prospects in this area.  If we keep up the momentum of exploration &mdash; and prices are now looking better &mdash; we will hasten the day when we may have another commercial find.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have made a substantial contribution to the economic life of this State since the late forties.  In order to sustain their national responsibility in the period ahead and recoup their financial losses incurred because of the two bad production seasons in 1985 and 1986, the board must seek a maximum return from the utilisation of their remaining peat resources.  This will require more effective operation of their existing activities on both home and export markets and the identification of new profitable produts and services.  For this reason I am in the process of commissioning a study to be undertaken by consultants into the entire operations of the organisation.  The study will focus particularly on the latest peat development technology in Ireland <Col N="816" /> and elsewhere, management structures, financing, planning, research, marketing and any other areas of the organisation where change is deemed necessary to achieve optimum return from the exploitation of this vital national resource.  The need for this hard look at their operations is recognised at all levels in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In relation to electricity, the price reductions implemented in recent years have been very welcome to consumers and will greatly facilitate an increase in the competitiveness of Irish Industry. Irish electricity prices have fallen from a position of being among the most expensive in Europe to one in which they are now well in line with the EC average.  The ESB are committed to hold electricity prices at their present level for the next two to three years.  I am keeping the possibility for futher price reductions under continuing review and any opportunities for a reduction that may arise will be availed of.</P>
    <P>The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1987, was recently passed by the Dáil.  The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the ESB to set up subsidiary companies for suitable developments, one being to engage in importation and wholesale coal trading from Moneypoint and to remove doubts which arose in relation to rates.  The enactment of this Bill will create considerable opportunities for expansion by the ESB of their external activities such as foreign consultancy and fisheries as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Already the ESB plan to provide employment for 500 people through their overseas consultancy operations by 1992 and employment of 100 through their fishery operations in the same period.</P>
    <P>In so far as oil supply is concerned, 1987 saw a partial recovery in oil prices worldwide following the collapse in 1986. Despite some erratic private movement, most commentators expect 1988 prices to be relatively stable.  As Ireland continues to depend on oil for just under 50 per cent of its energy requirements, price movements internationally impact greatly on domestic energy costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> In July 1987 my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, reintroduced price control on road fuels.  This action was particularly timely in that it ensured that consumers received benefit from the international price reductions which had taken place.  Further developments internationally have enabled prices to fall even further since last July.  We would be failing in our duty if we did not ensure that our domestic consumers and our commercial and industrial enterprises can participate to the full in any beneficial changes which take place on the oil market.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I am not in a position to add to my replies to recent parliamentary questions about a possible Nigerian project involving Whitegate and Whiddy.  I expect to finalise this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I cannot share the Minister's pleasure at the performance of his Department during the past year.  I think it has been, on balance, a disappointing year for the Department of Energy.  We have had plenty of grandiose talk about Nigerian oil deals and about closing down Sellafield, but we have had little of real substance in the energy policy area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems that beset the energy sector, a sector so crucial to a small trading country like our own, are still there. The cost handicap that was suffered in Ireland last year was estimated to be about £175 million which would have provided jobs for nearly 19,000 people if it could have been removed.  We are still one of the most inefficient users of energy in Europe, 20 per cent more energy intensive in producing output than the rest of Europe.  We have a large State sector in the energy area.  Sixty per cent of the energy sector is controlled by the State but it has not been put into a shape where it is really creating new opportunities for our people here as an energy sector should do.  There is £2,000 million worth of taxpayers' money and public capital tied up in these companies and yet they are companies who are imposing costs on the economy.  They have had a record of <Col N="818" /> disappointing investment.  One need go no further than to look at the excess capacity in the ESB or to look at the poor early returns on the BGE investment. The Minister himself praises the extension to Dundalk but did not provide us at any stage in the House with the projected returns.  It seems to me that on balance there is a real danger that very few of the extra gas sales on that investment will be above the basic sale price that could be got from selling, for instance, to the ESB and it is hard to see the economic return that is being achieved on these investments.</P>
    <P>It is in these areas that we would like to see action and prove that the Minister is exacting from the State sector the sort of performance that we need here if we are to have a prosperous environment for the growth of jobs throughout the whole economy.  Far from the Minister bringing in measures to improve the performance of these companies he has actually blocked moves that Fine Gael tried to introduce to improve the performance of State companies.  We sought to have targets set for an improvement in price relative to the EC that could be monitored. We sought to see annual performance indicators reported upon by these State companies and although these proposals were backed by the independent national planning board this Government threw them out here in the House which is a disappointment.  It is a disappointment to see in the budget that the ESB have been frustrated in their attempts to get down costs by the imposition of VAT and by the removal of £38 million of a low interest loan that they enjoyed.  These are not measures designed to improve cost performance in the economy.  Indeed they could be tolerated if we felt there was determined action by the Minister on some of the other problems of a company like the ESB, as highlighted in the Jacobsen report, but we have not had such evidence and that, again, is an area of disappointment.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, Ireland is one of the most inefficient users of energy in Europe, and despite that we have seen <Col N="819" /> our research and development budget decimated in recent years and continuing to fall.  It is now only one-seventh of the research effort that would be spent in other EC countries, and in many areas it has fallen below a viable level to sustain any sort of a research effort in an area that is going to be so strategically important to us in the coming years if we are to be an efficient energy producer.  That, again, is a source of disappointment as this is the seed capital for results in a few years time.</P>
    <P>In the area of conservation we have had a year of disappointment.  Despite evidence that up to £400 million worth of savings per year could be achieved by efficient investments that show adequate return and use known technology, we have seen no effort in the conservation area from the Department.  Indeed, the conservation programmes are grinding down to a derisory level at this stage. These are the areas we look to for inspiration from the Department if we are to get an energy sector that is creating job opportunities.  The Minister has an awful lot more to do if he is to get such a sector.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the generous oil concession he made during the course of the year since the last Estimates.  Generous indeed it is, but it did not address Ireland's two key areas of real concern, and that is to become a producer country, in other words, to get oil ashore, and also to replace our gas source.  He has not clarified the price at which a successful find of gas could be sold.  It is very hard to expect people to undertake costly exploration for gas to provide a company that is already fully supplied up to the year 2000 and for whom there will be no other outlet for the gas if it were found. That is asking too much.  The Minister should have taken the opportunity to clarify the terms in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in passing his pleasure that the House accepted the ESB Bill, a good Bill indeed had the Minister provided adequate protection for the ESB consumer.  All of us hope there will be no failure in these companies but, should it happen, it should not be <Col N="820" /> the ESB consumer who picks up the tab. I was very disappointed the Minister accepted none of the amendments coming from this side of the House seeking to have a water-tight separation between the new companies that were being established and the electricity parent.</P>
    <P>The coal business into which the ESB is entering is a risky one and the company engaged in that must stand alone; it cannot have the prop of subsidies and low interest loans or guarantees from the electricity consumer.  That should have been put into the legislation.  Many of us on this side of the House were gravely disappointed that the Minister appeared to have swallowed the ESB case without greater scrutinies.  We can only hope we will not live to rue the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to his commissioning of a report on Bord na Móna. It seems strange that after so long in Government, when he came into Government with a commitment to carve out a great new role for Bord na Móna, that it is only now we hear him commissioning a report.  That indicates decisions still a long way down the road. It is always interesting to see independent people look at our State enterprises but somehow I feel that to be commissioning a report at this stage is a bit of a step back from the real decisions that need to be made.  It was implied when the Minister came into Government that he had already done the thinking in this area. The evidence is that the Minister and his party have done very little thinking about energy.</P>
    <P>We have seen no White Paper on energy policy.  We have seen no coherent policy statements of any sort in the energy area and this country is crying out for it.  It is a major sector; almost 20 per cent of our national income is devoted to energy.  If it was any other policy there would have been reams of paper indicating precisely the sort of strategy that was needed, but that has not happened here and we are paying the price by having an inefficient sector, poor investment results from many areas and poor conservation, having ignored the <Col N="821" /> environmental consequences of many decisions.  This is the price we have paid for lack of proper thinking through in the energy area.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn briefly to two issues that seem to have dominated the Minister's thinking during the past year, that is, the Nigerian deal and the whole nuclear area.  Frankly, I am getting more and more frustrated with the continuing discussion about the Nigerian deal.  We read in the newspapers conflicting reports about whether it has been dropped.  Each time we read the inspired leaks there is something different in the content of the deal; it is watered down in scale, and despite all these leaks the Minister refuses point blank to allow a proper debate in this House on the merits of the case before a decision has been taken.  He has also made no effort to have the INPC appear before the Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  It is, as you well know, a Cheann Comhairle, purely a spurious reason that has been used by the INPC not to appear before that committee.</P>
    <P>That is not the way to make a decision that is so crucial to this country.  There are many worrying features about this deal that must have attention drawn to them.  We have for almost a year now dealt exclusively with the middlemen representing just Nigeria.  One country has had exclusive rights for almost a year, shutting out many other opportunities that could have been competitively cultivated alongside the Nigerian offer. Those opportunities have not been taken and I cannot understand why not.  We see reports that the Government have not yet sat down with the Nigerian Government, whose guarantees will, at the end of the day, be the only thing that will determine whether it is in the Irish interest or not. For our Government not to have sat down with the Nigerian Government is a major disappointment.  Indeed, if roles were reversed I do not think that this Government would be satisfied that the INPC were doing all the dealing and there was not straight across the table dealing with the Nigerian Government.</P>
    <P>There are many worrying aspects in <Col N="822" /> the deal itself, in so far as we can get any idea of what is on the table.  It appears that there is a long-term commitment by Ireland to buy oil from Nigeria, without any corresponding firm commitments by Nigeria on the operation of Whitegate or on delivering the product at a price that is at a level comparable with world trading prices.  If we have a long-term commitment to buy and do not have the commitments on the other side, this is a hazard for the Irish consumer, who is already paying far too much in this area.</P>
    <P>There are far too many question marks about this proposal and far too much is at stake for the Minister to continue to refuse to have a proper debate in the Dáil and to insist on not notifying the Dáil until everything has been signed, sealed and delivered.  That is a poor service to the public, whose resources are involved here and who will have to pay, in the form of oil prices, for the results of the deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I be given injury time?  I am not assuming anything but, one way or the other, it is on the cards that the Minister and the INPC are keen to see the involvement of some party overseas and if it is not the Nigerians, equally we need to have a clear statement of Government policy as to what it is that we want to get from such a deal.  Even if the Minister decides to reject this deal, a <Col N="823" /> debate in the Dáil during which he would spell out the parameters on which he is viewing such deals would be an enormous improvement on the present situation where we seem to be proceeding without a proper policy.  This deal seems to have persisted so long because of the connection of some of the principals involved to putting it together.  That is what frustrates me about it.</P>
      <P>I shall turn briefly to the nuclear area. The Minister has banged the table here and has told us how he is insisting on the British doing this and that, how he is insisting on new motions at the Paris Convention. The position is that we still have got the support of only one country at the Paris Convention and even if we are successful there, those decisions cannot bind.  The Minister has told us that he is taking legal action, but it transpires that that legal action concerns a French power station.  For too long he has been hiding behind the coat tails of the Attorney General, who is supposed to be examining the merits of this case.  It is time now to state clearly that he is or is not going to take an action against Britain.  I believe that there are adequate grounds for taking a case.  The British are clearly in breach of principles of international law in the way in which they are dumping carcinogenic waste into the Irish Sea and running reactors beyond their design life, with flawed safety controls and so forth. It is time for the Minister to give us a clear indication of what he intends.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I have to express disappointment that, more than two years after Chernobyl, we still have no fundamental change in the system at work here for protecting the Irish public.  We have seen promises of an emergency plan being put into a pilot operation, but no details.  We have seen no radiological protection institute legislation &mdash; there is mention that the heads of the Bill have been passed.  We have nothing solid enough to assure the public, who are concerned about nuclear safety, that we are better geared to meet the threat now than we were two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="824" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOMalley" hpid="Mr. P. O'Malley Mr. P. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have to accept that in Ireland we have very high energy costs which are certainly causing great problems in industry and are greatly affecting its competitiveness. Obviously, we must do very many things to ensure that we get our industrial costs down if we are to protect jobs here and be in a position to expand our industry.</P>
      <P>On the job situation, since 1980 we have lost about 40,000 manufacturing jobs, which represents about 18 per cent of total industrial employment.  These losses, to a very large extent, have been brought about by the uncompetitiveness of industry and, also to a very large extent, by the very high cost that we must pay for energy.  This is a very crucial factor in the whole industrial sector and, indeed, in the whole area of developing job opportunities.  A recent EC Bulletin on Energy Crisis shows that we pay here in Ireland in excess of £160 million, based on the equivalent consumption of oil, gas and electricity on an average basis in other EC member states each year.  This is a tax exclusive figure, so the high cost here cannot be blamed on the rates of duties and taxes that we impose on primary energy and energy products.  We depend on imports for approximately three-quarters of our primary energy needs and there is no doubt that we are vulnerable to price fluctuations on the world market.  However, this applies also to many of our European partners and they have managed to keep their costs down significantly below ours.</P>
      <P>The main energy cost factor here in Ireland relates undoubtedly to oil and oil products.  We spend in the order of £130 million over the EC average on oil and oil products for similar volumes that we consume here each year.  Again, this figure is a tax exclusive figure.  It just highlights the fact that here in Ireland we land energy products, particularly oil, at very high initial cost.  This cost handicap is unacceptable and must be reduced, particularly now in the lead-up to 1992, if we are to be able, as I said earlier, to protect existing jobs and have any hope of expanding our industrial base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the role of State energy <Col N="825" /> companies must be examined.  The question must be asked: Are they helping the situation or actually imposing a cost burden on the economy?  As oil is the main energy import and because we pay a very high price for it by comparison with other member states, it is very appropriate that we should look at the role of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and examine how effective they have been in keeping costs down.  The facts are that the 35 per cent off-take of refined products from Whitegate which are imposed on the major oil companies operating here, has resulted in oil-based fuels here being very costly.  The INPC can set their prices without reference to the spot market price and the other oil companies can then peg their prices a little below the INPC price, irrespective of whether this is competitive with what prevails on the world market.  In fact, it can be argued that this actually suits the oil companies, as they can claim that their price is below that of the INPC.  Even though they still have to take 35 per cent from INPC, they are getting a higher price for their own oil.</P>
    <P>I could ask the Minister if he considers that the INPC are actually helping the price structure here.  I pose the question whether he would consider that we would be better off without having the INPC operate in the way they are doing at the moment.  Certainly, we are not getting the benefit of reduced costs for oil on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>If the INPC claim that they are almost competitive with imported prices, they must accept that imported prices for refined products already have a built-in profit margin.  A more appropriate comparison would be the spot market prices. On average over the past five years, the INPC prices have been substantially dearer than spot market prices, on average about 12 per cent to 15 per cent dearer for oil products landed here.  This is a very serious cost handicap imposed on Irish energy users by the State through one of its own agencies.  I should like the Minister to address this and to tell me whether he considers the INPC function worthwhile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> One of the main reasons for the maintenance of the INPC is security of supply but that is a little disingenuous given that it is unlikely that crude oil would be readily available.  Refined products are very scarce and that is the answer to the security of supply, a point often made in defence of the INPC.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the Nigerian oil deal and to bemoan the lack of information.  I note that the Minister is unable to give us any particulars of this deal and that has been the position since this matter was first raised in the House. In principle, there are benefits and advantages to this country in entering into an arrangement with an oil producing country because it will have the effect of delivering oil to us more cheaply than we get it at present.  There are, of course, advantages to the oil producing country concerned because they will have their refined product available more cheaply to them on the main European markets. As we discussed this matter on a few occasions, the Minister will be aware &mdash; from the point of view certainly of the Progressive Democrats and perhaps other parties in the House &mdash; that the whole question of security of supply is very important.  I should like the Minister to outline what he considers is the important aspect of any deal done in relation to entering into such an arrangement with an oil producing country.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the House recently that he was now willing to consider offers from other countries.  That is an improvement on his original position.  He said he was prevented from doing that until the final terms had been submitted to him by the Nigerians.  However, as Deputy Richard Bruton pointed out, it is very important to negotiate with all oil producing countries and not to confine ourselves to one country, particularly when dealing with a country which has deep financial problems and which may not be able to fulfil commitments into which it entered.  In any such deal which the State enters into, it should have sufficient control to ensure that it has access to stored reserves and that it can opt to buy on the open market if there is a supply or price <Col N="827" /> advantage in doing so.  The State should also retain rights over the control of Whiddy and Whitegate facilities because they would be required in the event of a commercially viable offshore oil discovery, which as the Minister said, given the revised oil terms last September, is more likely now than before the terms were revised.  If we do not have a refining and storage capacity, in the event of an offshore discovery I presume we would have to send our crude oil overseas to be refined and that would not necessarily be very advantageous to us.</P>
    <P>Distribution costs of oil are very high in Ireland and I understand that the Nigerian proposal was that a pipeline would be built from Cork to Dublin to deliver refined products to Dublin. However, I am curious as to how you deliver and sell that product, given that the majority of retail outlets here are controlled by the oil majors and that the majority of the distributors are also tied to them.  There are very few independent operators in the Irish market.  What does the Minister suggest as a means of distribution in the event of an oil deal or a deal going through with some oil producing country?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to tell us what he considers the important factors in the event of this country entering into some arragement with an oil producing country. I reiterate what Deputy Richard Bruton said &mdash; I have said it myself in the House in relation to this matter &mdash; that it is very important that all the facts are discussed in the Dáil in relation to any proposed deal.  The Dáil should be given the opportunity to vote on it because it is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the question of radiation hazards associated with the British nuclear industry in general and the Sellafield reprocessing plant in particular.  This subject, as the previous speaker said, has been discussed on many occasions in the House since this Government came to power.  I raised it on many occasions and I have always been assured that the Government are taking all available steps to bring about the closure of <Col N="828" /> this plant, to ensure that there is no further expansion of the British nuclear industry and that the old, obsolete magnox reactors which have outlived their design life would be closed down.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister is keen to achieve results in this area but he must admit that all his efforts to date have failed.  I totally disagree with his statement that significant progress has been made on those matters.  No progress has been made, I would go so far as to say that, in relation to the Sellafield plant. The UK authorities have treated the representations of the Irish Government with contempt but it is the Government's duty to convince Britain that we have legitimate rights as far as their nuclear industry is concerned.  We must take appropriate action to convince them of this.  A motion was passed unanimously in this House in December 1986 calling for the closure of Sellafield but we are no nearer that objective now than we were when the motion was passed.  This is due to an over-reliance by the Government on political lobbying and putting the matter on the agenda at various international conventions.  The Paris Commission are meeting in Lisbon today and we have a motion down calling for the closure of Sellafield.  I hope we got more support this year than last year when only one delegation out of ten supported us. I know that the Minister, prior to the meeting of the Paris Commission, had been lobbying for support and I hope we increase it.  However, the main point is that we will not get 100 per cent support. That is obvious and, even if we did, it is not binding on anyone.  We must realise that raising the matter at international conventions and the like is primarily useful only in terms of highlighting our legitimate concern about these plants but it will not necessarily do anything to bring about their closure, which is the main objective of the House as encapsulated in the motion in 1986.</P>
    <P>The only realistic way &mdash; again I have said this on many occasions in the House &mdash; to bring about a result is to take legal action.  I have been calling for that since I came into the Dáil.  About five months <Col N="829" /> ago, the Minister agreed that this was probably the right course of action and he confirmed he had referred the matter to the Attorney General for him to review the legal options available to him and to make recommendations to the Government.  I understand that review has been completed.  I would presume that the review highlights options that I had outlined in this House almost a year ago, and would include taking action under Articles 37 and 38 of the Euratom Treaty.  I suggest we have the right to bring a case to the International Court of Justice in the Hague based on international legal precedents whereby one state is not allowed to cause damage to another state by actions taken within its jurisdiction.  We have not pursued our case.  The Minister keeps telling us that he has taken legal action, but in effect the Government have submitted their views on the Cattenon case to the court in Europe.  We are not parties to that action.  In my opinion the Cattenon case is less important in the sense that it poses less of a threat than the Sellafield plant. The Cattenon plant is not fully commissioned whereas Sellafield has been in existence and has been spewing radioactive waste into the Irish Sea for the past 30 years.  It has made it the most radioactive sea in the entire world.</P>
    <P>We should be making the running on this case.  Even though the Cattenon case may establish some useful legal precedents, I think it is not good enough that we did not make the running.  We should have made the running on a legal basis. I call on the Minister to stop expressing his wishes to see this plant closed down but to firmly get on and so something about it.  In my opinion we should initiate legal proceedings at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I will make the point briefly &mdash; Deputy Bruton has also referred to it.  The Minister in his speech has said that the earliest we can expect <Col N="830" /> the establishment of the national radiological protection institute will be next term.  I think one of the first undertakings that the Minister gave this House was that he would establish this very necessary body to monitor and to lay down an emergency plan for any radiation hazards that might arise in the future as a result of an accident.  I think it is very unsatisfactory that it has taken so long, and it is obviously going to take longer, to set up this body.</P>
      <P>I had other points which I wanted to raise but I know I will not be allowed do that, so I will refer briefly to the electricity and gas interconnectors.  I am glad that the question of interconnectors is being looked at in a fairly serious way. There are huge advantages if the electrical interconnector goes ahead.  I know there is a long lead-in time and there is a lot of planning to be done before it might become a reality, but when the Minister said in his speech that it would be 1995 before the ESB would be likely to require additional plant, it seemed to me extraordinary that that would be the case, given that the ESB have 75 per cent greater generating capacity than the peak demand at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on behalf of the Labour Party on the Estimates for the Department of Energy and Forestry. Whilst the financial parameters of the Department of Energy are small in numerical terms, nevertheless the Department of Energy is of major importance because of its broad range of responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I think the role that the Department of Energy could play in the context of national recovery is not fully exploited, or indeed appreciated.  Energy policy has a major relationships to an economic plan.  I agree with Deputy Bruton when he bemoans the absence of any real energy policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to comment on the low level of offshore oil exploration taking place.  As the House is aware, the Labour Party objected very strenuously to the give-away policy on offshore <Col N="831" /> exploration launched by the Minister last year.  We predicted at the time that there would not be an upsurge in exploration because of the general worldwide climate in relation to exploration.  Nevertheless, the Minister decided on a course of action which as far as we are concerned will cause major revenue losses to the State in the event of a commercial oil discovery. The limited interest in the Minister's speech today proves that very point.  Major losses of revenue will occur in the years ahead as a result of that decision.  I would also like to comment on the possibility of a major agreement being signed with a foreign government on the future use of the Whiddy and Whitegate oil refineries.  The Labour Party welcome any initiative which would lead to a regular guaranteed source of crude oil for this country's needs and which would also lead to a reduction in the consumer oil price.  While welcoming the benefits of any possible agreement, we would have to point out also the dangers that would be inherent in the type of agreement that has been rumoured and written about in the press in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>If an agreement is to be concluded, I urge the Minister not to give the control of Whiddy and Whitegate to a foreign government.  We would have no objection to a joint venture which would benefit the third party together with the Irish people, but it would be a sad day and a bad day, and in economic terms a very unwise move, to allow the controlling interest in the Irish oil industry to go out of Irish hands.</P>
    <P>I trust that in due course the Minister will put the terms of the agreement before the House before he concludes an international agreement.  I think it is extremely important that we are not presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and that the terms of any such agreement should be discussed and agreed by this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on the Minister's other responsibilities.  I would like to comment briefly on Bord na Móna and the ESB.  There is no doubt that Bord na Móna will face major problems in the <Col N="832" /> coming years.  The life of many of the bogs in the midlands is coming to an end.  Obviously the company will have to diversify.  Bord na Móna have served this country well for the past 40 years and at this juncture the Minister should be adopting a positive attitude to the company. He should be encouraging the company to diversify and to look for a new product lines.  Unless the company are actively pursuing diversification, I believe their future will be put a shadow of their great and proud past.  The Labour Party are very concerned about what will happen to the economic life of the midlands when the bogs are fully used up. Both Bord na Móna and the ESB are major employers in the area and are a major component of the economic life of the midlands.  Obviously at the expiry of the bogs there will be a major question mark over the peat-fired power stations in the midlands.  This can only lead to massive disemployment in the area, an area that has already been hard hit.  The Government have recognised recently that this area is in need of economic activity and assistance.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to set up without further delay an inter-departmental committee comprising the Department of Industry and Commerce, Energy, Agriculture and Food and Labour, who would consult with the county development officers of the local authorities in the area.  They should look at the medium-term consequences of the downgrading of these plants in the midlands and set out a strategy that will guarantee that economic activity will continue in the area.  I would like to spell out very clearly that otherwise in five to ten years it will be too late to do anything for the residents and workers of the midlands.  We have been particularly bad at economic planning, at making alternative plans, when many of us have envisaged what will happen in the years ahead.  I would urge the Minister to set up the inter-departmental committee for which I have called, to examine the problems that will occur, setting out a strategy to overcome them.  However, we will not be able to <Col N="833" /> devise that strategy overnight.  If we wait until the Bord Na Móna plants and the peat-fired stations are closed down it will be too late, when there will be thousands of men and women in the revelant areas joining the dole queues or embarking on the emigrant ships.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State has yet to contribute to this debate.  I am glad to note there has been some initiative to increase planting and to streamline the forestry industry generally. Comparing our forestry industry with that of countries such as Sweden, Norway, and in particular Finland, it will be seen that we have not yet developed a plan for the total utilisation of our resources.  It is my belief that the position outlined by the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry has many inherent shortcomings.  Perhaps the Minister will outline today how he envisges the long-term devlopment of our forestry taking place.</P>
    <P>We must ensure maximum plantation, that management of our forestries is of the highest calibre so that we prepare the ground also for a mature, developed downstream industry.  In the past we have not achieved anything like the added value we should in this industry.  We should admit our mistakes openly and examine the experience and knowledge to be gained from the Nordic countries where there has been comprehensive economic planning in relation to the development of forestry and timber industries generally.  We should ensure that we become not alone self-sufficient in timber requirements but that we also export many timber products.  The world scene is very clear in relation to declining timber stocks.  It is anticipted that in 20 years time there will be massive demand for good quality timber products which we should be capable of producing.  The potential of the industry is enormous.  We must ensure that we plan economically and have a strategy in relation to the industry generally.  Otherwise we shall have missed the boat as we did in many other areas of economic activity in the past.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not <Col N="834" /> dealt in any detail with mineral development particularly in relation to the long outstanding problem of the development of the Leinster coalfields.  I hope the Minister will comment on this when replying.  I know he has met deputations from the various unions and others representing the miners in those areas who have explained to him the potential for economic activity and, above all, worthwhile employment.  I am aware of the many problems encountered in this area in the past and of the many abortive attempts to have something done about them.  The State must play a greater part in making the necessary wherewithal available to enable people at present in the dole queues who would be most anxious to work in the viable coalmines in these areas an opportunity to do so. Those people want to work and are confident they can produce coal at an economic cost.  I would ask the Minister to actively pursue this matter.  Resolution of the problem would take many hundreds of people off the dole queues in the areas of north Kilkenny, north Carlow and south Laois.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to the nuclear threat and the dangers of radiation.  We lag behind many other countries in taking action on this matter.  The Minister has much to say about it, receiving much media publicity.  However, the end result is that we are no better off or protected than we were some years ago.  Indeed, I was the only Member of this House to raise questions on those dangers back in 1979 and 1980.  As a Member of the European Parliament in 1982 I was the only Irish Member at the time who questioned the Commission and Council on the matter when there were snide remarks on the part of the British Members of the European Parliament, claiming that I was raising false alarms.  At that time the media took no interest in the matter either.  Indeed one tended to be regarded as some kind of crank.  Neither those in power or the media paid any attention to the potential dangers.  Sadly, events have overtaken us and proved me to have been right.  Had those who raised questions in those days received more recognition we <Col N="835" /> might not now be as close to potential disaster.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to maintain pressure in this regard because he has achieved nothing to date and must show some progress in the immediate future. In this respect any help my party can give him will be readily forthcoming, as it was nearly ten years go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking the Minister himself for his complimentary remarks.  I should like to be associated with his remarks in relation to the staff in the Forestry Service who have pursued an expansionary programme in a full-blooded way despite the difficult financial constraints on them.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a new forestry company which will be operational at an early date is the most exciting development in the forestry area this year.  The new company will have great tasks and opportunities.  Essentially, it will be responsible for operating the State forestry programme and, to this end, the State's forestry estate will be transferred to it.  A lot of money and work has been invested in the development of this estate over the years.  Thus, the company will have the opportunity of building further on the labour of past generations in order to fully exploit this asset in the interest of generations to come.</P>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta will also face major tasks.  Primarily it will have the task of conducting its business efficiently and effectively and in accordance with strict commercial criteria.  It is only in this way that we can achieve an acceptable return on past forestry investment and generate substantial profitability in the future.  We intend to monitor very carefully the performance of Coillte to ensure that it fulfils our high hopes of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the long term nature of forestry investment, and the present development of our forestry estate, it is clear that Coillte Teoranta will not immediately be in a break even position on its operations. However, a very hard look will be taken <Col N="836" /> at Coillte Teoranta's financial performance. Although Exchequer funding will be required in the initial years, the company will be expected to make substantial radical changes to ensure that it stands on its own feet at the earliest possible date.  To that end, we expect the company to operate at optimum efficiency, to maximise their resources, and to maintain operational costs at minimum appropriate levels.  Like my colleague, the Minister for Energy, I am confident that Coillte Teoranta will respond to these tasks and will be an organisation of which we all can be proud.</P>
    <P>Already the production from the Forest Service can sustain indigenous wood industries with potential and capacity for growth in jobs, import substitution and exports.  Sales of roundwood in 1988 are expected to reach 1.4 million cubic metres and income from these sales in 1988 is projected to amount to £20 million.  Although this compares favourably with the figure just five years ago of £9 million, there is still a gap of £31 million between total income and expenditure in 1988.  The company will be expected to sustain and build on the growth in income which has been realised in the past and to eliminate the shortfall in the shortest possible period.  In this regard output from State forests will continue to rise significantly in future years, reaching 2 million cubic metres by 1993 and 3 million cubic metres by end of the century.</P>
    <P>The market price for this timber rose steadily in 1987 and this trend has been maintained in the early part of 1988.  The price of imported sawnwood also increased during this period although occasionally consignments became available at keen prices.  It must again be stressed that there is no economic or technical reason why well-sawn, dried, graded and finished Irish sawnwood should command a lower price than imported timber.  This has increasingly been accepted by the domestic construction market in recent years, where Irish timber constitutes 50 per cent of the market compared with less than 15 per cent in 1980.  Indeed it should be possible <Col N="837" /> to supply the bulk of the industry's needs from domestic supplies within the next few years.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the new company, Coillte Teoranta will face major tasks in ensuring maximum returns from the State's investment in forestry but I must stress that the Forest Service has not been awaiting the establishment of the company to improve its effectiveness. Over the past few years a number of alternative sales and marketing strategies have been developed.</P>
    <P>While the primary method of sale continues to be the sealed tender system, alternative methods which enable the Forest Service to adopt a more flexible approach have been developed.  These include auctions, two of which have been successfully held in 1988 with another planned for later in the year; a quota scheme which guarantees a proportion of their supplies to eligible sawmills; and short term contracts for three years duration for specified volumes.  Advance information on supplies of roundwood has also been improved and a forecast of production, nationally and by county, from 1988 to 1997 has recently been made available to the trade.</P>
    <P>My objective in these various initiatives, and it will also be the objective of Coilte Teoranta, is to generate the maximum revenue from our sales so that the people of Ireland will soon get a financial return on the vast amounts of their money which we have invested in forestry.</P>
    <P>The result of these initiatives and the efforts made by the Forest Service to encourage improved standards of efficiency and production in the industry through close contact with the major sawmills and pulpwood processors has been most encouraging, not just in terms of receipts but from the increased confidence which is evident throughout the industry.  Having made very significant strides towards dominating the home market, Irish timber firms are now aiming at the European market.</P>
    <P>While sales of sawlog and pulpwood continue to be the principal revenue earners, profitable outlets have also been developed for other produce such as <Col N="838" /> transmission poles, decorative foliage, picnic furniture and firewood.</P>
    <P>The advance sale of immature nonamenity forest crops was another new development introduced in 1987.  Forest crops of varying characteristics covering species, location, elevation, productivity and age were offered for sale.  The land was not included initially but was offered with the second round of sales.  A target of £3 million was set but, for a number of reasons, a sufficient number of acceptable tenders were not received and those accepted amounted to just short of £400,000.  As I said at the time, I am not prepared to sell these forests unless realistic prices, which reflect their true market value are received.  Nevertheless the response was encouraging on the lots sold.  Lots will again be offered this year and the Estimate includes £3 million appropriations-in-aid in respect of such sales.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Estimate includes provision for continuing the research programme on Irish timber which the Forest Service has conducted directly and through EOLAS.  The result of part of this research work was the making of an Irish Standard recommendaton SR 11-1988 on &ldquo;Structural Timber for Domestic Construction&rdquo; which introduces for the first time in this country a strength classification system, including permissible design stresses, for all structural softwood timbers.  This new Irish standard recommendation now forms an integral part of the building regulations ensuring that only timber meeting this new standard may be used by the Irish construction industry.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Government have actively promoted the expansion of forestry through increased planting in both the State and private sectors.  Last year the State planted 8,000 hectares and this combined with private planting of 3,200 hectares gave a record national planting level of over 11,000 hectares, a level never previously achieved in the history of the State.  An even more ambitious programme is expected to be achieved this year.</P>
    <P>As you have heard, the target for 1988 <Col N="839" /> for State planting was increased to 10,000 hectares and this has in effect been achieved at this stage with 9,500 hectares already planted by the end of May.  Of the total area, 1,000 hectares will be planted on areas of cutaway bog leased from Bord na Móna.  The planting programme has been increased by 42 per cent over the last two years and, at the same time, the direct cost of planting each hectare has been reduced by 10 per cent through greater productivity within the Forest Service.</P>
    <P>The Forest Service has also planted over 500 acres of broadleaved species, mainly oak, ash and birch, during the year in areas where the land has been of sufficiently high quality.  On the subject of broadleaves, I would like to mention that the Forest Service is maximising the availability of ash supplies for hurley manufacture.  I was pleased to be associated with Dublin's Millennium celebrations through the supply of timber used in the construction of a full-sized replica of a Viking longship by the East Wall Community Development Co-operative.</P>
    <P>While the Government are pressing ahead with the expansion of State forestry, they are also taking positive steps to secure a sizeable expansion of the private forestry sector.  A key element of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is to encourage investment in private forestry and with this aim existing grants have been improved and new schemes introduced.</P>
    <P>Last year the grants available under the State private planting grant scheme were increased to £500 per hectare for conifers and £800 per hectare for broadleaves. These grants continue to operate this year.</P>
    <P>The western package forestry grants scheme is also undergoing change at present.  The scheme covers an area of about 3.6 million hectares spread over 11 western counties and the western parts of Cork and Limerick.  The scheme will be extended to all disadvantaged areas in the country when a revised programme, which has been drawn up following a <Col N="840" /> recent Council of Ministers decision, has been approved by the European Commission. This extension will benefit an additional 500,000 hectares of land.  The scope of the scheme is also being extended to include all agricultural lands. Up to now only marginal agricultural lands were eligible for grant assistance.</P>
    <P>Under the western package scheme, farmers qualify for afforestation grants of 85 per cent of costs and non-farmers qualify for 70 per cent of costs subject to a limit of £800 per hectare.  Grants of up to £12 per metre for the construction or reconstruction of forest roads are also available.  In the past these grants were financed equally by the State and the EC. However, 70 per cent of the cost of these grants will be recouped from the EC with effect from 1 January 1988.  This welcome development will reduce substantially the cost of the grants to the Exchequer and will enable the maintenance of a large private planting programme at a low cost to the State.</P>
    <P>Two new EC-assisted forestry schemes for farmers were launched recently and these improve further the incentives available to encourage private forestry. One of these provides the following grants for full time farmers and farmer co-operatives: up to £550 per hectare for planting conifers; up to £850 per hectare for planting broadleaves; up to £8 per metre for forest roads; up to £35 per hectare for the provision of firebreaks and waterpoints in forests.</P>
    <P>While farmers in the west of Ireland are encouraged to invest in forestry through the forestry elements of the western package, this new scheme will encourage the development of farm forestry in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The second incentive launched recently will allow farmers, who are in receipt of headage payments in respect of livestock, to continue to receive those payments for 15 years if they afforest part or all of their land.  The availability of compensatory payments during the first 15 years of a plantation's life &mdash; a period during which it is producing no income but is generating costs &mdash; should encourage more farmers to invest in forestry. <Col N="841" /> With an annual income to look forward to, farmers will, hopefully, become much more interested in forestry as a farm enterprise.  The allowances will be paid by the Department of Agriculture and Food and are provided for in that Department's Vote.</P>
    <P>The amount provided for private afforestation purposes in the 1988 Estimates will cover the afforestation of some 3,350 hectares of land and the construction or reconstruction of about 5,500 metres of forest roads.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grant schemes and in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> I initiated a major drive to increase substantially the level of EC funding for forestry. I have held discussions with the main EC institutions to explore the possibilities of increasing aid for Irish forestry. I visted Commissioners Andriesen, Sutherland and Schmid Huber and the European Investment Bank to put forward Ireland's case in the matter.</P>
    <P>The concrete results to date of the initiative I have taken are more than satisfactory.  They include: a major improvement in the level of EC funding for Irish forestry with the approval of £8.1 million in grants for forestry roads from the regional fund in January 1988; £27.8 million of loans for general forestry development approved by the European Investment Bank.  It is my intention to maintain and strengthen the contacts with the EC that have proved so fruitful to date.  In this regard Commissioner Andriesen has accepted my invitation to visit Ireland this July to discuss the development of Irish forestry in the EC context.</P>
    <P>The decision to double the structural funds for less developed parts of Europe by 1992 also provides opportunities in this connection as it is clear that the advantage of forestry in its Irish and overall European dimensions should place it very high on the list of economic activities deserving of priority assistance from the enlarged funds.  Europe's position in relation to timber supplies, the suitability of the Irish climate for the growing of <Col N="842" /> trees, the close relationship between forestry and recent developments in the CAP, the economic returns to be procured from properly managed forestry in Ireland, its employment potential in the nurseries and forests and in downstream manufacturing activities, all of these factors will be emphasised by me in the various exchanges, internal and external, which are due to take place in the process of girding ourselves to make the maximum use of the increased Community funds.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty in reviewing the two Estimates before us, Forestry and Energy.  My favourite would be forestry on which I have spoken on a number of occasions in the past.  I have a great interest in forestry, particularly at this time, because as the Minister has said the development of the new company opens up great possibilities.  I am glad the Minister has succeeded in getting out of the old constriction of the tender system and is using more flexible methods of sales.  However, I would like to dwell on the issue of downstream industries in the processing area and the possibility of encouraging joint ventures to get into various hardwoods, plywoods and papermills so that the whole area of forestry will be used for job creation.  I hope the Minister will try to encourage whatever joint ventures are necessary to ensure that these processing industries are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This evening I have elected to use my 15 minutes to deal with three items relevant to the Department of Energy: the oil deal, Bord na Móna and the scandal in the mining and minerals area, particularly Tara Mines.  I agree with many of the points made by previous speakers regarding the little knowledge we have of the proposals on the oil deals which have been discussed over the past six months.  I spoke on this matter last January and made the point &mdash; which I think the last two speakers agreed with &mdash; that whatever arrangements, deals or joint ventures are entered into, both the Whitegate refinery and the Whiddy Island storage terminal should be retained in <Col N="843" /> State hands and should be under public ownership both for strategic and economic reasons.  I do not know what stage the negotiations have reached at present. As far as I understood, the negotiations which were under way were in terms of giving away these two facilities.  Under this deal the Whiddy Island storage terminal and the Whitegate refinery would go into the hands of the Nigerian Government. I was given to understand, some six months ago, that Ecuador had some deal, the extent or the meaning of which I do not know, but one of the points of their suggested arrangement was that both would remain under Irish public ownership.</P>
    <P>We, in The Workers' Party, have consistently advocated the construction of a modern oil refinery which would use the most up-to-date steam cracking technology. It is obvious that we need to double our refining capacity for our own use because the shipping over long distances of crude oil can be done economically whereas the shipping of light oils such as petrol is much more costly.  To ensure that we would have a refining capacity on our national territory for all our oil and, also for the reasons given by Deputy Pat O'Malley in the event of the possibility of offshore finds it is essential that we retain the refinery.  The extent to which any possible deal with other countries would help us to move towards this objective would be a crucial factor in determining the viability of the deal.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to deal with relates to Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna are reaching a crucial point at this stage. I know the Minister has the structure and the financial arrangements and everything in Bord na Móna under review.  I hope he will not take the view that Bord na Móna are now running down in their potential capacity and that over the next ten, 15 or 20 years they will be running out of turf and that a winding down operation will be thought of to the extent that they will be wound up like Irish Shipping in ten or 15 years' time.  I hope the Minister will look at Bord na Móna in a totally different fashion because of the amount <Col N="844" /> of land which is becoming available to them as the peat development is completed. An area totalling the size of County Louth will be available by the end of the century or early in the new century.  The potential of this for development and expansion should be looked at and the possibilities of use including horticulture, biomass, conventional forestry, grassland, amenity use and job creation in this area should be considered and the type of development that is necessary to retain the jobs of the Bord na Móna workers who are highly skilled and dedicated people and also of the ESB workers in the turf burning stations who depend on peat for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>In that context it is vital that the Minister should make an early decision on who should have responsibility for the development of the cutaway bogs so that the necessary planning can begin.  Bord na Móna have been doing many experiments and, to date, they do not know whether it will be taken from them. Already, this new company which the Minister of State has referred to in the forestry area has taken an area of land from Bord na Móna for forestry.  Many farmers in the midlands in the IFA are looking for the land to be given back to the farmers by Bord na Móna.  This would be a disastrous piecemeal breakup of Bord na Móna land because one factor in regard to it is that it is absolutely essential that this land have a centralised drainage system, otherwise the whole thing would revert to an unusable wet area.  Therefore, it is essential that it is kept in centralised control and Bord na Móna should be told whether they are going to have control over the development of the cutaway bog so they can plan for the use to which they will put different parts of it and can project the employment potential in the various uses and the economics of the use.  We are talking about 5,700 permanent employees in 1984-85 and 1,100 seasonal workers, a huge workforce. It is essential that the Minister deal with that.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with what I call the scandal of Tara Mines.  About £600 million worth of raw ore has been exported <Col N="845" /> by Tara Mines in a nine year period and they never paid one penny in royalties and only a paltry couple of hundred thousand pounds in corporation tax in that period.  I have raised this issue nine times since 1984 with the Ministers responsible and I am giving the Ministers' replies. On 12 June 1984, Minister for Energy Deputy Spring said: &ldquo;... no royalty payments have been made as yet by the company.&rdquo;  On 22 January 1985 the Minister Deputy Spring said:</P>
    <P>... no royalty payments have been made as yet... Having regard to that situation, consideration is being given to the question of what action might be taken in regard to the possible liability of the company for royalty.</P>
    <P>On 11 June 1985 the Minister of State Deputy Eddie Collins, said &ldquo;The profits of the company for tax purposes since the commencement of trading have not yet been agreed ... and consequently no payment of royalty has been made.&rdquo;  On 31 October 1985 the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>... in correspondence with the company ... a number of complex questions are being actively addressed, ... arbitration proceedings may prove necessary ... the State's rights in the matter will be fully enforced.</P>
    <P>On 5 February 1986 the Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, said: &ldquo;The matters at issue involve a number of complex points and, whilst progress is being made towards their resolution, it is not possible to say precisely when they will be resolved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 26 November 1986 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>These profits have not yet been agreed with the Revenue Commissioners ... my Department is not in a position to demand payment of royalties ... nor indeed to estimate with any accuracy the company's liability for royalty payments.</P>
    <P>On 27 May 1987, in a new Government, a new Minister Deputy Ray Burke, said: &ldquo;... procedures are now in train to refer <Col N="846" /> the matter to an arbitrator.&rdquo;  I thought that was wonderful and the new Minister was making progress, but on 3 March 1988, almost a year later, the Minister was saying:</P>
    <P>The matter has not yet been referred to the arbitrator, however, because certain preparatory aspects require attention including finalisation of consultations with legal advisers.  Agreement has been reached on the selection of an arbitrator.</P>
    <P>On 1 June this year the Minister, Deputy Burke, was still saying &ldquo;Agreement has been reached between my Department and Tara Mines Ltd. on the selection of an eminent senior counsel as arbitrator but the counsel in question has not yet been approached with a view to his appointment pending finalisation of the aspects to which I referred.&rdquo;&ldquo;The aspects to which I referred&rdquo; were precisely the same aspects as the Minister, Deputy Spring, referred to in 1984.  No progress whatsoever has been made in the payment of royalties by this company who have paid only £300,000 in taxes in nine years, an average of £30,000 a year.</P>
    <P>This is an absolute scandal when you consider the fact that they are exporting our raw ore to various smelters overseas and this vital part of our natural resources can be used for job creation by the building of a smelter here at home.  This was considered some years back by the Government with reference to the job creation potential of such a smelter and the IDA drew up plans for a smelter in the mid-seventies.  A feasibility study was done, land was purchased at Ballylongford and now, today, while we are still exporting 350,000 tonnes of raw ore every year and while new finds are being made, Bula has not yet even been touched and that land in Ballylongford is now being sold with the result that this Government are not even thinking in terms of the use of our natural resources for job creation.  It is a scandal that lead and zinc could be used for the manufacture of parts for washing machines, cookers, refrigerators, cars and so on and create thousands of jobs here and the <Col N="847" /> huge development of an engineering industry, instead of our ore being exported in the raw state and not even a penny in royalties being received.  I ask the Minister to look at this company again.  If we cannot get a penny in royalties out of Tara Mines in ten years why are we talking with the oil companies around our shores and making deals with them?  They will not pay us a penny either.  Why not give the lot away?  That is the attitude being adopted with Tara Mines and if oil companies see us letting them away with that, they are not going to pay us a penny in royalties either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Since the appointment of the Minister and the Minister of State this Department has been unduly active in the legislation field and has kept the Opposition on our toes with the production of legislation for RTE, the Radio Bill and forestry.  I have to commend the Minister and the Minister of State for the work they have done in that area.  I would like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the Department of Forestry who have served the State well in their time, and generally are going to lose their greater clout now.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Minister were on this side of the House and he was debating an Estimate for Energy, Communications and Forestry, he would point out the deficiencies that had been experienced by this country in the administration over a period.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he was most vocal about the nuclear threat and early warning systems and why the weak Minister on the other side could do nothing about the problems that were arising from Sellafield and other plants in the UK.  He urged that we go into litigation against the British.  Certainly the general public would be led to believe that when Fianna Fáil would come to power one of the first things they would do was take on the British about this nuclear threat from Sellafield and see about a satisfactory early warning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> Since we arrived on this side of the House we have been continually asking the Minister what he is doing and every year he tells us he is going to the Paris Commission.  I am not impressed by his trips to the Paris Commission because they have produced nothing.  If the Minister is serious about Sellafield and the nuclear threat he must take Britain to court.  It is no use being a sideline partner in a case on the Continent and then coming in here and telling us that he has taken a major step, that he is going to support evidence in a European court case.  If there are more leaks from Sellafield, if there is a nuclear explosion, we will not have taken the necessary steps and the people in the UK will not be too concerned about what happens to us here.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister fairly well and I wonder what is holding him back.  I do not understand why he is not going in there and why he has not taken on the Attorney General.  If the Taoiseach is holding him back why does he not tell the Taoiseach that this is a very important matter even for his constituency?  After all, it is quite near to Sellafield; it is on the coast.  A great deal of employment in that constituency is generated from the sea that flows by Sellafield.  The Minister will get support from this side of the House if he decides to take legal action against the British Government over the continuous pollution of the Irish Sea.  I accept that his task will be difficult but he should make a firm declaration that he intends taking such action.  That would satisfy the people.  It is time something was done about that menace.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that it took some time to decide to establish a State company to take over responsibility for our forests.  That did not happen overnight. The then Minister, former Deputy Paddy O'Toole established a review group, at the request of the unions to consider the future of our forests.  That group, consisting of Department officials and the unions, produced an excellent report and as a result a decision was made to establish Coillte Teoranta.  If plans can be prepared to eliminate difficulties in <Col N="849" /> regard to forestry, I wonder why it is not possible to prepare plans to at long last take on the might of Britain over the nuclear hazard at Sellafield.  We should do everything possible to eliminate it. The Minister is capable of tackling that problem but I want him to confirm he will be taking positive action.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stressed the importance of the economy being fit, of industry being fit, of the public service being fit and of the Government being fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>And of how important it was that the Opposition should be fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I hope that during the long summer we will have an opportunity to get fitter.  The Department of Energy play a major part in the economy. It is important that we should prepare for the internal market in 1992 and in that regard we should do something about the high charges for energy and communications imposed by State companies under the aegis of the Departments of Energy and Communications.  Opposition Deputies have highlighted the need to reduce ESB and telephone charges.  I was disappointed at the decision of the Minister to abolish the users' council and to reject a Bill tabled by Deputy Richard Bruton which sought to introduce consumer control.</P>
      <P>The ESB produce glossy brochures about their services and tell their consumers how they have succeeded in reducing charges in recent years but that does not impress people.  I do not think consumers read those brochures but they would respond if there was an announcement on RTE, or by the Minister in the House to the effect that the domestic charge for electricity was being reduced. If the company contend that prices have been reduced the Minister should make an announcement in the House to that effect so that Opposition Members could question such a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Energy costs will have to be reduced if our industries are to be competitive.  We are not preparing for the internal market in 1992.  I hope the Minister, by rejecting Deputy Bruton's Bill and abolishing the users' council, is not permitting the ESB, and other State agencies, to retain existing charges.  He should encourage them <Col N="850" /> to reduce charges so that industries can compete in the internal market.  The only way we can guarantee our jobs will be if our industries are competitive.  We will have to reduce charges to industry if we are to hold existing jobs.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy may be energetic but they will have to deal with the problems that will arise in the labour intensive industries between now and 1992.  Members will be aware that our textile industries failed because of the huge cost of energy.  That labour intensive industry has been wiped out.  I accept that cheap labour in Asia was another factor but those industries were not able to compete in the UK or on the Continent because of our energy costs.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister producing an enlightened programme to reduce energy and telecommunications costs.  Now that the Department is being slimmed down due to the establishment of Coillte Teoranta, officials will have more time to deal with those charges.  I was pleased to learn from the Minister of State that the amount of tree planting is increasing.  That was the objective from the seventies onwards.  I would have been happy if the Minister had acknowledged the input of the previous Government in regard to forestry.  The plans to improve our forests were not prepared by the Fianna Fáil Government, they were prepared by the Coalition Government who also allocated grants.</P>
    <P>It is important that we encourage the private sector to get involved in tree-planting. I hope the new company will confine their activities to taking up the slack in the area designated under the western package.  I am conscious of the fact that that was a privilege given to the Department of Forestry and that it was not in keeping with EC rules.  There should be greater emphasis on getting farmers to plant more trees.  On 1 June last, in the course of a parliamentary question, I asked the Minister to outline the prospects for forestry.  While there was a strong emphasis on the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Forestry Bill, I was disappointed that no emphasis was placed on farmer involvement.  These people should be encouraged to take up more grants.  The Minister referred to grants amounting to <Col N="851" /> 85 per cent of costs but I do not think it has been highlighted enough publicly. Perhaps the Department of Forestry could consider that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am almost finished.  We should not concentrate on forestry in the western package area alone.  I would ask the Minister to renew his contacts at the Council of Ministers so that other areas of the country which do not benefit from forestry grants under the Western Package will be included in any new policy document which the EC may produce. Agricultural Structures Regulations 797/85 should include grants for downstream industry so that timber would be treated in the same way as any other product.  If meat companies can get Structural Fund grants why can the timber industry not get similar grants?</P>

      <P>I would like in the short time available to me to thank the Members of the House who have contributed to this debate on energy and forestry.  I have very little time and it will not be possible for me to reply to all the contributions.  However, I assure Deputies I have taken note of the points made and will take them into consideration in the decisions of the Department in the period ahead.  I thank the Deputies for their words of encouragement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will start with the final speaker.  At the beginning of his speech he was very complimentary to the Minister of State and myself in our efforts in the Department. <Col N="852" /> It is a pity he changed as the speech went on.  I am very grateful to him for his expressions of encouragement and his support for the efforts we have been making.  The Deputy then dealt with the nuclear threat, Sellafield and various other issues relating to the British nuclear industry.  This was the theme of most of the speakers in the debate this evening. I would like to put the record straight.</P>
    <P>I do not like to refer back to the record of my predecessors in relation to this issue but it was brought forward by Deputy Carey.  For the information of Members who were not here up to the last general election, in the four years of the previous Administration, and particularly in the last year, on three occasions we had Private Members' debates calling on the British administration to close Sellafield.  It was only on the third occasion, near the dying hours of the previous Administration in December 1986, in their last couple of weeks in this House before the general election, that they agreed to a united call on the British Government from Dáil Éireann to close Sellafield. Deputy Carey, who contributed to this debate tonight, trooped through those lobbies on the other two occasions and rejected that simple call.  He then comes into this House and lectures me and the Government on the fact that we should be taking immediate court action&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;against the British administration, not that it should be done now but that it should have been done yesterday or the day before.  This Government since coming to office have given a very high priority to the threat from the nuclear issue.  We have lobbied continuously at national and international level.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have lobbied in relation to the closure of Sellafield and the Trawsfynydd experiment and we were successful in that case.  A very dangerous experiment was to take place at the old magnox reactor in Trawsfynydd but due to the pressure from this Government, and an awareness in the areas surrounding <Col N="853" /> Trawsfynydd and the pressure from there that dangerous experiment was postponed.</P>
      <P>Through our efforts and co-operation with our friends in the Isle of Man we have brought a greater awareness in the UK of the dangers of the old magnox reactors, to such an extent that they are now the subject of very detailed public debate about their future, and in particular in the period as they go into the private sector.  There is an ongoing debate, resulting from all the lobbying we have done at political level, about the future of the nuclear industry in Britain. It has been the subject of a number of television programmes even in the past month or six weeks.  I have no doubt that the continuing lobbying will pay off.</P>

      <P>We have also been very much involved, not as passive observers but actually involved, in a court case, the Cattenom case, which had major implications in relation to the involvement of the European Commission and how the Commission should meet its obligations under the EURATOM Treaty in relation to the question of having an independent health and safety inspectorate at EC level rather than depending on the national inspectorate which exists at present in each individual country.</P>
      <P>The whole question of legal action has been the subject of consideration by the Attorney General at the request of the Government and that consideration is proceeding.  Much progress has been made but much remains to be done.  The British Government have been committed to a nuclear policy for many reasons one of which resulted from the 1973 coalminers' strike when they found themselves in a situation that they had no alternative energy supply.  Following that period the Conservative Government, when they came to office, were very strongly in favour of a nuclear policy. However, as this area is being privatised in Britain there will be a change in thinking. I do not believe that private industry will be able to afford the costs involved in the public hearings in relation to future investments in nuclear plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The worldwide trend is against nuclear <Col N="854" /> plants.  Major changes are taking place in relation to decisions by Governments to alter their nuclear policies not only in Europe but also in America where there had been a very thriving nuclear industry. In that country many plants which had been built are not now in operation: some of the plants were never allowed to go into operation.  In discussions which I had with the regulatory authorities in the US in January last it was made quite clear that no new plants would be built or even planned there until well into the next century, if at all.</P>
    <P>I regret I do not have time to respond to the other issues that have been raised but I have taken note of them and I assure the Deputies I will give them consideration, as I have promised.  I will report to the House at Question Time on occasions throughout the year in relation to progress on the various items.  That is as much as time allows me to cover at this stage.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy John Bruton, following the publication of the White Paper on Industry gave his blessing to the establishment of the National Software Centre by the IDA.  That was a very progressive and far-seeing move.  He recognised that there was tremendous development potential in the software industry and that there was great opportunity for employment creation around the country given that we have a very well educated computer-literate young population.</P>
      <P>Since then, the National Software Centre have been operating very successfully and effectively and have been giving entrepreneurs technical advice in setting up companies, directing overseas sales, assisting them in raising venture capital and in business planning.  The National Software Centre also have been involved in market research and in the general overseas marketing of the national software industry and they have been doing a very good job.  So successful have they been that in recent times that their development and expansion have been in excess of 70 per cent.  That compares very favourably with the minimal expansion in other areas of industry.  Evidently this is the one area where there is tremendous potential.</P>
      <P>The question now arises, why did the Government give the IDA their blessing to close the National Software Centre. On 31 May 1988 in reply to a question by Deputy Bruton, the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, said it was based on a number of criteria including the view that the income of the centre would not be sufficient to sustain their operation.  This is a very weak and unsustainable argument. The Minister did not give any other criteria for closing down the centre.  In England when the National Computer Centre was set up, it took them 13 years to become self-sufficient.  Our National Software Centre have been assisting industries employing fewer than 15 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure you, a Cheann Comhairle, will appreciate that many of these companies would not be in a position to pay major commercial fees, whereas the centre in England was getting very high fees from Ford's and other large companies. Again I ask, why did the Government <Col N="856" /> take this decision?  On 31 May the Minister said he was ensuring that the IDA and CTT would be available to firms to fill any gaps that could arise as a result of the closure.  The IDA are a development agency and have no technical expertise; CTT are not involved in overseas selling of software and do not have personnel who are specialised in that area, and they also handle the electronic sector.</P>
    <P>Effectively, the National Software Centre were working a trading house.  An interesting feature has developed, and this is a matter the House must treat very seriously.  A private company was formed recently &mdash; TTH Limited &mdash; and was issued with a trading licence which has been published.  The trading company intend to take over the work of National Software Centre were doing.  What we are witnessing is this Government agreeing to an abolition of public company in favour of a private compeny.  Why has this been done?  I understand some of the personnel in this company have very close associations with senior members of the Fianna Fáil Government and Party, and have been very closely aligned to them for a considerable time.  The general suspicion and concern among the personnel in the software industry throughout the country is that these people are getting a pay-off for contributions made to Fianna Fáil in the recent past.  This is extremely unfortunate.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on the Government and the Minister to take this matter back to Government and to direct the IDA to re-establish the National Software Centre immediately to ensure that the fears of people working in the software industry are allayed.  This is a serious matter which this House must view with extreme concern.  When one examines this matter one sees a close relationship to the marina incident in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The National Software Centre were internationally recognised.  The Australian Government are at the moment establishing a software centre in Australia on the Irish model.  Internationally this was viewed as an innovative development. The question is, why did the Government allow this centre to be closed?  What is the real reason?  I would go so far as to say that the Minister, <Col N="857" /> Deputy Reynolds, misled this House when he gave one criterion &mdash; that it was because the income for the centre would not be sufficient to sustain operations. This House has been left in the dark.  The real facts have not been put to the House and there is an onus on the Government to ensure that this position is corrected immediately.</P>
    <P>Many questions could arise as a result of this closure.  I hope the Minister takes this matter back to the Cabinet and that they will direct the IDA to re-establish the National Software Centre.  I wonder how this decision tallies with various statements made by Fianna Fáil Ministers and the Taoiseach in the recent past? At the recent CII annual conference the Taoiseach said that enterprise means imaginative, innovative, courageous and well-directed action in pursuit of carefully defined objectives.  He went on to say they tended to discuss enterprise mainly in the context of private sector activity and that it was also essential to promote it within the public sector.  How does this closure of a public sector company tally with what the Taoiseach said?</P>
    <P>One must ask why the Government are not prepared to be innovative and to take a chance and act as an entrepreneur in this area.  The facts are there.  There are people in this country and in other countries, who are constantly taking chances. But for these people there would not be any development at all.  The fact that the Government have taken this decision means very serious damage has been done to this country internationally. While the IDA are trying to attract the software industry to Ireland, there is a feeling abroad that the Government are no longer committed to this industry.  It will be far more difficult now to attract that type of industry here and I would go so far as to say that it will possibly cost the IDA twice as much to undo the damage that has been done.  This is very unfortunate and should never have happened. The motivation behind this closure must give rise to serious questions. The Minister has an opportunity to outline the fine details to the House.  I am not prepared to accept the answer given by the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, to Deputy Bruton because that answer cannot be substantiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>The Government in their <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> claim that they intend to create 3,000 jobs over the next four to five years in the area of international services.  The first one they mention is computer services.  The IDA in their recently published document <i>Your Partners in Development</i> state that they provide a special package of incentives and support facilities for companies involved in internationally traded services.  They go on to say that software development has been the main business supported and this sector has shown rapid growth in recent years.</P>
      <P>Against that background, how can the Government justify closing the National Software Centre?  The Minister makes the claim that it is because of lack of income but, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn has pointed out, a centre of this kind is not expected to be self-financing within the first two or three years of its establishment. It was established by the IDA as a centre of excellence in software so that it would gradually build up expertise, help create private companies and ultimately through its reputation after a reasonably long period, having helped independent commercial enterprises to grow, it would become self-financing. The private sector would have grown to a point where it would be using the services of the centre and providing it with sufficient income.  The National Software Centre is described in paragraph 9.14 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy as being an addition to on-going promotional work for the software industry by existing organisations.  It is part of the promotional activity of the IDA.</P>
      <P>Why was it strangled in its infancy by the IDA?  Why was a new board appointed to the centre only a few months before the centre was done to death? Surely if the IDA's intention was to keep the centre going they would not have appointed a new board and put it out of existence within a few months.  It does not look as if this was an IDA decision when one measures it against that background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to deny that any representations were made by the Government, by him, by any other Minister or by anybody acting on his behalf, or at his instigation, to the IDA to the <Col N="859" /> effect that this centre was to be done away with.  I want him to deny that representations were made to him by any private interests seeking the removal of the centre as potential competition for a private project.  I want the Minister to deny those categorically if he can.  If he cannot, one must ask serious questions about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government are continuing to fund infrastructural activity of this kind in the electronics sector.  For instance, this year's Estimates provide £256,000 as a grant-in-aid for the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre.  That same centre got £268,000 the previous year and about £400,000 the year before that, so the Government accept that it is reasonable to give a grant-in-aid to a research centre, a centre of excellence.  The point is that the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre is concerned with research into micro chips and we have not a single micro chip manufacturer in this country.  Two or three projects were found to be impossible because they could not operate in a country of this size and we could not put up the necessary money.  They are not particularly suitable to this country, yet the Government are continuing to spend substantial sums of money subsidising a research centre into micro chip production.  I do not criticise them for doing so because there are spin-off benefits.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand, however, how they can justify continuing that grant-in-aid while, at the same time, closing on the grounds of economy a centre concerned with software, which is specifically suited to this country.  We have a surplus of young, trained people with an interest in computer activity who have been trained in software.  Software is a brain-based, not a capital-based industry.  People make the software industry move; capital equipment makes the micro chip industry move.  Yet we have a research centre into micro chips and the Government have closed down the only centre of excellence concerned with software, on the grounds that its income was not large enough. Why not ask the same question about the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre, which has been in existence for a number of years?  If income was the <Col N="860" /> criterion, why was it necessary to give £256,000 this year to the National Micro-Electronics Research Centre?  Surely that centre, if this is the standard, should be able to pay for its own expenses in the same way as the Government say the National Software Centre should have been able to do?</P>
    <P>It is important to know the true considerations behind this decision.  The Minister has not so far given the full facts to the House.  I am seeking clear denials from the Minister in regard to the questions I have put to him, in regard to representations by him or to him in this matter and whether a private sector project had any influence whatever in the matter.  Secondly, will he indicate, given that he has licensed that same private sector project, whether it is doing or proposes to do any of the things that the National Software Centre was doing?  If so, why did he not encourage the software centre to seek a trading house licence rather than encourage an alternative project? Why, for instance, did he not suggest that the software centre, if it had a deficiency of income from what it was able to sell here, should take part in the international development co-operation activities of the IDA?  The IDA say they provide consultancy services to developing countries on a commercial, fee paying basis.  If the National Software Centre in its early years was not able to get enough income within this country, why did not the IDA seek to sell those activities and services overseas?  Why close it down? Surely the Minister should have looked for other ways to keep going that vital support to the software industry rather than strangle it in the way he seems to have done or allowed to be done.  It is important that we have frank and full answers to these questions.</P>

      <P>The decision to close the National Software Centre was made by the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce was advised of the decision to close the centre but did not play a role in that decision.  I am informed that the decision was based on a number of criteria, not just the one mentioned by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, <Col N="861" /> including the view that the income of the centre would not be sufficient to sustain its operations.</P>
      <P>To answer Deputy Bruton's questions about the new board, yes, it was that new board that advised the IDA when it decided to take shares in the centre, and more recently, when it decided to close, it was acting under it own authority, under statute, and the Minister has no responsibility in relation to these decisions.  I reject totally the points raised about who influenced it.  We did not force anybody's hand in this decision.  I would also say to Deputy Taylor-Quinn that there is no place for chancers, as she describes them, in this Government.  There may have been in other Governments but not in this one.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this is a matter for the day-to-day administration of the industrial development agencies and it is an area in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function.  This reflects the rationale behind the establishment of such bodies, that is, to give them a greater degree of flexibility and freedom than is normally available within the Civil Service, and to free Ministers from responsibility for the decision which the boards and staffs of these bodies take in the day-to-day administration of their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In this regard the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, in answer to a Dáil question last year, indicated that he is answerable for overall policy, including the legislation under which the bodies operate and also for the Exchequer allocations provided to them.  Finally, it may be as well to emphasise here that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in relation to the commercial affairs of individual companies in respect of his industrial policy role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Software Centre was formally established in 1984 as a limited <Col N="862" /> company, to help meet a number of perceived needs in the Irish software industry. The establishment of the centre was funded by way of IDA grants and equity. The principal objectives of the centre were: to increase the pace of development of the indigenous software industry; to increase Ireland's credibility in the eyes of overseas companies as a location for the development of sophisticated software; and to become self-funding within five years of being set up.</P>
    <P>The principal activitities in which the centre engaged, in order to achieve these aims, were commission sales of software, technical consultancy, software research and marketing supports.</P>
    <P>In the light of the decision to close the centre, the Minister has been keen to ensure that the provision of services and support by the State agencies leaves no gap in the range of aids and assistance needed for the development of the software services sector.  In this connection, services from the IDA and CTT will be available to firms in order to fill such gaps.</P>

That was the question and I answered yes, so do not twist it about.  The Deputy asked a straight question but he goes around in circles.  We are used to hearing it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce fully appreciates the importance to Ireland of a strong software sector, and the employment potential which exists in the sector for our young, computer literate workforce.  The supports for the sector which I have outlined emphasise the Government's commitment in the software area.</P>
      <P>The current appraisal of the supports to the software sector in the Department of Industry and Commerce, Eolas and the IDA which I mentioned will be used to further tailor these supports to the sector if and where appropriate.  These measures should guarantee the continued success and future development of the sector.</P>
      <P>Only yesterday, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced the expansion of one Irish software company.  This expansion will lead to the creation of 108 new jobs over the next three years, practically all of them of a high calibre. The range of supports already in place for the sector plays a vital role in encouraging expansions such as this.  The fact that this growth is evident is a reflection of the success of our initiatives in the software area.</P>
      <P>These initiatives will be maintained and, where considered appropriate, will be developed further.  The Minister is confident that this course of action will maintain and accelerate the development of our software industry.</P>

There is no provision in the Estimates for such a scheme in 1988-89. However, while I cannot yet announce that private sponsorship will be available to cover the costs of operating such a scheme this year, I can assure the Deputy that I have had a positive interest expressed by one firm and I am hopeful that negotiations will be completed shortly.  I anticipate that grants to successful students would be awarded in time for the commencement of the academic year 1988-89.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy means by the reintroduction of an accredited system of distance learning.  Courses through distance learning are at present being provided under our National Distance Education Council.  This includes courses leading to diploma and degree awards in information technology from the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>The National Distance Education Council is at present examining the provision of further courses leading to awards, including degrees.  The Deputy has also raised the matter of developing educational television and broadcasting generally.  As I stated in the Dáil on 11 June, 1987, in reply to Question No. 29, progress in this area is contingent on the requisite resources being available and in view of the current heavy financial commitments in the educational sector overall and the constraints on public expenditure generally, it would not be feasible to undertake any further commitments at present.</P>

      <P>There was no reduction in the grant-aid allocated to Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann in 1988 as compared with 1987.</P>
      <P>The figure of £60,000 referred to by the Deputy comprises £40,000 allocated under the scheme of annual grants to national governing bodies of sport in respect of coaching, equipment, administration and special projects and £20,000 in respect of the employment of a full-time administrator.  The comparable figure for 1988 is £73,000, which comprises £53,000 allocated under the annual grants scheme and £20,000 in respect of the administrator.  This represents a 21.66 per cent increase in grant-aid under these headings in 1988.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann also benefits from grant-aid from my Department in respect of grants to outstanding sportspersons and attending and hosting major international competitions.</P>

      <P>I have, to date, given certificates under the relevant statutory provisions to four companies locating in the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in the Custom House Docks area.  Applications by a further 23 companies have been approved in principle.</P>
      <P>In relation to the target of 7,500 jobs over a five year period I am confident that it can be achieved.  To qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax, companies intending to locate in the IFSC must meet certain requirements which are set out in the relevant legislation and must also be certified by me.  That certification process ensures, <i>inter alia</i>, that activities and jobs will not simply and without justification be transferred from another part of Ireland to the Custom House Docks area.  Such transfers may, however, be justified in certain limited cases where there are plans for significant expansion in the scale of the activities in question in response to the stimulus of the favourable environment of the IFSC: to refuse permission for such transfers would not serve the best interests of the economy because it would mean foregoing additional new employment, profits and investment.</P>

A five year development plan drawn up by the IDA in consultation with my Department has already been published.  Major investment programmes for the rationalisation and expansion of the beef and pigmeat sectors have been announced and plans are also being implemented for the production of higher added-value products in the sheepmeat sector.  Financial assistance <Col N="758" /> towards these investments is being provided by the IDA and by the EC.</P>
      <P>The modernisation and rationalisation of the food industry will inevitably result in the closure of some inefficient plants.

The importance of the programme lies not only in the creation of new jobs, but more importantly in the establishment of a highly competitive and technologically sophisticated agri-food industry capable of competing on the world's international food market.</P>
