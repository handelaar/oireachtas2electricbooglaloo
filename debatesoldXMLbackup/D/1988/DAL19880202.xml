    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the magnificient bequest of Sir Alfred and Lady Beit to the National Gallery, he will now agree to the need for an Irish honours system in order to enable Ireland, like almost every other country in the developed world, east and west, to recognise and signal service and contribution to Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated previously in this House, the matter of an honours system is not under consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of assuring the Dáil that the Government greatly appreciate the magnificent bequest of Sir Alfred and Lady Beit to the nation.  Their generosity will long be remembered by the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware whether Ireland is an exception in Europe in not having at least some form of honours system and will he agree that there are countries which have republican constitutions which can also contain <Col N="638" /> within such constitution an honours system that is consistent with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would not see the difficulty lying in the constitutional area.  I think most of us would like to see some type or form of honours list but, as you know, any attempts in the past have run into difficulties of a nature which had nothing to do with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach care to elaborate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that the Taoiseach is in favour in principle of some form of system which would allow the State to recognise the type of singular contribution that Sir Alfred and Lady Beit have made to the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think it is well known that I would be in favour of such a system but so far we have never succeeded in getting any agreement or unanimity about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What efforts have been made in recent years to reach agreement? I am certainly not conscious of any effort having been made in the past decade since I came into this House. Could the Taoiseach enlighten us on the attempts that have been made to reach agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of attempts were made but perhaps they never took the form of concrete efforts.  The matter has been thought about and adverted to on a number of occasions, but I think the Deputy will agree that unless there was unanimity there would be no point in proceeding with the matter.  I find it difficult to envisage unanimity, at the present time at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to consult with the other party leaders with a view to seeing if such unanimity could be reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would press me very strongly &mdash; with no great <Col N="639" /> enthusiasm, or rather optimism, I would undertake such a process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is enthusiastic but not optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is something missing in our general structure and I think most of us would like to see something put in place if it could be put in place, but unless there was practically unanimous agreement about it, it would not be worth trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should be encouraged in his efforts, provided he does not propose that we have an order of the Bald Eagle.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, there you are; I now completely withdraw my offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the measure of agreement that has been reached between the Government and the main Opposition party, and that already exists between Fine Gael and the Government party on many other issues, surely they could reach agreement on this as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be very encouraged to know that on many of the basic areas of social and economic progress the Labour Party agree with what we are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of questions of this nature addressed to various Taoisigh over the past number of years.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that many Irish people have achieved great distinction in many fields, sporting, cultural, business and otherwise over the past number of years which in other countries would have merited a role of honour or some other distinction?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that in this country we should have some means of according an honour to people who distinguish themselves in those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course.  I <Col N="640" /> think I have already indicated that but, as the Deputy will have seen already in the House this afternoon, we Irish I am afraid have a very highly developed sense of the ridiculous and we would have to make a very strenuous effort to overcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Taoiseach for my levity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his policy and if he will instruct all the Ministers of his Government that appointments to State boards or bodies should reflect as far as is practicable the fact that women constitute over half the adult population of the country and if he will ensure that every Minister carries out this instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach informed the Dáil on 7 April 1987, he has instructed the members of the Government to advance the position and status of women in all aspects of their responsibilities.  This includes in particular the appointment of suitably qualified women to State boards and bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Taoiseach himself would not answer this question because I expect he would take responsibility for it.  I understand the Minister of State's role is to co-ordinate rather than ensure that this occurs, and the Taoiseach should be ensuring that it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State happy that the policy is being carried out, given that the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing set up a committee recently on marketing called so far as I know, &ldquo;The Marketing Think Tank&rdquo; on which there were 15 men and no women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="641" />
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Taoiseach will ensure that the instruction or advice he has given the Government will be carried out in so far as is practicable. The only way we can record the appointments officially to State boards is that the Department of Finance collate a six monthly record of appointments which gives details in relation to respective membership by males and females of all State boards.  Since assuming office on 10 March last, this Government have appointed 51 women to State boards. That is a significant improvement on the situation that existed before then.  Of course, I will not personally be happy until I can convince my Government colleagues that 50 per cent of appointments should be female.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand the Minister of State's position. Given that she says she is unhappy with the situation at the moment, how does she think she is going to get past this blockage?  Here are a committee recently set up, and the Minister of State apparently has responsibility in this area, with 15 men and no women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask your indulgence, Sir, because I am asking the Minister of State to indicate how she believes she is going to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first supplementary, I indicated that this Government had achieved that of their nominees to State boards since they assumed office in March, 51 were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that in accordance with reducing substantially the budget to the Council for the Status of Women?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget for the Council for the Status of Women is the matter of a separate parliamentary question which I answered recently here in the Dáil.  We are talking here about <Col N="642" /> ministerial nominees to State boards and I am saying that 51 of the nominees appointed to State boards since last March were women.  I said also I would be happier if 50 per cent of the membership of all State boards were women, but we must ensure that when nominees are being nominated, they are, of course, suitable, and where suitably qualified women are available and able to take up the position, then they are considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised angling licensing arrangements which included the introduction of licences for trout and coarse fish angling, came into effect on 1 January 1988 in <Col N="644" /> accordance with the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987.  The licence fees will go directly to the fisheries boards for the conservation, protection and development of fisheries. In these circumstances I have no proposal to amend this law at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the tremendous resistance to these charges, would the Minister reconsider his decision?  It is obvious that, because of the ill will which this licensing has generated, the cost of collecting will exceed the amount collected and no money will be gained as a result.  We will have a tremendous ill will among fishermen, and besides, the tourism, will industry, particularly inland tourism, will suffer grievously.  In view of the present circumstances I ask the Minister to reduce his decision.  Will he consider that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the cost, and I am quite satisfied there will be no additional cost in the administration of these licences and that at this time there is no intention on the part of the Department to rescind or, indeed, bring further legislation before the House.  This was enacted and it was not supported only by the Government party. Second Stage in this House was opposed by the Labour Party but the Committee and Final Stages were unanimously agreed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give recognition to the fact that this Bill was guillotined through the Dáil at a time of year when we should have been having an Adjournment Debate rather than rushing legislation in through the back door?  Will the Minister accept that the imposition of a rod licence as proposed will alienate those who have, up to now, led the way in investing in developing the inland fisheries?  Will he accept that the imposition of a rod licence is, in effect, charging angling club members to fish for fish they themselves have bred and put into these fishery waters?  We are now charging fishermen for fishing for coarse <Col N="645" /> fish while up to now State funds have been spent on killing off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I remind the Deputy that in 1980 the commission recommended that there should be licences and it was decided at that time that it might be better to consider a voluntary system of licences.  That was agreed on, and out of the 135,000 who could contribute on a voluntary basis there was a contribution from some 4,000.  Yes, there are difficulties and there will be more difficulties if Deputies like Deputy Molloy continue to tell the people down the country, particularly in the west, that they do not agree with this.  I would like to put on record here that the leader of his party agreed in this House prior to Christmas with the legislation and did not oppose it.</P>

I presume he feels that <Col N="646" /> in some magic way this money is going to make up the difference and that the administration costs of this will, as Deputy Deasy rightly said, exceed the cost of what is going to be netted for the Government.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that all forms of angling are in a serious state of decline at present?  When I, as spokesperson for Fine Gael, accepted the principle of the Bill, I think that all parties on this side of the House had difficulty on Committee Stage because of the fact that a guillotine had been agreed on the Bill just prior to the Christmas recess and also because the Bill was published on a <Col N="649" /> Friday and we discussed it on the Tuesday or Wednesday and perhaps we did not give it the thorough study it deserved. Notwithstanding all of that, and accepting the principle that any moneys collected will go back into the industry, would the Minister now agree that the timing of the introduction of licences, apart altogether from the principle of the introduction of licences, was appalling with the decline in angling, with the serious pollution and poaching problems, with the decrease in Government spending proposed for 1988 and the uncertainty about the fisheries' boards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is really making a case for me by saying that if there is a difficulty with protection and development and if finance is required to ensure that we continue the development and protection of our inland fisheries, the object of the new licences is to provide a more equitable way by which funds for the further development and protection of the inland fisheries will be available. I want to refer &mdash; and they have not been referred to yet &mdash; to the licensing fees.  A 21 day ordinary licence for coarse fish will cost 24p per day and if it is over the year, it will cost 3p per day.  A trout licence will cost 48p per day over 21 days and over the year it will cost 4p per day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that I put down amendments about the level of licences in many cases and, in particular, in relation to the composite licences.  I still feel that £40 for a composite fresh water angling licence is way beyond the reach of the average person who is interested in angling.  I would urge him to look again at that and to consider reintroducing district licences because for the ordinary person with his bicycle and his rod an increase from £7 to £21 or £25 is out of his reach given the economic situation in this country.  We want to encourage people and we want to encourage the angling industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There are a number of individual anglers and angling clubs who opposed the <Col N="651" /> arrangements but the main body of anglers support the new arrangements and I think they do so because the money whether it is £500,000 or £1 million &mdash; and I have stated this categorically both here and in the Seanad &mdash; will go directly towards the protection and development of inland fisheries.  Any Member of this House who disagrees with that would be suggesting that I am telling untruths in the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1987 a package of incentives designed to increase Ireland's merchant fleet was put in place. The Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987 provides for grants of up to 25 per cent towards the purchase of new or secondhand ships which are not more than seven years old; the Finance Act, 1987 provided for a reduction in corporation tax for shipping from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and enabled shipowners to benefit from the investment potential of <Col N="656" /> the Business Expansion Scheme.

      <P>The total available under the Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, is £7.5 million.  That is a maximum over a number of years.

      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on the number of applications he has received?  It is certainly in line with the expectations I had as Minister that there would be a great response to the incentives scheme.

Here is a shipping sector which has suffered a buffeting in the past few years because of the travails of Irish Shipping, and which offers an opportunity for development in a cost-effective way.  Would the Minister tell the House that he will make every effort to get from the Department of Finance the necessary justified finance to give the go ahead to all those projects so as to create employment in the shipping sector again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if, in view of the reduced EC quotas for fish, he will indicate the steps, if any, which are being taken to protect jobs in the fishing industry, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the quotas achieved for Irish fishermen for 1988 are at a reduced level, or will have any adverse effects on employment in the fishing industry.  Indeed, in cash terms, increases of some £7 million over and above the quotas originally proposed by the Commission were negotiated at last December's Council and this will have a major beneficial impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>How could the Minister have the gall to come in here today and say that the reduced quotas will not affect employment?  Only last week in Rossaveal, County Galway, at one of the largest fish processing plants, there was a loss of 240 jobs.  In view of the effect the ban will have on employment in the industry, would he now seek to have the ban lifted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the position, I said I did not accept that the quotas achieved for Irish fishermen are at a reduced level.  I went on to say that the quotas for this year will have no serious adverse effect.  Furthermore, I should make very clear to Deputy Sherlock that it was not the question of reduced quotas which resulted in the loss of these jobs in Rossaveal last week.  I do not want to go into that case in detail because there are further questions on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Sherlock has been advised that the ban on fishing in the Celtic Sea has resulted in this closure, that is not true.  The figures for the Celtic Sea, which I do not have with me at present, have been in the region of 11,000 odd tonnes. In the region of 4,000 tonnes would have been caught at the moment.  We agreed with both the processors and the producers of the industry that there would be landings of some 6,000 tonnes.  This <Col N="660" /> could have continued if the quality of the fish had been as we believe it should have been and we sought scientific advice.  I would not like to preside, with my Minister, over a Department that would allow a reversion to the situation in which we found ourselves some years ago when it was necessary to close the fishery for some five years.  The closure was on scientific advice.  I can go into that matter in greater detail when we are dealing with questions concerning the Celtic Sea.</P>

      <P>Taking mackerel, the quota for 1987 was 79,350 tonnes. Having come into office in March when 72,000 tonnes of that quota had been caught and landed indiscriminately, with prices at a minimum, the remaining quota being only 7,000 tonnes, the Minister and I secured a further 10,000 tonnes valued at about £3 million.  That ensured that the fishing could continue into December of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter does not stop there.  Let the Deputy just hold her breath.  We did what was never done in the past since the introduction of the Common Fisheries Policy; we ensured that there would be a review of the mackerel quota in the middle of this year because of the surveys carried out by the industry in conjuction with the Department &mdash; indeed, paid for by the industry. All that information was not available to ISIS, but the working groups within the Commission are working on this whole matter at the moment and I feel confident, because of the scientific advice which we are making available to the Commission, that we shall meet with success there.  With regard to hake, the 1987 quota was 1,990 tonnes and we received a quota of 2,070.  For monkfish, the quota last year was 3,060 tonnes and is now 3,370.  For megrim last year we had 2,960 tonnes and got 3,260.  For herrings, last year's quota was 38,920 tonnes and we now have a quota of 33,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>I shall explain that with reference to the Celtic Sea questions.  We had done something for which there was no precedent. Because of the closure of the three areas, Baginbun and two other areas in the Celtic Sea, we have ensured the other 5,000 tonnes.  On white pollock, we have gone from 910 tonnes to 1,230 tonnes.  For the quota of cod we have gone from 11,660 to 11,520 tonnes.  On haddock, the 1987 quota was 3,850 tonnes and it is now 4,090; saithe from 3,760 to 4,790; whiting, 17,240 tonnes&mdash; there is a <i>status quo</i> in this case and in fact we do not catch all of our whiting quota; plaice, 3,310 to 3,410; sole, 680 to 640 and nephrops, 9,315&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Government have decided to go ahead with the Shannon Estuary Bill which will <Col N="664" /> include all three major harbours and the smaller ports in the estuary?  I would like the Minister to inform me and the House as to why he has not accepted the views of the Foynes harbour trustees that they, even for some time, should be left outside the scope of the Bill, with the possibility of being included, and the future dissolution of the trustees providing that matter comes before the House by way of an affirmative order.  Does the Minister realise that the development in Foynes has far exceeded the development of the other harbours in the area?  Can he please assure this House that the views of the trustees will be accepted as per the Harbours Bill discussed in this House this time last year?</P>

      <P>As I have said in my reply, it is hoped to submit proposals for the Shannon estuary authority for consideration by the Government later this month.  I fully appreciate that there has been considerable development in the Foynes area in the past.  However, this is draft legislation and I feel it would be inappropriate of me to give any views when the Government have not had an opportunity of considering the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the Minister of State is so reluctant to give views in this House when the Minister, Deputy Daly, has given his views quite categorically and they are on record elsewhere. He has said words to this effect &mdash; I respect your ruling and I will not quote directly &mdash; which were quoted in <i>The Irish Press</i> on 8 January this year, that he intends to have one unified estuarial authority, all ports included, and he will knock heads together, if necessary, to get it.  Can the Minister please tell me what heads he has in mind?  Is it heads around the Cabinet table, heads in a particular constituency in this area or what heads is he talking about?  The Minister is quite clear about what he intends to do so please do not be coy, Minister.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will appreciate that in the most minor of insurance claims it takes a considerable length of time to get the money and in this case it has also taken some time.  We submitted a claim to the insurers on 19 October.  We wanted to be absolutely certain that everything was in order before we submitted the claim.  We have sent back-up data for the claim to the insurers recently.  Certainly we are most anxious to receive the £1.734 million which is our claim and we will be pursuing the matter as vigorously as possible.  Hundreds of documents accompanied this claim and no doubt it will be some time before it is processed.  We have referred to the question of interest in this case.

Any individual tourist interest would not be able to claim for loss but the whole area suffered as a result of cancellations.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine the action, if any, he intends to take regarding the adverse decision by the EC Commission in relation to Ireland's 1987 applications for EC Commission grants for fisheries and aquaculture, formerly FEOGA grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the amount of grant-aid awarded to Irish applications for the construction and modernisation of vessels and for aquaculture projects under the FEOGA scheme in December 1987 was disappointingly low.  However, I should point out that decisions in relation to such grants are entirely a matter for the EC Commission.  I raised the issue of the low grant approvals specifically at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Brussels on 15 December last and I left the Commission in no doubt as to my disappointment at the level of aid approved.  The matter has also since been pursued by my officials at working group level.</P>
      <P>I will continue to press for the maximum aid possible for the Irish fishing industry from the EC Structural Fund in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister was very disappointed; indeed the levels of aid were appallingly low.  Would the Minister comment on the fact that, with a Portuguese Commissioner who was advised by a Spaniard, who administered the Structural Fund itself and by a French acting head of division, Portugal received 11.5 per cent of the fund, Spain 33 per cent and France 12.5 per cent whereas we received 1.9 per cent only?  I am concentrating here particularly on the aquaculture areas&mdash;disappointing and all as were the boats, that matter can be taken up again &mdash; but there were many aquaculture projects on their last chance which were rejected out of hand.  This is an area all of us have spoken about with a view to the future development particularly of our western seaboard.  Would the Minister not agree it is a coincidence <Col N="669" /> that a Portuguese, Spaniard and Frenchman who are administering this fund happened to allocate the greater portion of it to Portugal, Spain and France? What are this Government going to do about it?  We cannot be polite and say we are not allowed question them, they have the discretion.  This matter must be taken up at the highest level.  I have asked my colleague, Tom Raftery, MEP, to table an oral parliamentary question in Europe which is down for 10 February to try to elicit the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is factual that Spain received 33.8 per cent approximately of the total aid awarded, Portugal 11.53 per cent, France 12.81 per cent, Italy 18.56 per cent, the United Kingdom 10.56 per cent and that we were the lowest.  That information was made available to me prior to the meeting of 1415 December last.  Before the meeting commenced at all we sought the permission of the Presidency to discuss this matter, which we did.  I told the Commission and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers in no uncertain terms how disappointed we were, particularly in view of the fact that when Commissioner E Cunha visited this country with the Director General of Fisheries and the Chef de Cabinet they informed us that there were additional moneys available in the Structural Fund for which we should apply.  I am convinced that aquaculture proposals submitted by this country were as good as those submitted by any other country.  I do not for a moment disagree with Deputy Doyle.  Even in Brussels I could not hide my disappointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that eight of the projects were resubmitted.  We had applied for some £3.8 million in respect <Col N="670" /> of those &mdash; our total application covered 61 projects including some in respect of aquaculture, modernisation of vessels in respect of which we received £1.423 million &mdash; but what is disappointing is that those who were on their last legs did not receive any assistance.  The others, which were not on their last legs, can be resubmitted. There is another tranche to be approved in March when, hopefully, the latter will be approved also.  It has been a lesson for us and those in the industry. Nobody in the Department or any Minister has ever encouraged anyone to become involved in a project, whether it be in regard to a fishing vessel, a new vessel, modernisation of one, or an aquaculture project, unless they were absolutely certain that these grants would be available.  We should not take them for granted.  This has been a dear lesson for many people.  Officials and the Secretary of the Department have had further discussions with the Commission in regard to this but at the end of the day, unfortunately it is not a question of voting at the Council of Ministers, it is a question for the Commission itself.  The facts about which Deputy Doyle has spoken in relation to Portugal, Spain and France speak for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the crane barge <i>Samson</i> left Liverpool under tow by a tug on 9 December 1987 on its way to Valetta, Malta.  South of the Smalls, off the Welsh coast, the towline parted at approximately 7.30 a.m. in the morning of 11 December.  The tug remained in attendance on the crane barge and several attempts were made to reconnect the towline without success. Winds in the area on 11 December were force 6 to force 7 (near gale force) with rough waves.</P>
      <P>The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon monitored the situation from the time the <i>Samson</i> entered the Irish search and rescue region and they co-ordinated the rescue of the two crew men on board the crane barge which was carried out by an RAF Sea King helicopter from Brawdy in Wales.</P>
      <P>The grounding of the vessel at Rams Head, Ardmore, County Waterford occurred at approximately 7.50 a.m. on 12 December.  A surveyor from the Marine Survey Office of my Department later boarded the vessel to investigate the cause of the casualty and to establish if a danger of pollution existed.  Subsequently he instructed the owners to remove all pollutant substances.  This instruction was complied with immediately.  The <i>Samson</i> does not now pose a threat to marine life. The Marine Survey Office are continuing to monitor developments with regard to the wreck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have asked the owners of the <i>Samson</i> to remove the vessel.  Its removal is a matter, in the first instance, for the owner.  A harbour or conservancy authority, or the Commissioners of Irish Lights can also remove a wreck if they consider it an obstruction or danger to navigation.  I have no statutory powers to <Col N="672" /> remove such wrecked vessels or to direct that they be removed.  I should point out that the costs involved in wreck removal can be very great.</P>
    <P>I am at present examining the problems involved in removal and disposal of such wrecks with a view to the enactment of new legislation in the matter, if practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his history lesson.  The last part of his reply was the most interesting.  Is he now saying that the Department of the Marine finally will accept responsibility in this whole area?  Furthermore, is he saying that, as a result of those discussions, there will be some definitive division of the Department responsible for dealing with these types of wrecks?  The Minister said that a surveyor of his Department went to examine the wreck: on what date did that inspection take place?</P>
      <P>Would he also not agree that, in terms of a wreck, from 12 December to today is a long time? As I understand it, the only hope one has of dealing with such cases is by immediate action.  If one does not react to the danger within 48 hours, the chances of satisfactorily removing such a wreck at a later date is greatly lessened by the delay.  The key to this is that the Department must take responsibility. I was in touch with the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment.

      <P>I hope the Deputy's first question did not infer that there was any delay because I was about to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Marine Survey Office who very expeditiously dealt with this case.  The grounding of the vessel occurred at approximately 7.50 a.m. on 12 December and on the evening of that day the marine surveyor was in touch with the owners who were very cooperative. They ensured that a company in Cork, Celtic Sea Divers, removed the pollutant substances&mdash;12 tonnes plus 800 gallons of diesel oil &mdash; very expeditiously. Those with responsibility to remove wrecks are harbour authorities, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and conservancy authorities.  In the meantime, the Sea Pollution Bill is with the Attorney General and we are looking at the possibility of extending these powers to deal with cases like this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 15, 16 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that my Department, in consultation with the various fishing interests involved, manage this fishery. A management regime, incorporating individual boat quotas and a total take of 6,000 tonnes approximately, was adopted for the January-February fishery.  On 22 January last, I decided, on the basis of strong scientific advice, to close the fishery because of my concern for the future of the herring stocks.  In the early part of January, a large proportion of the fish landed from the fishery were made up of very young fish &mdash; two years old &mdash; the majority of which had not spawned.  The risks inherent in this type of fishing and its long term impact on the stock made such a decision imperative.  I could not allow a possible return to the situation which existed ten years ago when herring fishing in the Celtic Sea was totally prohibited for five years because of the poor state of the stock, resulting mainly from the catching of young fish.</P>
      <P>I would also wish to point out that my Department were in contact, in advance of the closure, with representatives of the fishermen and also the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, who represent the processing industry.  The majority of the processors directly concerned were in favour of the proposed closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, the Minister and Departmental <Col N="675" /> officials have since met a number of deputations from the IFO and the IFPEA. Following these discussions we have agreed on a course of action which will address the concerns of fishermen and also allow us to secure the scientific objective, which is the preservation of this stock in the long term.  I am satisfied that the proposed course of action is the best strategy in the circumstances.  It involves test fishing to determine the quality and age structure of the herring in the fishery at present.  The decision to close the fishery will be reviewed in the light of the results of the test fishing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to indicate on what basis he can say the fishery was closed on strong scientific advice when the scientists themselves admit that the quality of their scientific advice is inadequate.  It is more than seven years since there was a vessel survey and three to four years since there was a larva survey.  Is it not a fact that, despite the fact that we need serious management programmes &mdash; this being the first year the Celtic Sea is managed by the Department of the Marine &mdash; the Minister was afraid to go after those boats which had fished their quota and found it easier to close off the Celtic Sea fishing in a panic reaction rather than apply the law with equity and justice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of vessels were apprehended and some of the Deputy's colleagues have made a case to me not to take steps against them.  What we are doing is taking action and ensuring that this 6,000 tonnes will be spread equitably among the 60 odd boats involved. In conjunction with the IFO after discussions which concluded at 3 a.m. last Wednesday, we decided on a course of action.  In relation to the scientific advice we have received, there could be a natural closure there.  We are assuring those fishermen who have been badly done by <Col N="676" /> because of the over-fishing by some vessels, that all these matters will be taken into consideration when we are working out a quota which will be equitable and just.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, 0.95 per cent of the fish landed was one year old and 62.5 per cent was two year old. This means that one and two year old fish constituted 63 per cent of the fish caught. If this continues we will have a repeat of what happened ten years ago when we had to close the fisheries for five years. We must act responsibly and we are doing that.  As a result the fishermen will be financially better off at the end of this year.  Furthermore, I am confident we will secure another 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of herring from the EC during 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke the last day I expressed major disappointment &mdash; not at what was in the budget but at what was left out &mdash; and I felt there were many missed opportunities such as the chance to realise major capital from Irish Life, to provide major tax reform, to deal with the structural problems of the economy and to develop certain pivotal sections of the economy.</P>
      <P>The overall budget strategy of the Government seems to be flawed in respect of one element of their cuts in expenditure, the excessive cutting of capital expenditure, which is now down to somewhere between 1 per cent and 2 per cent of GNP.  This is a perilously low level just to replace existing facilities, not to speak of providing for all the infrastructural development which is required.  This is very much out of line with what Fianna Fáil said in Opposition leaving aside their promise to reduce VAT on construction to 5 per cent, and also to give £200 million to the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency of Wexford, <Col N="800" /> we have been notified that there will be no new houses, schools, roads, drainage programmes or bridges this year.  All development has come to a standstill and only existing contracts will be honoured. A major opportunity was missed for creativity by the Government because there are a number of projects, such as the Army headquarters and certain roads, which could have been pursued by way of joint venture.</P>
    <P>I believe that the capital is available from the construction and financial sectors for such joint venture activities which would stimulate investment in the construction sector.  A budgetary decision is not necessarily required to bring forward some of these projects which the construction industry could finance at a reasonable rate of interest, equivalent to Government stocks at present and it could have been, all round, very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>An area in relation to unemployment which worries me &mdash; and there has been very little public comment on it &mdash; is the proposed change in corporation tax.  This has been put forward as a minor reform of the system whereby the standard rate is being reduced from 50 per cent to 43 per cent; capital allowances will no longer be fully allowed &mdash; only 50 per cent of them will be allowed.  Many people are experts on the amount of money which businesses pay in profits tax but know very little about how businesses accumulate profits.  I suggest that a detailed analysis of capital allowances would show that such a move by the Minister is in the wrong direction.  For example, if I have a small business and I decide, after a couple of years of profitable trading, or in the start-up stage, to buy property, to buy a shop or a facility.  I cannot write off one penny of that investment against my profit.  If I spend £50,000 on a premises I cannot write off one penny.  There is no depreciation against buildings for the services sector.  If you reduce further the capital allowances on things like vans, vehicles, cash tills, modernising of premises and so on &mdash; if you do away with the <Col N="801" /> capital allowances by 50 per cent &mdash; you will put a lot of start-up small businesses who would not heretofore have had a taxable liability for corporation tax into the tax net.  For the larger business there is no major change.  If you change the equation a little bit on one side and a little bit on the other side and you see the net effect in 1988, there is no increase or decrease in taxation.  I feel that the change will hit small businesses which are starved of capital in the early stages and who will not be able to write it off.  I ask the Minister to tread very warily and to ask the Revenue Commissioners to monitor the effect on small business and to consider a two tier structure for corporation tax for small businesses as against larger businesses as defined by turnover of say, £250,000 or £200,000 per annum.  If we are to be serious about generating indigenous growth in the economy we must look at that possible danger.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made in this budget to tax pension funds at 6 per cent.  On the surface this may seem reasonable but, in fact, it is altering the game rules of various forms of pension income which are already well established.  For example, it is already the case that anyone who is in receipt of income from a pension is taxed in the normal way <i>vis-à-vis</i> the income tax code on that.  It strikes me as extraordinary that the Government on the one hand should give a fixed rate of return in relation to those bonds and, having done that, they are now changing the rules. Most of this pension income is generated not from the productive sector of the economy but through the Government's stockbroker and through the Stock Exchange.  It strikes me that that is unfair and it should have been done a year ahead.  It should be signalled now that from next year the changes will be made. This would be a lot fairer to those people who are living on small, reducing incomes or pensions who would have been able to plan ahead, or the fund managers could have planned accordingly.</P>
    <P>In relation to some small sectors in the economy which made budget submissions <Col N="802" /> to the Minister I am particularly disappointed that the VAT rate on certain elements of leisure and labour intensive sectors, such as the growth sectors of the economy, have not been reduced.  I refer specifically to the VAT rate on snooker facilities.  There is no doubt that there are many unemployed people and others who have a lot of leisure time on their hands. The current VAT rate on snooker &mdash; and I know that a detailed submission was made to the Minister in that regard &mdash; should be reviewed.  Similarly in the entertainment sector progress was made. As a former chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses I met all the various interest groups and I am glad that progress has been made on cinemas, fairgrounds and so on where VAT was reduced to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association have again been totally neglected.  They had sought to have two occasional licences per week.  There have been something of the order of 5,000 jobs lost in this sector and it is extraordinary that they should have been neglected in this way.  It strikes me that it would have been very beneficial to the Exchequer in terms of extra revenue and the extra competition which it would create in the entertainment sector.</P>
    <P>There is a particular matter, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, which I wish to raise and to which I hope the Minister will reply on Second Stage and I hope his officials will take special note of it.  It is an anomalous situation which has arisen concerning farm tax.  The last Government, and the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, gave a commitment that anyone who paid land tax in 1986 could get a tax credit against any of the three tax years, 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88.  If he paid £3,000 in land tax and his income tax bill in the first year was £1,500, and £1,500 in the second year, he could write it off until it was exhausted.  Letters were sent to farmers from local authorities and from the inspector of taxes granting people tax credits on income tax paid.  It was subsequently decided by the chief inspector of taxes last December that this facility <Col N="803" /> was being withdrawn.  It strikes me as being very unfair that because of this change people are now being informed that they have huge income tax bills where they were previously given written documentation to show they had tax credits. I will be seeking to table an amendment to the Finance Bill if this matter is not satisfactorily dealt with.  It is extremely unfair.</P>
    <P>One of the areas mentioned before the budget was announced was property tax. I note that other political parties such as the Progressive Democrats have proposed a property tax.  As Deputy Noonan said, the only proper way to look effectively at the property tax is to have a major tax reform package.  It is undoubtedly true that local authorities are starved of finance at present.  In their current state they are totally different from the local authorities of yesteryear.  In my own local authority all hedge cutting services have been abandoned, all rural refuse collection has been abandoned, all house repairs have been abandoned because there is no income.  Money which came in in lieu of domestic rates or grants has now been cut by £2 million this year. There is a need for a property tax but it must be based on the Exchequer giving money to local authorities by way of a property tax in lieu of income tax in so far as a full credit would be given for property tax payments to local authorities against ordinary income tax receipts.  At the end of each year, once a system of property tax was established, we would not have an increase in our taxation burden &mdash; which as a percentage of GNP or as a percentage of total income is the highest in Europe &mdash; but we would look again at a proper system of financing local authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the faults of the land tax was that, even though the money was payable to the local authorities, they were being directly deducted in their domestic rates of a support grant from the Department of the Environment &mdash; the money which was received in land tax payments.  The Government missed an opportunity to get the balance right between a tax on <Col N="804" /> property and a tax on labour.  Unfortunately, not one sentence of the Minister's speech was devoted to this area.</P>
    <P>Again we have seen the soft target hit with an increase of £5 million in the bank levy.  It is an extremely soft target.  It is unfortunate that this Government have seen fit not to extend the structure under section 84 loans.  There is no doubt that the debt equity ratio of many small companies is such that they require soft loan finance at a reasonable rate over a reasonable period of repayment.  Section 84 loans facilitated that.  Further pressures on the bank by way of bank levies, <i>per se</i>, are not necessarily wrong but it would be better to get increased taxation from the bank if necessary but, at the same time, allow them the facility to come out from under that particular tax burden by meeting their obligation to growth and industrial development in the economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome what has been done in relation to capital allowances for the motor industry but I regret there was not some change in relation to benefit-in-kind. It is only reasonable to state that all research into what can be done to stimulate the services sector such as the motor industry in terms of new car sales must be carried out by those sectors.  At present there is no incentive for companies to give their executives new cars. While capital allowances will be of some relief I feel that benefits in kind would be another way of stopping the brain drain. These people are very mobile and one of the important studies which needs to be done in relation to emigration is to see how many people, who could get employment here and who are well educated, are leaving because of the tax code as opposed to those who are leaving because of economic necessity and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Another major change which the Minister has made is in relation to the amnesty.  This strikes me as being a very significant change.  Many people call to see Deputies in regard to demands which they had received from the sheriff relating to tax affairs going back to 1979, 1984 and so on.  Some of these sheriffs hounded people out of business, not <Col N="805" /> unjustifiably in some respects where people totally disregarded the inspector of taxes' office and taunted the system.  I am not saying any sympathy should be given to them but it is amazing, seeing that we were advising people of their legal obligation to discharge their debts with the sheriff and seeing that the sheriffs went around threatening seizure and blue murder, now at the stroke of a pen those who were unfortunate enough this time last week to have made a settlement with the sheriff would have been far better to have done nothing.</P>
    <P>This morning I spoke to the sheriff in my own constituency and he informed me that if someone agrees the amount of tax owing by 1 May and discharges that tax debt by 31 September they can forget about the interest.  It strikes me as appalling that the Minister, if he was going to introduce such a concession, did not do so last year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision in so far as getting in money and getting things up-to-date are concerned and in that respect I have always advocated more computerisation for the office of the Collector General because that is where the problem started.  It was a Tower of Babel for many years.  We need greater consistency in regard to amnesties and arrears.  These <i>ad hoc</i> decisions based on political or other considerations will lead to major inequities and anomalies.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to repeat that this budget is worthy of support in so far as it goes.  A number of aspects should certainly be opposed by my party. If PRSI is to be introduced for the self-employed, it should be optional. However, my major criticism of this budget is that it has missed the opportunity to create the 3 per cent or 4 per cent growth in the economy which is vital. It has missed the opportunity to get in money which is available, for example through Irish Life, and it has missed the opportunity to be creative by not setting up joint ventures in the public capital programme.  It has missed the opportunity to create jobs in the developmental sectors of the economy and it has missed the opportunity to reform our tax code <Col N="806" /> by striking a better balance between tax on capital and tax on labour and between tax on property and tax on incomes.  In that respect I would like to see the phased abolition of employers' PRSI and a major change in the particular trap which both employers and employees find themselves in in the services sector whereby they compete with social welfare rates and which is driving people in to the black economy.  I am very suspicious of the changes which are being introduced in relation to corporation tax and I hope on the Finance Bill some of my detailed objections will be teased out in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this budget marks an important step in the Government's strategy for regenerating the economy. Its consolidates and builds on the Government's achievements in their first year of office and it lays the foundation for further progress in tackling the problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>This budget provides for measures which constitute the most significant and far-reaching package of reform in the social welfare area for a very long time. These are: a 3 per cent overall increase in weekly rates of payment; major improvements of over 11 per cent in the personal rates for those getting the lowest payments; the streamlining of the rates of payments in respect of dependent children of social welfare recipients with extra increases for those at the lowest levels; the continuation of the equal treatment alleviating payments until the end of the year; and the inclusion of farmers and self-employed persons in social insurance for old age and widow's pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back on the period of less than 12 months since we took office it is evident that the country has seen a major change for the better.  Through firm decisions and a strong commitment to the national interest we have stabilised the economy and brought a new sense of confidence to investors.  Significant visible and quantifiable improvements have been achieved.  The broad thrust of the <Col N="807" /> Government's strategy has been accepted by the people and by the major political parties.  Our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> reflects the general consensus on the approach that is needed at this critical time.  This programme is a blueprint for the regeneration of the economy and for greater social equity in our society over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Any programme, however well intended, will only be as good as our subsequent actions make it.  While there is still a long way to go, the initial economic indications are good.  Inflation continued to fall last year, the average being just over 3 per cent for the year.  This was the lowest annual increase since 1967. The inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued this year with a rate of 2.5 per cent for the year as a whole now being estimated.</P>
    <P>Interest rates and mortgage rates have continued to ease &mdash; mortgage rates have fallen by some 3 percentage points in the last 12 months.  This represents a significant reduction in outgoings for many middle-income households thereby increasing disposable income.  Many families have seen a reduction of some £12 per week in their mortgage payments. This continued downward trend in interest rates will also greatly assist investment this year, with consequent spin-off effects for employment.</P>
    <P>The targets set in last year's budget have been achieved and the Government's overall policy has wide international support.  The Exchequer returns for 1987 confirm completely the success of the Government's management of the public finances.  They clearly indicate that our finances have been brought firmly under control and that we can now look forward with confidence to securing a further improvement in 1988.  Real economic growth and sustainable employment can only be achieved on the basis of sound public finances.</P>
    <P>Present trends are more than encouraging and we must take full advantage of them.  I believe that there is enormous potential in the economy and we must ensure that it is being used to the full. <Col N="808" /> We must encourage people with ideas and ambition to put then ideas into action and we must make our economic and social system as flexible as possible so that it stimulates rather than inhibits their efforts.  This is brought home to me in my work with people, especially young people, who only require a little encouragement to put their ideas into action. People, in their early twenties today are extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic and they have an enormous potential which has yet to be fully harnessed. Government policies will enable this to be achieved.  In my own area I will also be providing more flexible opportunities for people on the live register and this is something I will return to later.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare front my first priority is to maintain social welfare payments at least in line with inflation.  This goes without saying and it represents a very significant financial commitment by the Government.  This year the Government have provided an extra £44.8 million for increases in social welfare and health allowance payments from late July next.  The overall increases are on the lines proposed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with much greater increases being provided for those on lower incomes.</P>
    <P>This year's improvements in social welfare rates are in three main areas, namely:</P>
    <P>(i)  a general increase of 3 per cent in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefit and other weekly payments;</P>
    <P>(ii)  much higher increases for those on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash; 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; 6 per cent increase in the rates for their dependent children;</P>
    <P>(iii)  streamlining of rates for child dependants so that in future there will <Col N="809" /> be only two different rates per scheme &mdash; in general there are four at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with each of these in turn.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> spells out clearly that the Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits, and, within the resources available, will consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.  The 3 per cent general increase in rates of social welfare payments from July will more than protect the real value of social welfare payments given that the rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.5 per cent.  By bringing forward last year's increases from November to July the Government made sure that the income of social welfare recipients were fully protected against inflation up until July this year.</P>
    <P>The general increase means that a family with three children in receipt of unemployment benefit will receive an increase of £3.10 per week giving them a new rate of £102.30 per week.  A couple on retirement or old age pension will receive an increase of £2.90 per week giving them a new rate of £99.10 per week.  A widow with three children in receipt of a contributory pension will get an increase of £2.80 per week giving her a new rate of £93.30 per week.  The cost of this 3 per cent across-the-board increase is some £67 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The second element in the improvements provided in the budget is the provision of special additional increases for people on the lowest social welfare payments, namely, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  There has been much debate in recent years about the low level of these payments.  There was no doubt in my mind that the lower payments should be increased, and the Government have decided to increase the long term personal rate of unemployment assistance in urban areas to £42 per week from July, that is an increase of £4.20 per week or 11 per cent.  All other unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare <Col N="810" /> allowance personal rates are also being increased by 11 per cent.  Overall this means increases well above the current rate of inflation.  It is the first time that the position of people on these low levels of payment has been directly tackled by a Government.  This is a concrete example of the Government's concern for the less well off members of the community being translated into action.</P>
    <P>As I have said, a single person on long term unemployment assistance gets an increase of over £4 per week.  A married couple with three children will get £6.70 extra per week bringing their total to £98.80.  These special increases are a major step in the Government's plan to provide additional assistance for those on the lowest social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The third area of improvement is the rates paid for dependent children of social welfare recipients.  There are two aspects to this.  In the first place, we are streamlining the different rates for children. It has long been accepted that something should be done to reduce the plethora of child dependant rates.  There are 36 child rates at present comprising, for most schemes, a different rate for the first, second, third to fifth and sixth and subsequent child.  In general, then there are, at present, four different rates for children for each scheme.  The Government have decided to reduce these to two.  The rate for the first and second child will be the same.  This will result in an increase for one child families.  The rate for the sixth and subsequent child will be increased to that for the third to fifth child.  These changes taken together with the general increase in rates will improve the incomes of large families considerably.</P>
    <P>In addition to this increase in child rates, it has been decided to further increase by 3 per cent, the child rates for those on the lowest weekly payments, that is people on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare assistance giving an overall 6 per cent increase in these rates.  This, together with the special increase of 11 per cent in personal rates that I already mentioned, will mean <Col N="811" /> a significant improvement in the position of these families.</P>
    <P>For example, a family with two children in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £6.20 per week. Their present rate of £84.20 per week will, therefore, rise to £90.40 from July next.</P>
    <P>A family with six children in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £9.70 per week to a new rate of £124.00.  A family with two children in receipt of disability benefit will receive an increase of £2.80 per week giving them a new total of £93.00.</P>
    <P>These examples clearly illustrate that the increases in the budget are meaningful in money terms and, therefore, will ease the financial burden on the more hard-pressed sections of our community. Some economists would have us believe that such increases cannot be afforded but this is to ignore the social reality of the present situation as distinct from the purely economic.  The Government know that people at the lower end of the income distribution cannot wait for better days, and the measures in this budget show our genuine concern for them.</P>
    <P>The overall social welfare package of improvement in payments will cost an estimated £44.8 million including health allowances, this year and some £101 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words about the equal treatment alleviating payments.  These payments were introduced on a temporary basis in November 1986 to lessen the effect of the implementation of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social security matters.  Payments of £20 per week are being made to recipients where, at November 1986, both spouses were in receipt of a social welfare payment. Payments of £10 per week are being made to people whose spouse was earning over £50 per week.  Originally there were over 29,000 persons in receipt of these payments. However, there has been a gradual decline in numbers with the result <Col N="812" /> that at present about 19,000 people are in receipt of these payments.</P>
    <P>The previous Government had intended that these payments would cease last November but this Government decided to extend them to the end of March.  In view of the hardship that would be caused to families by the abrupt ending of these payments, the Government have now decided that they should be continued until the end of this year.</P>
    <P>However, as part of the process of phasing out these payments they will be adjusted to take account of the basic increase in rates in July 1988.  I will also be reviewing the special additional temporary payments in respect of rent and mortgage which apply to a small number of these people.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the other major new development in the social welfare system which has been provided for in the budget and which will come into operation this year.  This is the extension of social insurance cover to the self employed.</P>
    <P>The extension of social insurance to the self-employed is a major milestone in the development of the social welfare system.  When the unified system of social insurance was introduced under the Social Welfare Act, 1952 it covered employed people only and this has been the situation since then.  The abolition of the income limit for social insurance in 1974 brought all employees, including those with higher earnings who were previously excluded, into the system and gave them the basic cover for benefits and pensions which the system provides. The fact that self-employed persons have never been covered is a major gap in the present system.</P>
    <P>We have been exceptional by European standards in having such a large proportion of the workforce outside the social insurance system.  It is a generally accepted principle of social policy that social insurance cover should be available on as wide a basis as possible to those who are in a position to contribute to it. This not only ensures that the people concerned have the protection of the system but also that the overall financing <Col N="813" /> of social welfare as a whole is put on a more equitable basis.  We have a system under which employees and employers contribute on a substantial basis to the cost of social insurance cover for themselves and their dependents whereas the self-employed are totally excluded from the social insurance system.  This means that self-employed people must rely on means-tested social welfare schemes, which, of course, are fully paid for by the Exchequer, or in practice by the general taxpayer.  This is an unfair system, both for self-employed persons themselves and for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>When I previously served as Minister for Social Welfare in 1982 I had developed proposals on the extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  We left office before these could be implemented.  The outline of that scheme was available to the incoming Government. However, in the four years which followed no further progress was made. On becoming Minister again in 1987 I asked the National Pensions Board to prepare a detailed, carefully costed report for me and in July, on the basis of my proposals the Government took the decision in principle to extend social insurance to the self-employed from April 1988.  This decision was later reaffirmed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I then had a series of discussions on the issue with delegations from the various organisations representing the self-employed. In these discussions careful note was taken of the views and concerns expressed and these were taken into consideration in drawing up my proposals for Government.  On 14 January I received the report from the National Pensions Board and final Gopvernment approval for the introduction of the scheme was given without delay.</P>
    <P>Thus a process which began with the publication of a Green Paper on the issue nearly ten years ago has been brought to completion within a matter of a few months.  The importance of this achievement must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The main focus in the debate on this issue to date has been on what the proposed scheme will cost the self-employed <Col N="814" /> and the general taxpayer.  I believe, as Minister for Social Welfare, however, that it is far more important to focus on the benefits it will bring.  Under the scheme social insurance cover will be extended to the self-employed for old age and widows and orphans pensions.  After three years a self-employed man who is married will have provided for his family an entitlement to a State guaranteed non-means tested widow's and orphan's pension in the event of his death.  In the course of my political life I have seen far too many cases of widows of self-employed people left left without any independent income as a result of the premature death of their husband and being forced to have recourse to a means tested pension.  The experience of these cases over the years was a major influence on me in pushing for the extension of social insurance to the self-employed. Under the proposed scheme these situations will no longer arise as the widows of the self-employed will have the same rights to a basic pension without a means test as widows of employed persons. Thus, the rate of pension payable will not be affected by the value of whatever assets they have on their husband's death and their pension payments will not reduce if they wish to obtain extra income from employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>Under the old age pension scheme self-employed persons will obtain entitlement to a basic pension as of right when they reach age 66.  In the case of those who have never been insured before, full entitlement to a pension will be obtained where a minimum period of ten years insurance has been completed before pension age.  Those already within ten years of pension age but who have previous insurance as an employed person, may also acquire entitlement to a pension under the proposed scheme as it will be possible to combine all the periods of insurance completed for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme proposed the self-employed will for the first time be required to make a direct contribution to the cost of social welfare pensions.  It is projected that this will significantly reduce the burden on the taxpayer, not <Col N="815" /> just in the early years when income for contributions will greatly exceed the benefits being paid out under the scheme, but also over the long term.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by some commentators to the fact that in introducing this scheme the Government are placing an extra burden on the general taxpayer and that in time the proposed new arrangements will cost the Exchequer more than continuing the existing arrangements.  The National Pensions Board in their report estimated that just continuing the existing arrangements for self-employed persons who could qualify for non-contributory pensions in the coming years would cost £45 million after five years, rising to over £200 million after 25 years.  The additional cost of the proposed new arrangements, however, will in fact be £6 million after five years and will not exceed £100 million in real terms at any stage within the next 50 years.  It has been a major objective of the Government that the income received from the contributions which the self-employed will be required to pay will, over time, exceed the additional cost of the new scheme.  The Government are satisfied that the rate of contribution set is in line with this objective.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme of social insurance for the self-employed was announced there have been suggestions that the scheme should be an optional one, that is that people who are better off should be allowed to opt out if they chose to do so.  I had considered this possibility but I came to the conclusion that such an arrangement would be totally unworkable. The essence of a social insurance scheme is that it is comprehensive and all embracing.  All must contribute &mdash; the good risks as well as the bad.  If the choice of opting out were to be allowed the scheme would not be viable unless levels of contribution were to be raised to a totally unrealistic level for the reduced numbers participating.  The only alternative would be a substantially increased net cost to the taxpayer.  I am satisfied that a scheme containing a provision for opting out would be unrealistic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I would now like to turn to the phasing in arrangements for contributions.  At a time of severe economic difficulty, the Government felt they could not impose straightaway a high contribution on the self-employed.  There are undoubtedly many self-employed persons who could pay the full contribution immediately but there are many more for whom the sudden introduction of the full level of contribution would have created hardship. The Government decided, therefore, that a phasing in arrangement was essential, given the position many self-employed persons find themselves in as a result of the current economic situation. Phasing in is also necessary to enable self-employed persons with private pension cover to adjust their level of cover and the contributions they are paying to take account of the PRSI pension cover they will now be acquiring.  The rate of contribution will, as announced by the Minister for Finance, be 3 per cent for the 1988-89 income tax year, 4 per cent for 1989-90 and 5 per cent for 1990-91.  The contribution will be levied on income assessable for tax and the percentage rate of contribution will be subject to minimum contribution of £4 per week.</P>
    <P>The minimum contribution of £4 per week was recommended by the National Pensions Board.  It is necessary in the case of the self-employed mainly because capital allowances are deductible for PRSI purposes and self-employed persons with high capital allowances who would otherwise have a reasonable or even high level of income could end up paying a very small PRSI contribution or none at all.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Government have accepted the view of the National Pensions Board that it is necessary to have a system of flat-rate contributions for those whose incomes are not being regularly assessed for income tax by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Government concluded that a flat-rate contribution of £4 per week equivalent to the minimum contribution would not be justified for lower income people and have set the level of flat-rate contribution at £2 per week. <Col N="817" /> Smallholders on unemployment assistance will not be required to contribute to the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is the basic outline of the new system as it will apply to self-employed persons from April next.  The necessary detailed measures to give effect to the new scheme will be included in legislation which I will be bringing before the Oireachtas in the coming weeks.  I look forward to a detailed discussion of the proposals at that stage and I am confident that my proposals will receive support from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues in the social welfare area that I would like to mention.  The first relates to the family income supplement scheme which is designed to help lower paid workers with families.  In line with our commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, I am having a detailed examination of the family income supplement scheme carried out in order to identify any adjustments to the scheme that may be required.  Deputies will recall that we made significant improvements to this scheme last year.  The present family income supplement weekly payments are quite significant.  For example, a family with five children on an income of less than £192 per week could be entitled to a weekly payment of £44 per week.  The effectiveness of the scheme in meeting its objectives is being examined and I expect to receive a report shortly.</P>
    <P>Another area of significance for my Department is the national Jobsearch programme.  Deputies will recall that it was in last year's budget that the announcement was made to launch the national Jobsearch programme nationwide. Prior to that it had been piloted in three locations and the results of an independent evaluation convinced the Government that it should be extended throughout the whole country.  Specific targets were set by the Government in relation to the number to be interviewed and the provision of placements on schemes and courses including the Jobsearch course itself.  There was no doubt last April when the new scheme became operational that the task facing the State <Col N="818" /> agencies involved was a massive one. Never before had those agencies been required to organise and co-ordinate their activities to such an extent in the interests of the long term unemployed.  I am glad to have the opportunity with the end of year returns to hand to pay tribute to the staff of AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the employment exchanges of my Department for their respective contributions to the success achieved.</P>
    <P>The national Jobsearch programme has been an innovative approach to the problem of assisting the long term unemployed. Its benefits, however, go far beyond those who are out of work.  It has also had a major impact on those who are in employment in their capacity as taxpayers.  There have been considerable savings in expenditure resulting from this programme.  The impact of the Jobsearch course on the long term unemployed has also been very encouraging.  In a survey carried out last September when the programme was in full swing 76 per cent of those surveyed said they found the Jobsearch course useful, that is three out of every four, while 72 per cent said that the course gave them more confidence in looking for a job.  These findings confirm the value of the scheme in terms of overcoming the particular problems of motivation, confidence and isolation experienced by the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In a number of ways, therefore, the national Jobsearch programme is a major success story for this Government's initiatives for the long term unemployed. It has been of direct assistance to many thousands in their search for work; it has ensured that the manpower resources of the State are deployed in a unified and co-ordinated manner towards the provision of services for the unemployed; and it has resulted in a considerable number of people leaving the live register when offered an interview for a job or place on a manpower scheme.</P>
    <P>The success of Jobsearch in 1987 has convinced the Government that it should be continued in 1988 along broadly similar lines.  Proposals for 1988 envisage that <Col N="819" /> a further 50,000 people will undergo the Jobsearch interview and that a total of 42,000 places on mainline FÁS courses and schemes will be made available on a priority basis for these and those who did not secure a placement in 1987.  In addition, a further 14,000 places will be provided on Jobsearch courses, thus making a total of 56,000 places in all.</P>
    <P>I would like now to say a few words about another initiative in relation to the longterm unemployed, namely, the part-time job allowance scheme.  This scheme, which up to now has only operated on a very limited basis, is an attempt to move away from some of the more restrictive rules of the unemployment payments system and introduce a degree of flexibility for unemployed persons.  It provides those out of work with an opportunity to seek and take up part time employment as a realistic alternative to remaining unemployed.  The objective of the scheme is to allow those who can obtain part time work the opportunity to do so while still retaining entitlement to a basic payment of income supplement from my Department.  Participants in the scheme may work up to 24 hours a week and earnings are subject to tax and PRSI in the normal way.  Details of the new expanded scheme are being finalised and it will be launched nationwide in April. I am arranging to have it promoted in conjunction with the National Jobsearch programme both in the context of it being an additional option for persons to consider at the counselling interview and as an additional feature of the Jobsearch course itself.  Provision has already been made in the 1988 Estimates for the proposed extension.</P>
    <P>The basic payment from my Department to participants in the scheme up to now was £25 in the case of single persons and £40 in the case of a married person with a dependant.  The Government have decided that the basic payment be increased to £45 per week for a married couple, and £27 per week for a single person.</P>
    <P>The last number of years has seen a change in the pattern of working in the <Col N="820" /> labour force; one of the most notable features in this regard has been the increase in the extent of part-time working. I believe that we need to be able to respond to such changes and I am convinced that the part time job allowance scheme will go a long way to meeting that need.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the unemployment payment system, where I believe we also need flexibility, is in relation to the elderly unemployed on the live register.  It is a fact of life that employment opportunities for the elderly unemployed are slight and on the other side of the coin that most of them are not interested in rejoining the workforce and would already regard themselves as semiretired. In order to receive their weekly unemployment payments, they also are required to sign on once a week at a local office of my Department.  This undoubtedly causes expenses, inconvenience and often hardship.  I believe that we can and should do better for our elderly unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have been considering a scheme which would allow persons aged 60 years or over who have been in receipt of unemployment payments for a certain minimum period to receive a pre-retirement pension equivalent to their unemployment payment which would be paid at local post offices by means of a pension order book.  This would give them the option to receive their payments in a different way without the obligations attached to their present payments.  I hope to be in a position to announce details of a scheme on these lines in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to another initiative in my campaign to crack down on abuse of the social welfare system. Just before Christmas I introduced a range of measures aimed at eliminating abuses of the social welfare system by employers.  These include measures which deal with attempts by employers to evade their responsibility to collect and remit PRSI contributions.  Most employers are exemplary in these matters and they have nothing to fear from the new measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> However, a small but increasingly significant number of unscrupulous employers are encouraging their employees to operate in what I would call the &ldquo;twilight zone&rdquo;.  Where an employer does not deduct PRSI it can amount to a passive encouragement or invitation to work and sign.  And, of course, the employer then hopes he can avoid paying the proper rate for the job.  In effect, he expects taxpayers to subsidise him against the vast body of law-abiding firms and to assist him in undercutting his competitors.</P>
    <P>This problem tends to be concentrated in particular sectors of the economy and I am embarking, in co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners on a nationwide clampdown on firms that openly and persistently try to ignore their obligations. Two weeks ago for the first time two employer directors were successfully prosecuted under existing legislation for aiding and abetting their employees in working and claiming unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>This investigation was carried out by a new joint investigation unit comprising officers of my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  The provisions introduced before Christmas will strengthen our hand in pursuing abuses of this kind and will provide for penalties of up to three years imprisonment or fines of £10,000 or both.  This new unit has already cracked down on many of these &ldquo;twilight&rdquo; firms in Dublin.  Some of those firms would like to present an image of honesty and integrity.  Some are operating as security firms; others seem to believe that they can get public moneys for work, for example, in the forestry sector while they fail to pay proper wages and to insure their workers.</P>
    <P>Using the joint forces of the Revenue and Social Welfare inspectorates, these firms are being forced to reveal the details of their activities including the use of subcontractors.</P>
    <P>Since the Dublin unit was set up it has detected 155 cases of working and signing.  As a result fraudulent claims with a total weekly cost of more than £8,000 were stopped in their tracks.  In <Col N="822" /> many cases these were employees of firms that had evaded detection until the joint unit caught up with them.  Many of these firms are now registered with the Revenue Commissioners and this will help them stay on the straight and narrow in the future.  The unit has unearthed arrears of unpaid tax and PRSI totalling £400,000 and well over half of this has already been collected.</P>
    <P>Over the coming weeks, I will be arranging for the reassignment of 15 staff in my Department to work directly with tax inspectors in a nationwide campaign. By this action I hope to demonstrate the serious intent behind the new legislative measures and to remove from the system the abuses in which some unscrupulous employers are engaged.  This unit has been particularly successful in its pilot phase and I have no doubt that it will result in the saving of several millions of pounds once it goes nationwide with a very small number of staff.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the developments in social welfare which have been provided for in the budget.  By any standard the measures being introduced represent a very major achievement.  Looking at what has been achieved by reference in particular to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare Deputies will recall the four main areas for priority attention identified by the commission, namely:</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving the basic payment for those in receipt of the lowest payment levels;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving the level of income support for families;</P>
    <P>&mdash;broadening the social insurance base;</P>
    <P>&mdash;improving the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>Each of these four priority areas is being addressed in a major way by the Government.  I have outlined the very significant increases in the lowest rates of payment, which were provided in the budget.  The streamlining of child dependant increases together with the additional increases for child dependants in the case of persons on the lowest payments represent a major improvement in <Col N="823" /> income support for families.  The introduction of social insurance for the self-employed represents precisely the sort of broadening of the social insurance base which was recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Indeed, when we look at the money allocated in the budget we find that if we were to give the 3 per cent only to the long term unemployed and those on supplementary welfare, it would have cost in a full year £23 million.  Because we have given a greater emphasis to those people on account of their very low income position the cost in a full year would be £53 million.  Therefore, in effect we are giving an extra £30 million per annum to those on the lowest payments.  I believe this is a highly significant step on the part of the Government and, of course, I welcome it warmly.</P>
    <P>Finally, as far as improving the quality of the services is concerned, I have referred on a number of occasions previously to the measures which have been and are being taken to streamline and improve in a major way over the coming years the administration of the social welfare system so as to make it fairer, more efficient and more effective for users.  A major element of this is the proposals for a more localised system of delivering services and the greater development of computerisation within the Department.</P>
    <P>We are currently engaged in computerising the employment exchanges for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  We have already completed unemployment assistance in all the Dublin branches and the unemployment benefit has been computerised in five of the 13 Dublin exchanges at this time.  We have also begun this process in Cork and will shortly be going to other centres throughout the country.  Once these payments have been computerised it will make the whole system much more flexible, reduce the pressure on the staff in the exchanges and make it possible to cater more effectively and efficiently in a way in which the staff will have more time to spare for the individual clients <Col N="824" /> who come in to discuss their position with them.</P>
    <P>Computerisation in that sense can have a major benefit and can be of great assistance. It also means that many of the claims can be sorted out right at the outset by reference to the information system in the computer which can give information on the various other schemes and programmes, for instance, the number of children involved, the status of the spouse in the case of a claim where these are involved, and thus avoid difficulties and problems arising and errors in claims at the outset.</P>
    <P>A localised service will mean that over the coming years all social welfare clients will be able to claim or obtain information on their entitlements locally.  This new style arrangement will be based on the one-stop shop concept and this will give the public access to a much more comprehensive and co-ordinated service. Closer working relationships will also be established at local level with FÁS, the health boards and other agencies.  The process of review of the social welfare system is an ongoing one, and in formulating further proposals for reform and development of the system I will continue to take into account the recommendations of the commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I am interested in particular, as I have already said, in introducing greater flexibility into the system of payments for the unemployed.  The developments which I have announced in relation to the part-time job allowance scheme and the introduction of a pre-retirement scheme for older unemployed people are examples of the sort of thing I have in mind.  I will also be looking at the further development of the educational opportunities scheme, the voluntary work scheme for the unemployed and other measures in the unemployment payments area in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I believe there is considerable scope in the educational opportunities scheme and I will be discussing some of this scope with my colleagues the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Education, Deputy Mary <Col N="825" /> O'Rourke.  The voluntary works scheme offers many opportunities which so far are not being taken up and I will be consulting with the voluntary groups and bodies in the social services and community area to ensure that they know the value of this scheme and its potential for them.  In that way I hope to see an improvement in the take-up of this scheme.  I will be devoting a good deal of attention to it in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am very happy with the major improvements which have been provided in this budget.  The implementation of these measures will bring about a social welfare system which is more comprehensive in terms of coverage and payment levels, more responsive to those in greatest need and more flexible in the way it responds to the real requirements of social welfare recipients.  Notwithstanding the current economic difficulties, the Government are ensuring that the needs of the less well off in our society are being recognised and catered for in an imaginative and meaningful way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking in this budget debate I will concentrate mainly on the provisions, or lack of provisions, for education and on how the budget leaves the education sector now that the Estimates and budget can be examined together. Before doing that I would like to comment on one or two other areas, particularly some of those mentioned by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I will start with some comments in the speech of the Minister for Finance introducing the budget on 27 January when he said:</P>
      <P>At last, there are solid grounds for optimism.  For several years there has been a prevailing lack of confidence which was essentially due to the belief that we did not have the capacity or the discipline to correct our public finances, and protect and develop the economy properly in the face of severe difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That passage from the last paragraph in the Minister's speech was delivered in a sort of Messianic tone which combined <Col N="826" /> aggression and fervour in equal measure. I noticed as he came to the end of his speech that the decibels ascended in direct proportion to the flimsiness of the case he was making.  The Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and their Government are well aware that the lack of confidence which the Minister deplored on 27 January was due mainly to the blind refusal of Fianna Fáil to cooperate in undoing the crippling damage they had inflicted on the financial stability of this country between 1977 and 1981. The lack of confidence was engendered by their consistent votes against any proposals for saving between December 1982 and December 1986.</P>
    <P>I want to make a further point which I will not labour too much.  If Fianna Fáil had behaved since 1982 as Fine Gael are behaving now the country would be four years closer to full recovery and a great deal of the pain which the population have to endure now from Fianna Fáil would not have been necessary. However, the greed for power was too great.  It transcended the national interest, so Fianna Fáil consigned more young people to the dole queues and single tickets to Boston and Sydney because they could not bear to agree that Fine Gael analyses, activities and actions to deal with the national financial crisis were right.  I must mention that because I felt the last paragraph of the Minister's speech on 27 January was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Taking the budget provisions, Fine Gael have already, in the speech of our spokesperson Deputy Michael Noonan, cautioned the Government on the PRSI proposal which the Minister for Social Welfare has mentioned at some length.  That proposal purports to save the taxpayer money by bringing a further 230,000 people into the social insurance system.  We have pointed out something that the Minister for Finance did not really bother to refer to in any detail, the calculations by the National Pensions Board about rates, about the collection of the moneys and the efficiency of collection. I repeat the call made by Deputy Noonan that there must be proof given <Col N="827" /> to the Irish taxpayer that this is not a trick-of-the-loop and that a short-term financial gain to the Exchequer does not carry within it the seeds of further financial drain along the road as claimants pile up and contributions do not match them. I am not at all assured by the rather convoluted statement of the Minister for Social Welfare on this issue today.  Fine Gael take this issue most seriously and we require proof that the Government have not embarked on this process in order to pacify the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> while selling the PAYE taxpayers a false notion of equity which will only rebound on them in the end.</P>
    <P>In listening to the Minister for Social Welfare just now, I was very interested on how many different areas he touched on.  He spoke about the Jobsearch scheme which he neglected to mention was designed and launched by me as Minister for Social Welfare.  I am glad that the Government are continuing that scheme, although it would be nice if they mentioned the fact that they had nothing to do with its launching.  However, I believe that a very serious follow up programme should be initiated for all those who joined training courses or schemes as a result of the Jobsearch initiative. The Minister for Labour who is sitting opposite knows that there is such a serious problem of long term unemployment in this country that the Government have to consistently research and develop new ways of helping those people not only to undertake some activity but to keep activity going.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I see no evidence of originality of thinking by the Minister for Social Welfare or the Government.  None of the schemes either in the Jobsearch area or in the combating of abuse area is original.  They were set up and initiated by me as Minister in conjunction with my colleagues in Government and also the National Pensions Board and the joint Revenue-Social Welfare task force on abuse for which the Minister has claimed such credit even in his speech.  The <Col N="828" /> Government had nothing to do with such innovations as the new printing systems, the family income supplement scheme, the part-time job allowance scheme and the educational opportunities scheme so rather than claim credit for many schemes they had nothing to do with, they should take very seriously the need to keep updating and progressing our enormous, unwieldly and creaking social welfare system for the benefit of the consumer, the real poor and the really needy. I hope we will see some originality because we have not seen any yet.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister for Social Welfare joy with the pre-retirement scheme he says he hopes to introduce.  I will confess to this House that I had hoped to introduce it, too, but I ran into great difficulties with the trade union movement who did not want a situation whereby these elderly people could go to post offices for their payments or have them sent out to them.  We had great difficulty with that because the trade unions within the Department would not allow that to happen.  I hope that the Minister will be able to solve that problem for the sake of those elderly people who should be able to be accommodated in this way.  Having said all that, I am glad that the Government have taken up the schemes and ideas we initiated and are carrying them on.</P>
    <P>An area which was mentioned also in the budget was the new 6 per cent tax on pension funds.  I notice that this is referred to as a tax and not a levy and I am glad that it was referred to as a once-off tax on pension funds.  There are a great many questions which arise from that provision, questions which must concern that PAYE worker, the person who hopes he is funding his pension out of taxed income and who hopes to be able to retire in some security.</P>
    <P>Does the 6 per cent tax on investment income include realised capital gains? That is one question that should be answered.  How are capital gains to be calculated &mdash; from the date of legislation or from 1 January 1988?  These are questions which people are asking and a great many firms and pension fund managers <Col N="829" /> started to ask them as soon as the budget speech was over.  Will capital losses be allowed against this 6 per cent tax and, if so, from what date?  Has this scheme been fully thought out or is it half thought out? Who will be responsible for paying the tax &mdash; will it be the trustees of the pension funds, the investment managers or insurance companies?</P>
    <P>An interesting sidelight on the question of taxation of pension funds is that, of course, the Government do not fund their pension system.  The Government behave as we do not expect pension fund managers to behave.  The Government pay pensions out of current spending whereas the pension fund managers who have been so responsible as to fund their pension liabilities are going to suffer now because they are going to be taxed on having built up those funds while successive Governments have not made such provisions and have left themselves in great difficulties which are growing because they were not so provident.  I am sure that when pension fund managers consider that irony they must consider it a bitter pill to swallow.  Naturally the pension fund managers are asking if this is a once-off levy.  If it is not, there will be considerable dangers, for example, it would increase the cost of funding the pensions.  That would initially affect companies but, of course, it will all come back to the PAYE worker who will be affected &mdash; either his pension will be less or he will pay more for his pension.  Those are more questions which have to be answered.</P>
    <P>In the prospectus which sells Government stocks, the Minister for Finance states that any appreciation of stock will be free of capital gains tax.  That is held out as an attractive carrot for people who are investing in Government stocks.  Is the Minister, as a result of putting a 6 per cent tax on pension funds because many pension funds invest a gilt edge stocks, proposing to default on that undertaking which is stated in the prospectus for selling Government stocks?  That is an extremely important question and will, of course, affect people's views on buying Government stocks.  Those are a range <Col N="830" /> of questions on the 6 per cent tax on pension funds which I hope a Government spokesperson will come into this House and answer very shortly during the course of this debate.  I do not know why we have debates if Government spokespeople do not come in and answer the questions that are raised by other people. Those are very clear questions which are now on the record and I ask that they be answered very shortly by a Government spokesperson.  I do not expect the Minister for Labour to answer them immediately because I have only just asked them but I would like to be answered very soon.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to education.  It is an area which, with over £1 billion expenditure, is central to any budget discussion. I am afraid I have to say that a complete mess was made of it in 1987 and continues to be made of it in 1988.  The record of the Government in the education area since the publication of the 1988 Estimates in October is one of blunder, confusion, and retreat.  They have retreated already in three areas: primary school cuts, school transport cuts and school building cuts.  It now looks as if another retreat on vocational cuts is underway and all of these retreats have already apparently cost us over £20 million. We are seeing now the bitter results of decisions which were made last summer and which have caused massive disruption and discontent.  They have done so because they were fundamentally wrong decisions and the Government refused to listen to this when it was pointed out immediately the Estimates were published.  They were identified clearly by Fine Gael and other parties as being wrong decisions.  The cuts brought the parents of this country out into the streets in unprecedented displays of anger.  When these cuts were brought to the Floor of the Dáil they resulted in the first defeat for the Government.</P>
    <P>The budget has belatedly attempted to correct one or two of these mistakes while the Taoiseach continually steps in to persuade teacher unions to come to the discussion table and uses yet another review group as a carrot.  Since the Government <Col N="831" /> came to office we have seen the establishment of no less than four major bodies, committees, commissions or councils.  They were the Curriculum Advisory Council, the Primary Curriculum Review Body, the Primary Quota Review Committee and the Review Body on Primary Education. Now there is talk of another new body on post-primary education.  This is making a joke of education policy and planning. The decent, concerned people who have been invited to sit on these bodies are being asked to mop up after the unholy mess created by this Minister and this Government since they took office.  It is time to take a hard look at what is going on in Marlborough Street.  It is time to get a steady hand on the education tiller before more damage is done.  It is time to see if the present political leadership in education is capable of putting right the damage already done and of bringing forward the kind of dynamic education policy which is so desperately needed. The signs in those areas are all negative.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance was selective.  He referred to £6.5 million being restored to school buildings.  The Minister was told long before the budget that he could not strip all school building money out of the Estimates as it would not be possible to have people in rat infested buildings which needed emergency repairs.  The Government would not listen and finally when many schools had despaired they restored the £6.5 million.  The Minister was too shy to mention the £3.8 million restored to school transport.  Presumably that was because he did not like to sully the record with a reminder of the incompetence of the Government in deciding to cut £6.5 million from school transport in the summer of 1987.  That decision was taken without the faintest idea as to the policy decision needed to back it up.</P>
    <P>I asked many Dáil questions about this since it was announced in October and I got total evasion.  For example, I put down a question on 3 November, following the failure of the Minister to answer questions in my Estimate speech <Col N="832" /> of 21 October, and the Minister told me on 3 November that she was finalising the proposals for using the £6.5 million and that they would be circulated very shortly.  Of course, they were never circulted because there never were any proposals for saving £6.5 million.  It was quite clear that even by 3 November the Government had not realised the implications for parents and children of the £6.5 million, even though the implications had been pointed out to them by me on several occasions and by others who understood the school transport system better than the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did the same thing in November 1982.  If the Minister opposite will cast his mind back to the Book of Estimates then published he will remember that it announced a cut of over £2 million for school transport and there was no policy decision then either.  In their usual manner Fianna Fáil turned around and bluntly opposed the measures and policy decisions made by the incoming Government in order to reach their financial targets.  That set the tone of Fianna Fáil Opposition for the following four years.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech last week the Minister did not mention that more than £4 million has been taken from the teachers pay bill at post primary level for 1988 as a result of the unexpected savings in 1987, so the vocational, community and comprehensive schools are facing the threat of losing hundreds of teachers from September 1988, because the Government seem to be pursuing that cut &mdash; or are they?  We do not know.  Last Sunday's and Monday's newspapers make interesting reading.  Side by side with the accounts of an angry and worried 12,000 vocational school parents descending <i>en masse</i> on Athlone, there were reports of the Taoiseach going to meet anxious union leaders in vital talks to discuss problems arising from the proposed changes in the pupil teacher ratio.  No wonder the Minister for Finance did not mention teacher pay in his speech.  He must be aware that another fudge is coming up as a result of Cabinet bungling in education. Should we add back another £3.8 million <Col N="833" /> to the pay provision at post-primary level, or is this budget for real?  It would be infinitely preferable if the Government would now announce that they could find £4 million in &ldquo;a better way&rdquo; before the country and their own backbenchers are once more thrown into chaos and confusion.</P>
    <P>On the primary side, all the committees, commissions and councils in the world will not tell the ordinary parents and taxpayers one simple thing.  Is the £6.3 million which is to be saved from the application of Circular 20/87 in or out of the budget?  Is the primary sector to lose about 1,000 teachers from July 1988? Here we have the prime example of stupidity. The Taoiseach trumpets to the world on 22 December that there will be a total review of the primary sector.  The INTO, happily for the Taoiseach, climb on board.  The country assumes that Circular 20/87 is effectively buried.  But, in another part of the forest the Minister for Finance is giving an interview to <i>Business and Finance</i> on 17 December where in his usual &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; style he announces, referring to Circular 20/87:</P>
    <P>We will see the whole thing through to June next, and it will take effect as from September.</P>
    <P>We will hold the line...</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and much more in that vein.  The Minister also said in relation to Circular 20/87:</P>
    <P>... when we talk about deferral to June of its implementation, that is only deferral of putting people on panel. Nobody is going to be out of a job ... until September next, the beginning of the school year ...  We have that much time to ensure we are getting the savings that we are looking for on this particular section of the Budget estimates.</P>
    <P>And if we don't, we have said quite clearly that they will come from other areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said one thing, the Taoiseach, the INTO and the <Col N="834" /> parents are saying another.  Who is telling the truth?</P>
    <P>Just before the budget the composition of the latest review group &mdash; the Taoiseach's brainchild &mdash; was announced on 22 January and it is to be chaired by the much respected Dr. Thomas Murphy, a man I have known for many years.  I do not envy him the job he has undertaken. How can he read the mind of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance?  It is clear that the Government or perhaps the Taoiseach are giving an impression to teachers and parents that Circular 20/87 has been safely seen off the premises, or will be so watered down as to have virtually no effect and, so, the 1,130 teachers who have applied for voluntary redundancy either will not get it or will be replaced.  Are we to assume that somehow another £6.3 will be found and, if so, how?  Does this budget stand up at all?</P>
    <P>No time limit has been set for the primary review.  The teachers journal <i>Turascail</i> tells us clearly that the review body will make a progress report before Easter 1988 and that it will report not to the Minister for Education but to the Government.  However, yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> said that the review could take up to two years and that it would allow the circular concerning the increase in class sizes to be suspended indefinitely.</P>
    <P>In that same article we are told of yet another review to be launched, one on post-primary education.  In another report on the same page of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; somebody was very busy giving that paper much interesting information &mdash; we are told the Taoiseach is to meet the teachers' unions and what is he going to discuss?  The pupil-teacher ratio.  We have a type of dance of the seven veils &mdash; now you see a cut, now you do not.  The Minister steps out, the Taoiseach steps in.  Who is running Education?  Is Education running at all?  While all these groups and commissions fall over themselves clearing up the Government's embarrassment, while the Minister for Finance squares up to the Taoiseach, the <Col N="835" /> desperately needed reforms and initiatives go by the board and nothing is happening in Marlborough Street.</P>
    <P>In the crisis in third level, who is taking initiatives there, while the Minister tries to placate, justifiably I am afraid, the parents and teachers?  With regard to the crisis in language learning, while Europe approaches full economic integration in 1992, four short years away, where is the new thinking, the new European dimension in mobility, the tools which will help us to take advantage of the market of 350 million people on our doorstep divided from us by language?  It has been raised by more and more Irish educators, most recently by Mr. Pat Diggins in a very interesting paper which he gave in Cork. It was also raised by the President, Edward Walsh, of the NIHE, Limerick. It has also been raised in the British education system.  We are not the only country deeply concerned about this issue. The British authorities are extremely concerned about the need there for an initiative in language learning.</P>
    <P>What is happening in that area?  The Minister, in a parliamentary answer to me recently, did not accept that there was a problem.  When will she remove the barriers which stand in the way of economic and scientific research and development in the RTCs?  When will the chaos surrounding third level entry requirements be resolved by introducing one CAO system so that all the leaving certificate students can apply on one form for any third level place?  There was a committee working on that issue when we left office.  What happened to it?  Who will force the third level colleges into fuller utilisation of their buildings 12 months a year, in order to alleviate the numbers crisis?  Are the Minister and the Government happy to see the initial flow of our brightest and best to English colleges grow to a flood?  There is so much to be done.  The record is disastrous this year and the budget does nothing to alleviate it.  Targeting the weakest and the poorest has been shown to be not only grotesque, as I have said before in the context of a general wage increase <Col N="836" /> given to public servants, but the Government have also shown themselves to be flat-footed in trying to undo the damage.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the budget would provide the opportunity for the Government to restore the <i>status quo</i> in the PTR at both levels, so that all this confusion would be put aside and we could see a Minister for Education actually doing what a Minister is supposed to do &mdash; directing and developing a progressive education system.  We have not had such a thing since March 1987.  The education world has taken a broad range of major cuts.  It has taken most of them on board and has not complained.  It has accepted most of these very swingeing cuts which were dealt out to them in March and particularly in October.  They have decided responsibly to put up with the worry and difficulties caused by most of these cuts in the national interest but there have been a few which were serious mistakes, were unacceptable and contradicted not only educational good sense but the Government's own aspirations as set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which promised in the education sector that the disadvantaged would not bear the burden of financial adjustments.  They proceeded, five days later, on 13 October, to contradict that and flout it in its very essence.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government are most carefully examining other proposed cuts which may have carried great threats within them.  I am very concerned, for example, about the effects on the small Church of Ireland schools which may lose so many teachers as a result of being reduced to five years that they may have to close.  We all know that the Church of Ireland Bishop, Dr. Caird, is not a man given to hyperbole or exaggeration.  He has made his position of extreme concern very clear.  We must remember that in small rural Church of Ireland schools lie the only hope for very many people of very low income to have their children educated in their own religion.  That is one area that is of extreme concern and it should be carefully looked at.</P>
    <P>The year 1988 begins with education in turmoil, with no policy initiatives of any <Col N="837" /> kind on the horizon.  It is, unfortunately &mdash; and I am sorry to say this &mdash; one of the failure areas of this Government and it is too important to let that failure continue. I repeat my call for a steady hand and a clear head in education before it is too late to undo the damage which has been done.  I wish I could have made a budget speech which would have been more positive and that I could have been able to look on the bright side of education but given the confusion which exists now, the duplication of effort, the crossing of lines, the Cabinet splits, there is nothing very much in a positive line that one can say.  I hope this Government can clear up this mass of confusion very shortly so that education can be put back on a steady road to progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget prepared and implemented last year by this Government, immediately after they took office, represented the essential starting point for economic recovery.  We not only ensured that we kept within the allocations laid down in that budget; we went further and published the Estimates for 1988 in October last &mdash; the first time ever that that was achieved &mdash; well in advance of the current financial year.  The negotiation and ratification of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represented a further step towards restoring the country to economic health.  The budget we have now framed is consistent with both those steps and with the 1987 budget which first outlined this Government's strategy.  It has involved tough decisions in the national interest.  It is responsible and constructive and it faces squarely the challenges posed by continuing high unemployment.</P>

    <P>Already, the commentators have been unanimous in recognising that the Government's strategy is firmly on course.  Each careful step has taken us some distance away from the precipice we faced when this Government took office last March.  The problems of the economy are being tackled.  This has led to the restoration of confidence in our being able to work towards a better <Col N="838" /> future, increased employment and improving living standards.</P>
    <P>In response to the Government's determination to take the necessary action to restore order to the public finances, the social partners took an unprecedented step in shaping a consensus on the measures which have to be taken to tackle our current economic and social difficulties.  This Government have held firm in their commitment to the resolution of these problems through partnership and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Consensus is not an easy option.  It is never on tap, to be turned on when it is needed.  It has to be worked at.  It calls for constantly renewed efforts on all sides in order to moderate sectional interests and to combine our energies effectively to surmount new difficulties.  It is clear that at each critical stage so far the strategy has held firm.  This budget has been seen as further confirmation of the Government's willingness to fulfil their commitment and to extend and strengthen that consensus.</P>
    <P>An important part of building consensus is to ensure that a consistent strategy is being implemented in all areas.  I would like to take this opportunity of considering this budget in the light of the implementation of the Government's strategy in relation to developments in the labour market; the special employment and training programmes to assist the unemployed; the promotion of necessary changes in industrial relations practice and procedures, and the kind of measures needed to encourage companies to realise the potential of their employees at management and shop floor levels.  The Government are taking action in all of these areas which will help to create sustainable employment in the future.</P>
    <P>The last year saw a levelling off and even a slight decline in unemployment after years of steady increases.  The seasonally adjusted live register in December 1987 was some 5,000 lower than in the early part of the year.  Youth unemployment fell from 76,600 in December 1986 to 71,100 in December 1987.  We are not resting, as the previous Governments <Col N="839" /> did for so long, on the weary recitation of quarterly changes.  We have taken action which will go straight to the root of the problems of youth unemployment and of long term unemployment among adults.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing features of unemployment in recent years has been the even more rapid rise in long term unemployment.  For this reason, I am particularly pleased that the figures showed a fall in the second half of last year.  Between April and October, the number of people who were registered as unemployed for over a year fell by some 2,400.  This shows the effects of Government measures such as Jobsearch, which was introduced to increase the assistance given to the long term unemployed under employment and training programmes.</P>
    <P>We have provided significant increases in social welfare payments for people who are long-term unemployed.  The higher increases in long-term benefits are a direct response to the plight of people living on unemployment assistance, the majority of whom have been out of employment for more than 15 months. These elements of the budget have been readily acknowledged as a significant step towards the implementation of the social equity provisions of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Programmes for the unemployed have been given a new impetus and a clear priority within FÁS.  This is particularly the case as regards the long-term unemployed. Despite the tight financial strictures which have necessitated a reduction in the overall Exchequer allocation for the training and employment services compared with 1987, we will be able to increase the activity levels in respect of this group in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Labour Services Act, 1987, replaced AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service with a single organisation, FÁS, with effect from 1 January 1988.  I have asked FÁS to develop their programmes in two broad directions and I have had a number of meetings with their executives on these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> FÁS will facilitate, to the greatest degree possible, access for unemployed people to the jobs that are available, and to the wide range of options involving training or places on employment and enterprise schemes.  I have told FÁS that their priority task is to provide programmes for those people who by reason of their educational disadvantage or long duration of unemployment have particular difficulty in obtaining suitable work or training.  The great bulk of their resources and their activities as a programme provider will be devoted to the needs of the long-term unemployed and of those young entrants who experience particular difficulties starting out in the labour market.</P>
    <P>I have also told FÁS that they should encourage employers to adopt a more positive approach toward training and towards bringing about an increase in the amount of training carried out in industry and in the services sector.  The budget strategy reflects the Government's view that economic activity must not be overreliant on the State.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger that State aid can lead in the end to substituting for what employers would otherwise have done themselves.  It has been suggested in some quarters that State support for apprenticeships has produced this effect. It is now widely accepted that a radical new approach to providing craft training is necessary to meet the demands of modern flexible career patterns as the pace of technological change increases. We all have a responsibility to ensure that the economic recovery which is within our grasp will not be held back by any problems in ensuring the availability of a skilled and adaptable labour force.</P>
    <P>The main purpose behind the establishment of FÁS was to provide a more co-ordinated and integrated approach in our manpower services.  I have, accordingly, asked the organisation to provide me with an early indication of their proposals in four main areas.</P>
    <P>First, how they propose to improve the delivery, content and cost-effectiveness of training and job creation programmes. I want this examination to include an <Col N="841" /> examination of whether or not each existing programme should continue, or be reduced, modified or abolished.  Secondly, what needs to be done to rationalise existing programmes and to ensure no unnecessary overlap as regards target groups, objectives or design.  Thirdly, whether we need to do more to ensure greater public awareness of programmes and, particularly in the case of young persons and the long-term unemployed, accessibility to programmes best suited to their needs.  Finally, I have asked FÁS to develop an integrated set of services to encourage enterprise having regard to the progress being made in reorganising other State agencies and in rationalising aids to industry so as to maximise their effectiveness in terms of actual employment creation.</P>
    <P>I have also set out to ensure that FÁS will proceed to develop their services with maximum responsiveness to the needs of different regions and localities.  This will involve the full integration of all employment and training services at regional level.  In Dublin city, for instance, where I recently opened the new FÁS public inquiry offices, a fully integrated programme of services is being assembled to help the programme of development for the new Custom House docks area and to ensure that local people get the maximum benefit from the job opportunities which will become available.</P>
    <P>In their endorsement in principle of the NESC Report Strategy for Development 1986-1990 and again in more concrete terms in their agreement to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> all the social partners have recognised the particular need to consider the position of the disadvantaged.  Our general economic strategy must be directed to the creation of an environment favourable to job creation and sustained economic growth.  Policies and programmes for the long-term unemployed must be developed within this context.</P>
    <P>The provision of funding for special employment and training programmes continues to place a heavy burden on the Exchequer, even with the assistance available from the European Social <Col N="842" /> Fund.  The Government have shown their commitment, however, to ensuring that scarce resources are directed to those most in need.  For those without jobs, the priority is to provide assistance which will help them in securing a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The establishment of FÁS marks a major step forward in our efforts to assist those who have been out of work for more than a year.  They will undertake to provide a cost effective approach to meeting their needs.  The objective of social equity which is central to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> clearly calls for the development of a broad policy framework within which to address the problems of long-term unemployment rather than continuing to modify or extend the present patchwork of schemes.</P>
    <P>The scale of the problem calls for a careful assessment of the factors which contribute to long-term unemployment. The Jobsearch process has helped to sharpen our appreciation of these factors.  It has proved a useful stage before proceeding to take radical steps in programme design.</P>
    <P>Recent experience in this regard has also influenced our approach to the future of the European Social Fund, in the context of the reform of the Community Structural Funds.  We have had to emphasise the importance of the social dimension in rehabilitating those who have been caught in the trap of long-term unemployment.  Clearly, income maintenance is not a sufficient measure of social solidarity.  We need to harness the commitment of employers, trade unions and local communities in order to increase the range of employment opportunities available to the unemployed. Above all, the sheer cost of pursuing these intervention measures to redress the problems of the long-term unemployed underlines the need for measures which actually prevent people from falling into that category altogether.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps not sufficiently realised that about 6,000 young people &mdash; about 10 per cent of the school-leaving population &mdash; finish school each year without <Col N="843" /> even the most basic qualifications.  We have plenty of evidence to show that there is a relationship between educational qualifications at the time of leaving school and subsequent experience in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Those with the lowest qualifications and with none at all are most likely to become or to remain unemployed.  That lesson is highlighted each year in the annual surveys of school leavers.  The problem categories continue to fare badly in later years.  A number of surveys have found that early and unqualified school leavers are heavily represented among the unemployed and the long-term unemployed. I set out in recent months, together with my colleague Deputy Mary O'Rourke, Minister for Education, to examine this problem in depth, responding both to the spirit as well as the letter of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There are many inter-related reasons for educational disadvantage.  While there are limits to the extent to which the education, training and employment services can address all those causes, we need to do a great deal more and we need to do it better.  The agenda for a better opportunity for early school leavers which we hope to announce in the near future will be based on four major themes&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; targeting our limited resources at the schools and pupils most in need (in primary and second level junior cycle);</P>
    <P>&mdash; taking preventive action within the school system at the earliest stage;</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensuring that programmes devised for those who have left and will continue to leave school early are sufficient to provide adequately for transition to adult and working life;</P>
    <P>&mdash; achieving greater coherence between the programmes of the Departments of Education and Labour, which has been a problem for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In the absence of systematic support along these lines up to now, too many <Col N="844" /> vulnerable and disadvantaged youths found themselves unemployed at the end of six months training or, at best, moving in and out of a series of unstable jobs.</P>
    <P>The allocation for DION &mdash; the Advisory Committee on Welfare Services Abroad &mdash; will be maintained this year at £250,000.  The 1988 allocation has been maintained at the new level set by this Government last year when it increased the allocation significantly above the level of £155,000 set by the outgoing Administration. The action taken by the present Government has been acknowledged by the Federation of Irish Societies, whose representatives I have had the opportunity to meet with in Dublin and in London in recent months.</P>
    <P>In addition to the DION grant, assistance is also being made available to the Irish Centre, Camden Town, London, through the community youth training programme to help renovate the premises to provide a drop-in centre for elderly disadvantaged Irish people and also to provide meeting rooms for young people. The completion of the project this year should result in a significant improvement in the facilities available at the centre.</P>
    <P>Since I took office as Minister for Labour, I have made it clear that I am anxious to improve the flow of information to intending emigrants &mdash; particularly those young persons who have given the matter little thought and who may have an inflated idea of both the work and the support services available to them abroad.  In the last year I launched a publicity campaign featuring a new leaflet and posters informing people of the information and counselling facilities provided by FÁS &mdash; done formerly through the network of National Manpower Service offices &mdash; and indicating the sources from which help is available for those who find themselves in areas like London and other British cities.  I have asked the board of FÁS to examine the problems in this area and the scope which exists for taking effective preventive action directed to those young people who are likely to encounter harsh experiences abroad.</P>
    <P>As many young people still seem to <Col N="845" /> make very unrealistic assumptions about the living and working conditions facing them in Britain, I intend to bring to light the work of many of the voluntary bodies who deal with the welfare problems of Irish people by releasing an annual evaluation of their efforts prepared for me by DÍON.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the positive effects of the Jobsearch programme in terms of reducing long term unemployment. As Deputies will be aware, my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, who has contributed already to this debate, retains overall responsibility for this programme.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight aspects of the programme which affect the operations of FÁS and which have yielded interesting results in terms of how the effectiveness of employment programmes can be assessed. After candidates are identified initially by the employment exchanges, FÁS becomes involved in interviewing them and in providing them either with access to the jobs that are available or with a wide range of options, including training, a place on an employment scheme or the chance to start a business for themselves.</P>
    <P>The savings which will arise from the Jobsearch programme in 1988 have already been documented.  What has not been significantly emphasised &mdash; indeed it has been shouted down by the begrudgers &mdash; is the extent to which many of the participants have responded positively to the opportunities which have been provided. Let us look at the results.</P>
    <P>Jobsearch is a mechanism which helps us to target our programmes on those most in need.  A good illustration of that targeting is the fact that almost 50 per cent of participants in 10,000 Jobsearch courses were two or more years unemployed and 35 per cent, one of every three, were unemployed for three or more years.  High levels of satisfaction have been expressed with the content of those courses.</P>
    <P>The results we have got from our evaluation of the programme have clearly established its value for participants. Problems have been identified and, <Col N="846" /> where aspects of the programme did not draw positive responses from some or all participants, they are being examined and, if necessary, will be redesigned.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme has achieved more than any previous initiative in breaking down the barriers between social welfare policy and labour market policy.  It has succeeded in a way which will help us to plan a range of initiatives reflecting more effective policies and an improved capacity to assist the clients they serve.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer at this stage to the important contribution which the European Community can make to our national recovery efforts, through the European Social Fund for which I have been entrusted with individual responsibility by the Government.  The Social Fund, which provides assistance for programmes of vocational training and job creation, is of major significance in maintaining current activity levels on training and employment schemes.</P>
    <P>In 1987 we received payments amounting to £193 million from the fund, our highest ever figure for one year.  In the coming years we would hope to increase our receipts from the European Social Fund substantially.  The Social Fund &mdash; as one of the structural funds of the EC &mdash; is about to undergo a major reform as part of the Delors plan for implementing the provisions of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals which will come before the European Council next month is for the doubling by 1992 of the resources from these funds to be committed to the poorer or less-developed regions of the Community, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the rate of assistance paid by the funds to the less developed regions be greatly increased. This would enable us to expand our training and job creation programmes substantially, without putting additional strains on the Exchequer, a major consideration in our present difficult situation. The major elements of the Delors reform package should be the subject of agreement by the Heads of Government <Col N="847" /> at the next Summit.  At that stage, the Ministers for Labour will have the task of deciding how the European Social Fund will operate in detail.</P>
    <P>In those discussions I shall be pressing the Council of Ministers for a special rate of assistance for employment schemes, such as the social employment scheme which, up till now, have received a much lower rate of assistance from the European Social Fund than vocational training schemes.  This approach is justified, given the numbers of long term unemployed we have and the need to give them special assistance.  Modern intensive approaches to vocational training are extremely costly and are unlikely to meet the immediate needs of those who have been out of work for an extended period of time.  We need more flexibility in the range of measures we can use to assist this category.</P>
    <P>New pay increases in 1988, in accordance with the private and public sector agreements associated with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, should not exceed 2½ per cent.  Even allowing for carry-over from existing agreements and the effects of movements in exchange rates, particularly the dollar, there should be a significant improvement in our competitive position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK and, at a minimum, broad stability in relation to other EMS countries.  I believe it is essential that there is general adherence to the terms of the agreements.  What is at stake is a significant gain in cost-competitiveness which can be translated into greater job security for those in employment and improved prospects for job creation.</P>
    <P>The changes in personal taxation which this budget has provided, particularly the broadening of the 35 per cent tax band, have been widely acknowledged as a step in the right direction.  They will significantly increase the real value of the pay increases provided for in the public and private sector agreements and improve work incentives.  The prospects for the smooth operation of the programme itself have been enhanced by the <Col N="848" /> combination of these tax reductions and an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that our capital and our human resources in both the public and private sectors are managed well. An enormous responsibility for the future development of our State, therefore, rests on all who perform a managerial task, and the numbers here are sizeable.</P>
    <P>We have never examined our approach to management development in any comprehensive and systematic way.  This will be rectified during the course of the year when I receive the report of the Advisory Committee on Management Training, which I established last year.  Management development is a continuous process and calls for major efforts by our businesses, our individual managers and the State education and training institutions.</P>
    <P>Securing improvements in our approach to industrial relations is an important objective of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; here I quote from Section VI, paragraph 5 which commits us to holding discussions about:</P>
    <P>... changes in industrial relations which would provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and help to create conditions for employment generating investment.</P>
    <P>There are three points I want to stress about these discussions.  First, I want them to conclude reasonably quickly.  I am talking of weeks and months rather than years.  There is little point in conducting endless discussions &mdash; as did all of my prececessors since 1906 &mdash; in search of an elusive consensus.</P>
    <P>Second, I am prepared to adopt a pragmatic approach and aim to secure a package with which both sides can live, and which is of practical benefit to the community generally, rather than pursue some unattainable ideal.  Third, I intend to publish a Bill this autumn in the light of discussions which have already started. Hopefully, these discussions will conclude &mdash; in the spirit of the programme &mdash; with broad consensus on the action which needs to be taken.  If this consensus <Col N="849" /> does not emerge I will have to decide on the best package to put to the Government.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations environment is changing.  This is partly a reflection of the changing labour market.  This pattern of change is apparent in the continuing reduction in the annual incidence of strikes and in the numbers of work days lost as a result of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>My Department counted a total of 76 strikes which commenced in 1987, of which 22 were the result of unofficial action.  The number of work days lost in 1987 was 260,000, of which 25,000 or approximately 10 per cent &mdash; were through unofficial action.  The 1987 figures reflect the steady decline in the incidence of industrial action.  In 1984, for instance, there were 191 strikes, of which 75 were unofficial.  The reduction in unofficial strikes is a very positive development.</P>
    <P>It is a trend which I hope will be further strengthened in the lifetime of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The changing environment of industrial relations in Ireland behoves us all &mdash; Government, employers and trade unions &mdash; to ensure that our procedures and practices are attuned to the needs of a modern industrialised economy and to our common objectives of consolidating employment and boosting job creation.</P>
    <P>With a view to ensuring that our employment laws are better explained and understood, I have recently had a new &ldquo;Guide to Labour Law&rdquo; prepared which provides in one booklet a description, in a straightforward and non-technical manner, of the main provisions and procedures of the various Acts.</P>
    <P>I would also encourage employers to use the information service which has been established to assist employers and workers in understanding employment regulations.  In 1987 about 40,000 inquiries were handled on subjects such as redundancy, holidays, dismissals, wages, minimum notice and maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I believe that our experience of the administration of legislation has shown the need for changes to keep pace with developments elsewhere in the economy. <Col N="850" /> I selected three areas of employment law for priority review &mdash; unfair dismissals, employment equality and payment of wages.  These formed the subject matter of a discussion document which was published at the end of November.  I am at present awaiting submissions from interested parties on the issues raised in the discussion document.</P>
    <P>In this instance views are being sought from a wider audience to ensure the greatest consensus possible on how to proceed further.  In examining submissions and in considering future changes I will be guided by the desire to strike a balance between the need to safeguard workers' basic entitlements in employment while, at the same time, recognising the need for flexibility to enable firms to improve their competitiveness and to keep pace with technological developments.</P>
    <P>The legislative proposals on worker participation at sub-board levels contained in the Bill to be taken in Seanad Éireann this week complement the thrust of my Department's efforts to translate into new legislation the recommendations of the Barrington Commission on reforming our approach to safety and health at work.</P>
    <P>Both of these areas feature on the agenda for legislative change outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Initiatives in these areas will strengthen the response at enterprise level to the principles on which the programme is based &mdash; namely the recognition that greater employee involvement and an acceptance of responsibility by all concerned can contribute significantly to improving the efficiency and the competitive edge of our organisations.</P>
    <P>The economic future of this country and the future of those in employment and of those unfortunate enough to be out of work at present, depend on this Government keeping their nerve and seeing their policies through to a successful conclusion, however unpopular this may be with some people.</P>
    <P>The most difficult decisions have been taken and the major sacrifices already made by the people of this country.  It has <Col N="851" /> not been easy &mdash; the problems we faced ten months ago were too deep-seated to permit of easy solutions or soft options. We still have some way to go but I believe the worst is over.  The signs are there in the 1988 budget that this is so &mdash; for those who want to see them in it!</P>
    <P>The combination of unavoidable expenditure cuts, reduced borrowing and moderate pay increases under the pay agreements, augmented by moderately improved incentives through the income tax band changes, should restore confidence, improve competitiveness and encourage initiative.  This is the only sure foundation for growth in sustainable employment.  That is the objective of the whole painful exercise.  The people of this country, generally, see this and, despite the discomforts, accept our policies.</P>
    <P>They know that, in our circumstances, the tired old prescriptions about spending our way out of our difficulties are a recipe for disaster.  If they worked, we would not be in the difficulty we are now in.  It can only lead to more disastrous unemployment levels in the longer term.  We are on course; this budget shows that the people realise this; so I am glad to say do the great majority of this House.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas of the budget that we could usefully go through, but I am touching on those in regard to employment and the incentives that are there.  We will see that with the economy being primed and some difficult decisions being taken, there will be growth in employment and less closures in 1988 than we have had in the past ten years. A major tackling of our huge unemployment problem will lead the way to a final recovery.  That is the only solution and, hopefully, 1988 will see a change particularly in the fortunes of the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the budget.  In the few days which have passed since the budget was introduced on 27 January one has had an opportunity to analyse more carefully the implications of the budget, the trickling down effects <Col N="852" /> of its contents for the economy and perhaps, most important, the strategic omissions.</P>
      <P>The aspect of the budget I am most concerned about is the omission of an industrial strategy in pursuit of jobs.  The whole debate on public expenditure in recent years in the country and in this House has increasingly focused on the somewhat sterile activity of seeking to balance the national books.  Important as that is, we should always bear in mind that that is not an end in itself but a means to an end, the end being some form of management of our resources and fulfilment of the aspirations and expectations of the people of Ireland.  In other words, the budget is not simply a fiscal statement; it is not merely an accountancy exercise.  Whereas I commend the Government on having achieved targets in the vital area of public expenditure and made progress more rapidly and more substantially than any previous Government or any previous Administration often in the face of hostile opposition, nevertheless, there are aspects of the presentation of the budget which leave one to wonder whether or not some of us missed the point a little.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, for example, that all of us embarking on and engaged in the form of consensus which has developed in this House relating to managing the size of borrowing and the public debt generally might miss the point, particularly in relation to those who are less articulate and less organised than some of our peers.  I would say to the Government that, provided they have analysed carefully the merits of cases being presented, they should stand firm against lobbies and groups who pursue merely a sectional interest.  That is not to say they should say no to them all but that they should be evaluated on the merits of their requests and not on the strength or obstructive capacity of their numbers.  It would be reasonable for the Government, in those circumstances, to expect support from every other right thinking person in this House who believes the national interest should come first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the language contained in <Col N="853" /> the budget was little short, on one or two occasions, of being slightly gloating, though I have to allow the Minister for Finance some degree of self-satisfaction in achieving, broadly speaking, targets which many political commentators derided him for aspiring to less than 12 months ago.  I am mindful, representing as I do large numbers of people who believe that whatever way the books are balanced they will be at the end of the pile, that the fundamental challenges of creating work and creating an environment in which people can realise the aspirations to which they are entitled and tackling the fundamental problem of poverty in our society are not being dealt with.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the budget, particularly in the context of representing broadly a shift from direct to indirect taxation, is, to a substantial extent, little more than moving one column of figures into another column in terms of the public accounts and Government expenditure generally.  In other words, I am particularly mindful of the fact that it is not adequate for us in this House simply to deal with budgetary strategy as if it was mere accountancy.  I do not want to be negative or less than generous in saying to the Government that there are many people who applaud what they are doing in broad terms and believe that the strategy they are pursuing, even if it represents a complete turnabout to what they said before the election &mdash; and leaving that aside because it is very much a side issue as far as public perception and public interest are concerned &mdash; is the right one.</P>
    <P>I think the Government are making a number of mistakes.  First, I believe they are not honestly dealing with the fundamental challenge of generating an industrial climate which will create work. Second, it seems that very much of what is in place is being allowed to continue in terms of industrial incentive and existing structures.  Third, the Government are not tackling the problems of tax reform.</P>
    <P>There is no point pretending that the optical illusion of a slight reduction in <Col N="854" /> cash terms for the PAYE sector, which has the net result of increasing the income tax take by over 1 per cent, is some form of tax reform.  It is not, and it is not right to pretend it is.  Tax reform is making a fundamental change in the way tax is levied and in recognising the disincentive effect which brutal levels of taxation have particularly on those people who are generating employment, despite the most hostile tax environment in Europe.  That area of tax reform has not been tackled and I have no doubt it would be relatively easy to develop a consensus in this House in that respect.  Whether it is because the Government have not had a chance to look beyond the figures or that they are happy for the time being to do a different type of exercise, I am not clear, but those fundamental areas have not been tackled in the budget.  To that extent, this is a matter of regret because one anticipates from a new Government a fresh and fundamental approach to reforming public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Today we nodded through the 1986 report from the Comptroller and Auditor General which was virtually a reprint of the mistakes, duplication, waste, inefficiency and fraud that appeared in previous similar reports.  The point is that the systems which are in place in terms of spending public money are similar to the systems that were in place last year and the year before.  There are opportunities there of radically overhauling our systems of expenditure and taxation.</P>
    <P>In terms of jobs, the budget hardly mentions the target.  There is no more major challenge to the morale of our society at present than the need to give people hope that, in the near future, they will have an opportunity to fill their employment expectations.  My party have done some work in this respect.  When we spoke a year or two ago about aspects of economic management which are not standard parlance, for example, privatisation, we were derided by colleagues of the present Minister for Finance, but we endeavoured to put forward some constructive suggestions, and I want to do a little of that today.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, the budget has to be <Col N="855" /> welcomed, although it is still soft in many areas, ducks many targets and evades fundamental challenges in the areas I have mentioned, particularly in employment generation, tackling poverty and taxation reform.  I am very sorry these areas have been missed because there is a capacity for all of us to respond to a serious onslaught on these fundamental problems.  Mere tinkering with the personal allowance of the PAYE workers will not be a pallitive for radical reform of the tax system, particularly when what is being presented as tax reform is, for the single man at the bottom of the scale a decrease in his weekly tax of less than the price of a loaf of bread.  In my view, that is an attempt at management by some form of illusion and that can hardly be presented as reformist in nature.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal honestly with creating work, or more properly creating a climate in which work can be generated, the first thing we should do is to address the misconception that somehow it is possible to create jobs.  Jobs are, essentially, the outcome of economic activity.  They are not something one deliberately sets out to create.  I have yet to meet an entrepreneur or business person whose target was to create jobs.  Their target was to create economic activity, to create profit and thereby they created work.  Facilitating that spirit of enterprise is ultimately the only answer to sustaining jobs in any economy.  Any other form of temporary schemes, training schemes or public sector works is simply postponing the evil day and perhaps masking the depths and nature of the challenge which has never been more serious, because present statistics do not relate to the very sad and tragic emigration which continues unabated.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of industrial strategy will have to deal with that fundamental issue. How can we so create a positive attitude to economic generation as to make it worthwhile and rewarding to work? Unless that is done, the sad statistics of company failures which we witnessed recently, despite the heroic work of many State bodies and their leadership, will <Col N="856" /> simply come to nought.  Essentially our economic and social prospects depend on the further development of our industrial base to produce quality internationally traded goods and services for the world markets which is no more complex than that.  In broad terms, therefore, it is essential for us to provide a competitive environment for industry and business by implementing suitable macro-economic policy, by imposing the most rigorous standards of control and a reduction in scale and size of State activity and institutional involvement in industrial policy. It is vital to take a major leap forward in support of export marketing because a job in this area creates downstream seven other jobs.</P>
    <P>We have to positively and dynamically encourage the innovation process.  I am constantly staggered at the number of people, young and old, who have the innovative spirit and who look for some form of guidance or environment in which that spirit can be brought to fulfilment. We have to encourage the base of indigenous enterprises and continue to attract overseas investment in the traded goods and services sectors.</P>
    <P>Successful enterprise will depend ultimately on how competitive the operating environment is.  This has major implications for enterprises' need for competitive input costs and for realistic interest in exchange rates.  There has been progress in those respects, yet cost penalties for indigenous industry, despite the marginal benefits that have been derived from the interest area for example, far exceed the total grants paid to the sector.  The amounts by which Irish industrial costs exceed those of our EC partners is currently estimated at over £200 million.  Despite the many natural advantages we enjoy as a trading nation, and the enormous investment which has gone into industrial development over many years, it is nevertheless very clear from any examination of objective criteria, including international and domestic publications in the area of industrial policy, that the two key targets of doubling output over a ten year period and increasing employment in manufacturing <Col N="857" /> from £3,000 to £6,000 per annum, have not been achieved.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is clear that growth in output has been concentrated essentially in three sectors, electronics, chemicals and food.  Irish manufacturing output growth is now heavily dependent on international trends in the electronics and chemicals market and, therefore, subject to cyclical downturns.  It is clear, for all these and many other reasons, that a more considered, more highly planned and more specialist-oriented approach may be desirable, and indeed is perhaps essential, if we are to get the kind of growth in employment targets which we are so obviously in need of.  Yet, grant approvals to the IDA remain heavily concentrated in those three sectors, constituting some 70 per cent of approvals in 1985, for example.  These are three sectors in respect of which there is no particular reason in many cases to believe that we can do better than others competing in the same marketplace.</P>
    <P>Our industrial policy should be honed to play to our strengths, to become the best at what we are good at and not to seek to enter into artificial competition in relation to goods, services or manufacturing which can be provided better by others, either by virtue of the economies of scale or by the natural, indigenous nature of the manufacturing infrastructure of other countries, tradition or whatever.  This country is good at some things, the food industry is one and it is in those areas we must invest and develop.  Yet high productivity in the three sectors to which I referred has led to negligible growth in employment even when output increases.</P>
    <P>Between 1983 and 1986, there were small increases in electronics employment, a decline in employment in the food industry and no change in the chemicals area.  It is not an impressive return for the very substantial investment put into those sectors.  If it is agreed &mdash; and this is open to debate &mdash; that a primary objective of industrial policy is the creation of employment and not merely the creation of successful companies, which is presumably what the entrepreneurs are <Col N="858" /> primarily concerned about, we have a substantial length of road to go.</P>
    <P>If the main aim of industrial policy is to target an improved annual growth of industrial output per annum, with an associated overall growth in employment within the economy over the next ten years, then the State's massive expenditure must be targeted towards meeting the defined aims of this industrial strategy. Perhaps that is a fundamental weakness in the Government's approach. There is a degree to which the Government go down a little of the road with everybody in the industrial spectrum because there is not a coherent or clear-sighted industrial strategy against which investment can be measured and against which criteria or commitment of resources can be applied.  Therefore, it is impossible to measure success in terms of achieving targets.</P>
    <P>The criteria involved for grant-aiding should include the need for commercial viability on the part of each project receiving State support, a clear development strategy from the applicant enterprise, an adequate rate of return on the State investment in excess of, for example, that on long terms gilts and an adequate equity base within the enterprise. For example, it is not unreasonable to ask in the light of some of the unfortunate, but inevitable, failures that we have had by some of the major companies &mdash; I am thinking of the micro-electronics area &mdash; whether there is a flexible grant-aid approach which allowed for reviewing the way we grant aided certain companies who, overnight, collapsed and took off owing substantial sums.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals my party would make is that there is no longer any absolute need in all cases to assume that the only way to grant-aid an industry is to present them with a non-repayable grant based, presumably, on an assessment of the industry's business plan.  It is not unreasonable to suggest, as an option at least, that one way of facilitating companies with far greater protection for the taxpayer, would be to make repayable loans or to make grants payable in respect of input costs directly related to those <Col N="859" /> costs over a period of time, so that if the enterprise folds up or if head office in Detroit or New York decide to cash in their chips the taxpayer will not be left high and dry, as has happened time and again here.  I am not blaming the IDA and, given our investment policy, it is reasonable to assume that now and again there will be failures.  Naturally, we all wring our hands when these things happen although we are a little more reticent in applauding the firms which are successful.</P>
    <P>The idea that grants on a non-repayable basis paid into the open maw of a company is the only way of assisting the creation of jobs is nonsense.  Serious and genuine companies, looking at a long term commitment to Ireland, will be quite happy to sit down with the IDA or the Government to consider the possibility of repayable loans or getting their grants on a phased basis relating directly to their various costs, peculiar perhaps to this country.  I am talking here about the input costs to industry and I suggest that with respect to the Minister, as a way of getting better value for money, which is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>It is also clear, for some peculiar reason, that Irish industry has not shared in the general international recovery since 1984 and that native Irish firms have lost a large share of the home market, which is a very serious and worrying trend.  Between 1980 and 1985, the share of domestic consumption won by competing imports grew from 34 per cent to 41 per cent.  In other words, Irish firms are losing at home and abroad and growing exports to EC countries have not offset this decline in the home market. Unfortunately, this is lending to an international perception of Ireland which is far from flattering, perhaps unjustly so, but nevertheless that is the case.</P>
    <P>The world competitiveness report published by the EMF foundation in Geneva in August 1986 used a combination of hard data indices and survey information collected from an international sample of business executives and economists.  In that study 22 OECD countries were <Col N="860" /> ranked on overall competitiveness. Ireland came 17th having been, incidentally, 16th the year before.  Those at the top of the scale were Japan, the USA and Switzerland in that order.  The detailed assessment of that study makes extremely interesting reading and builds up a picture of the profile which the world has of the Irish industrial scene.  Candidly, it presents an enormous challenge to all of us.</P>
    <P>Domestically, of course, the area in which we have some control &mdash; and in relation to which the budget had the opportunity to make strides and did not &mdash; is that of Irish industry and commerce which also suffers severe competitive handicaps.  I appeal to the Government to review those peculiar and particular costs, levies and taxes with a view to refining and honing them with the strategic aim of reducing them where possible in line with the potential to create work.  I am quite convinced that a review of competitive costs would lead us to an inescapable conclusion which could, if applied logically, in terms of industrial policy, be largely self-financing by taking people off the dole, putting them into employment and causing economic regeneration.</P>
    <P>Even to apply a European average cost for fuel oil, gas, electricity, postal service, telecommunications and interest rates to Irish industry would almost double the profit rates.  The application of European averages to Irish industry would double profitability and would obviously make a major contribution to employment.  It gives some indication of the incredible handicap which people trying to run small and large businesses in this country have to endure.  It is the essential reason it is simply not attractive to employ people unless there is no other opportunity.  It also explains the reason for the incredible growth in the black economy which is nothing more than a symptom of revulsion at an extraordinary tax rate which continues to penalise those in the tax net but still continues to avoid many people outside it who should be within and which has at its root a regime in terms of tax evasion which simply rewards the evader. <Col N="861" /> By and large, the worst that can happen in terms of evasion is that, once caught, the evader negotiates a deal to settle amicably, a deal more or less agreeable to both the Revenue Commissioners and the evader.  That is the regime which punishes those who comply with paying their taxes and rewards those who do not.</P>
    <P>Since 1980 only one third of the decline in output is attributed to fall in domestic demand.  Some two thirds of the explanation can be found in a huge increase in competing imports.  Consequently, at home or abroad Irish industry is paying the price of being uncompetitive and most of the lack of competitiveness is due to factors other than the cost of labour. It seems to me that firm action by the Government is essential.  That is why I was particularly disappointed to find in the very comprehensive statement by the Minister on the budget virtually no reference to the challenge of employment. That is why I perceived the document presented as being very largely an exercise in accountancy.  Nationally, it is very important and very important to the economy but it is without clear social targets in terms of employment or other objectives such as tax reform.</P>
    <P>We have got to consider in addition the imposed cost disadvantages of lower standards of roads and public infrastructure, the extra costs involved in dealing with bureaucracy and legislation compared to the European average and the inherent logistical or scaled disadvantages, including the transport costs arising from our location <i>vis-á-vis</i> Europe.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be a very thorough re-evaluation of every piece of form filling and bureaucracy which the ordinary business has to endure.  When I use the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; I am not talking about the multinationals predominantly.  Most businesses in this country are very small operations.  Recently I asked one shopkeeper how many pieces of paper per year he had to complete.  Part of his answer was not fit for family consumption but the other part told me that there were dozens &mdash; he did not say how many &mdash; and that he was, quite frankly, fed up <Col N="862" /> with them and was thinking of packing it in.  I wondered to what extent much of this was necessary.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the creation of a climate in which enterprise can flourish is not purely about the tax burden or about PRSI levels but about a positive attitude by the Government and by semi-State bodies to welcome in people with ideas on enterprise, making it as easy as possible for them to flourish, giving them the benefit of the doubt in terms of, for example, introducing a proper, genuine tax self assessment scheme and punishing those who abuse the scheme.  I am convinced that we cannot expect any genuine revolution in that respect unless the State is willing to focus directly on the reasons enterprise, right now, is in the doldrums.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely healthy for the Government formally to invite in representatives of enterprise, of industry and the various areas of economic development and seek to ascertain from them the precise reasons why, unfortunately, much of what they find repressive at present is causing this down-turn.  You will find that it is not all about simply having the hand out all the time.  There are very practical things the Government can do to deal with some of the difficulties imposed on enterprise now.  All of those cost factors &mdash; and the Minister must know them as well as I do and, indeed, there are Ministers in the Cabinet who have direct experience of these cost factors &mdash; must be tackled within the framework of a comprehensive industrial policy.  That is not to say, nor let anybody here pretend, that they can all be written off overnight or that there is an open cheque to build new roads tomorrow. Nobody is saying that.  There is not even a beginning of the perception in the Budget Statement that these problems of industrial costs are germane to the question of our industrial strategy and employment strategy and will have to be tackled even on a systematic basis over, say, a ten year time scale.  That is not even mentioned in the document and, to that extent, for the unemployed it is a failure.  That is very sad and, perhaps, explains why there is a continuing drain out of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> In future, the impact of Government measures on industrial costs per activity should be addressed in advance.  There should be an impact statement prior to measures which the Government often blithely introduce here, some of them being administratively cumbersome, or unnecessarily expensive, or perhaps duplicate of effort.  That procedure applies at present to proposals coming before the EC Commission and it seems a perfectly reasonable proposal to make in order to guage the likely impact of various Government decisions on small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the whole area of Government infrastructure, of the semi-State bodies and the State agencies described as supporting industrial development in Ireland is a key element in the support of infrastructure in terms of assisting the development and achievement of an industrial strategy.  Across the 20 State agencies, so described as being broadly supporting industrial development in Ireland, the annual pay out to industry is put at £187.5 million, half of the total budget allocation of these agencies and the other half is absorbed by internal administration and increases in agencies' fixed assets.  That in itself speaks volumes without having to spell it out in greater detail.  If half of the total allocation goes on administering the grants, since the grant applications must be prepared by the clients and that in itself is a very expensive business, it might be reasonable to assume that a like figure could be put on the cost of securing the grants, or other supports and, of course, this cost is absorbed by industry.  What this means is that, broadly speaking, both the Government, as a provider of incentives, and the firm, as the beneficiary, have found what is called their line of indifference in relation to the grant receipt at a cost of three times the net benefit.  That, in itself speaks volumes and shows another ripe area for investigation, for analysis and for Government response.</P>
    <P>There is also the serious question of the extra costs of Government imposed on industry.  I am convinced that a major <Col N="864" /> assault in that area would yield extraordinary results.  I would like to make this suggestion to the Government.  Would they consider some form of strategy or measure similar to the Grace Commission in the United States which would invite in the achievers in our society &mdash; the only people who will make this economy grow &mdash; to informal consultations and to an informal structure if they are so agreeable to assist in Government in targeting on areas inhibiting industrial growth and focusing on areas where industrial strategy and industrial potential could be fully realised?  That commission consisted of a group of voluntary people from the private sector who sat down with the Government and tried to assist them in pinpointing clear targets in the areas I have mentioned.  At all times the Government have to be the guarantor of last resort for the people.  They must protect the interests of the public and the common good.  The present structure which is to shut out vast areas of expertise and achievement totally, as if they had nothing to contribute, is totally unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The knowledge or experience base in politics generally is relatively low.  I honestly believe it could do with interfacing in some structured way with the real world of commerce, business, enterprise and achievement.  I am not suggesting, at any stage, that there should be any form of abdication by the Government to such interests many of whose primary concerns will be sectional, will be selfish and will perhaps be self-centred.  I simply believe that people who have to make it happen day in day out &mdash; some of the associate companies with a scale and size almost of our GNP &mdash; if approached properly and if asked, would respond and would assist the Government to target areas of industrial strategy and focus on areas of handling of public expenditure where some kind of modern management system would be useful.  I ask this rhetorically and perhaps when the Minister is replying he might try to answer it specifically even though I do not assume he will.</P>
    <P>Mention of modern management reminds me of an experience I had some <Col N="865" /> years ago when I was an office holder.  I would like to know, today, in 1988, how many Government Departments still use people resources, still utilise workers in the incredibly tedious job of writing their letters in longhand and handing them to typists who type each letter individually. I know there are many.  That kind of outdated, Dickensian approach to managing both people and resources would not be tolerated in any ordinary private business.  There is no justification whatever for its being tolerated in the public sector.  It seems reasonable, therefore, that the wisdom and experience of those who are in the business of achievement day in and day out should be brought to bear in Government or at least interfacing with Government with the Government and the Cabinet always retaining the right to make the final decision.  I would commend such a strategy.</P>
    <P>The Government have made an attempt to embark on a programme of rationalisation in State agencies.  I am equally concerned about the regionalisation of State agencies and, quite frankly, some of the approaches to rationalisation have been little more than cosmetic.  A basic weakness is that they rely absolutely on voluntary redundancies, the result of which, hard as it is to say, will inevitably mean that the needs of the individual rather than the overall needs of the State will be met.  Those who want to go are those who want to go because it suits them.  I am pleased to see that some of them are setting up their own enterprises.  What the State may need however is a different model.  It may very well be that some of those who are going are precisely the people who should stay and it may very well be that some of the agencies presently existing should be rationalised out of existence or that in one or two cases a new structure may need to be created.</P>
    <P>I believe, hard as the bullet might be to bite, that relying absolutely on a cosmetic approach to rationalisation in terms of the numbers involved in voluntary redundancy is inadequate in terms of honing a structure to deal adequately with the <Col N="866" /> challenge of industrial policy.  However, I accept that the Government have made a start in that respect and are to be applauded for it.  I suggest that a substantial amount of inter agency rivalry and overmanning still exists and that this needs a very serious and tough look.  It also seems that some of the suggestions made in this respect raise major questions. For example, the on-off abolition of the National Social Service Board is a case in point.  One of the reasons given for its abolition was that the work would be done by the Department.  If people have built up an expertise in an area it seems that the answer may well be to leave them where they are and perhaps depending on what is the rather nebulous and unclear future of that board, to ask those in the Department who may be handling the work of the board to leave. Why should it be that the Department are virtually sacrosanct and that the agencies, those in the field, get the chop?  The Government in that respect should begin at the centre, deal at the core with the problem of numbers and deal much more dramatically with it than by way of the option of voluntary redundancy which may result in a quantative improvement but which may also result in qualitative disasters in certain areas.  We cannot start from scratch but the Government will be extremely fortunate if, depending totally on voluntary redundancy, they achieve by chance a model which will assist in the development of an industrial strategy.  I do not believe anybody expects that to happen.</P>
    <P>In the area of industrial promotions there should also be a review of the socalled free services which the State offers and which are paid for by the taxpayers in general.  It is reasonable that the Government might look at a fee for a service being provided to a beneficiary wherever this is reasonable or practicable and particularly where it would not inhibit new enterprises.  Here, we are not talking about people at the start up stage being hammered by additional costs but rather at substantial industries which have established their market niche both <Col N="867" /> here and abroad paying for the State services they use.</P>
    <P>While we have been worst in the trends in the eighties our pattern of decline in industrial employment is consistent with international trends and it makes the case for combining a selective industrial development policy with a comprehensive service development policy. It is clear that there is a major future in internationally traded services.  Again, there has been a blind spot in terms of giving grants and incentives.  It is legitimate to do so if it is manufacturing, heavy product or engineering but if it is a service, perhaps because it is more difficult to quantify, it is less likely to attract grants.  That is something we should seriously question and I do not think that that concept would last very long in certain other small countries which have been very successful in their economic management.  Above all, there is an overriding requirement to focus Government action and funds on resolving the cost disadvantages which Irish industry presently suffers from.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the narrow economic issues, somewhere along the line we are going to have to address the question of the definition of work which we have inherited.  We are now embarking on a totally new age which has a totally new attitude to work and personal fulfilment. There are areas of economic activity in which there will never again be the same kind of economic activity as there was in the past because technology, human expectations, educational qualifications and personal aspirations have all changed.  The goal posts have shifted. Redefining what is useful socially and personally as being a legitimate definition of work will be a challenge, perhaps for the sociologists in the first instance and some of them have been attending to it but also for all of us who talk about creating jobs.  Our definition of work is too narrow but we can debate that in greater detail on another occasion.</P>
    <P>I also believe that another omission from the budget was the area of privatisation <Col N="868" /> or what we sometimes call in the Progressive Democrats public ownership, that is allowing workers, members of the public, to part own their enterprises.  I include in this public enterprises. It is fundamentally wrong for the State to preach to the private sector about the need for and the advantages of a wider share of equity in private enterprises if it is not prepared to make a start and show an example in the area that it itself controls.  The Progressive Democrats completely support the concept and practice of public ownership or privatisation of public sector companies.  It is our view that workers and others in relation to these enterprises are entitled to a stake.</P>
    <P>Who are these anonymous owners who own these enterprises on our behalf? Some of them will not even reply to a letter.  I would be far happier having a much wider ownership base, including ordinary people with small investments and not merely the substantial and wealthy people who obviously are entitled to a stake also but that is a question of degree and control.  The principle is what we are after.  I would like the Minister to tell us in his reply specifically what he proposes in relation to privatisation of both major State bodies and public sector agencies.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, therefore, I just want to say that in general terms there is much about the budget we like and I do not believe it is unimaginative. There are a number of measures in the budget which have to be welcomed and the general thrust of it is broadly welcome but there are many omissions and they are at a fundamental level.  It is regrettable that the budget focused not at all on the very basic issues and challenging areas of employment, tax reform and poverty.  It did not concentrate on the basic inadequacy in the way our resources are distributed.  Unless those areas are <Col N="869" /> addressed all we are doing is moving the figures around.  That fundamentalist approach is what we should look for and one I would like to have seen in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the budget I should like to state that it strikes me as extraordinary that we hear from time to time in the House remarkable raiméis about the budget.  This is a creative budget, an extraordinarily well-crafted one, and it is not true to suggest, as has been suggested by several speakers, that it has a narrow focus.  In fact, it has a very broad focus.  The budget has to be put into a context and that is where most of its critics are missing the point. it has to be considered in the context of being part of a continuing brave effort by Government to put the nation's sick finances back onto a healthier plane.  It is only by doing that that we can achieve what we want to achieve for our people.</P>
      <P>The year that has just passed, even critics of the Government must admit, was one of considerable achievement on many fronts in the Irish economy.  The year that is ahead of us will be equally important in terms of achievement and potential to put the nation back on its feet.  It is no exaggeration to say that the 11 months since the Government took office have seen the whole thrust of economic and financial policy changing dramatically and for the better.  A sense of purpose has been restored to the management of the public finances and solid progress has been made in both output and exports.  Inflation is at its lowest level for two decades.  Decisive Government action on the public finances has led to lower interest rates.  These are real and substantial achievements and they bear reiteration from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all the public finances have been put back on the rails.  Over the last few years our public finances began to look like what Sir Alex Cairncross once described as a hippopotamus that had gone amok and was running out of control. That hippopotamus, that huge bloated beast of public finances, has been brought to heel and is now being caged <Col N="870" /> and penned down.  We will all benefit from that.  The Government inherited an extraordinarily difficult economic and financial position when they took office in March last.  In the four to five years of Coalition Government the public debt doubled, from £12 billion to £24 billion. It is worth reminding ourselves of that fact from time to time.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael in government had analysed the problem accurately and had reached the stage where they had established what precisely needed to be done but they failed to do it because they were vetoed by their partners, those ersatz socialists who can say not to everything and yes to very little.  By the time we took office not only had the national debt doubled but it was increasing at the rate of £2 billion per year.  That fact sometimes proves unpalatable to Opposition parties.  The cost of funding the debt had doubled and virtually the entire yield of PAYE was being swallowed up by that debt.  Obviously, there had to be a change of direction and when the Government took office they decided that they would take decisions.  That is where they fundamentally differ from the Government who preceded them.  The decisions were difficult and, in the short term, were not likely to be electorally popular but, nonetheless, in the greater interest of the nation, they were taken.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Government since taking office has been to lay the basis for secure growth in the economy.  If we are honest with ourselves we will recognise that laying those foundations is not something that can be done in two or three years; it is something that determines commitment over a considerable number of years.  The profligacy of the past &mdash; many parties participated in that profligacy &mdash; had led the nation into a state where its economic existence was imperilled.  In the budget the Government have continued to reduce the dependence on borrowing and improve the environment for more investment and in that way to create the conditions in which employment can be established. There is no point in Deputies wringing their hands and suggesting that the <Col N="871" /> Government have a magic wand they can wave over a sick economy and create employment.  If employment is to be created we must concentrate on creating real jobs.  In the past, unfortunately, we created jobs that were propped up and carried on the backs of the taxpayers and taxpayers are not prepared to go that route any more, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>Effectively, the objectives of Government must be long term.  The first and most important objective is to restore confidence in the economy.  I submit that confidence in the economy has effectively been re-established.  Real economic growth depends on the clear demonstration of Government determination to manage the Government's and the nation's finances not just in 1988 but in future years.  I submit that the budget shows such determination.  The decisions taken last year, while essential for our future prosperity, were by no means sufficient in themselves to solve our budgetary and economic problem.  Difficult decisions have also to be taken in 1988. The Estimates were published last autumn marking an historic breakthrough because it signalled a very real intention to retrench, to cut back severely on the excesses of public expenditure. It was important in that their early publication made one of the most significant breakthroughs in the public finances of the nation.  Other parties had prattled about that.  A fine document was produced in the early eighties by Deputy John Bruton suggesting that we should go that route but, significantly, when Deputy Bruton was in the most important position in regard to the nation's finances he failed to achieve that.  To publish Estimates so that the House could engage in some logical discussion on them was a major and welcome breakthrough.  Hopefully, it will be improved on in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There were real achievements in 1987. The Exchequer borrowing requirement was sharply reduced and that has been handsomely recognised by some Members.  It is to our advantage that we should sharply reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  Despite the <Col N="872" /> severity of the budget measures taken last year there was a degree of buoyancy in the economy by year's end which surprised some economic analysts.  By year's end the prime overdraft rate had fallen by five percentage points.  That was a significant achievement because not only does it impact itself on the cost of Government but it impacts itself on the cost of small businesses, on farmers, shopkeepers and industrialists planning long term projects and investments and, therefore, planning for employment.  It also makes an impact on householders. If we take the case of a young couple buying a house and taking out an average mortgage of £25,000, the percentage cut in interest rates means a saving of £55 per month to that young couple.  That is significant because it is taking a major step in the right direction and putting money back into the pockets of ordinary people where the money should have stayed in the first place.</P>
    <P>The alarming drain of domestic capital out of the economy was dramatically slowed by the end of 1987, while in the first few weeks of 1988 we could begin to celebrate inflows of funds from abroad. These inflows had received a very real impetus by the clear determination of the Government to rectify the disastrous position of the national finances.  Major development projects in a variety of sectors had already been announced.  Last year this Government put the nation's finances on course, in remarkable contrast to the previous five or ten years, not just the years of the previous administration but the years before that when there were administrations from this side. This again demonstrates the determination by Government to follow through on their earlier decisions.  Over the past 15 years the budget had become something of a farce because figures at the end of the year bore little relationship to what had been said with such solemnity in this House at the beginning of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The actions taken in the 1987 budget were only the first step.  The second step which is taken in this budget was signalled in the 1988 Estimates which involved <Col N="873" /> savings of the order of £490 million. These were published well in advance to give Members of this House the opportunity to digest them and to respond. Most Members responded in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>These were not the only achievements of 1987 and 1988.  Another singular achievement for which the Government are responsible is the establishment of the three year <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Much scorn has been lavished on this programme but I see this as one of the most important achievements of 1987 because it brings rationality to the whole issue of pay and pay negotiations in the wider sector.  Rationality is an essential ingredient if we are to have economic growth.  We must not only control public finances but we must start saying to those who create real jobs that these are the parameters within which they will have to operate.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> underlines the fact that development is central to this Government's outlook.  It has been suggested by Deputy Noonan and others that this Government are following a one-item agenda.  This is a catchy phrase intended to appeal to the gallery and the headline writers.  That is what politics has become in this country. It is unjust, unfair and simply untruthful to suggest that this Government have set been following a one-item agenda.  The agenda which the Government have set themselves is expansive and has within it many facets, all of which are important to the wealth and wellbeing of the nation. The Minister for Labour spoke earlier about changes in the labour and public service area.  On the industry and employment side we have, for example, the contract for the financial services centre which has now been signed and work is in progress.  It is interesting to consider the rumourmongers in this city who were gleefully operating in anticipation of some reversal.</P>
    <P>A crash programme to boost tourism was introduced last year.  The increase of 16 per cent in tourism is quite extraordinary by any standard.  In the same sector, work has commenced on a new <Col N="874" /> runway at Dublin Airport and on an extension to Cork Airport.  The business employment scheme has been extended to tourism projects.  In a county such as Wicklow where we have a great deal to offer the tourist, this is a major achievement. Air fares have been reduced and while we cannot claim full credit some credit at least is due.</P>
    <P>There have been real achievements in the forestry sector, which is of particular importance in my constituency.  New and bigger grants were introduced for tree planting and the planting programme exceeded all previous standards.  Those growth targets were achieved in 1987 and we can be confident that they can be repeated in 1988.  We will also see this year the establishment of a State forestry enterprise agency.  I have said before in this House, and I repeat, that there is only one county for it, the county which has most forestry and which I have the privilege to represent, namely, Wicklow.</P>
    <P>On agriculture and food a great deal has been achieved.  At the beginning of the year the Goodman Group announced a £260 million investment programme. That shows real confidence.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Keating said earlier, there is no point in talking about ersatz or shadow jobs created in the public sector. If we are to generate real wealth and make real progress we must look to the areas where we have special advantages such as food, mariculture, agriculture and forestry.  We must build on and expand these areas.</P>
    <P>We have appointed the first ever Minister for Science and Technology.  It was announced at the end of the year that the Biotech programme would get a boost. This programme has languished on the files of the previous Government for some reason which cannot be rationally explained.</P>
    <P>There was progress in energy, communications, environment and every other sector.  It may be modest but it was progress and it is a damn sight better than anything achieved in the previous five years.</P>
    <P>While progress was being achieved on these fronts, the weaker members of our <Col N="875" /> community were not being forgotten. Last year we had an expansion of social welfare services through the extension of optical and dental benefits.  Tragically there are difficulties on the dental side because members of the profession are interested in a narrow focus rather than in serving the community who put them into their professions in the first place.  In this year's budget we have even bigger and better improvements.  The increase of 11 per cent for the long term unemployed must be welcomed by all Members.  A great step forward was the introduction of real measures to combat fraud.  There had been a great deal of discussion in this House and elsewhere over the past four to five years about the extent and the level of fraud.  To the degree that there is fraud in the social welfare system it is theft from the poorest and it is also theft from the taxpayer and it has to be redressed.  I was appalled during the course of the Minister's budget speech when a member from the Fine Gael benches talked about Nazi tactics and draconian measures.  If somebody is stealing from the poorest or if somebody is stealing from the taxpayer we should make no apologies for going after those people with vigour.</P>
    <P>Very real progress has been made in the marine areas.  For the first time in the history of the State we have created the Ministery for the Marine.  We have put into place the Shipping Investment Grants Act.  Only last week at Arklow port we saw the <i>Arklow Manor</i> sail into her mother port, which was the first fruits of the Shipping Investment Grants Act. As I have said there has been very real progress not just on a one-item agenda but on a multiple-item and varied agenda in 1987.</P>
    <P>Much has been made about the areas where we need to make progress now that the nation's finances have at last started to be brought under control and very high on any agenda for progress in the future must be taxation reform.  The Government have recognised in their activities this year, as they did last year, <Col N="876" /> that high taxation was a disincentive and had a disincentive effect on economic recovery.  At the beginning of last year the Government indicated that they intended to make significant progress towards fulfilling their promise that two-thirds of the taxpayers would be brought to the standard rate.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Marital breakdown is an ever-increasing and growing problem within Irish society.  Prior to the seventies the law relating to marital breakdown had remained virtually unchanged for over a century.  In 1976 the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act was enacted to extend powers to the courts to make maintenance orders to provide for the support of dependent spouses, who were usually wives, and children who were not being properly provided for.  The same legislation also extended to our courts power for the first time to make barring orders to exclude a violent spouse from the family home.  The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, for the first time provided protection for the wife in the family home by preventing the sale of the home without her consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the legislation introduced during the seventies and some further amending legislation of the early eighties was by way of a fire brigade legislative response to confront particular problems resulting from marital breakdown which were highlighted by pressure groups and the news media.  It was not until the formation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in 1983 that Members of the Oireachtas for the first time since the foundation of the State conducted a detailed examination of our marital laws and in particular our laws relating to marital breakdown.  The committee in their report published in April 1985 acknowledged the failure of the <Col N="877" /> Oireachtas to tackle this area and emphasised the need for reform.  They state:</P>
    <P>The problems caused by marriage breakdown have not been adequately dealt with by the Oireachtas in the past.  The present laws which purport to deal with marriage breakdown are not comprehensive nor are they reactive to the current changes in society and in personal attitudes to the family and to marriage.</P>
    <P>In their report the Oireachtas Joint Committee proposed comprehensive and radical reform of our separation laws and the court system that administers them. Many of the recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee are implemented by the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, which is now before the House.  A couple whose marriage has totally collapsed and who wish to permanently legally separate may currently adopt one of two approaches.  If they agree that their marriage has broken down they may enter into what is commonly known as a Deed of Separation, under the terms of which they agree the future arrangements to be implemented between them to regulate the family finances and family relationships.  Where it is not agreed that the marriage has broken down or where it is not possible for a couple to agree on the basis upon which they should separate it is open either to a husband or a wife to bring procedures to seek what is known as a divorce <i>a mensa et toro</i>.  This is, of course, not a divorce in the popular meaning of the term, but it is in fact a decree of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>The present law relating to the obtaining of decrees of separation has remained unchanged for centuries.  Prior to 1871 a decree of separation in Ireland could only be granted by the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of Ireland.  By virtue of the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) (Amendment) Act, 1870, the High Court inherited this jurisdiction and has exercised it since that date.  The Courts Act, 1981, conferred a concurrent jurisdiction on the Circuit Court as and <Col N="878" /> from May 1982 to hear and determine separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>The only grounds upon which a decree of separation can presently be granted is upon proof of adultery, cruelty or what is known as unnatural practices.  At no time since the foundation of the State has legislation been introduced into this House to either expressly state the grounds upon which a decree of separation can be obtained or to expand, modify or reform the grounds upon which such a decree can be granted.  As a result the current law provides no legal remedy for many spouses whose marriages have totally collapsed and who require legal intervention to resolve the consequences of such a collapse.  High Court proceedings for a decree of separation can still, curiously, be heard by a judge and jury as well as by a judge sitting alone, although it is some ten years since there was last a jury trial in a separation proceedings. Such proceedings in the Circuit Court are determined by a judge alone. If the court grants a decree of separation it has ancillary powers to make an alimony order to require a husband, against whom a decree of separation has been made, to pay alimony for the support of his wife and may also under the provisions of section 18 (1) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, make a declaration that the spouse by reason of whose conduct the decree is made is unfit to have custody of any children of the marriage.  A decree of separation, or divorce <i>a mensa et toro</i>, also automatically deprives the guilty spouse, be it the husband or the wife, of his or her legal right to a share in the estate of the other, either as a legal right or on intestacy under the Succession Act, 1965.  There are no other statutory powers conferred on the courts to make ancillary orders following the making of decrees of separation.</P>
    <P>The courts currently cannot in separation proceedings determine property disputes between spouses or disputes relating to the guardianship or custody of children.  Neither can they make maintenance orders for the support of a dependent husband or dependent children or orders to protect the family home or to <Col N="879" /> permit its sale, where sale is desirable, or barring orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence or property transfer orders, to provide security for a spouse who requires such security.  In recent years, on occasions, both the High Court and the Circuit Court have in practice in some instances granted exclusion orders prohibiting a spouse against whom a decree of separation has been granted from entering the family home but there is no statutory basis for the making of such orders in separation proceedings and the courts jurisdiction currently to make them is open to question.</P>
    <P>So as to circumvent the limited jurisdiction conferred on the courts when determining separation proceedings the practice has grown up in recent years of estranged spouses through their lawyers simultaneously instituting a variety of other court actions at the same time as the bringing of separation proceedings so that all issues that have to be resolved between them that arise from a marital conflict can be dealt with in a single court hearing.  As a result, following a marriage breaking down a husband and wife can find themselves embroiled in two or three different sets of court proceedings and as a consequence incur a great deal of unnecessary legal expense.</P>
    <P>For over 20 years our separation laws have been the subject of considerable criticism.  Many voluntary groups and organisations have over the years called for reform and in 1983 the Law Reform Commission published a report on the need for reform.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown discovered there was almost universal agreement right across the religious, social and political spectrum that our separation laws should be reformed and that the current narrow grounds on which a decree of separation can be granted should be replaced by the &ldquo;one overall ground&rdquo; of proof of irretrievable marital breakdown.  In so recommending the committee recognised that the current grounds which require proof of the committal of a matrimonial offence maximised conflict between estranged <Col N="880" /> spouses, discouraged instead of encouraged voluntary reconciliation and, where reconciliation was not possible, effectively sabotaged the possibility of future co-operation between estranged couples where such co-operation was necessary. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee recognised that the essence of marriage is the making of a formal commitment between two people to create and maintain a lasting and stable relationship and that where such relationship collapsed the purpose of separation proceedings was to provide the means whereby the parties to a broken marriage could rearrange their lives for the future with a minimum of bitterness and recrimination.</P>
    <P>In recommending that irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be the one overall ground upon which a decree of separation should be granted, the Oireachtas Joint Committee prescribed six basic facts, one of which must be proved by a spouse to obtain a separation decree.  Section 2 of the Bill now before the House corresponds to this recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>The committee also recommended that all barriers to reconciliation contained in current law should be removed, and this is reflected in the provisions contained in the Bill.  They recommended further that, following the granting of a decree of separation, the courts should have comprehensive powers to make maintenance orders, guardianship, custody and access orders relating to children, lump sum payment orders, property transfer orders, orders relating to the family home and other family peoperty as well as orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence at the hands of the other spouse.  All these recommendations are implemented in the provisions of the Bill before the House tonight.  I wish to outline some of the provisions contained in the Bill as published. We will, of course, deal with them in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with the basis upon which a decree of separation can be granted and related matters.  Section 1 <Col N="881" /> provides that after the commencement of the Bill the sole ground upon which a decree of judicial separation shall be granted is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that, in order to establish that the marriage has irretrievably broken down the party to the marriage must prove one of six facts. These are (a) that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the respondent (b) that the respondent has committed adultery (c) the respondent has deserted the applicant for a continous period of at least one year immediately preceding the presentation of the application (d) the parties to the marriage have lived separate and apart from each other for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding presentation of the application and the respondent consents to a decree of judicial separation being granted (e) the parties to the marriage have lived separate and apart for a continuos period of three years immediately preceding the presentation of the application, or finally (f) the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent. All these provisions correspond with the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee as contained in paragraph 7.3.8.2 of their report.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) requires that on proof of such a fact a decree of separation must be made unless the court is satisfied on all the evidence presented that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably. Section 2 (3) includes constructive desertion within the definition of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; as referred to in the six basic facts I outlined.  Section 2 (4) makes provision to ensure that where it is alleged a party to a marriage consents to the granting of a decree of separation the consequences of so consenting are fully understood by him.</P>
    <P>Section 3 contains a provision to ensure that if parties to a marriage attempt a reconciliation after marital difficulties <Col N="882" /> have occurred which could give rise to one or other of them seeking a decree of separation, the attempt at that reconciliation does not prevent a spouse from seeking a decree if the reconciliation does not prove successful.  Under the current law if a husband or wife attempts a reconciliation and if the reconciliation does not prove successful, the spouse who could have brought separation proceedings may find he or she is unable to do so due to their being held to have condoned the matrimonial offence previously committed by the other spouse.  In effect, the current law acts as a barrier to conciliation in circumstances where reconciliation may prove possible.  For example, at present if a wife learns her husband has committed adultery and upon his promising not to commit adultery again forgives him and the couple resume normal marital relations, if matters do not work-out the wife may find that because she attempted to resolve the marital difficulties she is excluded from seeking a decree of separation.  The current law effectively militates against reconciliation.  The provisions of section 3 and section 32 of the Bill are designed to remove obstacles to reconciliation inherent in the current law.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains provisions to ensure that court proceedings between couples are avoided where possible.  It requires a solicitor consulted about a marital difficulty to advise the spouse as to the availability of marriage counselling where there is a possibility of the marital problems being resolved.  Where there is no such possibility a spouse must be advised as to how to effect a separation without bringing court proceedings.  In the latter context a solicitor is required to furnish information to a spouse as to the availability of mediation services and the possibility of resolving the consequences of marital breakdown by the conclusion of a separation deed or a written separation agreement.  Section 4(2) contains provision to enable a court hearing a separation case to adjourn the proceedings upon the application of either spouse if there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation being effected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Section 5 makes provision to ensure that proceedings seeking a decree of separation cannot be commenced by a party to a marriage until at least one year after the date of celebration of marriage unless difficulties have occurred of a serious and exceptional nature so as to render it unreasonable and unjust to delay the issuing of proceedings.  Section 6 provides that, following the granting of a decree of separation, the parties to a marriage are no longer obliged to reside together.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains provisions to enable the courts to make comprehensive ancillary orders following the granting of a decree of separation.  It also contains provisions to enable the courts to make interim orders or emergency orders to provide protection for a spouse where it is necessary to do so prior to a court hearing taking place and the court fully and finally determining the separation application.  Section 8 gives powers to the court in separation proceedings where necessary to make such interim orders in respect of maintenance, interim barring orders to provide protection for a spouse at risk of violence, interim custody orders or access orders relating to children and interim orders for protection of the family home and for the protection of household furniture and property.</P>
    <P>Section 10 lists the various orders the court can make following the granting of a decree of separation.  Under this section it is provided that the court may make maintenance orders for the benefit of a dependent spouse and children; the court can make lump sum payment orders, property transfer orders, orders extinguishing or varying inheritance rights, orders determining any disputes relating to the guardianship and custody of children that arise, orders determining property disputes under the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, orders under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 and barring orders under the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.  It also extends to the court power in separation proceedings to make orders under the Partition Acts, 1868 to 1876 relating to the sale of property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Section 10 (1) (m) enables the court to make an order determining which spouse shall have the right to continue to reside in the family home and which spouse shall vacate the home, or in the alternative whether an order for the sale of the home be made subject to such conditions as the court determines.  Section 11 states the criteria the court is to have regard to in making an order under section 10 (1) (m).</P>
    <P>Section 10 confers a jurisdiction on the court to grant orders pursuant to the specific Acts named in the section without the necessity of additional and separate court proceedings having to be instituted which would result in both husband and wife incurring much additional unnecessary legal expense such as they have to incur at present.  Section 10 (4) provides that the court's jurisdiction to make property transfer orders and orders extinguishing or limiting inheritance rights can be invoked only on one occasion after the granting of a decree of separation.</P>
    <P>Section 11 describes what criteria the court is to have regard to in making an order relating to a family home under section 10 (1) (m).  In exercising the latter jurisdiction the court is required to have regard to the welfare of the family as a whole and in particular must take into consideration the following matters: (a) where a decree of judicial separation is granted it is not possible for the parties to a marriage to continue to reside together (b) proper and secure accommodation should where practicable be provided for a dependent spouse and any dependent child of the family (c) the matters referred to in section 13 of the Bill which I shall come to shortly.  These provisions are designed to ensure that the position of a dependent spouse and children is fully protected in the making of any order pursuant to this provision, and again reflect recommendations made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that an order made by the court extinguishing or reducing inheritance rights can be made only when an order or orders are also being made by the court to pay a lump sum or when <Col N="885" /> a property transfer order is made as provided for in section 10, except in circumstances where a spouse has been guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states the detailed criteria the court is to have regard to in determining what orders it should make in respect of maintenance, lump sum payments, property and inheritance rights. The criteria referred to include the criteria currently taken into account in determining what maintenance orders should be made in proceedings brought under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and additional matters proposed by the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to require the court specifically to take into account the manner in which family property was acquired and the relevant contributions of both spouses during the course of the marriage.</P>
    <P>It also incorporates the view expressed by the committee that a dependent spouse should not be prejudiced in the ownership of family property by the fact that he or she gave up employment in the course of the marriage to attend to family duties in the home.  The court must take into account the contribution made by each of the spouses to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family.  The court must also take into account the effect on the earning capacity of each spouse of the marital responsibilities assumed by each during the period when the parties co-habited together.  In effect, these provisions will, for the first time in our law, afford a substantive recognition of the work done by the wife in the home and for the first time in legislation give statutory expression to the constitutional duty imposed on the State to recognise the worth of the work done by a wife in the home.  Despite all the constitutional rhetoric on this issue we have not, up to now, conferred such recognition on such work or required the courts to take such work into account when determining a wife's interests in family property acquired during the course of a marriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Section 14 provides that in considering the liability of one spouse to maintain the other and the amount of maintenance that should be ordered, the court can take into account the conduct of the spouse seeking maintenance where it is of such a nature and degree that it would be repugnant to justice to require that maintenance be paid to such a spouse.  At present, in maintenance proceedings brought under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, desertion by one spouse of the other is an absolute bar to the obtaining of maintenance, while adultery is a discretionary bar.  However, cruelty is not a bar to the obtaining of maintenance nor is the commission of unnatural practices or any other form of matrimonial misconduct. The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown recommends that the law in this area be changed and this provision is designed to implement the proposals of that committee.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the backdating of maintenance orders to the date when judicial separation proceedings were instituted and effectively prevents a spouse who fails to maintain his family from benefiting by deliberately delaying the hearing of court proceedings so as to avoid incurring an obligation to make maintenance payments for the support of a dependent wife and children.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the discharge or variation of maintenance orders in the event of a change of circumstances of either spouse.</P>
    <P>Section 17 applies to maintenance orders made subsequent to separation proceedings the same provisions as currently apply to maintenance orders made currently under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  Support payments for children can under this provision continue until a child attains the age of 16 years or if such child is still participating in a full time course of education or instruction until the child attains the age of 21 year's, as is the case currently under the 1976 Act.  If a child is suffering from mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not <Col N="887" /> reasonably possible for him to maintain himself fully, maintenance provided for the support of such a child can continue indefinitely, well beyond the child's 16th or 21st birthday.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 of the Bill extend provisions contained in existing maintenance law which apply to maintenance orders made under the Act of 1976 to maintenance orders that are to be made under this Bill and extends the remedy of attachment of earnings to such maintenance orders so that the employer of a maintenance defaulter can be required to make maintenance payments directly out of the defaulter's salary.  In effect, this means that if a maintenance order is made under the terms of this Bill and if a husband, for example, who is required to make maintenance fails to do so, and he is in employment, it will be possible for a wife to have his earnings attached. The weekly or monthly maintenance payable to the wife can be deducted by the employer for transmission to her.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with court jurisdiction.  As already stated, currently, separation proceedings can be commenced in either the High Court or the Circuit Court although the majority of such cases at present are brought in the Circuit Court.  Very often the Circuit Court hears family law cases on the same day as it hears criminal prosecutions, pub licensing applications, running down actions and other civil actions.  As a result distressed husbands and wives are very often left hanging around the courts while other legal proceedings are given precedence. The Bill expressly provides that the Circuit Court shall hear initially all judicial separation proceedings and that when it is dealing with such proceedings the Circuit Court is to be known as the Circuit Family Court.  It also provides that judicial separation proceedings should be heard on separate days set aside for the hearing of such proceedings and should not be intermingled with other types of court actions.  As an alternative, it is provided that the Circuit Court sitting as the Circuit Family Court <Col N="888" /> shall hear judicial separation proceedings at a separate venue from the venue in which other court proceedings are usually heard.  The Bill also provides that all existing powers vested in the Circuit Court to hear and determine family law cases shall be transferred to the Circuit Family Court and heard and dealt with by it.  Matters relating to the Circuit Court's jurisdiction are dealt with in sections 21 and 22 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for a degree of informality at the hearing of family law proceedings.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown emphasised the need to reduce the adversarial element inherent in the resolution of family disputes and to provide a less formal type of adjudication process for their resolution.  Where legal rights are in contest it is clear that it is essential to ensure that justice is properly administered. Accordingly, it is not possible to make such proceedings totally informal. To deal with this issue, however, the Bill provides that family law proceedings in the District, Circuit or High Courts shall be as informal as is practical and consistent with the administration of justice. These matters are dealt with under the provisions of sections 23 and 33 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that neither judges hearing family law proceedings nor barristers nor solicitors appearing in them should wear wigs or gowns.  This provision is similar to one enacted in the legislation of a number of other countries in recent years such as Australia and New Zealand.  To ensure that the anonymity of couples whose marriages have broken down is preserved provision is also made for all proceedings brought under the Bill to be heard <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>Of relevance to the manner in which the court exercises its jurisdiction is a provision contained in section 28 in Part IV of the Bill.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee emphasised the need to enable judges determining disputes in relation to children to obtain independent welfare reports and assessments to assist them in the decision-making process.  This section <Col N="889" /> amends the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, by adding provisions to it which confer power on all courts dealing with proceedings relating to children to seek independent medical, psychological, psychiatric or social work reports on the child, the subject of the proceedings. By virtue of this provision and the provisions contained in section 8 and 10 of the Bill and Circuit Family Court, following the granting of a decree of separation prior to the making of any access orders relating to the guardianship and custody of children, will, if the judge deems it necessary, be able to seek such independent reports.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with a number of consequential amendments of existing family law legislation which are required to provide for a consistent legal approach to the area of matrimonial law on the Bill being enacted.</P>
    <P>Before moving completely away from reference to the courts it is only right to state that while the Bill provides for a number of radical reforms and changes in the approach of the courts to the resolution of family conflicts, it does not in full implement a major recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  The reforms being introduced by the Bill all accord with individual recommendations made in the joint committee's report with regard to the reform of the courts.  However, a major recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee is that there should be established a unified family court structure to hear and determine all family law disputes between spouses that require judicial resolution.  They recommend that the current overlapping and fragmentary court jurisdictions exercised by the District, Circuit and High Courts should be transferred to a single court staffed by judges with a particular expertise in family law matters and who would have the backup of necessary welfare services. Unfortunately, it is not possible in the context of a Private Member's Bill to provide for the establishment of such a new court system.  Legislation providing for such a court can only be enacted by <Col N="890" /> the Government because it would constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  While the provisions contained in this Bill will substantially improve the current position I would urge the Minister and his officials to examine seriously the recommendations made by the Oireachtas joint committee to provide a unified system of family courts and I would hope that legislation to establish such courts would be brought forward by the Government in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I have now completed my outline of the main provisions of the Bill.  It is my hope that this measure will receive support on all sides of the House.  I have been greatly encouraged by the reaction I have received to it from Deputies on all sides of the House, including the Government side, since its publication and I would like to put on record my appreciation of the constructive approach adopted to the Bill by the Taoiseach who prior to Christmas indicated in the House that the measure would not be opposed by the Government and that he and the Government were well disposed to the Bill passing through Second Stage and proceeding into Committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed effectively to take Irish family law out of the 19th century and into the 21st century.  It seeks to minimise the hardship and distress that can occur when marriages break down and attempts to ameliorate rather than exacerbate marital conflict.</P>
    <P>It seeks to place a duty on lawyers consulted about a marital problem to ensure that all avenues have been explored by a distressed spouse before court proceedings are commenced.  It imposes for the first time in our law an obligation on solicitors to provide information about marriage guidance services that are available and, where marriage guidance is not a practicable possibility, it imposes an obligation on them to provide information about the availability of mediation services.</P>
    <P>It is a measure which is designed to encourage spouses whose marriages have broken down to reach a civilised agreement about their future arrangements <Col N="891" /> without the necessity of court proceedings where that is possible.  It confers new comprehensive powers on the courts to make financial lump sum and property transfer orders to provide additional protection, in particular for dependent wives and children, by enabling the courts to give to them a far greater degree of security than they can obtain at present.  By conferring a jurisdiction on the circuit family court to resolve all outstanding problems that arise upon a marriage breaking down in one court action, the Bill will reduce the cost of family law litigation and will simplify much of the documentation required to commence court proceedings.  Reform of the court procedures, the separation of family law court proceedings from other types of court proceedings, the prohibition on the wearing of wigs and gowns and provision to enable judges to obtain independent welfare reports on children will make family law court proceedings a less distressing experience for those who look to the law to resolve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a detailed and constructive debate on the various issues raised by the Bill.  The intention of Fine Gael in bringing forward this Bill is to provide the best and most comprehensive measure that is possible in this area.  In this context I look forward to hearing any comments and criticisms Deputies may have to make.  As we move out of Second Stage and into Committee Stage I will welcome any constructive amendments Deputies may propose that can improve the Bill to ensure that upon its enactment it will comprehensively and effectively reform our laws.</P>
    <P>This Bill, like the Adoption Bill that we brought before this House last year, is one of a number of social reforming measures Fine Gael intend to bring before the House during the lifetime of this Dáil.  A party in Opposition have a duty not merely to criticise the Government when they deserve to be criticised but to bring forward constructive legislative measures that deal with major areas of reform that need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> Thirty years have elapsed since a Private Members' Bill was last enacted.  It is noteworthy that in the 30 year period of 1928-1958, 16 Private Member's Bills were enacted through the Oireachtas. Since 1958, not a single such Bill has become law.  It is unfortunate that Governments of different political persuasions in recent years have automatically taken the view that a Private Member's Bill sponsored by an Opposition party should be opposed regardless of the content of such Bill or its merits.</P>
    <P>For too long Governments in this country have looked with suspicion on Private Member's Bills brought forward by individual Deputies for no reason other than to protect what has come to be regarded as the ministerial prerogative to introduce legislation and Governments have automatically and mindlessly opposed such Bills even if their passage would facilitate the Government in implementing policies which they supported.</P>
    <P>The present Government are to be commended for not adopting such a knee jerk reaction.  It is to be hoped that in the context of this Dáil the Government in their response not only to this Bill but to future Private Member's Bills that are published will copperfasten a change of attitude and a more mature political approach to the legislative process.  We fought in this country for centuries to be given the privilege of legislating for ourselves.  For too long Deputies in this House have been criticised for not acting as legislators when in reality they have been prevented by successive Governments from doing so.  For too long Opposition and backbench Deputies have accepted the role of the legislative eunuch imposed upon them by the Government of the day.  My own party have on occasion been as much as a sinner in this as sinned against.  It is to be hoped that this Bill will be the harbinger of what can be described as a new parliamentary glasnost.</P>

      <P>As Deputies know, the Minister for Justice is engaged on very important business connected with the Anglo-Irish <Col N="893" /> Conference so I am speaking on his behalf at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Government support the principle of this Bill and are anxious to see it proceed through Second Stage to be dealt thereafter in special committee.  The Bill deals with matters which as Deputy Shatter has said, have been the subject of reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and of the Law Reform Commission.  The commission discussed and considered the relative merits of certain approaches and their final views are expressed in the large number of recommendations for changes in the law of separation, or divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> as it is called at present, contained in their report.  In their deliberations the joint committee took account of the Law Reform Commission's report, but did not follow it in full.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the previous Government stated their intention to implement changes in the law of separation taking into account those two reports.  Deputy Shatter's initiative in having the Bill published is to be commended and welcomed.  I welcome the sentiments Deputy Shatter expressed towards the end of his speech. I recognise the constructive part which an Opposition can play and the detailed work which has gone into the Bill.  I also recognise that Deputy Shatter was big enough to say that the Government have done the right thing.  I will not refer to the last period in Government but we have reached a stage where, especially through committees and the work of the Opposition, we can have proposals discussed objectively here on the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated previously to the House that my own proposals for changes in the law on separation were at an advanced stage of preparation and I have looked at the Bill in the light of those proposals. There are a number of matters in the Bill which are of concern to me and which may require amendment.  I am in the process of ascertaining the views of interested Departments and of my colleagues in Government about these and other amendments which I think should <Col N="894" /> be made to the Bill.  These other amendments I refer to are extensive and are designed to improve the Bill.  However, in my speech I intend to concentrate on the main matters of concern to me and to indicate the kind of amendments I have in mind to deal with that concern.</P>
    <P>The Bill is important because of the extended remedies it proposes, namely, extension of the grounds for a decree of judicial separation, and the new maintenance, lump sums, secured payments and property orders provisions.  The present remedy, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, has limited application because the grounds on which a decree is available are confined to adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices.  Alimony is available only to the wife.  Where, however, there is failure to maintain, the provisions of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, can be availed of by either spouse.  However, most separating couples resort instead to comprehensive deeds of separation.</P>
    <P>That practice would of course continue to be the most appropriate procedure even after the enactment of this Bill &mdash; since it is generally better for couples with problems to come to mutually satisfactory solutions rather than to involve the courts &mdash; but undoubtedly there are cases in which both spouses, because of their differences, cannot agree to the terms of separation and may ultimately need to resort to the courts.  In these cases it is important that the courts should have wider powers to grant a decree and to make ancillary orders, of the kind dealt with by Deputy Shatter in this Bill.  The limited value of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> decrees at present is reflected in the small number of applications to the courts.  In 1986, 189 applications were made, 183 of which were made in the Circuit Court and the remaining six in the High Court.</P>
    <P>All the reports I have mentioned, as well as the Bill, recommend that the grounds for a decree of judicial separation should be extended.  The approach in the Bill is that irretrievable breakdown should be the sole ground after proof of various matters such as <Col N="895" /> adultery, unreasonable behaviour, desertion and separation.  I have reservations concerning irretrievable breakdown being the sole ground on which a decree of judicial separation should be granted, despite the fact that a similar recommendation was made by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>
    <P>My first objection is a conceptual one. Judicial separation does not put an end to the marriage &mdash; the parties remain free to come together again and have the decree discharged.  Irretrievable breakdown, if the phrase means anything, does not therefore appear to be an appropriate concept to use in the context of judicial separation.  Another objection is that irretrievable breakdown of the marriage does not require to be proved before a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> can be granted under present law.  Such a decree can be obtained on proof, simply, of, say, adultery or cruelty without anything further.  If proof of irretrievable breakdown were to be insisted on as well, the result could be that decrees might not be available in circumstances where they could be obtained under present law.  Of course, it could be argued against this point that it would probably be that once one of the other facts were proved, acceptance by the court that the marriage was, in fact, broken down irretrievably would, in practice, become a formality &mdash; as it has become in England, in relation to divorce, where there is a similar requirement to prove breakdown in addition to one or more other facts (such as adultery or separation).  On this view, however, the addition of a requirement to prove breakdown, in addition, to, say, adultery serves no useful purpose and is, in fact, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the proposal in the Bill seems to be the claim that &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; as the ground for a decree removes the need to investigate questions of fault.  On any view, this claim does not hold water since the court would expressly be required, before granting a decree, to make a finding on one or more other facts, three of which adultery, <Col N="896" /> desertion and unreasonable behaviour, clearly involve fault.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to the view that it might be preferable to follow more closely the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this matter.  Broadly, their recommendation would mean that one or more of the facts set out as (a) to (e) of section 2 of the Bill would be sufficient ground for granting a decree, namely, adultery, desertion, unreasonable behaviour, separation for one year where there is consent and separation for three years.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> had a similar proposal as, indeed, did the previous Government's Statement of Intentions.  The ground at section 2 (f) in the Bill namely, that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live apart from the other spouse, is so wide as to be almost meaningless and I do not think that it should be retained.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, in effect, in sections 14 and 27 that desertion will no longer prevent people from getting maintenance or statutory succession rights.  In relation to maintenance, the Bill contains the general provision that the conduct of parties shall affect maintenance awards where that conduct is &ldquo;repugnant&rdquo;.  While I acknowledge that these provisions are in line with proposals made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, it would seem to me that there should be strong convincing reasons before we make such a fundamental change in the law which would allow a spouse who repudiates the marriage by deserting to benefit from the resulting breakdown of the marriage.  I am not aware that such convincing reasons have been advanced for the change recommended. My present view is that I would prefer to see a provision that is in line with existing family law provisions, providing that desertion should be an absolute bar to an application by a spouse for maintenance, or for any financial or property order under the Bill and, apart from that, that the conduct of each spouse would be a matter to be considered by the court in deciding whether to make such an order, where that conduct was such that in the <Col N="897" /> opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it.  I might mention that the position under existing law is that if a spouse obtains a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> on account of his wife's adultery, no alimony is payable to the wife.</P>
    <P>On the question of succession rights, the Bill provides in section 30 that, following a transitional period, a spouse who is in desertion for two years or more would no longer be precluded from succeeding to the estate of a deceased spouse.  It would appear that the basis for the provision is the supposition that in all cases of desertion a decree of judicial separation will be applied for.  I think there can be no basis for such a supposition. Apart from the effects on succession of a decree of judicial separation which I will deal with now, I can see no grounds for a change in the present position on desertion as a bar to statutory rights of succession.</P>
    <P>The Bill in sections 10 (1) (g) and 12, following generally the recommendation of the joint committee, proposes that, on the granting of a decree for judicial separation, the court should have the power to vary or discharge rights of succession of a spouse but only if, at the same time, it also makes a lump sum, property transfer, or settlement order in favour of that spouse, save where that spouse has been guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct.  My main worry with this is that where under the proposal a court declined to make a lump sum, property or settlement order for the benefit of a dependent spouse in favour of allowing that spouse to keep his or her succession rights to the other spouse's estate, the latter may subsequently dissipate his or her assets, leaving no estate against which such dependent spouse can claim.  This danger would exist also where under the proposal a court varied succession rights. The objection might also be made that giving the court discretion to vary succession rights offends against the long standing policy which favours certainty in the law of succession.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Law Reform Commission that on the granting of a <Col N="898" /> decree of judicial separation each spouse would be precluded from taking any share in the other's estate might be preferable. It is, of course, a common condition in the standard form of separation agreement used by separated persons that they each give up succession rights to the estate of the other.  If the course recommended by the Law Reform Commission were adopted, loss of succession rights would have to be one of the matters the court would have regard to when exercising its powers to make a financial provision order.  In this way, a dependent spouse would be as fully protected as possible.  The question of succession rights following the granting of a decree of judicial separation certainly raises difficulties and it is one on which I would like to have the views of my colleagues in Government before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while it provides for the court to seek reports on children, does not expressly provide that the court, before granting a decree must be satisfied that the arrangements made for each child are adequate and reasonable in the circumstances. I would regard the inclusion of such a provision in the Bill of great importance to ensure that arrangements that are as satisfactory as possible are made for any dependent children.  It is also a matter for consideration whether the court should be enabled to make property orders for the benefit of any dependent children, not just the spouse as is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Generally, on the financial and property order provisions in the Bill, might I say at the outset that, apart from the one I have just mentioned, there are various aspects of those provisions which I think could be improved.  There is, for example, no provision to nullify or render void transactions designed to frustrate the making of orders by the court.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Court will have power to make an order conferring on one spouse, either for life or for such shorter period as the court may decide, the right to occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse.  In the alternative, the court may order the sale of the family home, or any property of a <Col N="899" /> spouse, but in this regard the powers of the court under the Bill appear to be limited to sale of property held by the spouses jointly or in common.  Provided that the power being given to the court to transfer property is constitutionally sound &mdash; I will come to that question in a moment &mdash; it would appear that the court should be given wider powers as to sale of property and generally to ensure that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, is made for any spouse and dependent child.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the important question as to whether the provisions giving the court discretion to transfer property as between the spouses or between a spouse and his or her dependent children could give rise to constitutional challenge.  This is a matter on which I am seeking the advice of the Attorney General.  However, I might say that I would regard the inclusion of such provisions as being a particularly important aspect of the Bill and it was my intention, provided they were not regarded as being constitutionally unacceptable, to propose similar type provisions to those included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It would, under the Bill, be open to persons who have separation agreements to apply for a judicial separation and any ancillary order as to maintenance, lump sums, property etc.  It might be a matter for consideration also as to whether persons who have a divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> should be allowed, if they wish, apply to court under the new financial and property provisions in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides safeguards to ensure that the spouses are aware of alternatives, namely, counselling and mediation, to court proceedings in separation cases.  There could be some strengthening of those provisions to provide that the court itself would be required to address itself to the possibility of reconciliation or, if reconciliation is not possible, to whether mediation procedures, designed to achieve the maximum degree of agreement <Col N="900" /> between the parties on the terms of their separation, should be invoked.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for certain changes in procedures: family business in the Circuit Court would in future be conducted in a &ldquo;family circuit court&rdquo;; family business in all the courts would be conducted as informally as possible and neither judges nor barristers would wear wigs or gowns. I am disposed generally to changes along those lines but, unlike the Bill, I think that the High Court should continue to have jurisdiction in judicial separation proceedings because ancillary orders may be made which concern property, the value of which exceeds the present jurisdictional limits of the Circuit Court.  It is the case, of course, that parties could as at present consent to having the matter dealt with in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>There may be a difficulty however, concerning section 22 of the Bill under which the circuit family court would have to sit in a different place or at different times or on different days from those on which the ordinary sittings of the Circuit Court are held.  The difficulty arises in relation to the sittings of the court outside Dublin.  There would, I understand, be no difficulty in relation to Dublin.  What the Bill seems to require is that either two judges should be sitting together in a town thus requiring a separate venue, or that, if there is only one judge, he or she should allocate a separate day or days for family law business exclusively. Having regard to existing commitments in the Circuit Court, it is quite likely that if this mandatory provision were enacted, it would give rise to extra Exchequer spending from the point of view of staffing.  I have already indicated to the House on a previous occasion that the institution of family courts could be very costly in buildings and staff and, therefore, is out of the question in present financial circumstances.  In view of this it may be necessary to amend the Bill to provide only that the Circuit Court should, as far as practicable, when hearing family law cases sit in a different place or at different times.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, among the other matters in the Bill which are of concern to me are <Col N="901" /> the following.  There appears to be some doubt as to how conduct of a spouse would be taken into account when the court is making orders other than maintenance orders and this may need to be clarified.  Another matter concerns the provision in the Bill abolishing the bars to a decree of judicial separation, subject to retention of condonation, conduct which condones the behaviour of the other spouse, in a modified form &mdash; sections 3 and 32.  On the basis that a person should not be allowed benefit from his own wrongdoing there appears to be a good case for retaining connivance as a bar, that is, where a decree is sought on the grounds of adultery and the other party proves that the adultery was committed with the connivance of the applicant, the decree should be refused.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is enacted it will add substantially to the very few examples of Private Members' Bills that have been enacted.  When the Government's views on the matters I am putting to them have been made known it will be necessary to refer them to the parliamentary draftsman for the drafting of any amendments that might be required.  This will take time and it will be necessary to allow an adequate period to elapse before Committee Stage to allow the drafting to be done.  Having said that, I can assure the sponsor of whatever assistance and cooperation is necessary to have the Bill made law as soon as possible.  As I said at the outset, I am happy to support the principle of the Bill and I commend Deputy Shatter on bringing it to the House.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats support the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill moved this evening by Fine Gael.  At the outset I would like to congratulate and compliment Deputy Shatter for initiating this reform in this very important area by way of this Private Members' Bill.  I agree with what he said about the reluctance of various Governments down the years to bring on board legislation initiated by Members of this House.  I hope that has changed and, if so, will be of benefit not just to this <Col N="902" /> House but generally to the benefit of the country.  I often find that Deputies, when they are in Opposition, although they do not have the resources available that one would have in Government, have the kind of forward thinking that is required to initiate reforms of this kind and other kinds that we need so much.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw attention to the last paragraph of the Minister's speech.  I hope I am not misrepresenting what he meant by that paragraph when I say that it seems that although Fianna Fáil and the Government are supporting this Bill, I can in some way detect a sense of &ldquo;let us put it on the long finger for a while&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If this Bill passes Second Stage next week we should not delay in establishing a special all-party committee of this House to deal with the matter and departmental advice should be available to that committee in order to allow them bring forward the draft proposals.  Whatever about the drafting, it is important that we get together on that committee to tease out the differences we may have to various aspects of this Bill.</P>
      <P>As a former member of the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, I am only too well aware of the tragic situation in which so many Irish people find themselves as a result of our archaic laws, and often indeed our lack of any law at all, in this vital area of social policy.  Despite the disappointing outcome of the divorce referendum in 1986, the fact remains that marital breakdown is increasing at a frightening rate in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the recent census figures grossly underestimate the extent of the problem.  Those figures indicated that <Col N="903" /> 37,245 people were affected in a legal sense by marital breakdown, that is persons who had had their marriages annulled, were deserted, who were involved in legal separations or who had got a divorce in other countries.  I believe there are many thousands more Irish people who are in difficult and broken marriages who have never had recourse to the law simply because there are not adequate laws here to allow people avail of such facilities.  Many victims of broken marriages prefer to live in distressing circumstances rather than face the consequences of openly acknowledging that their marriages have failed.  Irish society is still driven by a prejudice that makes it easier to sweep difficult social issues under the carpet than face up to the problem and implement sensible legislation.</P>
    <P>Legal remedies cannot stop or cure marriage breakdown but they can alleviate its inherent problems by allowing those involved to have recourse to compassionate and realistic laws.  The provisions of this Bill will do that in respect of judicial separation.  They seek to remove the present Victorian criteria of endeavouring to establish who committed the matrimonial fault before a court can grant a decree of judicial separation. When this Bill is passed a couple will be able to get a judicial separation if their marriage has broken down irretrievably. Laws that enforce the fault mentality in inter-personal relationships hinder rather than help families in these difficult circumstances and, I believe, have no place in a caring society.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy with the Minister's view that irretrievable breakdown should not constitute the grounds for deciding that somebody should get a decree of judicial separation.  I somehow detect that the Minister wants to retain the system whereby one establishes the fault against somebody, and try to establish who committed the wrong and when.  I do not think that is any way to proceed in this area.</P>
    <P>I support fully the views of Deputy Shatter, as outlined in this Bill, and the views of the all-party Joint Committee on <Col N="904" /> Marriage Breakdown.  That was one area in which we were in agreement &mdash; that more than anything else irretrievable breakdown should constitute the basis for granting a decree of judicial separation. Although supporting this Bill in principle I believe it to be defective in a number of respects.  I say that realising that any Bill on judicial separation cannot do everything that needs to be done in the whole family law area.  It still leaves the whole jurisdiction of family law within the present courts structure.  I do not believe a court, however informal, is the appropriate place to deal with family disputes. I acknowledge what Deputy Shatter said this evening and also what is said in the explanatory memorandum &mdash; that establishing family tribunals would place an extra cost on the Exchequer.  In a Private Member's Bill one cannot introduce proposals involving any extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I believe we should, as a matter of urgency, begin the process of implementing a unified system of family tribunals here.  I believe that the adversarial courts structure &mdash; the whole idea of a court &mdash; is the wrong place for people to go with family problems. These tribunals should be staffed by people capable of dealing with marriage breakdown in a sympathetic manner.  The removal of wigs and gowns is useless unless we have properly trained personnel, social workers, psychologists, marriage counsellors and so on to assist couples, particularly in the welfare of the children.</P>
    <P>There must be adequate accommodation made to house such tribunals. The present circumstances in which people often have to queue in corridors along with criminals and others in order to have family cases heard is a disgrace. Although I have never been involved in a family law case many people I have met who have had recourse to the courts in order to establish their rights have said that had they been aware of the facilities, indeed the whole ethos of the courts in these areas, they would not have gone near a court in the first instance, that they had found the experience degrading in <Col N="905" /> the extreme.  Many such people have told me that they felt like criminals.</P>
    <P>The criteria for selecting people to adjudicate on these family disputes in such tribunals should be different from the usual criteria used in selecting judges. This was a recommendation also of the all-party Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It is the case that many people who at present adjudicate on family disputes do not have the interest, training or, above all else, the kind of sensitivity &mdash; to put it at its best &mdash; needed to deal with family disputes.  Training in family law, which became part of the curriculum for law students in the last 15 years or so, is vital for judges and others involved in this area.</P>
    <P>Very often family law is considered the pits by the legal profession; many senior lawyers and members of the Judiciary never want to become involved.  Here I want to exclude Deputy Shatter.  I know he is one of our leading lawyers in this area but it is a fact that many lawyers never want to touch family law.</P>
    <P>Helping the victims of marriage breakdown to reconcile their differences by way of marriage counselling is at present in this country left exclusively to various churches and to the few private agencies that have been established for this purpose. With the exception of the pilot mediation and conciliation scheme established by the Minister with responsibility for women's affairs in the last Government, former Deputy Nuala Fennell, there has not been established here any proper State mediation or marriage counselling service.  That is a disgrace.  If the words of the Constitution and all the noble sentiments contained in speeches made in this House and elsewhere &mdash; particularly in the course of referenda held here &mdash; mean anything they must mean that the State should involve itself in the whole area of marriage counselling, mediation and so on.  We must make it very clear that the best way that couples in a marital dispute can resolve their differences is by way of mediation and not through the courts.  The courts and lawyers are not qualified or suitable people to resolve such difficulties.  They should <Col N="906" /> be brought into family circumstances only when everything else has failed.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Shatter, under the provisions of this Bill, places an onus on the solicitor consulted to inform his or her client that they should avail of marriage counselling or of mediation services, that is not sufficient.  There is, first, the lack of resources and it is my belief that when people consult a solicitor they have probably passed that stage anyway.  We need to educate couples involved in marital difficulties to seek help at the very early stages.  The time at which they consult lawyers is possibly too late.  I know that many lawyers consulted on family law matters do ask people whether they have consulted a marriage counsellor.  Usually it transpires that the marriage counsellor is a local priest or some such person. Indeed many Members of this House often end up acting as marriage counsellors particularly women Members.  We end up filling a vacuum for which we are not trained because the State has not involved itself in this area.</P>
    <P>The welfare of children in this country takes second place to that of their parents.  The Minister referred to this matter in the course of his remarks.  The provisions of this Bill should place an onus on the court to have a report on the child's or children's welfare before making any decree.  That should be mandatory.  If both parents agree there is no problem but, in cases where there is not agreement in relation to the children, it should be mandatory rather than leaving it to the discretion of the court.  It should be mandatory to order a proper professional report regarding the welfare of the children.</P>
    <P>Following a family law dispute in this country parents end up joint guardians of their children.  Although one parent will have custody both will end up as joint guardians.  We need to examine these provisions again.  There are many parents who, because they have been cruel to or have been involved in assaults of one kind or another on their children do not deserve to remain as joint guardians of their children.  In those circumstances we <Col N="907" /> need to look seriously at the responsibility of parents and of the State.</P>
    <P>I hope that the child care and protection Bill, promised by this Government, will soon be introduced in this House so that the welfare of our children can be taken care of, so that, above all else, their rights and interests are taken fully into account in family law disputes. Invariably they end up the real, innocent victims in such disputes.</P>
    <P>We also need to raise the marriage age. I accept that perhaps not all of these things can be achieved under the provisions of this Bill but, in the context of family law it warrants examination. There was a consensus in the all-party Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in relation to this matter also that the marriage age should be raised to 18.</P>
    <P>There are many people in this country involved in marital disputes of one kind or another who often escape honouring their responsibilities.  For example, when a wife is deserted the onus is on her to establish where her husband is, whereas I contend that a woman in those circumstances is not in a position to do so.  It is my belief that the State should assume that responsibility, the State should endeavour to establish the whereabouts of the husband.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said that in cases where somebody deserts their spouse, they should not be entitled to maintenance allowance or whatever.  I strongly disagree with that. In many cases people have no option but to desert because of the behaviour of the other spouse.  It would be very wrong if they were not entitled to maintenance simply because they had been forced, for one reason or another, such as mental cruelty or whatever, to desert the other spouse.  I do not like that thinking which forces people to stay together in order to get financial benefit.  It is wrong and I would be very worried if that were to be a prerequisite for maintenance in this country.</P>

      <P>All the laws in the country are useless if people do not have access to the law.  The present civil legal aid scheme is, to put it mildly, a farce; it is in total chaos.  It is particularly so when it comes to family law.  First we have too few centres.  Second in areas where there is only one centre to cover a large geographic area, if one party goes to that centre obviously the other party to the marriage has to go elsewhere.  It needs to be looked at again.  We need to ensure that people have access to the law and to information and advice and are not denied that simply because they have no money or because they live in a particular part of the country.  I accept the financial difficulties that exist.  But priority must be given to those in our society who are living in difficult family circumstances, many of whom feel that they cannot have recourse to the law because they cannot travel the requisite journey, do not know where to go or whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's Bill is simplifying the procedures for applying for a decree of judicial separation.  I would like to see them simplified even further so that ordinary individuals could, off their own bat, make these applications without having to go to lawyers.  I know it is not a prerequisite under Deputy Shatter's Bill, or even under the existing legislation, to go to a lawyer, but the law is so complicated and application forms are so technical that one would need to be a lawyer to understand them.  We need to simplify the procedures as much as possible so that people need not unnecessarily engage the services of lawyers before coming before a court or a tribunal to make application for a decree of judicial separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill people can now, for the first time, take a number of different aspects of their marital disputes under the one application and will not have to apply to different courts under different laws for different things.  That is a good thing.  It is farcical that at present one has has to go through so many different procedures to sort out marital disputes in relation to the family home, maintenance, barring orders, custody etc.  It is welcome that all of this can now be done <Col N="909" /> at once.  It makes it easier, not just in a financial sense but in a practical way from the point of view of the person going through this experience; it will obviously ease the burden and trauma on them. People in this situation are in a very vulnerable position and the worst time of all is often immediately before a court appearance.  If we can minimise the number of times they have to go to court or to lawyers then that will be for the better.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas that need to be looked at again.  First, there is the whole question of property.  We need to look extensively at this in relation to marital disputes and in relation to marriage generally &mdash; one does not need to be in dispute to have something sorted out in that area.  The Family Home Protection Act needs to be examined and there are a number of problems here.  In particular there is a problem where one party to a marriage gets an unsecured loan and subsequently a bank or a building society can repossess the house to have that loan paid off.  We need to look at that whole area to make sure that we do not damage the cause of a family, particularly the dependent spouse and the children.</P>
    <P>In this legislation we need to take on board an education process in relation to marriage in the first instance because there is too little preparation for it; second, in relation to the counselling and mediation services that are available, albeit private facilities provided by the churches and private organisations, the mediation service in operation in the Irish Life building is not well advertised.  I know they have dealt with a couple of hundred cases to date but it is not well advertised and many people are not aware of its existence.  I know advertising facilities of this kind can be costly, but they could be advertised through the NSSB, which I hope is still in operation, and organisations of that kind which tend to deal with people involved in marital disputes.  This service needs to be more widely used than it is.  The words in the Constitution regarding the protection of the family, if they are to mean anything, <Col N="910" /> must be given weight in legislation and the legislation must be effective by way of proper information and education.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate that will follow over the next two weeks in this House.  I know the Bill now has the support of all the parties in this House and that is the way it should be.  Perhaps if the last referendum in this country had had the full support of all the parties we would be able to do even more in this whole area of marital breakdown because, at the end of the day, no matter what laws or changes we make, by way of this Bill or any other, we will not be able to give those unfortunate people who are the victims of marital breakdown a second chance; we will not be able to dissolve their marriages and allow them remarry, and that is a great pity indeed. It is a sorry state that we are still in this position in 1988.  Sometimes when you make comments like that you are told that you are abiding not by the wishes of the people.  I do abide by the wishes of the people.  I have no choice anyway.  But I think the people made a mistake, and I think they made a mistake because they were misled by the false and horrible campaign conducted by many groups in this country.  I met deserted wives who told me they voted no because they thought they would lose their deserted wife's benefit if they voted yes.  That is the level to which the campaign unfortunately descended.</P>
    <P>I hope we will not have campaigns of that kind again and that it will not be long before we are in a position to enact full and proper legislation in this area so that people can be given a second chance. Regrettably, even the all-party committee on marital breakdown, of which I was a member, did not make recommendations for divorce, whether it was because we were not mature enough or courageous enough or whatever to do that.  Yet 20 years earlier our predecessors on a different committee recommended divorce; it was not the ideal divorce, it was divorce for Protestants or for minority religious groups, but it was some divorce.  Twenty years <Col N="911" /> later we were not even in a position to make a recommendation of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats fully support the Bill.  I look forward to participating in the all-party committee that will make some of the changes that I believe will improve the measure and make it more effective.</P>

      <P>I too wish to welcome this Bill which has been presented by Deputy Shatter as a Private Member's Bill, and I welcome the Government's conditional support for it and the contributions of all the Deputies who have spoken this evening.</P>
      <P>The Bill can be regarded as a consensus document.  Deputy Shatter has put it before the House, obviously with an eye to meeting the broadest possible consensus of the various views that will be reflected by Deputies.  While he may not have reached the type of consensus document which many Deputies would put forward, nevertheless he is to be commended for having taken that discipline on board in relation to the production of a document which can be at least debated and discussed in this House in a very nonpartisan and constructive way.  I hope the comments I make will be consistent with that spirit.  If I have any criticisms of the Bill it will be with a view to perfecting the consensus and making it a more solid and viable entity and structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general intent of the Bill, as I understand it, is to make the process of judicial separation as we know it in this jurisdiction &mdash; otherwise referred to as divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>&mdash; more efficient and more identifiable as a remedy for people with marital problems who very often, in the present very unsatisfactory situation, seek various limited remedies and effectively try to use the courts as courts of judicial separation.  It is my view that the courts have been pressed into an excessive jurisdiction in many instances in applications for barring orders, and for maintenance, under the married women's property Acts and other legislation which were used as the various components of what sometimes proved <Col N="912" /> to be full blown judicial separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>It was a wrong use of the courts to have them pressed into making decisions on barring orders which were effectively decisions amounting to divorce.  The recent decisions of the courts in relation to barring orders, especially those of the Supreme Court, have indicated that the courts eventually recoiled from being pressed into this type of toil.  I consider the decisions of the court in this area to have put a very desirable pressure on the Houses of the Oireachtas to legislate positively in this area and not to shirk the responsibility for legislation by waiting for the courts to act inventively, ingenuously, and, very often without any democratic backing.  The position as it has evolved to date is satisfactory in the democratic context in so far as it does not arise from the establishment of an independent law making function by the court which has to be rectified by this House, but arises from the fact that the courts have not exercised any far ranging and possibly dangerous law making function which would have to be rectified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem to be addressed is a very wide ranging problem.  I agree with Deputies who have said that it is perhaps understand by the various statistics.  The measure of the problem of marital breakdown can be indicated not by the existing track record of applications to courts for decrees of judicial separation but rather by the applications to courts of various kinds of barring orders, maintenance orders and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I preface my remarks by saying that perhaps the view being taken of the Bill as one not giving rise to any great financial demands on the Government, and thus not being a Bill which the Government should initiate as a Bill charging moneys on the revenue, is not, if one considers what might work out in practice, a legitimate view.  If this Bill is passed, as it will and must be in something approximating its present form, then the vast number of <Col N="913" /> barring order applications in many cases will be transformed into applications for judicial separation.  That is a fact.  That in itself will create a vast volume of demand for judicial services in the form of courts and staff being available to hear the cases.  This in turn will put what I consider to be an intolerable strain on the existing system especially in the country where the circuit system works from county to county.  I cannot see the present distribution of judges or the present arrangement of courts being able to handle the situation, even on the modified basis proposed by the Minister for Social Welfare this evening.</P>
    <P>To the extent that the Bill produces economic pressures which, ultimately, and if we are to be realistic about it, will place a financial burden on the Exchequer, I wonder if we are being realistic debating the Bill without considering first where the resources will come from to match what I referred to as judicial services which will be required by the public, and which will be the right of the public to require, under the Act.</P>

      <P>One of the main thrusts of the Bill which appeals particularly to me as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights is the fact that the Bill encourages reconciliation in a formal way.  This principle is one towards which practically all Irish people would aspire.  It is a source of much concern to ordinary people, to many Deputies and to me that the judicial system to date has, to a large measure, discouraged the tendency for parties to a marital dispute to seek reconciliation.  I have already stated on a number of occasions at the committee on women's rights that in many cases legal advisers are constrained to advise parties to a marital dispute not to seek reconciliation because to do so at certain stages of the proceedings would, <Col N="914" /> in their professional view, prevent them attaining the legal rights for which they retained their professional advisers.  This is a situation the Bill seeks to redress and I give full credit for the effort in that regard.</P>
      <P>I have some reservations about the position in which the legal advisers would find themselves in the event of their having to advise parties of the alternative of reconciliation.  It will be very difficult for a solicitor or barrister to go into court, to take the stand as a witness and to tell the court what they told their clients in relation to reconciliation, how far they have to go and break what has long been recognised as their professional commitment to confidentiality, privilege and silence as to what they said to their client and what their client said to them.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Shatter proposes is a very radical innovation.  I would suggest, respectfully, at this that the House should consider that the old tried and trusted procedure of independent legal advice in some shape or form to supply the type of advice which a party to a marital dispute would be required to receive in that instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter of remedial works to Teach Earlsfort because there is widespread dismay that the collection of taxes has been &mdash; and continues to be &mdash; disrupted with no apparent end in sight to this dispute which has been running now for over a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute is a continuation of one which led to a strike about a year ago and it concerns the poor level of air circulation and humidification in the building which is occupied by the Office of the Collector General.  There is also a question of overcrowding. Last year's strike went on for about ten days and, during this dispute, the IIRS were commissioned to write a report on conditions in the building.  Certain recommendations were made and the Revenue Commissioners undertook <Col N="915" /> to have the repairs and alterations carried out by the Office of Public Works.  This was undertaken to happen within a period of six to eight weeks.  This became three months and three months became six months.  Finally, last December, the IIRS were asked to do a further report on what modifications had been carried out to date and on the state of the building.</P>
    <P>The fact that this office is closed is a matter of great concern to the Government, the Minister for Finance and certainly to me.  Any delay in the collection of taxes is absolutely crucial to a Government with such a strict budgetary policy. The dispute, which caused the closure of the office last year, is wholly due to the fact that the undertakings given a year ago have not been acted upon or certainly not fully acted upon.  What is at stake? Why is there such a fuss?  It does not seem to be too great a problem.  There is not enough air and the surroundings are not very pleasant, but we all know what that is like around this House where there is not enough room for all of us and sometimes the air conditioning is not what it might be.</P>
    <P>This building was originally leased by the Office of Public Works about 15 years ago for the Revenue Commissioners and it was intended to have about 380 people in the building.  Today, there are approximately 600 people in it and the number is rising weekly as more staff are redeployed from other areas.  I welcome redeployment; nevertheless it puts strains on the accommodation.  I learned today that staff in these offices have been sent home on numerous occasions over the past couple of years because the building was either too hot or too cold.  Two years ago, on a number of occasions, the whole complement of staff was sent home because the building was too hot.</P>
    <P>What kind of tax collection system can continue when it is clogged up by this stop-go situation?  Only last week a whole floor of this building was cleared out and the people sent home because conditions were freezing.  That cannot continue.  A sum of £150,000 has been spent on this <Col N="916" /> building over the past year or so in putting in new thermostats and one must ask what the result is if a whole floor full of people have been sent out of the building because it is not possible to work there.</P>
    <P>The delay in receipt of any revenue must be a serious matter but when you consider that all the value-added tax due for the November-December period is coming in at this time and not getting through to the Collector General and that it represents the value-added tax coming in on goods sold during the Christmas rush &mdash; on which, presumably, an enormous amount of VAT was paid &mdash; it is not good enough to allow this dispute to continue.  The details and issues were decided a year ago and all that is required is that they should be acted on.</P>
    <P>One must also remember that all the PAYE payments for December 1987 are now due but not getting through.  There are literally millions of pounds in sorting offices waiting to go into the Collector General's office and that is not good enough.  Another aspect of business carried on with the Collector General is the refund of VAT.  Cheques are issued on a regular basis for VAT refunds.  They are drawn by the Revenue Commissioners against an account with the Central Bank.  Naturally, they have to put money into this account on a regular basis because, if no funds are lodged to that account, there is a risk that there will be insufficient funds to meet cheques which have been issued in the last week.  Any delay in collection of taxes must be looked at very seriously.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the role of the Office of Public Works.  As I said, they leased the building some 15 years ago on behalf of the State for the use of the Revenue Commissioners.  They are responsible for the maintenance of the building and one would expect them to be responsible for the maintenance of the system of humidification and air conditioning in the building.  They renewed that lease around this time last year in full knowledge of the existing problems. I hope that responsibility for maintenance of the system as it stands rests <Col N="917" /> with the Office of Public Works and not with the landlord because, if it rests with the landlord and is inherently a bad system, not suitable for these premises, the Office of Public Works should not have renewed the lease without at least making sure that the landlords did something about this problem.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the Office of Public Works are directly responsible for maintenance and for the efficiency of the system, one must say they have failed in their duty because this is a long running problem.  An undertaking was given a year ago which indicated that the levels of air coming into the building and circulated would be increased.  It is acknowledged by the IIRS that there is approximately 10,550 cubic feet of fresh air being circulated around the building but the rate recommended by the CIBSE 1986 guide for that space and those numbers is 18,400 cubic feet.  There is a very wide discrepancy there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a standard accepted by the IIRS and others.  The IIRS and the Revenue Commissioners acknowledge that they are making efforts to bring the level up to 15,000 cubic feet.  That is actually a decrease on 18 months ago when they had a throughput of about 16,000 cubic feet per minute of air going through the building.  I know this sounds very complicated but it is remarkable that in 18 months they have actually lost capacity and they have still being putting money into it and increasing the output and making the whole system more efficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage they are offering to put the level up again to about 15,000 cubic feet per minute by the end of March 1988. In itself it sounds a reasonable proposition. Why should not the people who work there accept that this is what should happen?  One must have regard to the similar undertaking which was given last year to complete the work, all works which had been agreed on, in approximately six to eight weeks.  That work still <Col N="918" /> has not been done satisfactorily.  They are only offering to upgrade the fresh air output and the problems about humidity and overcrowding are not really being addressed.  There is a certain glossing over the problem of humidity.  There is talk about the fact that the humidity rate should be 45 degrees for VDUs &mdash; visual display units &mdash; but the figure is somewhat less for human beings.  The important one seems to be the rate for VDUs.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <P>Some questions must be raised about the system of humidification and air conditioning in the building.  A sum of £150,000 has been spent on providing these new thermostats.  We still have a situation which is very unsatisfactory. There are real question marks over whether the whole system should be abandoned and a new one put in.  There are very real questions to be asked about the physical placing of the outlets and inlets which they have in the building and whether they are suitable.  When the building was first looked at it was an open plan with desks for 380 people laid out in serried ranks.  That is not how it happens in practice.  When the Revenue Commissioners came in, naturally they put up partitions for various offices and the like and that prevented the air from circulating. One may also ask why they cannot open the windows.  That is a very basic question.  They cannot open the windows because they are hermetically sealed.  It is part of the whole system of air conditioning in this building and it does not allow for opening windows. They are inherent questions which must be asked about this system.</P>
    <P>The IIRS report which was made last December &mdash; that is the most recent one &mdash; found that the working conditions are &ldquo;fairly good&rdquo; but the IIRS still point out that the fresh air intake is well below standard and output is over only half what it should be.  How can that be satisfactory? How can it be stated to be &ldquo;fairly good&rdquo;?  There has been a decrease over the past 18 months of some 33 per cent of the fresh air intake.  How can that be satisfactory?  How can that be stated to be &ldquo;fairly good?&rdquo;?  From a number of <Col N="919" /> viewpoints it would behove the Minister to say to the Revenue Commissioners immediately: &ldquo;Take on board the undertaking that you gave last year.&rdquo;  In that undertaking it was stated quite clearly that there was no financial problem attached to it and that the Revenue Commissioners could meet all the necessary requirements as regards finance.</P>
    <P>We must call a halt to this dispute.  If we are to get tax collection back on the rails, which has to be done, every day we lose puts greater strain on the State's finances.</P>
    <P>I see no good reason why this dispute should continue.  I believe those who are on the staff are a reasonable group of people who have been involved in the negotiations all the time.  They have been on the monitoring committees and they have had good relations with their employers and the employers understand that they have a good case.  The problem is that nobody is doing anything about it and nobody is taking it seriously enough. I do not think that is good enough.  If this is to continue for another year, and another year after that, with stoppages for ten days every year, that simply is not good enough.  It is putting too much of a strain on the State's finances as well as reducing public confidence in the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to actually go out and collect the taxes.</P>
    <P>That confidence must be built up.  It is not there at present.  Efforts are being made to show the public at large that the Revenue Commissioners mean what they say and that they are out there busily collecting the taxes that are due.  If, on the other hand, they allow a dispute to wander on &mdash; when they have it within their control to put an end to it &mdash; I do not think they can expect the confidence of the public to be given to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to respond to this matter.  I am a little disappointed that she did not end the very good case she has <Col N="920" /> made by calling on the people concerned to resume duty.</P>
      <P>Following complaints from the staff in the office of the Collector General a programme of remedial works was carried out by the Office of Public Works on the heating-air conditioning in Teach Earlsfort during 1987.  The cost of these, as the Deputy has rightly said, was £150,000.  It was agreed with the staff unions that the IIRS would conduct a survey of the building.  Their report, following their survey, was furnished to the staff unions.  The Office of Public Works &mdash; who were responsible for the heating and maintenance of the buildings in the past couple of years only &mdash; and the Revenue Commissioners accepted the report.</P>
      <P>The report states that overall the conditions have improved considerably since the previous IIRS report in March 1986. That is an established and an agreed fact. They have two recommendations for further improvements.  These relate to the relative humidity and fresh air output.  A satisfactory relative humidity level has since been achieved and the fresh air output will be increased to a satisfactory level by the end of this month.  Far from what the Deputy has said, the levels have improved and not decreased since 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the IIRS stated that, based on the results of their survey, they would regard the building as suitable for office accommodation.  When the above recommendations have been carried out they expect the conditions to be close to what is normally regarded as ideal for an office environment.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy and the House and all the staff concerned that everything that can be done is being done and I would urge &mdash; and I hope the Deputy will respond as well &mdash; the staff concerned to return to work immediately.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3 February 1988.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference of the Ministerial Committee are to carry out an indepth investigation of Ireland's off shore islands with the objective of improving the working and living conditions on the islands.  One of the first initiatives taken by the committee, which is chaired by the Minister for the Environment, was to recommend that the inhabited islands off the coasts of Mayo, Donegal, Galway and Cork have a liaison officer on the mainland in the relevant county council. Reports were sought by the committee from these liaison officers setting out the problems relating specifically to islands of the respective coast lines.</P>

      <P>In 1987 total debt service payments amounted to £2,118 million, of which £1,396 million was accounted for by domestic debt service payments and £722 million by foreign debt service payments. The estimate for total debt service payments in 1988 is £2,173 million.  It is not possible, at this stage, to break down the 1988 figure into its domestic and foreign components.  This will depend in part on the split between domestic and foreign borrowing in 1988.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Minister for finance the increase in tax revenue which would accrue (a) in the 1988-89 tax year and (b) in a full tax year, from a halving of accelerated capital allowances against corporation profits tax liability.</P>

      <P>If the change referred to in the question were to affect investment from 1 April 1988 onwards it is estimated that the yield in 1988-89 would be negligible. In 1989-90 and for some years thereafter there would be a yield to the Exchequer in terms of increased corporation tax revenue. This is tentatively estimated for 1989-90 to be of the order of £56 million. This additional yield would diminish in each subsequent year because the initial reduction in accelerated capital allowances would be balanced by an increasing total of annual allowances.</P>

      <P>Records of the fees paid to individual solicitors and barristers under the scheme are kept on a tax year basis in my Department. In writing to the Deputy I will also let him have the appropriate Dáil debate references to information, published in response to previous Parliamentary Questions, on the earnings of lawyers under the scheme for most years from 1977, together with details of earnings for the years which were not published in the Debates (viz. 1983-84, 1985-86 and 1986-87). It would require a disproportionate expenditure of public time and money to compile a breakdown of the amounts paid to each individual over the years before 1977.</P>

      <P>Grants from my Vote are paid as they arise subject to normal processing constraints.  For farm investment schemes, however, notably the Farm Improvement Programme there are some delays in making grant payments. At 31 December 1987 the aggregate amount of approved but unpaid grants was approximately £9 million.  The equivalent figure for end of 1986 was £2.2 million but this latter amount is well within normal payment processing times.  The increase in the number of unpaid grants at end 1987 is due to adherence to the amount allocated for the relevant subhead.  Given the number of payments made it would not be practicable to give particulars of the individual grants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in Walkinstown, Dublin 12 in the Dublin Corporation local authority area, is classified as rural and is therefore paid a lower rate of unemployment assistance as he has no other income and lives alone.</P>

      <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable to claimants residing in urban areas is higher than that which is payable to those residing in other areas.</P>
      <P>Urban areas for unemployment assistance purposes are defined as every county borough, the borough of Dun Laoghaire and every urban district the population of which exceeds 7,000.  The urban rate is also payable to a claimant who resides outside an urban area in a house owned by the corporation or council of an urban area.</P>
      <P>The person concerned resides in Walkinstown within the Dublin County Council area and in accordance with the legislative provisions this area is regarded as non-urban for unemployment assistance purposes.  Under the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, parts of Walkinstown were incorporated into the County Borough of Dublin but the particular district in which the person concerned resides remained within the county council area.  Therefore, he is entitled to the lower rate of payment. The rate payable in his case is £35.50 weekly, being the maximum long term non-urban rate of £36.60 appropriate to a single person less means of £1.10 derived from capital.  He is also in receipt of a fuel allowance of £5 weekly under the national fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a particular difficulty is arising for farmers in the social welfare code who have to sell off their herds because of outbreaks of bovine TB and that the compensation received for the cattle, although not near the actual market value, is calculated as capital in assessment of the farmers who apply for unemployment assistance; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the interest on the capital does not keep pace with the increase in the price of cattle and that the capital and the interest fall far short of the money required to replace the stock when allowed to do so by the Department of Agriculture and Food; and if, in view of this he will instruct that this capital is disregarded in the unemployment assistance application.</P>

      <P>Income from farming for unemployment assistance purposes is assessed under section 146 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 and the Unemployment Assistance (Calculation of Means Regulations)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> Order, 1934 as the yearly advantage accruing from the farm.</P>
    <P>In calculating the advantage accruing from the farm the social welfare officer has regard to the income and expenditure involved in earning the income from the enterprise.  The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the income from farming less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net income over the 12 months preceding the investigation of means.</P>
    <P>Where at the time the assessment is carried out the normal pattern of farming has been distorted by unusual factors due allowance is made for such factors.  The aim of the assessment is that it should reflect the net income from the farm in a normal year.  Obviously herd depletion arising from outbreaks of bovine TB would distort the normal pattern of farming and due consideration is taken of this situation when assessing the means.</P>
    <P>If a farmer who is in receipt of unemployment assistance asks for a review of means following depopulation of herd because of bovine TB his means would be assessed on the basis of the estimated income from the farm in the succeeding 12 month period having due regard to the difficulties encountered by him.  Any capital held by him, whether arising out of compensation received or otherwise, would have to be assessed in the normal way.  The legislative basis for assessing the value of such capital as means is to take 5 per cent of the first £400 and 10 per cent of the balance.  When the capital is subsequently used for the purpose of restocking the land and a degree of normality has returned to the farming enterprise the case would generally be reviewed again so that the means assessment would reflect the normal situation.</P>
    <P>The current method of assessment in such cases is considered fair in that it is designed to represent the actual financial circumstances of the claimant.  Consequently it is not proposed to make any changes in the method of assessment. <Col N="718" /> Furthermore where a claimant is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and have his case determined by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the accommodation used by travellers are obtained from the annual count of travellers.  Figures from the 1987 count are not available yet but in the period 1978-1986 the number of traveller families accommodated in standard/ group housing and serviced sites rose from 1,122 to 1,938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1986 annual count shows that there were 1,048 families requiring accommodation. My Department's policy in relation to travellers is to encourage the provision by local authorities of suitable accommodation and to make available the necessary financial assistance for this purpose.  The authorities have been asked to deal with the accommodation of travellers as a priority in their housing programme. The main thrust of the provision <Col N="744" /> of accommodation has been housing. This trend is now changing due mainly to a decline in the number of traveller families requiring housing while there is a greater need for serviced caravan parks. Up to 31 December 1987, 32 caravan parks catering for 324 families had been provided; there are currently 7 parks under construction and a further 30 are at planning stage.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour, in view of the fact that legislation was introduced to extend the Protection of Employees (Employer's Insolvency) Act for the employees of a company (details supplied) in County Kilkenny which was closed on the 29 November, 1984, if he will now arrange to have the funds distributed to the former employees of this company from the fund asset/pension plan through Irish Pensions Trust Ltd.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that moneys available under the pension schemes operated by the group of companies concerned have been <Col N="745" /> distributed by the trustees to the employees.  My Department have received two applications under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, from the trustees of occupational pension schemes in the group.  The applications are in respect of the employers' outstanding contributions for the year prior to the insolvency of the group of companies in November 1984.  The amounts claimed were £191,691.93 and £17,679.80.</P>
      <P>The Act requires that applications for payment of outstanding contributions in the case of pension schemes which are non-contributory must be supported by appropriate actuarial certificates.  Such certificates have been submitted in the two cases concerned but a question has arisen in regard to the legal interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act as they affect groups of related companies. I have sought legal advice on this issue which I hope to receive very shortly.  I expect that I will then be in a position to make a decision on the applications in respect of the employees of the company specified in the question.</P>

      <P>Eastern Health Board</P>
      <P>BCG vaccination services are provided on a routine basis at maternity hospitals, public health clinics and national schools.</P>
      <P>Western Health Board</P>
      <P>BCG vaccinations are offered on a two yearly basis to all pupils in 5th and 6th classes of national schools.</P>
      <P>Neo-natal BCG is not given routinely except in specific instances e.g. where the family has a history of TB or where children are at risk.  Medical students and hospital staff are also screened.</P>
      <P>Midland Health Board</P>
      <P>BCG is given to all children in 5th class at national school and to children at birth in special circumstances.</P>
      <P>South-Eastern Health Board</P>
      <P>BCG is offered at birth in hospital, at senior national school level and, on request, at BCG clinics which are held on a weekly and monthly basis.</P>
      <P>Mid-Western Health Board</P>
      <P>All new born babies are offered BCG vaccination.  Clinics are held monthly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Southern Health Board</P>
    <P>Neo-natal BCG vaccinations are offered to children as well as to older age groups at regular clinics.  In appropriate cases, contacts of TB are also offered BCG, as well as persons going to Third World countries.</P>
    <P>North-Eastern Health Board</P>
    <P>BCG vaccinations are available at neonatal and primary school levels.  In addition, people at risk through contact are also immunised.</P>
    <P>North-Western Health Board</P>
    <P>BCG vaccinations are carried out on all new born infants in all health board maternity departments.  There is also routine tuberculin tests on all national school children, aged generally between 10 and 12 years and repeat BCG's given, if required.  Neo-natals who because of early discharge from hospital may not have got the BCG are followed up at public health clinics which are held regularly. BCG is also given, on request, to people going abroad.</P>
    <P>National BCG Policy</P>
    <P>A study is presently being carried out by the Faculty of Community Medicine of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, on the age specific tuberculin conversion rates in children and when I have received this study I will review policy with regard to BCG vaccination.</P>

      <P>Under the last heading the Department provided grants-in-aid to the Dublin Institute for Adult Education and the National Adult Literacy Agency.  As the latter is a national organisation it is not possible to provide figures for expenditure on the Dublin area alone.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has no record of having received a formal application from Galway Hockey Club for aid under the Department's Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities.</P>
      <P>Before the availability of a grant for the project in question can be considered, it will be necessary for the club to study the leaflet, of which details are given below, outlining the terms of the Capital Grant Scheme and, if their proposal appears to conform to those terms, to complete the attached application form and return it to the Department.</P>
      <P>I must stress, however, that the keen demand for the relatively limited funds available means that financial assistance cannot be presumed in respect of an application which may be submitted by any group.</P>
      <P>Following are the contents of the leaflet:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Department of Education</P>
      <P Just="Center">Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Objective of Scheme</i></P>
      <P>This Scheme is designed to assist and encourage local initiatives in the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities (excluding swimming pools and environmental works).  The provision of indoor and outdoor facilities are eligible for consideration under this Scheme.  The Scheme is open to all voluntary community organisations wishing to provide recreational facilities and thereby promote the greater availability of recreational and leisure opportunities for the community.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Conditions for Participation</i></P>
      <P>(i)  <i>Site Acquisition</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicant organisations must provide a suitable site for the development. The site must be owned or held under long-term lease (not less than 25 years from time of application) by the applicant.  In determining the suitability of a site the Department will take into account its proximity to existing <Col N="763" /> facilities and its accessibility in terms of the potential use of the proposed facility by the community and schools.  Grants will not be made available towards the purchase of sites or premises.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Grant Limits and Local Contribution</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be required to provide a local financial contribution of at least 30 per cent of construction cost of the proposed project but in very exceptional circumstances a contribution as low as 20 per cent will be acceptable (in such cases full particulars of these circumstances must be furnished).  The level of grant-aid will be at the discretion of the Department.  Grants will only be considered in respect of work to be done by recognised building contractors and will not exceed £100,000. Under no circumstances will the grant exceed 80 per cent of construction costs for the proposed project, as agreed in advance by the Department.  Grants will not be increased in line with increased building costs.</P>
    <P>Where the development of playing pitches is proposed a grant maximum of £20,000 will apply in the case of any single project or group.  All other conditions of grant assistance stipulated in this schedule shall apply in the case of such developments.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory evidence of the ready availability of the required local contribution amount must be produced prior to the confirmation of grant-aid by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iii)  <i>Plans</i></P>
    <P>Plans for the proposed development must be prepared and submitted to the Department.  The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.  Each development must proceed in accordance with the design and costs agreed by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iv)  <i>Planning Permission</i></P>
    <P>Applicants will be required to secure planning permission and by-law approval for the proposed development. <Col N="764" /> The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Construction of Project</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be responsible for all arrangements for the construction of their project.  The project must be put out to tender and subsequently executed by building contract.  If it is proposed to pass over the lowest or any tender the Department must be notified before any other tender is examined.  Failure to accept the lowest suitable tender may result in reduction or cancellation of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory arrangements must be made by the grantee for the professional supervision of construction works.  The Department will not be liable for professional fees incurred.</P>
    <P>Grants will not be provided towards work performed by voluntary labour or under Government training schemes.</P>
    <P>Where proposed construction works exceed £100,000 building contractors will be required to secure an insurance bond in respect of such projects in advance of the award of a contract.</P>
    <P>Tax clearance procedures (i.e. production of a current C.2 Certificate of tax clearance) in respect of contractors proposed for selection must be complied with in advance of any contractual commitments being made on the part of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Commencement of Building Work</i></P>
    <P>Reasonable progress towards the commencement of building work on the project must be in evidence within six months from the date of provisional allocation of grant aid.  The onus will be on the grantee to show evidence of satisfactory progress towards project construction state.  In the absence of such evidence the Department retains the right to withdraw the offer of grant assistance.</P>
    <P>(vii)  <i>Management and Maintenance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the proposed facility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> (viii)  <i>Guarantee of Community Access and Continued Usage</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to submit a written guarantee that the completed facility will be made fully available to the local community.  It will also be necessary to provide an undertaking protecting the Department's financial interest in the facility and guaranteeing the repayment of grants should it cease to operate or should a change of usage occur.</P>
    <P>(ix)  <i>Insurance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to arrange for the provision of adequate insurance cover for the completed facility, against fire and all other insurable risks, with an approved insurance company and to pay all necessary premiums.  The insurance will be for such amount as will provide cover for the full re-instatement value of the facility, together with a sum for professional fees.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the grantee to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc.</P>
    <P>Groups wishing to avail of grant aid must be in a position to comply in full with the conditions for participation in the scheme outlined above.  All applications will be considered on their merits, but special consideration will be given to cases where an early commencement of building work is possible.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> 3.  <i>Payment of Grant</i></P>
    <P>Grants will be paid to approved projects following submission of architects' certificates/builders' invoices in respect of work completed.  Grant instalments will issue at a rate established by the Department having regard to the level of grant approved.</P>
    <P>The Department will retain a proportion of the approved grant amount against satisfactory completion of the proposed development works.</P>
    <P>A grant will not be payable in respect of projects being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Project Visits</i></P>
    <P>Approved projects will be subject to occasional visits by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Application Forms</i></P>
    <P>Application forms for completion in respect of eligible projects are available from The Secretary, Department of Education, Youth Section, 11th Floor, Hawkins House, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>All questions on the form must be answered and failure to disclose full details will render applications ineligible for consideration.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Acknowledgement</i></P>
    <P>This grant scheme is being funded from the surplus proceeds of the National Lottery. All grant assisted projects must display an acknowledgment that the projects have been aided by the National Lottery.</P>

      <P>A grant under my Department's Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities has not been agreed for Star Rovers A.F.C., Limerick.</P>
      <P>Before the availability of a grant for the project in question can be considered, it will be necessary for the club to study the leaflet, of which details are given below, outlining the terms of the Capital Grant scheme and, if their proposal appears to conform to those terms, to complete the attached application form and return it to the Department.</P>
      <P>I must stress, however, that the keen demand for the relatively limited funds available means that financial assistance cannot be presumed in respect of an application which may be submitted by any group.</P>
      <P>Following are the contents of the leaflet:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Department of Education</P>
      <P Just="Center">Capital Grant Scheme for the Provision of Recreational Facilities</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Objective of Scheme</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is designed to assist and encourage local initiatives in the provision of recreational, leisure and community facilities (excluding swimming pools and environmental works).  The provision of indoor and outdoor facilities are eligible for consideration under this scheme.  The scheme is open to all voluntary community organisations wishing <Col N="778" /> to provide recreational facilities and thereby promote the greater availability of recreational and leisure opportunities for the community.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Conditions for Participation</i></P>
    <P>(i)  <i>Site Acquisition</i></P>
    <P>Applicant organisations must provide a suitable site for the development. The site must be owned or held under long-term lease (not less than 25 years from time of application) by the applicant.  In determining the suitability of a site the Department will take into account its proximity to existing facilities and its accessibility in terms of the potential use of the proposed facility by the community and schools.  Grants will not be made available towards the purchase of sites or premises.</P>
    <P>(ii)  <i>Grant Limits and Local Contribution</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be required to provide a local financial contribution of at least 30 per cent of construction cost of the proposed project but in very exceptional circumstances a contribution as low as 20 per cent will be acceptable (in such cases full particulars of these circumstances must be furnished).  The level of grant-aid will be at the discretion of the Department.  Grants will only be considered in respect of work to be done by recognised building contractors and will not exceed £100,000. Under no circumstances will the grant exceed 80 per cent of construction costs for the proposed project, as agreed in advance by the Department.  Grants will not be increased in line with increased building costs.</P>
    <P>Where the development of playing pitches is proposed a grant maximum of £20,000 will apply in the case of any single project or group.  All other conditions of grant assistance stipulated in this schedule shall apply in the case of such developments.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory evidence of the ready availability of the required local contribution amount must be produced prior to the confirmation of grant-aid by the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> (iii)  <i>Plans</i></P>
    <P>Plans for the proposed development must be prepared and submitted to the Department.  The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.  Each development must proceed in accordance with the design and costs agreed by the Department.</P>
    <P>(iv)  <i>Planning Permission</i></P>
    <P>Applicants will be required to secure planning permission and by-law approval for the proposed development. The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in this regard.</P>
    <P>(v)  <i>Construction of Project</i></P>
    <P>Grantees will be responsible for all arrangements for the construction of their project.  The project must be put out to tender and subsequently executed by building contract.  If it is proposed to pass over the lowest or any tender the Department must be notified before any other tender is examined.  Failure to accept the lowest suitable tender may result in reduction or cancellation of grant aid.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory arrangements must be made by the grantee for the professional supervision of construction works.  The Department will not be liable for professional fees incurred.</P>
    <P>Grants will not be provided towards work performed by voluntary labour or under Government training schemes.</P>
    <P>Where proposed construction works exceed £100,000 building contractors will be required to secure an insurance bond in respect of such projects in advance of the award of a contract.</P>
    <P>Tax clearance procedures (i.e. production of a current C.2 Certificate of tax clearance) in respect of contractors proposed for selection must be complied with in advance of any contractual commitments being made on the part of the grantee.</P>
    <P>(vi)  <i>Commencement of Building Work</i></P>
    <P>Reasonable progress towards the commencement of building work on <Col N="780" /> the project must be in evidence within six months from the date of provisional allocation of grant aid.  The onus will be on the grantee to show evidence of satisfactory progress towards project construction state.  In the absence of such evidence the Department retains the right to withdraw the offer of grant assistance.</P>
    <P>(vii)  <i>Management and Maintenance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be responsible for making satisfactory arrangements for the management and maintenance of the proposed facility.</P>
    <P>(viii)  <i>Guarantee of Community Access and Continued Usage</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to submit a written guarantee that the completed facility will be made fully available to the local community.  It will also be necessary to provide an undertaking protecting the Department's financial interest in the facility and guaranteeing the repayment of grants should it cease to operate or should a change of usage occur.</P>
    <P>(ix)  <i>Insurance</i></P>
    <P>The grantee will be required to arrange for the provision of adequate insurance cover for the completed facility, against fire and all other insurable risks, with an approved insurance company and to pay all necessary premiums.  The insurance will be for such amount as will provide cover for the full re-instatement value of the facility, together with a sum for professional fees.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary for the grantee to maintain satisfactory public liability insurance in respect of users, general public, etc.</P>
    <P>Groups wishing to avail of grant aid must be in a position to comply in full with the conditions for participation in the scheme outlined above.  All applications will be considered on their merits, but special consideration will be given to cases where an early commencement of building work is possible.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Payment of Grant</i></P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> Grants will be paid to approved projects following submission of architects' certificates/builders' invoices in respect of work completed.  Grant instalments will issue at a rate established by the Department having regard to the level of grant approved.</P>
    <P>The Department will retain a proportion of the approved grant amount against satisfactory completion of the proposed development works.</P>
    <P>A grant will not be payable in respect of projects being grant assisted by any other Government Department.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Project Visits</i></P>
    <P>Approved projects will be subject to occasional visits by officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> 5.  <i>Application Forms</i></P>
    <P>Application forms for completion in respect of eligible projects are available from The Secretary, Department of Education, Youth Section, 11th Floor, Hawkins House, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>All questions on the form must be answered and failure to disclose full details will render applications ineligible for consideration.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Acknowledgment</i></P>
    <P>This grant scheme is being funded from the surplus proceeds of the National Lottery. All grant assisted projects must display an acknowledgment that the projects have been aided by the National Lottery.</P>

He will determine the precise status of reports received to date and will look at the methods employed by French scientists to detect the disease.</P>
      <P>The immediate consequence to the industry is a ban on the import into France for relaying of Clew Bay oysters. Oysters can still, however, be exported to France for direct sale in baskets.  The bonamia disease poses no threat to this form of export trade as the disease is not harmful to humans.</P>
