      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek a little clarification from the Taoiseach on the statement issued by the Government last evening.  With reference to the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference yesterday the statement was that the meeting adjourned to enable certain things to be done, that it would resume very shortly, that the Government would now await the response of the British Government and would report to the Dáil as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the adjourned meeting.</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us whether that means that after the adjourned meeting has resumed, which I understand is to be early next week, the Taoiseach will arrange for the Dáil to be informed of the results?  Can he further tell us whether it would be his intention following that meeting to take the matter up further with the UK Prime Minister at the European Summit next week and if he would make an appropriate arrangement to keep the Dáil further informed after that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the gravity <Col N="922" /> of these issues, it is my wish to report to the Dáil as fully as possible at the earliest possible date and to give the Dáil an opportunity of debating the issues at whatever length it would wish.  Therefore, it would be my intention to facilitate Members of the House in every way possible and to that end I intend to keep in touch with the party Leaders during the course of the next few days.  The meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference which was adjourned yesterday will resume early next week and I would imagine that the best thing then would be to have immediately after or as soon as possible after that a debate or discussion here in the Dáil but, as I have said, I would like to keep in touch with the party Leaders to keep them informed of developments.  If there is any change of intention by the Government in regard to any of these matters I will let the party Leaders know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Taoiseach is not ruling out a further discussion on the matter in the margin of the European Summit next week and, if necessary, a further discussion in the Dáil following that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, may I take it that it is not intended to combine Anglo-Irish relations and the outcome of the Summit in whatever statements might be made to the House?  I trust that would not be the Taoiseach's intention and that the report of the Summit in respect of European affairs will be kept separate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be advisable.  It would be very necessary to keep Anglo-Irish relations in one category and to keep a discussion of European affairs separate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution to this important debate yesterday I pointed out that the Government had faced an extraordinary situation at the start of their term of office.  I pointed out that they had met it, and met it well.  For the first time in a decade we can say that the beast of public finance has been penned and if it has not been finally tamed it is certainly on the way to being tamed.  In the time available to me I should like to deal with four specific issues.  The first, and the most important one dealt with in the budget, is the question of taxation reform.  There has been a great deal of hot air in the House, expanded elsewhere, on the issue of tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The noise from the lobby is intruding into the Chamber and is source of disorder.  The noise in the lobby must cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="926" />
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxation reform is one of the most important issues dealt with in the budget.  Much of the hot air here, and elsewhere, on the issue of taxation reform emanated from the benches opposite.  It is worth reminding those Members who are guilty of expounding so much hot air on behalf of the taxpayers that in the term of office of their Government very little was achieved other than analysis.  As one commentator has suggested, we had a paralysis of analysis. We had continuous claims that taxation reform was imminent and that taxation reform would be achieved but the reality is, and statistics prove this, that the overall take on taxes during the period of Government of the last regime increased by some 5 per cent of GNP.  In other words, there was a great deal of talk about reform but there was very little reform.</P>
      <P>One of the problems here is that politicians by reiterating good intentions have begun to debase the currency of political rhetoric.  The first major steps in taxation reform were taken in the budget and have to be put in the context of what was achieved last year.  During last year the special task force set up to deal with the whole issue of tax arrears proved extremely effective, too effective for some Deputies.  I can recall a Fine Gael Deputy referring in the House to Nazi tactics.  The tax clearance arrangement for grant payments has been finalised and that is a major breakthrough.  The Revenue Commissioners are completing a programme and timetable for the reduction and elimination of taxation arrears.  Members on all sides are rightly affronted by the extent of taxation arrears, as is every taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have taken the first steps to fulfil the latter commitment through the introduction of self-assessment for corporation tax and for income tax in the self-employed area.  Overall, the Government's aim is to reform the taxation system so that each group in Irish society pays its fair share of the tax burden, no more and no less.  Most Members will accept that under the present arrangements the PAYE sector <Col N="927" /> pay far too much, they bear an excessive degree of the burden.  Major tax reforms are important in the context of social equity.</P>
    <P>Another achievement last year was the introduction of the withholding tax.  That tax was, in effect, the spread of the PAYE system to other persons in the public sector.  The Government have taken an additional step in that regard in the budget.  Overall the Government have put the country on course for a more rational taxation system.  At the same time, they have achieved a considerable amount in returning the balance to equity with regard to the PAYE taxpayer.  All Members will welcome the additional allowances and the increases in allowances. I am sure they welcome in particular the expansion of the 35 per cent band and, therefore, the effective reduction of the higher bands.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that taxation reform cannot be achieved overnight. There is a great impatience for taxation reform but it is important, as we move down the road of implementing and putting into effect a logical tax structure, to ensure that it is a tax structure that will endure.  The steps taken by the Minister, particularly in regard to self-assessment, are important in that regard and should be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>The first specific of the taxation proposals in the budget is that the Government have given an additional £152 million in tax reductions, effectively putting money back into the pockets of taxpayers. That is where the money should stay.  It is quite intolerable that very high levels of tax burdens have to be carried by members of society.  Effectively, that soaks up the money of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Another important achievement in the budget was the fact that 93,000 taxpayers who would otherwise have been liable for a 48 per cent rate have been reduced to the 35 per cent rate.  In addition, 55,000 taxpayers who would otherwise have been paying the top rate of 58 per cent are now at a marginal rate of 48 per cent. They represent major achievements. Another major achievement is that <Col N="928" /> 16,000 taxpayers at the very lowest levels will, effectively, be out of the tax net. In all, the budget comes very close to fulfilling a promise the Government made at the outset, that two-thirds of all taxpayers will be on the standard rate.  In the tax year 1988-89 some 63 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the standard rate.  That, by any standard, will be a major achievement.  It is a timely one because what the Minister for Finance is doing is showing faith with the people who have accepted the burden of the necessary cuts in areas of public expenditure. The Minister is rewarding the people for their forbearance in that regard.</P>
    <P>The second question I should like to deal with is that of jobs and the budget. I have mentioned the mythology that has been created about this, particularly by Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael who spoke in cliché terms of a one-item agenda.  Yesterday I went through the various sectors where the Government have adopted specific proposals to improve and create jobs.  They have endeavoured to create real jobs in the private sector where wealth will be generated and where the national well-being will be better attended to.  The Government's strategy on employment is twofold and Deputies, although they might preach otherwise, know that.  First, the Government have to take firm action in relation to budgetary difficulties.  They did that last year and again this year. Those firm actions will bring with them their own rewards.  This is already being demonstrated in the new sense of confidence which is coming about because of falling interest rates.  I would refer Members to the most recent CII report which pointed out that there is if not a bullish tendency with regard to private sector investment at least sufficient confidence for private sector investors to consider putting more job-creating proposals into place.</P>
    <P>The first step must be the bringing into control of the beast of public expenditure. That is being done.  A second Government objective is the active pursuit of development opportunities <Col N="929" /> throughout the economy, with special emphasis on natural resources.  In the past year we have seen the beginnings of these efforts and the first rewards. Yesterday I referred to forestry.  The untruth that this is not a budget dedicated to jobs or to progress and development does not improve by reiteration.  The opposite is precisely the case, as Deputies opposite are aware.  They also know that during the term of office of the previous Government unemployment increased by a figure in excess of 100,000 and there were, in addition, 100,000 emigrants.  It will take time for that unfortunate trend to be reversed but the slackening of the rate of increase in unemployment shows that a reversal is within sight.</P>
    <P>In spite of all our economic and financial difficulties, a measure of a nation's civilisation is the degree to which it seeks to support those who are least well off. In this budget and in last year's budget this Government have dedicated their attention to these people.  Last year the social welfare increases were brought forward from November, when it was proposed by the previous regime to introduce them, to July.  We would all like to have done better but at least that was an improvement and a move in the right direction.  This year there is an overall increase of 3 per cent in the level of social welfare payments, despite the fact that inflation will be of the order of 2.5 per cent.  I would admit that there is only a marginal benefit to those who are dependent on social welfare but at least the balance is again in the right direction. Special help has been introduced for the long-term unemployed and a single person on urban unemployment assistance will receive an increase of 11 per cent.  I am sure Deputies on all sides of the House would like to give more because those who are genuinely unemployed and dependent on long-term urban unemployment assistance deserve special consideration.  We all accept that their plight is a very real one.  There is also a special increase of 6 per cent for child dependants.  Once again this increase if considerably higher than the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> There is to be a continuation of the special equality treatment payment which was due to end last November but is to be continued at least until the end of this year.  The equality directive was, to say the least, anomalous in that it had the net effect of equalising people downwards.  It is well to remind ourselves that this was during Deputy Hussey's period of office in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The extension of PRSI to farmers and the self-employed on a phased basis seems to be a realistic way of extending the PRSI net.  I accept that there is some criticism and some Members opposite have made the point that some of those affected may try to take the benefits without paying the imposition.  That is their judgment on farmers and the self-employed; it is not my judgment.  An effective collection system when it is introduced should prevent that anomaly from arising.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the additional £11 million which the Government have put into the budget for the drug refund and long term illness scheme.  The retention of that scheme in full is a very important decision which should be welcomed by all sides.  As a member of the Eastern Health Board, I certainly welcome it. The additional £3 million which the Government have promised towards the cost of providing accommodation for the homeless is also very welcome.  One would wish that the money could be higher because anybody who is a member of a local authority or a health board is aware of the extent of this problem.  It is sad that because of the economic situation this problem may deepen in the years ahead.  I look forward to the introduction of legislation later in this session to deal with the issue of homelessness.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional £6.5 million for the repair and replacement of dilapidated primary and secondary schools. Notwithstanding the fact that there was a great deal of hype during the previous Government's term of office about the repair and replacement of dilapidated schools in my constituency, we got a whole series of promises but at the end <Col N="931" /> of the day when Deputy Hussey vacated her seat as Minister for Education we were left with nothing but paper.  We had no bricks and we had no mortar.</P>
    <P>In the general area of social equity, a final improvement is the reintroduction of the installation aid package.  This is a very important scheme which costs only about £1.4 million.  We have a very peculiar age structure in agriculture and it is important that the Government should provide installation aid to encourage that age structure to change.  It is extraordinary that the age structure in agriculture is so out of kilter with the demographic structure in general.  It is of critical importance that this scheme should be operated.  It is a very low cost scheme so far as the Exchequer is concerned because much of the expenditure will be met from European funds.  There should be a long-term commitment to that scheme because on-off policies in this area cannot but do damage.</P>
    <P>I would ask the relevant Ministers when they come to work out the detail to look at those who are marginally disallowed under the installation aid package.  In my constituency there is a young farmer who had four hours of instruction to complete on the day the aid package was discontinued.  He should be allowed to fulfil that requirement and the cumulative amount should be taken into account so that the aid package can be made available.  There are other young farmers who may have gone ahead since the discontinuation of the aid scheme was announced and have become installed as the primary operators of particular holdings. There should be a degree of retrospection to deal with such cases.  As I have said, it is a very low cost scheme.  It is a very important scheme.  It retains a degree of equity for young farmers and would help to change the balance.</P>
    <P>Again as with other myths that are being perpetrated, it is not true to say that this budget focuses excessively on one area.  As I said yesterday at the outset the striking feature of this budget is that it is extremely well crafted and covers so <Col N="932" /> many areas.  On taxation reform we are moving in the right direction.  Jobs are dealt with in the budget as are the less well off.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with a point which has been touched on by a number of Deputies.  I think it is a valid point.  It deals with the whole general area of what we could call administrative reform and decentralisation of the administration. The Government's announcement to extend the decentralisation programme and to increase the number of centres involved in decentralisation is very welcome, but I would submit that it does not go far enough.  We need to think of real decentralisation and, in effect, for the past 15 or 20 years we have deluded ourselves that we are talking about decentralisation. I said on another occasion here that we have one of the most highly centralised Administrations.  Our bureaucracy is not only highly centralised but, because it is highly centralised, it puts a particular burden on our citizens. For example, in the social welfare system the decisions still emanate from Dublin. To my mind this is wrong.</P>
    <P>Real decentralisation would mean shoving decision making down to the provincial centres that are now getting staff units.  At present effectively we are decentralising the Civil Service and the Administration and we are simply moving sections from Dublin to the provinces. That is very welcome in that it helps to spread the economic benefits of the Administration around the provinces, but we need to go a step further.  We need to address the core issue in regard to decentralisation and that is the anomaly that exists in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  There is the extraordinary myth that all decisions emanate from a Minister and, because of this extraordinary mythology, the Civil Service and the Administration effectively have to be encrusted about the Minister's presence in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We all know that Ministers, good as they are, do not make all the decisions. We all know that many of the decisions emanate from the day to day operations of the Administration.  Those operational <Col N="933" /> decisions which do not need to be taken at the centre must be taken in the provinces and towns and moved out of Dublin and down to where they are closer to the citizens.  That is the next priority.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom Barrington said some 20 years ago that real decentralisation was the next necessary thing.  If it was necessary then, it is urgent now and should be addressed.  I accept that Ministers who are overburdened have a difficulty in this regard.  As the old saying goes the screaming babies get the attention. Sometimes that which should be done is displaced by that which must be done.  In a busy schedule I would ask Ministers to look at this issue.  It is an important issue and the lives and wellbeing of the citizens of the nation could be improved.</P>
    <P>I would also venture to suggest that the lives and wellbeing of the Members of this House would be improved because one of the things that flows from our anomalous level of centralisation, our abnormal level of centralisation, is a very high degree of what some people have called clientelism.  I do not accept that there is anything wrong with TDs or public representatives representing and seeking to further the interest of their constituents.  To my mind it is one of the highest and most important duties of public representatives.  However, there is no doubt that the situation which pertains in Ireland is abnormal.  There is equally no doubt that it is not some sort of peasant culture suggested by some academic observers that created this situation but an excessive degree of centralisation of administration.  I ask Ministers to turn their attention to this issue.</P>
    <P>A further point was raised by Deputy Keating in his contribution yesterday which I listened to attentively.  Deputy Keating suggested there were other areas of administration which should be looked at, for example, forms.  I should like to submit in this regard that it would be worth while for us to look at the French experience.  Some ten or 15 years ago the French Administration put in place a form audit agency known as CERFA, the centre for form research.  That agency examined every single form used in the <Col N="934" /> public service and ensured that every single detail of information which is sought is necessary and they banned and outlawed a whole range of forms which sought to put an unfair imposition on those who have to fill in the forms, the public.  Major economic benefits have accrued from that and I think we could achieve a great deal in that regard.</P>
    <P>One final point was touched on by Deputy Keating and I am somewhat surprised that those who watch the affairs of this House in the press gallery missed it yesterday.  I am mystified that they missed it because this was an issue in the general election.  I will quote what Deputy Keating said and I will quote slowly so that they cannot miss it today. Deputy Keating said that a basic weakness in the Government's proposals with regard to administrative reform was that:</P>
    <P>... they rely absolutely on voluntary redundancies.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>Thus the needs of the individual rather than that of the State will be met.</P>
    <P>If that phrase had come from any other quarter in this House it would have made the headlines because, of course, the needs of the individual should always be above the needs of the State.  We do not live in a situation where we should dictate the circumstances to individuals.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary because this issue became a debating point when the PDs were suggesting there should be major cuts in public services during the election. If I recall correctly Deputy Colley made great efforts to make sure the press took it that she did not mean there should be involuntary redundancies.  Yet here we have on the record of this House a suggestion that there must be involuntary redundancies.  The Government have depended rightly on voluntary redundancies and the wisdom of the Government's decision in this regard is obvious to anybody who knows anything about the public service.  It is suggested that the Government should &ldquo;bite the bullet&rdquo; in this regard.  We are always being advised <Col N="935" /> by these people to bite the bullet but when the bullet has to be bitten they are in the wrong lobby.  This is hypocrisy of a most extraordinary degree.</P>
    <P>I would oppose any decision to have widescale sacking on an involuntary basis of people who have served this State well. I urge that the voluntary element which is in the restructuring package should be maintained and I certainly reject the PDs' suggestion that that package should go forward on the basis of turfing people out on a wholesale basis.  No doubt the great prevaricators in that party will find some other ways of reinterpreting this as they did, for example, when Deputy Kennedy of that party at one stage last year said in Bray: &ldquo;I support the £86 million cuts in education but I do not want them in primary education.&rdquo;  One of her colleagues said the following week: &ldquo;We do not want them in secondary education&rdquo; and the next week they said: &ldquo;We do not want them in third level education.&rdquo;  The money was obviously to come out of the tea money in the Department of Education. As I said, there has been a great deal of hypocrisy about economic affairs in this nation over the past ten or 15 years.  It does not exist on one side only but right across the board.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was a welcome injection of realism and this year's budget follows on it.  The Minister is to be commended on a budget that is well crafted and deals with all the important issues. In particular, he is to be congratulated in that in his budget he has made a special effort to protect those who are less well off in society.  He has made an important contribution to tax reform and by continuing with his logical policies he has made a very important contribution to the improvement of the long term economic prospects of this nation.  Therefore he has made an important contribution to the wealth, well being and welfare of all the people of this nation.</P>
    <P>The budget deserves support.  It does not deserve some of the carping criticism it has received.  It certainly does not deserve the nit-picking which typified Deputy Noonan's contribution on it.  It <Col N="936" /> deserves support.  It is a fine budget and it has been put before this House by a fine Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest last evening and this morning to Deputy Roche's contribution and I congratulate him on a very articulate submission, though I am not so sure that the credit he now attempts to take along with his party for the current situation which he sees as developing favourably rings of consistency.  Of all the political parties in this House I believe that the one which I have the privilege and pleasure to represent at present is probably the only party who have remained consistent to any policy at all in the last ten years.  One of the major problems the country has had over that period is frequent changes in policy to meet the various problems that arise.  For reasons of expediency, political parties seemingly willingly have changed their policies at any given time just to meet the opportunities and difficulties that arose.  If more political parties had been more consistent and remained true to their objectives we would not have the kind of problems we have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to take Deputy Roche to task also for his seemingly scant respect for the efforts of the previous Government during the past four years, and I remind him of the attitude his party took to public spending, their repeated demands for increased public expenditure and increased borrowing throughout that period.  I remind the House also, lest anybody forget, that when the Government came into office we had inflation rates in the 20s and interest rates somewhere in the same region and a large number of other problems with the economy which I am not going to go into at this juncture but which are well known to everybody in this House.  Dramatic changes took place during four years in the face of the stiffest opposition, of repeated motions in this House in Private Members' time and of issues raised on the Adjournment, night after night, week after week.  Therefore, if anybody wants to claim credit for what has happened in <Col N="937" /> the past couple of years the people on the benches opposite should be the last to raise that issue.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all that, on this side of the House and generally there has been a guarded welcome for the more positive aspects in the current budget right across the board, despite what the previous speaker might say.  However, nobody should forget that every book has its good and bad pages, good and bad chapters, and that applies to this budget and I am sure it applied to previous budgets. We must all recognise that there is a job to be done and we must all decide on how it is going to be done, and whether we are in Opposition or in Government it behoves politicians to remain consistent to what they see as the resolution to the problem regardless of the position or location of their benches or portfolios. That is very important from the point of view of the country and confidence in general.</P>
    <P>Taking the budget generally, social welfare increases, for instance, are welcome, though of course we note that the child benefit area received no great recognition &mdash; in fact, it received none. That being the case, in that area there are unresolved difficulties and anybody who has had a discussion with housewives who are attempting to meet the weekly budget at present knows that they will tell you exactly how hard it is to bridge the gap week in and week out.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that a little more recognition was not given there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax concessions given in the budget, but I point out that greater tax concessions were given in previous budgets and when they eventually filtered down to the taxpayer the benefits were not as they at first appeared.  Therefore, before anybody goes into a state of euphoria about it we should recognise that these problems have been tackled previously.  We all accept that there are problems and they must be accepted by Opposition as well as by Government parties.</P>
    <P>I must refer to a point made by the <Col N="938" /> Minister in his Budget Statement regarding the satisfactory outturn.  The satisfactory outturn has been much vaunted in the last week or so and a great deal of attention has been paid to it, but I submit it is not as satisfactory as people might be given to believe.  First, we have all received complaints about unpaid house improvement grants, unpaid new house grants, unpaid disadvantaged area grants, a whole series of payments that have been delayed for one reason or another.  When anybody rings up a Department to find out what the problem is that person is told it will be some time in the next six weeks or two months, or it is in hand and will be paid as soon as possible, or it will be paid as soon as an inspection is carried out and the inspection will be carried out as soon as possible. All in all, it leads us to the one conclusion, that for some reason we have not been able to identify &mdash; or we have but it has not been accepted yet &mdash; payments have been slowed down from the month of August onwards in the last financial year and they are still being slowed down.  Therefore, the great general acclaim we have had about the outturn in terms of spending results more from involuntary cutbacks, in failure to meet just payments on demand.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the introduction of PRSI for the self-employed. As previous speakers have said, there are beneficial aspects and dubious aspects to that in the sense that on the one hand extra revenue will be brought into the coffers and extra liabilities will be imposed on the Exchequer as a result. Undoubtedly it is welcome that a pension scheme will be available for everybody in this country who after a life at work may find himself or herself unable to afford his or her own pension.  One way or another it is desirable that consideration be given to the introduction of a national pension scheme.  Of course, it could also cost the Exchequer more money.  Certainly it will cost more in administration and in benefits to be paid later and these will increase as time goes on.  That has been provided for &mdash; this point has been made by my colleague <Col N="939" /> Deputy Noonan &mdash; but I am not so certain that at the end of the day there may not be a loss as a result of the change rather than a gain.  That has been dealt with fairly adequately by various other speakers and I will not go into it again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with the reintroduction of the young farmer's installation grants.  Serious problems were caused when they were ceased and it is to be hoped that those referred to by Deputy Roche who were on the wrong side of the expiry date when the hatchet dropped may be accommodated to some extent under the new scheme.  I ask that that be done.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the consistency of political parties and the possible effect consistency or lack of it can have on Government and public attitudes to Government.  The party opposite will have to accept that in the last 18 months they have undergone a major change in attitudes and policy in so far as public spending is concerned. One had only to read the various posters that adorned the various highways a little over a year ago to get some impression of the thinking at that stage.  The public do not necessarily feel too aggrieved at what is happening at present.  What they feel most aggrieved about is the fact that what is happening at present is vastly different to what was indicated in most of those posters and no doubt this type of thing will happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What posters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand why Government speakers have chosen to forget about these posters but I can think of one famous one which read: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was your party who put up that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that a Government Minister should make a suggestion like that because it is one thing to forget about what the posters contained but to try to disown them at this <Col N="940" /> stage is stretching the imagination and the public's ability to cater for that a little too far.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make is that the regard the general public have for politicians and political institutions is undermined by political parties and politicians when they set out on one particular course and seemingly espouse one particular type of policy and then decide to turn their backs on it.  There is nothing wrong with adopting a policy; it is when you go down a road a certain distance and then turn your back on it that public confidence in the political institutions is shaken.  That is a dangerous thing to do.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the other negative aspect of the budget which I think has been dealt with by other speakers, the question of employment or lack of it at present.  There is only a passing reference to that in the budget.  I cannot see anywhere in the budget a provision that is likely to create jobs.  There is absolutely no recognition in it of the fact that more than 250,000 people are unemployed in this country at present; yet, when the Government were sitting over here in the Opposition benches hardly a day went by when we did not see a hoarding or billboard showing a passport or a long queue depicting what they saw as the failure of the then Government policy to provide jobs and the only alternative for young people was to emigrate.  If that was their attitude then, I cannot understand why the Government are so silent about the unemployment issue at present.  I cannot understand why no great attention was given to the unemployment issue in the budget.  Is it that the Government have completely forgotten about the existence of the unemployment problem or is it that the only answer they have to the unemployment problem is that the young people be exported out of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the term of office of the previous Government there were difficulties in that area and unemployment figures increased.  There is no doubt about that but at least some attempt was made at that time to tackle the problem and to try to continue to introduce incentives which <Col N="941" /> would help to alleviate the problem, to try to give hope to young people and to try to give hope to the parents of young people who would be coming out of school, seeking employment and coming onto the job market.  There was some attempt made right through the period of office of that Government to restore some semblance of hope to those people. There is absolutely no hope now.  There was not even a mention of the issue in the single biggest item to come before this House during the past 12 months. The many thousands of young people who are seeking employment and who will come onto the job market during the summer months who listened to the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance must have felt at the end of it that there was a page missing because they did not hear anything that would give them any encouragement or enthusiasm to remain on at school.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that point simply because young people, as we all know, are easily elated and easily deflated or dejected. They lose confidence very quickly because they do not have the experience of older generations.  They take as an indicator what they hear and see over a shorter period of time.  What they have seen on this occasion is a total neglect of what they regard as their most serious problem, the very problem when they leave school of having to face into the world and get employment.  There is no recognition of that problem in the Financial Statement.  That is very sad.  I hope as the year develops we will see some further movement by the Government which will give us some indication that at least they are aware that the problem exists and that something needs to be done about it.  Most important of all, if all else fails there should always be some hope.  If one takes away the hope, particularly when it relates to young people, one can do irreparable damage.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the policy of the Government and the budget and the effects on education.  From listening to speakers on the Government side of the House during the past week or so, one could be forgiven for coming away with <Col N="942" /> the belief that we are living in a different country.  I am sure there is hardly a Deputy in this House who has not attended dozens of meetings throughout the various constituencies in regard to the cutbacks in education.  The Fine Gael Party put before this House a motion which would have resolved many of these issues in the early stage which the Government, and various other parties for that matter, did not accept.  This party anticipated the problems that were about to arise but obviously other parties did not because we were forced into a situation where public representatives had to go before the people in various towns to give an explanation to the parents as to what was going to happen, where cuts were going to take place, the effect they were going to have on the pupil-teacher ratio in schools and whether there would even be a proper education system for their children, let alone jobs, at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>If the Government had carefully thought out their plans, surely they would have made provision for all this during their discussions with the social partners away back last summer and autumn.  The week before Chrismas when the budget was framed was not the time to go hunting around the country looking for a few million pounds here and a few million pounds there and wondering if it would be possible to squeeze a few extra shillings one way or the other in order to provide the necessities for the educational system.</P>
    <P>I have to say, having listened to a number of the Government speakers, I am not so sure they were aware that this was happening.  Certainly, it smacks of a great lack that the Government speakers should now be so complacent in regard to those matters.  Incidentally, those problems are not over.  Despite the little recognition given to education in the budget, those problems still exist.  We have not heard the end of Circular 20/87, though we hope we have.  There is also the question of the cuts in vocational schools and their effect on pupil-teacher ratios, the possible loss of teachers and the loss of various disciplines as a result. <Col N="943" /> All of those issues have yet to be addressed.</P>
    <P>While speaking on the question of vocational education, I have to point out that that was the one system whereby every boy and girl in the country could aspire to a high standard of education.  It was available and accessible to them and they readily availed of it.  This is the first time during the past four or five years that an attack was made on that system. When we talk about progress or lack of it over the past four or five years let us remember that in those years there was recognition of the necessity to provide a proper education system for the children as well as to meet budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>The budget debate so far has made little reference to local government although previously we heard a lot about local government reform.  I am glad that the Minister for the Environment is here now as I know he is personally committed to local government reform.  I hope the Minister achieves his ambitions.  The Minister will certainly receive the support of every politican in this House, certainly politicians who have experience as members of local authorities.  A local authority gives good grounding to politicians as it is there that they learn the rudiments of administration and politics.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the need for local government reform, but it will not come easily.  Unless something is done soon in that area the whole system will crumble. When I joined a local authority there was something in the region of three times the number of outdoor workers as administrative workers.  Now the position is completely reversed.  A private company in any part of the world could not exist in that inverted economic situation.  The decision not to fill posts that become vacant is exacerbating the problem because generally the outdoor workers are more established and are in their fifties or late fifties, whereas the younger workers are in administration.  The Government's policy in relation to public service redundancies is exacerbating the problems and there is no possibility of achieving a balance in that area in the <Col N="944" /> foreseeable future unless there is a change of policy with regard to replacing staff.  That problem must be tackled because if it is not, in about five years time there will be no outdoor staff in the various local authorities and we will have the ridiculous situation in which there will be administrative staff who will have nobody to administer.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Boland introduced a system whereby grants were allocated to local authorites to top up the funds they raised through local charges. That might have seemed like a gimmick at the time, but it had the effect of rewarding the local authorities who had the guts to raise finances.  It gave them some recognition and topped up their funds.  It also had the effect of levelling off the amount of local charge imposed by a local authority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, all local authority members love to have power but they do not necessarily always want responsibility.  There must be a combination of power, authority and responsibility because without that we do not have local government.  The money must come along with the responsibility. It is probable that local authorities themselves allowed the power to slip through their hands.  When various rates, farm rates, commercial and domestic rates began to rise it became unpopular to be associated with the charges, particularly at estimates time.  Local politicians, like all politicians want to be loved by the public at all times and do not want to be involved with the hassle that goes with raising money with the result that they handed the power over to central Government. Now local government is centrally controlled.  There is no point in talking about autonomy because it does not exist.  Virtually the filling of a pothole on the road is controlled by the Department of the Environment.  Incidentially, while I am on that subject I invite the Minister to drive to my constituency along the scenic Grand Canal route towards Sallins to discover what must be the worst county road in Ireland.  The Minister must find a way to do somthing about main and county roads especially in the <Col N="945" /> counties adjacent to Dublin.  The immediate neighbours to Dublin have a particular problem that has not been recognised and unless some recognition is given to it the roads system in those counties will disintegrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, the Minister can treble it and it would have no more effect.  The Minister must be aware, as the previous Minister was, that the problem is greater than an increase in the funding available.  There has to be a specific carefully drawn up plan to deal with the roads in these counties immediately adjacent to Dublin because every motor car and truck that travels to or from the capital city uses the roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not use the county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do use the county roads, because of the traffic congestion on the national and primary routes.  All one has to do is to drive around those roads to see that.  I invite the Minister to have a look at them some time, just to see for himself exactly the effect this traffic is having.  I have travelled throughout the country and there is not another place of which I am aware that has such atrocious road conditions as the conditions existing in the counties adjacent to Dublin.  I refer to Counties Wicklow and Meath as well as to County Kildare.  They are the only counties affected in that fashion and I implore the Minister to do something about it.  Unless the Minister tackles that problem the whole roads structure in these counties will completely disintegrate. The Minister's colleagues in the counties referred to will verify exactly what I have said.  I am not making a politicial point.  I put this to the previous Minister as well.  That is the issue that ranks highest in the minds of commuters <Col N="946" /> in Counties Kildare, Wicklow and Meath at present.</P>
      <P>One often gets the odd snippet from previous budget speeches.  I am sure that that will happen also in the future.  The building industry is one that would hardly be an inspiration for Government speakers. I was amazed that the Minister referred generally to the economy taking an upturn and said that there was greater investment in plant and machinery.  I cannot understand where this is happening. It certainly is not happening in the building industry.  By checking with any of the suppliers to that industry we would quickly find out what really is happening. In the Official Report, Volume 355, column 1300 on 31 January 1985 the present Minister, Deputy Reynolds, said as follows:</P>
      <P>This morning I was stopped at the lights in Northumberland Road and a builder came over and knocked on the window.  He said: &ldquo;I am absolutely disgusted that nobody knows what the reality is of business here&rdquo;.  I asked him what he had intended to do.  He said he was taking the plane to Florida to enjoy the sun and that he would come back when there was a change of Government.</P>
      <P>If I were the Minister now, I would be very worried if that builder came along and knocked on my car window again. Anybody who is familiar with the building industry and recognises the problems that that industry face&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that that builder is back and has got a huge job in the docks site scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he knocks at Deputy Flynn's car window that Minister should make sure it is with his hand and not with a hand weapon as well.  I have spoken to a number of such builders recently.  Their reaction to present Government policies with regard to the building industry is, to say the very least, not what the Minister seems to think.  There is also the question of roads and communications.  Whether we want to accept it or not, there is a <Col N="947" /> crying need now for more investment in roads.  I well recall when Members now on the Government benches used to tell us on a daily basis that there was need for an investment of £200 million extra on roads and that this was a capital investment which would not affect budgetary policy at all.  At present, all capital investment seems to have disappeared.  The school building programmes, the extension of facilities in various schools throughout the country, all seem to have disappeared.  I once heard a Member of this House, now sitting on the opposite benches but not present at the moment, saying that a sign of the state of the economy was the number of cranes you could see on the horizon.  You can see a few of them on the horizon, but there are fewer than there were.  It is now reaching a stage where they are being dismantled. Certainly, the amount of movement is very little.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Allen, is more than capable of dealing with the health situation, to which no doubt he will refer. As a member of a health board I have to say that, generally speaking, while everybody accepts that economies must be made it is unfortunate that the cuts bear most on those who bring the services to the ordinary people who are most affected &mdash; those in community care, for example.  The nurses in hospitals are concerned at the closure of wards and the loss of beds.  It is not in administration that the cuts are made but where they affect the people.  That is what has happened, also, in relation to local authorities. The same general principle applies, of imposing the cuts on outdoor staff, those who carry the services to the people.  It is they who have been curtailed in their activities and on whom the cuts are visited most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the improved situation in agriculture.  We all know that that improved situation was almost directly attributable to a very dramatic change in climatic conditions.  There had been two, almost three, successive seasons of extremely inclement weather conditions, creating particular difficulties <Col N="948" /> in agriculture.  Fortunately, last summer there was a slight change for the better. I know the Government and the Minister are inspired, but I am not sure he could claim responsibility also for the change in the weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is about the only thing for which he has not claimed responsibility.  There was reference to the food industry and expansion plans in that area, which I welcome.  I also welcome the Government's general thrust of policy in that regard.  It provides a great area for expansion in terms of job creation and so on.  I must point out, however, that there are fewer people employed in that industry than there were a year ago.  After all the smoke has died away and after all the hype which we have heard before, that is the position.  If that were to continue, I would have to conclude that all that hype was merely window-dressing which was not going to produce anything.  I would have to issue a warning that we have heard enough of the glory that goes along with expansion plans.  We want to see the potential in that area realised.  We do not want to hear about continued investment policies which it is hoped will achieve 4,000, 5,000 or 10,000 jobs and find at the year's end that there is a loss of 800 to 900 jobs. That simply is not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point was mentioned by my colleague and myself in the debate on Second Stage of the Abattoirs Bill.  It is that grant aid which is available to meat processing plants involved in exporting is not available to similar plants catering for the home market.  This needs to be tackled.  We should recognise that if we want the industry to grow it can start from small beginnings and grow greatly. We should be prepared to encourage a natural progression from a relatively small plant catering for the home market to a plant capable of dealing with export substitution and exports.  I am sorry there was not some reference to that important matter in the statement of the Minister for Finance.  It would certainly improve <Col N="949" /> job prospects in the food and meat processing area.  I hope that will be borne in mind in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Noonan, made reference to costs to industry generally, right across the board.  Costs here are higher than elsewhere.  Electricity and transport costs are examples.  There is also the cost of bad road communications, all an added burden on industry.  We should strive to get our Irish industrialists competing on a fair and equal basis.  This matter is extremely important.  If we are to expand as an industrial nation, our costs will be the determining factor in the sense that we will be able to compete with our neighbours only when our own costs are down to a level similar to theirs.  If we do not achieve that, we shall lose out.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises in regard to the ESB.  The Government are becoming increasingly reliant on borrowing from the future.  Advances were made to the ESB in previous years and those advances are now being hauled in.  It seems that all that is happening is that payments that will be due next year and the year after are being brought forward. That is all very well but what will happen in 1989, 1990 and 1991 when the then Minister for Finance is framing his budget?  Where will he claw the money from?  Those moneys will already have been expended and they will no longer be available.  It is a little like what used to be Fianna Fáil policy &mdash; borrowing from the future to pay for today.  It is dangerous and should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>My last point refers also to industry and was mentioned by other speakers, that is the rising problem of the black economy and the reasons for it.  There would not be a black economy if it were not for the fact that taxation levels, contributions, liabilities and levies on business interests are of such a nature as to make it virtually impossible for them to exist.  Any employer taking on an employee at present is immediately committing himself or herself to a liability of approximately £2,000 before paying the person any wage at all.  We hear a lot of hype about the number of incentives that <Col N="950" /> are available but there is very little talk about the number of disincentives, the built-in, continuing, on-going disincentives which are imposed on the business community, the people on whom we rely to provide jobs in order to alleviate our unemployment problem.  I know budget targets have to be met and that will always be the case but greater recognition should be given in the future to labour intensive industries by way of tax concessions.  If we want the private sector to carry the responsibility for providing jobs then we must also give recognition by way of tax concessions for the effort they are making and will have to make if they are going to carry that burden.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a theory in this House at present that the private sector has failed and various instances are cited to illustrate this.  It should be pointed out that the private sector has many things imposed upon it over which it has no control, such as the costs to which I have already referred.  Those costs are imposed simply because the area from which they arise are areas which are controlled in many cases by monopolies. Those costs are passed on to industry which has to carry the burden, part of which is a lack of job opportunities, a lack of incentive to work and a lack of incentive on the part of employers to employ more people.</P>

    <P>Against that background, the reaction of Opposition parties to this budget has been very interesting.  It has said much more about them than it has said about the budget.  It has underlined a reality of which the Irish public is already aware: that we have a minority Government here which just happens to be the strongest and most decisive Government this country has had in many years and that we do not have an Opposition but a scatter of ideological hitch-hikers on the lookout for a handy bandwagon.</P>
    <P>The elegant subtlety of this budget was that it did not give any of that scatter a bandwagon worth climbing on to.  They did their best.  Deputy Durkan followed the same line this morning.  I must tell him and this House that I do not believe we have ever before had so mediaaddicted a Dáil.  Press releases and statements are fed out with marvellous fluency. Half the Opposition do not know what they think until they hear themselves quoted the following day.  So, when the budget details were clear, one major Opposition figure in this House called them &ldquo;dull&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are a Government, not the allsinging, all-dancing budget show.  We are not playing to a clapometer here, we are bringing realism into the Irish economy. We are implementing a balanced solution not influenced by sectional interests or diverted by sectional interest demands but recognising the needs and possibilities that are available now.</P>
    <P>What another Opposition party seems to be implementing is some kind of second-rate Oliver Twist performance. We also had that last week.  It was not &ldquo;Please, Sir, can I have some more?&rdquo; but &ldquo;Please, Sir, couldn't that group over there have some less?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Let us remember that the Leader of the main Opposition party suggested last week that, given the current consensus within the House, the Government should have taken more draconian measures. That could only result in reduced economic activity and reduced living standards.  The Opposition should get their act together and decide what they really want in politics in 1988.  It is a bit like a group of doctors hearing about a planned operation and agreeing before they were even consulted that it was very necessary, and suggesting that the surgeon, while he had the knife in his hand, should also cut off a few spare legs and arms and maybe a nose or two.  That is the kind of Opposition performance we have had since the budget was announced.</P>
    <P>At least let us have no self-serving waffle about consensus.  Let me define for the House precisely where there is a consensus and where that consensus stops. There is consensus that we have a problem. Action must be taken and we have consensus on that also.  We have also got consensus on the tragedy of unemployment and emigration.  After that, obviously, there is a parting of the ways.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a simple decision in regard to these matters, simple but courageous.  They have decided to be part of the solution to those problems.  They have taken radical action.  They have also recognised the plight of the PAYE taxpayer.  This budget underlines our intention to honour our manifesto commitment to them.  The Government have done a lot more, for example, the self-assessment measures for the self-employed and others constitutes a major step forward in taxation thinking which should be recognised by the Opposition parties as such.  Therefore, in the face of our problems, the Government have decided to be part of the solution to them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, all of the Opposition parties in this House clearly have decided to be part of the problem.  The parties on the Left clearly need the problem to continue &mdash; that is what they have <Col N="953" /> been seeking to achieve &mdash; because, if it does, then they can recruit from the growing misery base.  That is why, for example, they can trivialise as dull a budget which has made major, unprecedented funding available toward the solution of homelessness.  The parties on the Right need the problem to continue also because, if the Government build on reality and break the mould, how can those parties face the next day without a nice warm slogan to wrap around their hollowness?  Has that not been the problem as represented from the far right in this House?</P>
    <P>One commentator said that a particular Opposition spokesman talked as if he had written his speech before he had even heard the contents of the budget.  I would go one step further.  I would suggest that all the spokespeople talked in reaction to what they expected from the stereotype they had built up of what constitutes a Fianna Fáil Government.  Of course the reality is quite different.  So it was particularly in this budget, which was demanding but was also human in content, caring for the economy but also for people and their environment.  In a nutshell, our budget was street wise and idealistic.  Of course the Opposition could not cope with that other than whinge, which now appears to be the usual response to Government measures.  They like to tinker also at the edges of the problem.  So far as I am concerned Opposition should be a seed bed of alternatives. The Opposition, made up as it is now of right, left, middle left and middle right, is barren of ideas.  We heard no ideas from any of the speakers this morning. Of course Fine Gael have always been strong on posturing, as is the case with some of the other Opposition parties, strong on rhetoric also but barren of ideas.  Fortunately for the country this minority Government have ideas, the courage to implement them and most important of all the competence to make them work.  That is a new dimension to Government in this country.  When one considers that the Opposition parties who were in Government for ten of the past 14 years left behind them a trail of <Col N="954" /> destruction and failure to implement any suggestions they had made over that period, one gets some idea of just how barren those parties were in Government. They have continued their sterility and barrenness in Opposition.</P>
    <P>Our success in handling the national finances since assuming office has led to a growth in business confidence.  This is reflected in the large decrease in commercial lending interest rates, including the mortgage interest rate.  Bank interest rates have fallen six times since this Government took office.  At a recent meeting of the CII, when in excess of 40 of the major executives of some of the bigger companies here were in attendance, it was stated that, for the first time in four years, the meeting was actually bullish, the new buzz word when investment is about to take place, when people feel there is a lift in the economy.  That happened for the first time in four years just a few weeks ago.  It is a strong indication that Government policies are working.  It is not just a matter of our stating it here.  It has been recognised in an independent way by the captains of industry outside.  The Opposition should take note.</P>
    <P>The fall in interest rates has had a beneficial effect on costs for the public and private sectors.  It helps reduce the cost of servicing the public debt.  It helps reduce the borrowing costs of private sector firms, especially those in the building and manufacturing industries.  In my area of responsibility local authority have benefited from lower interest rates in servicing their short term borrowings, all because of reduced interest rates and good Government policies in order to achieve them.</P>
    <P>Of course individuals are most affected by mortgage rates.  There, the annual rate has fallen four times, from 12.5 per cent to 9.25 per cent, since this Government took office.  That adds up to a monthly saving of £55 for somebody with a typical £25,000, 20-year mortgage, a real saving and easement for those who have to meet a tight budget.  It would be much more beneficial to the Opposition were they generous in recognising the fall in interest <Col N="955" /> rates in so far as it affects mortgage holders, falling from that 12.5 per cent to 9.25 per cent, an extraordinary achievement within a matter of nine or ten months.</P>
    <P>There are other favourable economic trends such as the very low rate of inflation, surplus balance of payments due to the spectacular performance of our exports and stability in foreign rates. Government policy has underpinned all these trends.  This budget sustains them further.  Positive economic trends will tend to improve employment levels, particularly within the building industry where there have been some recent encouraging developments.</P>
    <P>Obviously greater equity and fairness within the tax system is a Government priority.  This budget demonstrates that we are serious about this.  The new measures will ensure that nearly 63 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the standard rate in the income tax year 1988-89. Who would have thought that a Fianna Fáil Government could have come so close to achieving their three-year target in nine months, of having almost two-thirds of the PAYE sector paying the standard rate of income tax &mdash; 35 per cent?</P>
    <P>Self-assessment for the self-employed and corporate taxpayers will help to release staff to monitor and follow-up those in arrears.  The measures proposed for dealing with non-complying taxpayers show Government determination to improve collection of taxes and reduce public unease about its effectiveness.  For the past couple of years we have heard nothing but bleating from the Opposition parties about what they would do about collecting the moneys due to the State. There has been a major advance made in that respect this year, in so far as the incentive now being provided for a short time to those who are in arrears means that they can finally settle their affairs.  It constitutes a major step forward and we deserve to be complimented in that regard.  Following on the number of representations received from all sides of the House, from Deputies on behalf of their <Col N="956" /> constituents who were advocating such measures, the Opposition should, in all generosity, accept that that constitutes a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always provided for the most vulnerable and deprived sectors of our community.  The Government, in providing for an increase of 3 per cent in the value of social welfare benefits and health allowances, are continuing that commitment.  The increase will be effective from July next as compared with the Coalition proposal last year to pay increases from November.  Mind you, that Coalition had a party of so-called Left involved in its make up.  When one considers that they thought that the way to deal with the people they profess to support was to leave until November the little they would receive at that time, then one sees something of how far away from the thinking of the Left that party have gone.  The increase of 3 per cent may be slightly ahead of the expected rise in the cost of living, as some experts predict that the consumer price index this year could be as low as 2 per cent.  Of course, there will be increases of up to 11 per cent in selected categories of long term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The least well off have received special treatment.  We should all be generous enough to reflect in the House on what is regarded outside the House as a genuine recognition by Government of the least well off in society.  We have discriminated positively in their favour and that must be seen as a positive step forward in reducing the existing level of poverty.</P>
    <P>I was saddened to note, in the Opposition response to the budget, a suggestion that it has ignored the unemployed. The budget has no gimmicks, no fast fixes, no sops, no created agencies mandated to solve some aspect of unemployment overnight.  What the Budget does is to boost areas which provide a reasonable expectation of generating new jobs in worthwhile numbers.  The building industry, tourism, fishing and aquaculture all stand to benefit.  These industries are labour intensive.  They benefit the country as a whole as expenditure is spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> The Government are not into flag waving or speculation on unemployment figures.  We set our targets in the Estimates as published and we reached them. That is some change from the practice that has been there over the past 14 years, most of which time the Government benches were occupied by the Coalition. We reached our targets, a difficult reality for the Opposition to swallow, whose preoccupation in Government was preaching figures and then failing miserably to attain any of them.  That, of course, is what put them out of office and where they will stay while they continue to practise the same kind of foolishness.</P>
    <P>Before getting down to areas of expenditure for which I am responsible I would like to say a few words about the large reduction shown in the Environment 1988 Estimate over the 1987 outturn, as set out in table 2 on page 2 of the Principal Features of the Budget</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, which allows the Minister for Finance to write off amounts outstanding on certain loans from the local loans fund.  The main purpose of that legislation is to simplify the system of financing capital programmes operated by local authorities which had developed into an expensive and time consuming circle of payments.  The changes will not have an adverse effect on the finances either of the Exchequer or local authorities.  They will reduce administrative work and improve efficiency.</P>
    <P>The total amount of loan charges subsidy varies with capital expenditure and the level of the local loans fund interest rate.  In 1987 the Environment vote included £266 million for such subsidies, while the 1988 Abridged Estimates includes about £270 million.  This money is issued by the Exchequer to local authorities via my Department and then it is returned by the local authorities to the Office of Public Works as part of their loan charges repayments.  I am glad these wasteful procedures are now terminated. The revised Estimate volume will provide a much clearer picture of my Department's expenditure.</P>
    <P>This Government are setting out to <Col N="958" /> create economic conditions conducive to investment, employment and growth. They are setting out to improve derelict and rundown inner city areas.  The largest urban renewal project underway is, of course, the Custom House docks development.  The master project agreement between the Authority and the development consortium was recently signed and construction work on the site has already begun.  It is estimated that the project will cost £250 million and employ about 2,500 to 3,000 people during construction.  Hopefully, it will be in excess of 7,000 on completion.</P>

      <P>Not in the slightest.  The level of national and international interest that has been generated by the success rate to date in furthering this project is most encouraging and the speed and efficiency with which the authority and the Government have brought this project to commencement date has impressed those looking at Ireland as an investment opportunity.  I have to take a bow, whether for the Department or the Authority, for the completion of the master project agreement which was done in record time has resulted in the Government receiving very favourable notice as a Government who know what they are doing and where they are going and get on with the job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, the urban renewal financial incentive scheme has been in <Col N="960" /> operation in designated areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway since mid-1986 and redevelopment projects amounting to almost 400,000 square feet are being pursued in these areas.  In view of the progress being achieved in these centres, it was decided last year to extend the incentives to nine new provincial centres, namely Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Wexford. Areas have been designated in these centres and the incentives will be available until mid-1991.  Let me remind the House of some amendments which were announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The first is extending the deadline for availing of the incentives in the five county boroughs from 31 May 1989 to 31 May 1991, the time limit set in the new areas.  I was anxious that whatever incentive package is available in a designated area, whether it is a borough council or a provincial centre, that they would all apply in the same way over the same period of time.  That has been welcomed by many of the authorities involved in those areas.</P>
    <P>We are also altering slightly the boundaries of two of the designated areas in Limerick and Dublin where development was being hindered by their original boundaries.  Because of new investment opportunities becoming available in those areas there is need to extend these areas slightly and that will be done in the immediate future.  We are also designating an area in or around Tallaght town centre.  This is a response to representations that have been received, pressed and promoted on all sides of the House and I hope we can get around to finalising that matter and doing something really positive to bring investment and improvement to an area that is long waiting for it.  This will bring much investment and prosperity to all the centres involved.  My Department will be finalising details of these three amendments which I will be announcing shortly.</P>
    <P>The good news on the designated areas front is that private investment is available and willing to get involved in urban <Col N="961" /> renewal.  It must be an indication of confidence returning in the private sector so far as development and putting up money in the area of construction are concerned. This will provide facilities that are badly needed in many of those derelict areas in the designated areas and also in the new town centre in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Government are also providing a special £1 million revolving fund to the National Building Agency to enable them to invest in certain developments which will bring together local authority, private and voluntary interests in provincial centres to promote urban renewal.  The fund aims to further stimulate and encourage private investment in this type of activity.</P>
    <P>Two crucially important environmental measures were included in this budget: the concession in the excise duty on unleaded petrol so that it can retail at the same price as premium leaded petrol, and the new scheme of financial assistance for smokeless zones which I have been authorised to prepare.  I make no apology to anybody.  I have been seeking these two measures for a considerable time and they are a great response to what has become a major problem particularly for Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Lead pollution from petrol is a serious environmental problem.  It is a threat to the health of young children.  Already we have reduced the lead content of leaded petrol in this country to a low level of 0.15 grammes per litre.  Bluntly, that is not enough.  Longer term, we have to phase in unleaded petrol.  We have to reduce the use of leaded petrol and, ultimately, we should replace leaded petrol with unleaded petrol.  We have some forecourts already in place with unleaded petrol available for sale and I expect there will be a huge expansion in the sale of unleaded petrol in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The main obstacle to achieving this objective has been the higher price of unleaded relative to leaded petrol.  This is due to the higher refining and transport costs associated with unleaded petrol.  So, even though unleaded petrol was introduced in Ireland nearly a year and a half ago, it has not made much headway <Col N="962" /> because it has been retailing at nearly 5p per gallon more than premium leaded petrol.</P>
    <P>The budget excise duty concession will end this disincentive by allowing unleaded and premium leaded petrol to retail at the same price.  It is now a matter of choice.  I intend to exploit this initiative fully in promoting the use of unleaded petrol in this country.  We are extremely well placed in that as much as one-third of the Irish car fleet can use unleaded petrol either straightaway or with minor timing adjustments.</P>
    <P>Availability of unleaded petrol is now a key issue in tourism.  Large numbers of mainland European motorists, particularly German, Dutch, Danish, Scandinavian and Swiss, use unleaded at home.  When they come to Ireland, they want to do the same.</P>
    <P>Many of our motoring tourists from mainland Europe know their cars cannot work properly on leaded petrol and the first thing they look for is the forecourt selling unleaded petrol.  Now we will be in a position to impress upon the companies the necessity to provide the alternative. It will be no loss to them but it will be a major boost so far as tourist promotion is concerned, and I believe it is being welcomed by all in the industry.  This point is well appreciated by the Minister for Tourism and Transport and by Bord Fáilte.  It takes on added significance given the Taoiseach's recent remarks about the proper promotion abroad of Ireland's tourism image.</P>
    <P>This budgetary concession, along with the £4 million announced in the budget for a package of tourism measures, will enhance tourist access to Ireland by facilitating continental motorists whose Governments and motoring organisations have already been complaining about the non-availability of unleaded petrol in the countries they visit.  I would like to thank the oil companies who, on my recommendation last year, increased the number of outlets for unleaded petrol even with the differential in the price, but the take up was, to say the least of it, negligible.  I will now have further discussions with the companies and I am <Col N="963" /> satisfied they will take on board what I regard as a major advance so far as emission control, pollution control and tourism development are concerned, by providing the facility of making unleaded petrol available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>State assistance for smoke control measures, as announced in the budget, will be of particular interest to Dubliners in this Millennium Year.  The Government have agreed to allow up to £250,000 to be spent in 1988 to begin a scheme of financial assistance towards the cost of smoke control measures.</P>
    <P>The Dublin smoke situation is by far the country's most serious air pollution problem.  The need to remedy it was the main reason behind the enactment of the air Pollution Act, 1987, which this Government actively promoted through the Dáil upon assuming office.  Smoke emissions in Dublin are actually greater than for the whole London area and, relatively speaking, smoke pollution in Dublin is six times more intense.  Dublin inner city and areas such as Ballyfermot, Crumlin, Cabra and Rathmines regularly exceed EC limit values.  Medical commentators, the media and increasingly the ordinary Dublin public have been voicing concern about this.</P>
    <P>Some 80 per cent of smoke pollution in Dublin arises from domestic sources. The remedy envisaged in the new Act for local authorities, subject to ministerial approval, is to declare &ldquo;special control areas&rdquo; or smokeless zones.  In line with their statutory obligations, Dublin Corporation have just completed a survey of nearly 900 houses in Ballyfermot with a view to this zoning.</P>
    <P>Smokeless zones will require householders to find an alternative to burning ordinary coal in an open fireplace, either by changing their heating system to, for example, a gas burner, or by using smokeless solid fuels which will also require adaptations in terms of an enclosed stove or an upgraded open fireplace. Financial assistance towards the cost of these adaptations will be available under the scheme now approved in principle. The practical preparation of the <Col N="964" /> scheme will now go ahead as a matter of urgency and I will announce the details later.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have speculated that the new grants scheme will be linked to a particular type of heating appliance. This is not going to be the case.  In principle, I would like the scheme to encompass all suitable appliances, whether for gas or solid fuels.</P>
    <P>The relatively modest sum of £250,000 has been earmarked for this rather than a larger sum because the procedures for establishing smoke control areas recently enacted by the Oireachtas in the Air Pollution Act, 1987, necessarily involve some time.  On top of that, a minimum period of six months must be allowed under the Act between the confirmation of an order and its coming into force. While I am anxious for remedial action on Dublin smoke pollution to be developed quickly, £250,000 is sufficient provision for the grant liabilities likely in reality to mature in 1988.</P>
    <P>Having provided the legislative framework to tackle the whole problem of air pollution, I am satisfied that we can now undertake practical steps to apply smoke control measures to areas of greatest need.  It comes down to a simple, basic fact of political life.  Passing legislation without giving it the financial muscle to implement it is a waste of time.  What we did last year was to get the legislation through and what we have done in this budget is to provide the money to make it work.</P>

      <P>As much as is necessary and, if more is needed, it will be there. With the time scale the procedure and formula which have to be adopted by the local authority, the amount I have provided cannot physically be paid out in any greater amount in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided not to proceed with the development of the site at Baldonnel which it was intended to develop for the storage, prior to export, of hazardous waste.  The site is not suitable as far as I am concerned.  Capital grants up to 50 <Col N="965" /> per cent will be made available by my Department to private sector operators to encourage them to improve and extend the range of treatment, recovery and disposal facilities for hazardous waste.  In addition, to make sure that planning in this area is based on current and comprehensive information, my Department are commissioning a feasibility study of the technical and economic aspects of the possibility of the provision of a national hazardous waste incinerator.  Progress in the safe disposal of hazardous waste is urgent to ensure that existing and potential employment is not endangered by the lack of suitable disposal arrangements for the inevitable waste.  We might as well realise that it will not always be possible to export our waste and gear ourselves to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the positive happenings in 1988 is, of course, Dublin's Millennium.  The Government are contributing to it by providing £700,000 from the surplus generated by the national lottery for a wide variety of projects and events including community involvement, youth, sport, arts and culture.</P>
    <P>We are anxious that permanent improvements are also undertaken for the Millennium and my Department have already given £250,000 to Dublin Corporation for the repaving of Grafton Street.  We have been assured that work on this project will be finished in time for St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>It is important, too, that improvements should be carried out to O'Connell Street and the corporation have at my request, drawn up plans for the widening of the central mall and, in the longer term, widening the footpaths and reducing the traffic flow.  The Department of the Environment will be providing a further grant of £250,000 towards the improvement of the mall this year and this will be matched by a similar amount from the corporation.</P>
    <P>We must encourage private investment in specific sectors of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>One of the best ways is by the restoration of the so-called section 23 incentive for investment in private rented <Col N="966" /> accommodation, under which a 100 per cent allowance will be available in respect of reasonable expenditure incurred on the construction and refurbishment of private rented residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>The allowance will be set against rental income from all property in the State. This fulfils a specific commitment in the Govenment's pre-election programme and is one of the principal recommendations of the Construction Industry Development Board.</P>
    <P>When this incentive existed previously from 1981 to 1984 it proved to be singularly successful in boosting building activity in the private rented sector and in increasing the supply of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The restored section 23 incentive should result in an increase in the supply of accommodation which should ensure that rent levels remain reasonable. Another benefit will be a raising of general standards in the private rented sector as older substandard accommodation is replaced by modern units.</P>
    <P>There is another important point here. The original section 23 had relatively little impact outside Dublin and, perhaps to a lesser extent, Cork.  I know that other cities and towns regarded the demise of section 23 as a lost opportunity and I would hope now that developers and investors throughout the country will avail of this important incentive to an extent that did not occur previously.  The incentive only applies for three years.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that when previously in operation, section 23 had an unexpected effect on certain types of residential building which was not confined to the private rented sector only.  Because of the incentives, many builders undertook high quality developments of town houses and apartments and found that in many cases the bulk of the development was sold to owner occupiers.</P>
    <P>So, quite apart from its direct impact in providing rented accommodation, section 23 encouraged house builders to discover an important element of the market which had been largely neglected. <Col N="967" /> The mortgage rate is now at its lowest level for 15 years.</P>
    <P>The prospects are good for private investment in the commercial sector of the construction industry.  Out in front, of course, is the Custom House Docks site, with investment in the region of £250 million.  That means an immediate impact on construction output and employment in the Dublin area.  It should also become a catalyst for further growth in private investment in construction, creating a knock-on momentum for development and recovery.</P>
    <P>Other areas of private sector involvement are the provision of office accommodation in provincial areas as part of the Government's decentralisation programme, the construction of the Galway Road/Navan Road section of the Dublin Western Ring Road and some major industrial projects such as the Saehan project in Sligo.  In the public area, the public capital programme affecting the building industry is set at nearly £900 million.  This is a very substantial sum in times of severely restricted funds.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Energy, recently announced that work would commence immediately on the extension of the natural gas grid northwards.  The total cost of the project will be approximately £30 million and during the construction stage it will provide 200 jobs in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to stamp duty, this budget has removed perhaps the worst trap or distortion from the present system with the introduction of a new reduced 5 per cent rate for properties in the £50,000 to £60,000 price band.</P>
    <P>Up to now, stamp duty on houses up to £50,000 was levied at 4 per cent while houses over this limit were rated at 6 per cent.  This resulted in a 50 per cent increase in the rate of stamp duty payable. The change will represent a saving of £600 on the purchase of a £60,000 second hand house.</P>
    <P>The Government have approved my proposals for a special allocation of £3 million over three years to finance the <Col N="968" /> provision of accommodation for homeless people by voluntary organisations. Voluntary Housing Organisations are now playing an increasingly important role in this area.  Expenditure under the voluntary housing scheme is increasing year by year, but it has not achieved much in the way of additional accommodation for the homeless.</P>
    <P>The additional £1 million provided in the budget will bring to £4 million my Department's allocation to local authorities for fully subsidised loans to voluntary housing organisations in 1988.  In addition to increasing funding, I wish to inform the House that I am also amending the terms of the scheme to make it easier for voluntary organisations to provide accommodation for homeless people which, being not necessarily self-contained, is at present outside the scope of the scheme except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that the existing requirement to meet 20 per cent of the cost of providing accommodation is particularly onerous on voluntary bodies assisting the homeless, I have also decided to increase from 80 per cent to 95 per cent the level of assistance available in any case of accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The increased provision, together with the change in the level of assistance which may be advanced, will let voluntary organisations expand and develop their role in housing the homeless.  There is no point in having legislation without the money to implement it and, since I became Minister for the Environment, I have provided the money and I will introduce the legislation later.</P>
    <P>The Focus Point organisation have been developing an integrated range of services for homeless people.  Very important within that range is help for homeless people to resettle whether in local authority or private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>Last year, following a request by my Department, a building in Arran Quay was made available by Dublin Corporation to Focus Point.  They undertook extensive rehabilitation work so that it <Col N="969" /> might provide accommodation for homeless young persons.  I am pleased that it has been possible to make a specific grant of £50,000 towards the substantial costs incurred.</P>
    <P>All that I have outlined should make a significant improvement when it comes to accommodation for homeless men and women.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing the tenant purchase scheme introduced in August 1986 to see if tenant purchase can be made more attractive.  House tenant purchase should be encouraged as I should like to see greater home ownership.  There are 120,000 local authority houses involved and the cost of management and administration of those houses in 1986 was £65 million, exceeding the rental income of £41 million by £24 million.  The decline in sales of local authority houses has taken place since the seventies and I am now interested in bringing in a new tenant purchase scheme so that more people can own their own houses and reduce that imbalance in rental income, administration and management costs.</P>
    <P>The 1988 provision for the local authority rate support grant stands now at £186 million, a reduction of £39 million on the amount included in abridged Estimates volume published last October. This reduction arises from the changeover to the new capital grants system which I referred to earlier and represents the amount of Local Loans Fund repayments which local authorities will not have to meet in 1988 from their own resources (including rate support grants) following the write-off of loans by the Minister for Finance on 1 May 1988.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the 1988 rates support grant provision which will appear in the Revised Estimates volume will incorporate the £13.08 million in Vote No. 18, Rates on Government property &mdash; which will in future be paid by my Department to local authorities as part of the rates support grant, much to their advantage.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the rates support grant provision, the Government will still be providing about £450 million to fund local authority current expenditure in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> Local authorities will also benefit financially from other developments, including the early estimate periods I introduced to help them manage their cash flow better, lower interest rates and cheaper energy.</P>
    <P>All this does not take from my clear understanding that 1988 will not be an easy year for local authorities.  I commend them for the responsible way they managed to strike a balance between necessary economics and the maintenance of local services.  It has been a workmanlike approach and it augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>The workmanlike approach of this budget also augurs well for the future. It is a budget which is resolute in its adherence to the direction this Government have established &mdash; but it is also a step away from the politics of misery.</P>
    <P>That has been recognised by the public. The reaction to this budget has been positive. There has been no euphoria by one favoured section &mdash; it was too fair for that.  But the general public have seen a continuation of the commitment to getting the national books right, while at the same time showing concern, showing innovation, showing imagination.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must reiterate that this is the first budget &mdash; the first budget ever &mdash; to make real provisions for the solving of environmental problems.  I suppose that sums it up.  This Government sees growth, development and a positive future for Ireland &mdash; and we are also going to make sure it is a country beautiful to live in, with air that is fit to breathe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the House of the following statement which I will quote from the budget speech of Deputy Haughey on 6 February 1985? He said:</P>
      <P>Practically everybody outside that small cabal of right-wing Ministers and monetarist economists who are slowly destroying our country clearly see what is needed and what should be done.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> Indeed, at times it seems that somewhere in the Government establishment there is an inexplicable malevolence towards building and construction as an industry.</P>
    <P>This budget has failed to confront the three main problems now facing our country.  We have unemployment where one in every five of our labour force has no work.  As Deputies we know the poverty and the degradation that means for tens of thousands of individuals and families.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we have still, after the budget, a taxation system which has done nothing to redistribute resources, in fact it has gone in the other direction.  Our taxation system is still narrowly based and open to substantial evasion.  It still does not control the black economy.  This is because there is one single thing missing from the budget and that is the question of total disclosure.  That is totally glossed over.  In terms of bank accounts, building societies, commercial and financial institutions there is no provision for total disclosure.  Even in the power of attachment, there is no provision.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this budget fails because the burden of lowering the current budget deficit and our foreign debt must be reduced.  There is no dispute in this House in that regard.  There is still that burden on the backs of those with low incomes and who are dependent on essential social services.  I will give one example.  Last year, from those on relatively low incomes £7.5 million was taken in out-patient and in-patient charges. That amount was taken from people who were sick and either in hospitals or needed to use out-patient facilities.  They had to pay.</P>
    <P>We have a Fianna Fáil Party who, in my opinion, have betrayed their historic concern for the poor and who, uniquely in this country, are enshrining a two-tier health system, a two-tier hospital system in a society which is becoming two-tiered in itself.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months there has been a doubling of the number of deaths from <Col N="972" /> AIDS.  What was the response of a former Minister for Health, now Taoiseach to all of this?  He abolished the Health Education Bureau.  We now have a staff of six in an office in Mount Street called the Education Health Bureau but with no director, a fictitious budget, no output and no work.  We saw the Galway report on juvenile alcoholism.  We saw the ESRI report on rampant adolescent alcoholism in Dublin.  Yet there is nobody to talk about lifestyles or to produce basic public health education programmes.  I say shame on the Taoiseach for allowing that to happen.</P>
    <P>I recognise, a Cheann Comhairle, that given the budget requirements for social services and for unemployment related expenditure there is a very restricted scope for major reductions in total taxation at present.  However, the budget should have provided some stimulus for employment.  It could have introduced real measures of tax reform.  It could have gone much further in reforming our social welfare system and it could have provided a much greater equity in the taxation system.  It could have done those things and above all we could have had a budget which would have protected essential social and public services.  That did not happen because, regrettably, there is a political consensus in this House &mdash; it is a very perverse consensus based on imported monetarism of the worst kind and dominating now the main parties in the House &mdash; that the only way to restore order in the public finances is to cut public expenditure left, right and centre.</P>
    <P>This deflationary policy, this <i>status quo</i> policy &mdash; because there is nothing new in this budget &mdash; must be opposed.  Otherwise our country will continue in a major crisis of growing emigration, an ongoing inequity built into our tax system and more and more people on long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There are now, as we speak this morning, 112,000 people on long-term unemployment assistance and by the end of this year the number will be 120,000.  We could add to that 15,500 smallholders who are effectively long-term unemployed who are not on the live register. <Col N="973" /> The long-term unemployment figure is frightening within our country.  What is the policy?  Another £300 million is to be cut in public expenditure in 1988 as we will find when the Estimates are published at the end of this year.  On and on it goes.  At least 30,000 people &mdash; 35,000 most likely &mdash; will emigrate, our youngest and best educated in many respects as will also families whose members may have jobs but who are suffering from a sense of despair and a depleted morale. One can look at electoral register just published to find that that is the case. This deflationary policy is the most severe in the history of our country and it is based on the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I endorse the statement made by the Combat Poverty Agency in their pre-budget submission.  I thought it was a most pertinent statement in that it referred to the programme as follows:</P>
    <P>The strategy contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will not significantly alter the position of that third of the population on the lowest levels of income.</P>
    <P>Equally, we must take account of reputable economic commentators in relation to both the budget and the pre-budget position.  It is frightening that the Central Bank in its latest quarterly bulletin forecasts that the rate of unemployment will increase further in 1988 and that the deflationary policies of the Government will reduce real GNP in 1988 by at least a half of 1 per cent.  Independent economists from the ERSI &mdash; and I regard Mr. John Fitzgerald and Mr. Bradley as independent economists &mdash; in a very pertinent post-budget analysis stated that the overall effect of the budget would be more unemployment, more deflation and a further drop in GNP.</P>
    <P>Last week when the budget was introduced and when I got sight of what can only be described as a pallid Finance script, with due respect to the Department of Finance, my hopes faded.  I had hoped we might have seen a Minister, even a Minister for the Environment, talk about the need for a new comprehensive <Col N="974" /> income-related property tax but there was not even a smell of it.  I thought we might have seen a real effort being made to integrate RSI records of social welfare and income tax payments but there was not much evidence of that.  I thought we might have seen a new statutory sick pay scheme which the Minister for Social Welfare has been talking about for the past 12 months.  The prospect of that has disappeared.  I thought we might have seen a real system of pay-related social insurance for the self-employed being introduced but what did we get?  We did not even get a half measure.  I thought we might have seen the introduction of the second phase of a child benefit scheme which I brought in in 1985-86 but what did we get?  It has been frozen and for the second year running there will be no increase in child benefit.  No effort has been made at reform.  They have all gone back to that Finance burial chamber of interdepartmental committees and what has been brought in has been emasculated beyond recognition.</P>
    <P>One of the more tawdry episodes in the history of Fianna Fáil has been its shifting policy on employment in the public service.  In 1977-78 a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance issued letters of congratulation to Government Departments &mdash; I have seen some of those letters &mdash; and other State agencies on their reaching the Government target on new recruitment in the public service.  Ten years later a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance and the public service is now congratulating State agencies on their achieving the exact opposite, a target of so-called voluntary redundancies.  This new policy in the classical Fianna Fáil response oscillates from one extreme to the other.  Both are unacceptable.  Effectively, almost anybody in the public service may now opt for redundancy.  For all practicable purposes any public servant aged 50 or over may opt out.  There is no selectivity. That he or she may be a key worker of outstanding personal worth in the public service is of no relevance.  The attitude of the Government and the Minister for Finance is: &ldquo;Let them go if they want to&rdquo;. Key Departments who are expected to <Col N="975" /> spearhead the control of public expenditure or the introduction of new taxation measures are not even exempt.</P>
    <P>Consider, for example, two situations. Six assistant principal officers in the Department of Health have left, and that in a Department which has very few assistant principals.  I do not blame them for going; I would be tempted to go myself such is the chaos in that Department. In Dublin County Council, 587 staff will have left between January 1987 and the end of this year.  The effect of these redundancies on the quality of administration in, first of all, the health services and secondly in the most densely populated county, County Dublin, will be devastating both in the short and long term.  All this is being done so that the Taoiseach can prove to his new-found stock exchange friends that he is a reformed macho expenditure cutter.  Even Dublin Fire Brigade is not secure from the zeal of the redundancy policy.</P>
    <P>It is said that we, the Irish people, are a people of extremes.  All that I can say is that it seems that the Taoiseach is determined in his endorsement of this public service redundancy policy to give this reputation an entirely new dimension. How do we meet the cost of this policy?  It is in a mess at this stage.  Here again, we go from one extreme to the other.  We can all recall in the halcyon days of Fianna Fáil expenditure the famous phrase &ldquo;self-financing subsidies&rdquo; as the vehicle of economic growth.  Now to meet the cost of those redundancies a new economic phrase has been coined &mdash;&ldquo;advance surplus payments from the Central Bank&rdquo;.  Money which they would have earned, £80 million has been brought forward but of course we will have to pay it back between 1990 and 1993.  The only complication is that the money must be paid back by a future administration between 1990 and 1993. Meanwhile the public servant retiring at age 50 with a lump sum and other payments will be drawing on an actuarial basis some 24 years pension &mdash; average life 74.  Seven and a half years have been added on to get him out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> Is it any wonder that there is a rumour now that a new association is going to be formed, the association of redundant but not retired public servants or civil servants. There will be room for one as we get rid of 10,000 public servants in 1988 at a cost which no other European country would contemplate and on the basis of a policy which has been ill-conceived and ill-costed and which is being ill-implemented. That policy should be declared redundant forthwith and the £80 million should be spent more profitably and more productively.  In my opinion if you want to borrow £80 million from the Central Bank it should be spent on the public capital programme.  Indeed, I would have expected that the public service trade unions in the congress would have shared my views on this matter.  It is a matter of profound concern to me that in their comprehensive discussions with the Government they seemed more preoccupied with the so-called voluntary options of redundancy and the levels of payment than with the far more critical matter of the great impact of that policy decision on our public services and, secondly, that the money should be used for more productive job creating purposes.  I regret that unfortunate response to the Government and it will be very much regretted in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>We have had no fundamental reform in the taxation system in the budget. There has been one major change in taxation in the past three or four years, the introduction of the deposit interest retention tax.  That was spearheaded largely by my party despite intensive opposition from multiple sources, including Fianna Fáil.  The House will remember the way Fine Fáil Members spoke of the impact of DIRT on children's savings.  Nevertheless, that tax has proved to be a major revenue earner bringing in last year no less than £298 million.  More revenue accrued from DIRT than from corporation profits tax in 1987.  That was a very substantial tax reform by the last Government.  In fact, the amount of money collected from DIRT is almost the equivalent of all of the public expenditure <Col N="977" /> reductions in 1987, £300 million.  That is sobering thought in terms of a new taxation measure.  In the long run there was not a great outcry about it and, relative to the cuts in expenditure, it was much more equitable in our society.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment in the course of his speech did not refer to the unprecedented slump in activity in the construction industry.  I do not think we fully appreciate that the public capital programme has been cut by 23 per cent, or £228 million.  That is the single largest reduction in the public capital programme in the past 30 years.  About 10,000 construction jobs will be lost as a result of that reduction and the prospect for 1988 looks grim indeed.  We have had a lot of hype about the Customs House docks site development which depends on very shakey private investment but that cannot mask the massive reduction in State led activity at all levels of the construction industry.  I can recall the assurances given by the Taoiseach, and other members of Fianna Fáil, to the construction industry and the building trade unions in the course of the general election campaign but those promises have been turned on their heads in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have had the unique decision by the Government to extend the urban renewal scheme to the Tallaght Town Centre and I should like to know why that decision was taken.  A political correspondent in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday said I had made some innuendoes about it.  I did not make any innuendoes about it; I stated the facts.  I said there were private developers involved who put the gun to the head of Dublin Corporation.  Monarch Properties Limited are the developers and that is well known.  They said they would not go ahead and we have revised and revised the Tallaght Town Centre project.  That company sat on the project until they got tax benefits applied to them.  Fianna Fáil caved in.  I should like to ask the Minister why those incentives are not extended to Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>It appears that urban renewal is being applied to green field developments. <Col N="978" /> What a policy mess we have.  In Government we decided to have this incentive applied to certain designated areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford but what has happened since? In a classical Irish move those incentives have been extended all over the place, to Tallaght, Castlebar, Athlone, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Sligo, Tralee, Tullamore and Waterford.  When are we going to extend the incentives to Clonmel, Blanchardstown, Dún Laoghaire, Bray, Wicklow, Mullingar, Ennis, Navan, Monaghan and Mitchelstown? The scheme is now a mess.  An entirely laudable programme of urban renewal and re-instatement has been messed up for purely political reasons.  The Minister for Finance must disclose to the House the cost of the tax concession in relation to Tallaght.  He should give the House details of the concession given to the company concerned and if he does not do so, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I will call in the Accounting Officers of the Departments of Finance and the Environment and put the question directly to them.</P>
    <P>In the course of his budget speech the Minister for the Environment disclosed that the master project agreement between the Custom House Docks authority and the development consortium was signed recently but when I asked him to put a copy of the project before the House he refused, despite the fact that it involves £250 million of an investment, including State money.  We are all aware that that agreement was not signed until the gun was held to the head of the Minister for Finance whose Department completely opposed giving a concession.  The gun was held to the head of the Minister for Finance to have special tax concessions applied to an inter-bank deal in relation to that master project.  There is no reason why details of that project should not be published but, once again, they are at it in terms of tax concessions and tax evasion.  The House is entitled to know what is going on and I intend to pursue the matter until I have unravelled it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> With regard to the construction industry, the Central Bank estimated that there was a decline of 6 per cent in building and construction industry employment in 1987.  During 1988, it is forecast that there will be a further decline in manufacturing employment and that output in the building industry will decline.  In 1987 output was down by 10 per cent and employment was down by 6 per cent.  Yet, we had a stupid decision by the Government to mutilate the public capital programme for 1988.  That will cause a further dramatic decline in activity in the construction industry.  On budget day the provision for infrastructure, which was savagely cut in 1987 to £116 million, was further reduced to £64 million for 1988.  The impact on employment will be of major consequence in 1988.</P>
    <P>The alternative was quite clear-cut. The public capital programme should not have been cut in such a deflationary manner because there are very many viable projects in the pipeline.  For example, many major roads within and between large centres of population are in a deplorable state and are a serious impediment to industrial and economic development.  Secondly, the voluntary redundancy scheme should have been abandoned and I call upon the Government to abandon it now.  We need our nurses, our teachers and our public servants. We already have ample provision for people to retire.  Under the current schemes anybody over the age of 50 can go.  There is no need for a special incentive to persuade people to leave.  The public services redundancy scheme should be abandoned forthwith.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that the public capital programme allocation to the National Development Corporation should be increased.  The amount provided is very small.  If we are to contain during 1988 the situation where we have 120,000 long term unemployed, we need to put money into social employment programmes. There is no reason why £25 million could not have been allocated from ESF moneys for such schemes in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> Despite multiple Government schemes to bring the farming sector into the tax net, farmers now pay less than half the tax in real terms that they paid a decade ago.  By means of blatant political blackmail the IFA have successfully frustrated every reform of farm taxation, from the wealth tax in the mid-seventies to the land tax of the mid-eighties.  In addition, this sector has been in receipt of massive Government and EC subsidies.  It should also be borne in mind that since 1986 many thousands of farming families with children have been paid the enhanced rates of child benefit with no loss of the child tax allowance as in the case of PAYE workers.  In effect, there has been a net additional transfer of child benefit of about £4 million a year direct to the farming community.  The non-taxing of farmers has impeded the full introduction of a taxable child benefit scheme.  In addition, farmers still owe £20 million in unpaid agricultural rates and they owe at least £15 million or £16 million in unpaid health contributions and levies.</P>
    <P>I opposed the Fianna Fáil decision to abolish the land tax and I was horrified at the decision to close down the farm classification office.  We have the scandal of public servants staying at home and being paid not to come to work because they are redundant in the farm classification office.  That has been going on for the past six months.  They do not know what to do with them.  It is incredible but it is a reality.  We are adamant that an effective system of farm taxation must be introduced.  I would have preferred the total abolition of the VAT refund scheme rather than tinkering around with it last year and this year.  It would have brought in additional revenue of £15 million or £16 million if it had been abolished altogether. In 1986-87 the average farmer paid £600 in income tax, while the average PAYE worker paid five times that sum.  Because of Fianna Fáil promises in relation to the land tax, the farming community paid only £34 million income tax in 1987.  This contrasted with £37 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the appalling decisions relating to PRSI for the self-employed <Col N="981" /> and farmers.  I feel very strongly about this issue because for the past decade I have campaigned in Opposition and in Government to bring about this basic reform.  In Government I was responsible for the setting up of the National Pensions Board and for the terms of reference which enabled the board to report on this issue.  I warmly commend the board and in particular their secretary for a most comprehensive and authoritative report.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Taoiseach, against the clear-cut advice of the Minister for Social Welfare, to introduce a rate of 3 per cent of PRSI for the self-employed, less than half the proposed 6.6 per cent, has been rightly described by responsible pension actuaries as an abject capitulation to the IFA.  This Government's decision is a repudiation of the report of the National Pensions Board.  Indeed, I find most disturbing the major lack of any real influence by the ICTU when this decision was being taken.  I know this was done for pure political expediency.  The net effect of this decision is that in ten years time the Exchequer will, in effect, be paying at least 85 per cent of the self-cost of providing pension for the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Our PRSI system is a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system.  At least the 40:60 ratio of personal contribution and Exchequer subsidy should have been maintained at all costs.  Unless the Social Welfare Bill for 1988 provides for the 5 per cent rate by 1990, we will vote against that Bill.  It would be a tragedy to lose the principle of introducing PRSI but I cannot accept that just 3 per cent will appear for 1988 and nothing else for 1989 and 1990.  I further submit that the proposed PRSI rate is unconstitutional.  It is self-evident that it is contrary to natural justice to charge a voluntary contributor 6.6 per cent and a self-employed person 3 per cent for the same social insurance benefits. In short, the Government have sold out on this fundamental issue and have almost destroyed the prospect of a fundamental reform in this area.  However, there is time to change the decision. Many members of the National Pensions <Col N="982" /> Board have greeted this Government decision with dismay.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil Government, uniquely in the history of the State, have extended and reinforced our two-tier system of health care.  In 1987 the Minister for Health closed down 2,325 consultant staffed acute beds in health board and public voluntary hospitals, 334 non-consultant staffed acute beds, 349 geriatric beds and 609 psychiatric beds, a total of 3,617.  In 1988 some 1,500 further beds will close at all levels.  Meanwhile new private and semi-private beds are being installed.  For example in the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin new beds are being installed and they have received planning permission for a new floor.  In St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, the fourth floor is being converted into private and semi-private accommodation.  There is nearly a £4 million new development at the Bons Secours, Cork, all for private facilities. The Brookfield Clinic, Cork, is due to come on stream at a cost of £12 million. We will probably have the privatisation of the Waterford City and County Infirmary and a number of other now closed public hospitals will be converted into private hospitals.</P>
    <P>BUPA, the British United Provident Association, are deeply involved in the Blackrock development and we have another company, Community Hospitals (Irl.) Ltd, actively involved in Galway and now in Waterford.  It is a matter of grave concern that this situation has arisen because there is now an acute shortage of public beds in our public hospital system, The future of the VHI in trying to cope with the great development of private companies in private hospitals is a matter of great concern.  For example, even in major hospitals such as hospital 1 and hospital 7, of St. James' Hospital in Dublin which is a public voluntary federated hospital, they are converting two full public wards into private and semi-private accommodation to try to keep the hospital going.  The reconstruction of that hospital has been almost completed at a cost of anything up to £90 million in public capital moneys and public beds are being snatched out of it <Col N="983" /> at an enormous rate.  The same is happening in relation to the new theatres in the hospital and more and more consultant staff are using these hospitals for private patients.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health are so desperate that they are encouraging the use of private beds in order to get some VHI money into the hospitals, whether it be the Cork Regional Hospital or any other flagship hospital throughout the country. This simply means that medical cardholders and the 40 per cent of the population who are not in the VHI cannot get into hospital for acute emergency treatment and certainly elective work is out of the question because the hospitals are not open for that development.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am greatly concerned about this and I am greatly concerned that within the House there is still a consensus that health care should be allowed to develop into a two-tier system.  Indeed, all I can say is that there are very few Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or senior public servants queueing for public beds.  It is ironic that the VHI which had an increase in charges of 8.2 per cent in 1987 are likely to face another major increase as more and more pressure comes on them within this two-tier health system, which is being introduced. In fact, we have a total absence of, and complete opposition by vested interests to the regulation of hospital development in this country.  It is commonplace in America, Canada and throughout Europe that you cannot open one new bed without statutory approval. Yet in Ireland we have a two-tier system standing on its head.  People are being abused and have no prospect of ordinary effective acute medical care.</P>
    <P>That is why we have demanded that moneys should be reinstated into the public health hospital system because.  I know patients who had to go into a private hospital to have a cardiac by-pass done who got a bill for £11,500 for a three week stay in hospital.  They got £3,000 or £4,000 from the VHI and they had to mortgage their houses for £6,000 or £7,000 to pay off that bill.  That is the <Col N="984" /> kind of health care system which this Government are implementing in our society.  I reject that and I believe we can bring about a far better system.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am pleased that the refund of drugs scheme and the drugs scheme for long term illness have been continued. That is a tribute to the Opposition in this House and the way the labour Party opposed the earlier decision.  I am pleased that the National Social Service Board and the National Rehabilitation Board have not been abolished.  We exposed that issue in this House and we campaigned for it in no uncertain terms. The Opposition parties, and in particular the Labour Party campaigned to have those regressive decisions not implemented by the Government.  With regard to Barrington's Hospital I hope we will see a change in policy here today. Although I am all in favour of rationalising acute hospital beds in many areas, the manner in which this particular episode has been handled is pitiful.  I want to assure the House that the Labour Party opposition to this budget will be spelled out in further detail by our spokespersons in the many other areas, including the decision in relation to social welfare yesterday where 20,000 people suddenly discovered from the Minister's speech that they will not get any increase in social welfare in 1988.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I begin to make my speech it is necessary to reply to a number of points that Deputy Desmond raised.  I have been sitting here and have listened to the entirety of his speech but I feel obliged to answer a number of points in relation to it.  A theme running through Deputy Desmond's speech is that he is against private investment and perhaps that is the reason he is sitting with the Labour Party and I am sitting in the Fianna Fáil benches.  I do not agree with him on this point at all.  I have no problem with private investment and I think it is one of the means by which this country will get back on its feet.  It surprises me to hear the Deputy say that. The Deputy also mentioned that the public capital programme had been cut. <Col N="985" /> Is the Deputy saying that it should not be cut and that we should keep building with State money when in fact there may not be a need to continue with the building programme because, as is quite obvious from our census reports, our population is declining and it may not be necessary in the future to have so many schools, hospitals or whatever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also referred to PRSI and the fact that this Government in the budget did not see fit to do away with PRSI altogether.  The Deputy felt it was unconstitutional.  However, he was a member of Government for four and a half years, and indeed over the past number of years the Coalition were in power more times than Fianna Fáil they did nothing to abolish the PRSI system. I feel the PRSI system is working well, there may be areas where it needs to be tidied up, but by and large it is working well.</P>
      <P>With regard to voluntary redundancies Deputy Desmond made the point that anyone can take voluntary redundancy. That is not my understanding of it.  I understand that the person would have to get the approval of the relevant Minister and would then have to go for the approval of the Minister for Finance.  For instance, in local authorities when somebody applies for the voluntary redundancy package such as a worker on the road, he has to get the approval of the county manager first.  The county manager may feel that he cannot let him go and so he will not be put forward for the redundancy scheme.  Therefore to say that anyone can take the redundancy package is not entirely correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to hospital charges and various other items that were brought in by Fianna Fáil which he said were to the detriment of the lower paid workers.  He was a member of a Government which did away entirely with food subsidies.  Can he justify that?  The Deputy also mentioned the recent good report on the budget, in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the following day and the report by the two gentlemen on unemployment and growth in the economy.  Although they did say that there would be no growth in <Col N="986" /> the economy this year, they said that if the Government kept on the path they were taking there would definitely be growth in the coming years.  That is the only way that we as a nation will be able to provide work for our people.  By getting this economy down lean, with no fat, we will get jobs for our people and hopefully stop the emigration trail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the claims made by the chairman of the environmental health officers' association (details supplied) that up to 50 per cent of rural water supplies are significantly contaminated by agricultural wastes and that many group water schemes are not monitored for contamination; the measures, if any, he intends to take to improve the quality of rural water supplies and to ensure that water supplies are properly monitored; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of these claims, which related to wells and small group water supply schemes, but I have not seen any evidence to support them.  To place the percentage referred to in context, less than 20 per cent of the national population is served by private or by group water supplies, and at least 60 per cent of the group supplies have a public mains supply as their source.  Monitoring of water supplies is the responsibility of sanitary authorities, and their powers and duties in this regard are set out in existing sanitary services legislation and in EEC Directive 80/778/EEC of 15 July 1980 <Col N="987" /> relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption.  I will shortly be making regulations to give full effect to the provisions of this directive in Irish law.  In addition, the package of measures I announced last autumn to tackle water pollution includes the carrying out of surveys of farms by local task forces, increased attention to educational and awareness aspects of pollution prevention and the strengthening of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  I expect that these measures will result in a significant improvement in water quality which will benefit all users of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that as there is a percentage of cases where there is a clear danger to health and a need to improve the quality, local authorities should get special funding for monitoring the water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All water supplies are subject to chemical and bacteriological testing before the supply schemes are approved and before grants are paid initially.  If there is a deterioration subsequent to that for any reason or if deficiencies arise, groups can and do apply to the Department for grant assistance and it is being granted.  They can either improve the existing supply or get an alternative source, but all precautions are taken both initially and following further monitoring of the supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider establishing some sort of national water authority to carry out this work? As An Foras Forbartha did a great deal of the monitoring, reporting and recommending, who will do this work now that they no longer exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The same people who did it for the last number of years.  The regional laboratories carried out that function for An Foras Forbartha and that is not being changed.  The same regional authorities and the same type of monitoring will continue.  While the regulations have not <Col N="988" /> been made to date, the directive has been implemented administratively. That is in place and I see no reason that we should not continue with the system that has already proved effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of some canvassers in the vicinity of polling stations can in some instances give rise to concern. Apart from possible inconvenience to electors, over-zealous canvassing of this kind is clearly counter productive from the point of view of candidates and their parties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the uncertain political situation at present, will the Minister give urgent consideration to the new measures he proposes to bring forward? He would know as well as I that the scene outside some polling booths, particularly in urban areas late in the evening, is most unseemly.  Indeed, voters are well-nigh intimidated in getting in to vote.  This should be ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some representations have been made in that regard in recent times, not because of the proximity of an election but because of the inconvenience it has caused, particularly in the large built up areas.  It is interesting to note that returning officers are authorised to employ a supervisory presiding officer if there are more than four polling stations in the one building and it is part of the duty of that supervisory presiding officer to see to it that electors are not subjected to undue pressure or harassment by the agents or their canvassers.  Of course, <Col N="989" /> prevention of the obstruction is a matter for the Garda, but I recognise what the Deputy is referring to.  It leads to some concern in certain areas.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the main problem occurs at the larger polling stations where election workers tend to congregate because large numbers of electors converge at that point?  Would he consider perhaps the idea of having many more polling stations in urban areas which would on the one hand be more convenient for electors and would reduce the large numbers attending in any one polling station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would.  I think it unsatisfactory to have a large number of polling stations in the one building particularly when they sometimes refer to two or three different constituencies. I suppose we will never get away from last minute canvassing on the doorstep, particularly when it is outside the curtilage of the polling booths.  However, I think there is something in what the Deputy says and I will endeavour to see to it that we alter that as it applies to the larger polling stations here in the city.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the third instalment of a mortgage subsidy for a person (details supplied) in County Meath due to be paid in December 1987 has not yet been paid; that the person was informed that it would take 16 weeks for it to be paid even though it was in order for payment; that the first and second instalments were paid in 1985 and 1986 respectively on time before the end of December of the year in question; and the reason for such an exceptional unprecedented delay in respect of the payment of the third instalment.</P>

Is he claiming at this stage that this grant was not in course of payment?  If he is not so claiming, why was it not paid, in accordance with the answer he gave yesterday, before 31 December?  Was the delay into January in fact an attempt to massage the budget figures and is this case just one of many for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not because the amount of money allowed for the purpose of mortgage subsidy payment has increased substantially.  It was £20.91 million in 1985, £21.66 million in 1986 and in 1987 we expended £25.5 million so there has been no reduction or curtailment in the amount of money being provided to meet the demand under that system.  I do not think &mdash; and I am sure the Deputy will agree with me &mdash; that having submitted application for payment for such a subsidy in mid-November and being paid by mid-January is unreasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

The Deputy would have a good point if there had been some reduction in the amount of money that had been allocated for the payments <Col N="992" /> last year or if the total that had been allocated in the Estimate had not been increased by me by some £3 million at the end of the year.  In all the circumstances &mdash; the increased amount of money that was made available for the payment of the subsidy last year and the fact that there were only a few weeks between receipt of the application and payment &mdash; I do not think the Deputy should pursue the matter too far.</P>

      <P>The overall environmental regime for Moneypoint station is that established under the conditions of the planning permission granted by Clare County Council in 1979.  These conditions include requirements as to emission control and related monitoring, which have so far been met.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and there is very close monitoring of this plant going on and it is proper that there should be.  There is a network of 11 stations within County Clare monitoring emissions from Moneypoint. There are five ESB stations in <Col N="994" /> County Kerry and County Limerick monitoring the same station and one station in the Slieve Bloom mountains determining the long range effects.  A considerable amount of money of a capital nature had been put in for the cleaning of the flue gases at the time of the installation which cost £25 million and I am satisfied that they are well within the targets set for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are running from a very low base and that gives us less clout in the European sense in that they already have a very high emission rate and our emissions are much lower and, in establishing what the base will be for the future, ours will be allowed to rise substantially whereas theirs will be decreased.  This is unsatisfactory to a degree but at the same time we are very low in so far as emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen are concerned.  It is important &mdash; and the thrust of the question bears this out &mdash; that we should closely monitor everything that comes from Moneypoint and from other stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the wrong figures are promoted there is, of course, cause for concern but that is not the figure.  The estimated emissions of sulphur dioxide from Moneypoint stood at 12,000 tonnes in 1986 and the total emissions from all plants throughout the country was 91,000 tonnes.

As the Deputy knows, we will have an overall annual limit of about 124,000 tonnes placed on us following the arrangements within the EC.  As I stated, that is a fairly big increase for us but, of course, it is a huge reduction when compared to what European countries have to reduce their emissions by.</P>

Will the Minister indicate whether the provisions of the Air Pollution Act will ensure that the emissions from that new plant will meet the target of 30 per cent which is the objective of most of the European countries, and will he further indicate what steps the Goverment intend to take in relation to the emissions from the existing plant?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right that the emissions control will apply to the certificate and licence attached to the new plant under Part III of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, but that is only initially. They will apply to all plants new or old after that.  I am satisfied that the arrangements are in place so that we can have accepted international standards.

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="998" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The parking of vehicles generally on public roads is subject to various prohibitions and restrictions imposed directly by the Road Traffic Acts, by general road traffic regulations (i.e. the general rules of the road) made by me under those Acts and by local traffic and parking by-laws or temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent under these Acts.</P>
      <P>Included in these controls is the power to remove vehicles which are either left on a public road in such a position as to cause danger or to obstruct traffic or are abandoned.  All local traffic and parking by-laws in force at present include a requirement that a container such as a refuse skip cannot be left on a roadway or on a footway during lighting up hours unless it is so lighted as to be clearly visible and does not cause danger to road users on a clearway during clearway hours.  The enforcement of the Acts and of regulations, by-laws or temporary rules made under them is a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>While existing parking controls provided under the Road Traffic Acts apply to all categories of vehicles, the question of the introduction of special measures to deal with the parking of large vehicles is at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>I understand that a survey of the extent of parking by large vehicles carried out by Dublin Corporation, with the assistance of the gardaí, is nearing completion. A report on the survey indicating,<i>inter alia</i>, alternative parking facilities which may be made available for the use of large vehicles will be prepared by the corporation in the near future.  Proposals are being developed by the Garda in consultation with the corporation with a view to the introduction of appropriate controls in Dublin on a pilot basis (by way of temporary rules made by the Garda Commissioner with my consent).  The extension of such controls to the country as a whole would be considered in the light of the Dublin pilot scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the reason these conditions were introduced was to avoid the widespread abuse by black economy operators in the construction industry?  Is the Minister saying that having gone to some lengths to eliminate this kind of abuse, the Department do not have the statistics available to monitor whether the new system has been effective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in that one of the reasons for bringing this in was to frustrate those working in the black economy.  It has had the desired result. The number the Deputy is talking about <Col N="1000" /> is very small.  It has never been the practice to segregate the rejected applications on the basis of the grounds for rejection. Those who apply recognise that they have to have a registered contractor with a VAT number and so on, before one gets approval and before one gets payment following the certification of the job completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the basis upon which this new grants system was introduced, the information I sought in my question should be available.  I understood the Minister to say that the information was not available because records were not kept.  Surely it would be useful to know what number of people attempted to get through the net and to have work done with contractors who are not registered?  The Minister, as a public representative, was aware of various kinds of abuses that took place and of various loopholes that were there in the application for these grants.  Does the Minister not think it is a matter of concern, having regard to the fact that the Government have eliminated most of those grants on grounds of cost, to have a better system of monitoring which might enable us to retain some of the grants which have been abolished?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of 140,000 applications, 123,800 were approved.  As the Deputy knows, it is part and parcel of the application that one had a registered contractor and gave all the details, etc. Subsequently once one claimed payment the registered contractor had to give the VAT number and all that goes with it before the money was issued.

Between the original approval and the final certificate, including payment of the cheque, what was the fallout? did our system of looking for tax clearance work?  Do the Department have statistics to bear that out?  The Minister's initial reply was to the effect that he does not have statistics on the second part, when payment would have been made.

It is in the context of various grants which the Minister's Government have brought in for other aspects of the distribution of taxpayers' money.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going to get the same assurance now.  The House will have the Homeless Persons Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The two things come together; the Deputy is quite right.  The money was necessary, as were the definitions. There was also an adjustment which I wished to make in so far as aid to voluntary bodies was concerned, in that up to now they have had to put up 20 per cent of the capital cost which they found difficult to make provision for regarding special accommodation for homeless persons.  I have increased the Government's contribution from 80 per cent to 95 per cent of the cost of the new accommodation.  There are some other changes also.  I was anxious to get that in place and to have money afforded to it which would make it possible to do something positive rather than just talk about it.  It is very interesting that somebody who has a very great knowledge in this matter &mdash; and I should not name names here &mdash; a Sister whom we all know well, did state in January of this year that if the day ever came when there was a Minister for the Environment who had the courage to provide £1 million per year to deal with the homeless the problem would be solved.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy would like existing projects or those in course of construction to be considered favourably.  That is a fair point.  I did take the opportunity, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, as indicated by the Minister for Finance, of giving £50,000 to Arran Quay for the Focus Point project there, as an indication of the kind of project that should be supported.  I agree that there are very many voluntary organisations which are anxious to get money and they are not going to be denied it.</P>

I do not want the Deputy to have to be asking for the tenth time, if it is the tenth time.  He can be assured that my commitment to introduce legislation is no less strong.  In fact, now I feel somewhat more confident of getting an easier passage of the Bill because I have given some money to deal with the total package.</P>

      <P>Those who are on the ground dealing with this matter say that this is the first break-through effort of a really positive nature and we go along with it except in so far as this city is concerned, where the biggest problem for the homeless exists.  There is another interesting point in so far as the question of the kind of accommodation is concerned. Perhaps that is what Deputy De Rossa was referring to.  The accommodation does not necessarily have to be fully self-contained.  There will be a possibility for funding voluntary organisations which offer hostel type accommodation. That is positive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the severely restricted capital budget for housing in 1988, he will give greater flexibility to local authorities to purchase good value second-hand housing for reletting, for example in Dublin's inner suburbs, where in addition to housing more families for the same cash allocation, those families can be offered a greater choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing authorities may submit proposals for the purchase of new or second-hand private houses where such proposals offer value for money, where established housing needs exist and, where it is not possible for the housing authority to provide suitable accommodation more economically within a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>The initiation of proposals for the purchase of private houses is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance.  Any such proposals submitted to my Department are considered on their merits, having regard to the capital available for the housing construction programme and the housing needs of local authorities generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each housing authority has been asked to submit its capital claim for its local authority housing construction programme in 1988.  Pending receipt and examination of these claims, it is not possible to indicate what funds will be <Col N="1007" /> made available to the individual authorities to finance their housing programmes and consequently what new proposals may be approved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the degree of flexibility which the Minister is now offering, may I ask if he would confirm whether all the housing authorities have, in fact, submitted their applications for the programme for 1988?  Could the Minister indicate when he will be in a position to announce the housing programme for 1988?  He must be aware that many schemes have now been held up for six to eight months and the local authorities are waiting for the go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes they are, but they have not all made their submissions.  I wish they would so that we could get on with the business.  I do not have a list of the counties which have not yet made their submissions and therefore nobody should ask me to name them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>Will the Minister include a facility for local authorities to buy into stock houses which they are obliged to repossess because householders have been unable to maintain their repayments under the HFA loans? In the Dublin city area the local authority are repossessing approximately 20 houses a year and they are being sold for a pittance &mdash; £12,000, £13,000 or £14,000. These houses could be used to rehouse people on the corporation housing list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something one could consider, but there is a continuing high vacancy rate in the city.  At the last count, before Christmas, about 700 dwellings were vacant and 160 of them were in the inner city area.  I note the point the Deputy is making but it is very hard to authorise the buying of secondhand, even new, houses in areas where we already have housing stock surplus to our requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that Dublin Corporation <Col N="1008" /> will not be building any houses this year and that there is no sign the housing list will be any smaller next year than it is this year?  Would he agree that it would make economic sense from the Government's point of view that these houses be taken into stock by the local authorities? Would he not also agree that the vast majority of the 700 dwellings in the Dublin area are not in a habitable condition to be relet?</P>

      <P>There is an element of repetition now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how many of the housing stock in the hands of the local authority are unfit for human habitation. The facility mentioned by the Deputy to purchase new or secondhand houses in addition to their rented stock has been available to the housing authority since 1984 but certain conditions had to be satisfied.  This facility is there to be utilised.  I have no hang up about allowing local authorities to do that if there is a need for it, but it does not seem to be the thing to do if the authority already have houses in their possession which could be refurbished and relet.  In one breath we are talking about the homeless and in another we talk about hundreds of houses available for reletting but nobody living in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to houses which are repossessed by Dublin Corporation or any other local authority, and following Deputy De Rossa's supplementary question, would the Minister not agree there is something contradictory when an existing tenant exercising his option to buy a house would have to pay £18,000 to £20,000 for that house but if it is repossessed and put on the open market, it can fetch something of the order of £13,000 or £14,000.  This clearly is an inefficient use of public capital moneys.  In the specific instances to which Deputy De Rossa referred it makes good housekeeping sense that the local authority should obtain from the Department permission to acquire that house through the capital <Col N="1009" /> budget and not put it on the open market at a giveaway price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point in that and I might consider it further.  The Deputy might raise it after I announce the details of my new tenant purchase scheme in the next couple of weeks.  I recognise there is a problem to be tackled here as far as the market price of existing housing stock is concerned, getting value for money and trying to keep the social mix right by making houses available.  I am going to try and do something special in that regard.  If the scheme is working well we might take this up again and I would not be unfavourably disposed to doing something.  I would like to get the matter settled once and for all as far as the housing stock is concerned and to make the best use of our existing housing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to his replies to the previous question and his surprise expressed in relation to the large number of vacant dwellings in the Dublin Corporation area, would the Minister not consider diverting some of the £3 million to that authority to put back into occupational condition some of those dwellings so that he could make a much bigger dent in the problem of homelessness than currently is the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>Before the Minister makes a final decision on the housing programme for Dublin and elsewhere, may I ask him to examine what exactly is involved in those 700 vacancies?  He referred to 160 houses in the Dublin inner city.  There are many vacant substandard uninhabitable flats in Dublin's inner city but there is a great need for houses in this area.  I would ask the Minister to examine precisely what is involved in those statistics because when he examines them, he will see there is a great need for habitable houses in the centre of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am empowered under section 19 of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, to make regulations for the use and control of dogs and, specifically, for regulating the <Col N="1013" /> use of guard dogs in the course of business. Recent incidents have pointed to the need to consider activating this section of the Act by bringing in controls which would take account of public health and safety considerations and other relevant issues such as the question of animal welfare.  I am, therefore, setting up a working party to advise me in this regard.  I propose that the working party, who are to report within four months, will comprise representatives of the official bodies involved in dog control, including the Departments of the Environment and Justice, the Garda and the local authorities, as well as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  In view of the recent serious incidents involving escaped guard dogs when the Garda and authorities complained that they had great difficulty in tracing the owners, will the Minister ensure that one of the issues considered by the working party will be that identity tags should be required for all guard dogs to avoid any such confusion in the future?</P>

      <P>Letters inviting participation in the working group have already issued and, within four months from the date of the response, I expect the report.  The Control of Dogs Act, 1986, came into operation early in 1987 but it has not been implemented in all areas.  I asked local authorities early in January to give me returns regarding the position in their own areas on 31 December 1987.  We will have to find a more effective way of implementing the legislation because there are 700,000 dogs in the country and I suppose about one-third of them are licensed.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 16, 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Last week's Budget Statement announced that £250,000 would be made available in 1988 for a scheme of financial assistance towards the cost of smoke control measures in the Dublin area.  I am urgently drawing up details of this scheme and will announce them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have already overseen the prompt enactment of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 which provides a comprehensive legislative framework for controlling air pollution. Local authorities have been issued with detailed advice regarding their powers under the new Act.  In addition, I have made regulations prescribing air quality standards for smoke, sulphur dioxide, lead and nitrogen dioxide and I have formally designated monitoring stations and arrangements in Dublin and other areas.</P>
      <P>There are no official statistics for coal consumption in the Dublin area only. However, coal sales in Dublin are estimated to have peaked some years ago at just below 400,000 tonnes and to have decreased somewhat since then.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has something in mind in relation to this problem because when I raised the matter during the last smog in the city the Government did not seem to realise that people were suffering.  The amount of money allocated in this year's budget will do little or nothing in relation to the programme.  Will the Minister subsidise the purchase of smokeless fuel by consumers in the city?  Is it his intention to divide the city into zones and to start on a working basis so that we can, over a period of time, reduce pollution and eliminate it, if possible.</P>

      <P>I said that Ballyfermot would probably be the first area because a survey has just been completed there of nearly 900 houses.  The area experienced the worst effects over the years.  Because of the formula that has to be gone through in establishing a control order, it will take some little time and that is why the amount of money allocated this year will be enough to satisfy the demands.  Dublin City Council have to make the order first; there will then be an oral hearing to see if there are any objections to the order. I will have to consider the inspector's report on the oral hearing and, after that, a special control area order will come into force.  However, it cannot come into force for at least six months after that matter has been disposed of.  To comply with the Air Pollution Act, 1987, will take a little while, even with the best will in the world.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the money allocated is enough to deal with the problem this year.  We will have to have a campaign in so far as conversion to natural gas is concerned and advocate the use of smokeless fuels. There will also have to be a grant scheme <Col N="1017" /> to deal with appliances which will have to be converted.  It should not be confined to just one appliance.  I should like to think that a whole range of options will be supported and I will keep in mind what Deputy Spring said in that regard.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if he would confirm that Ballyfermot is the only area in Dublin which has consistently shown a very high level of pollution, something like four or five times the EC standard?  Could he also confirm that in December 1987 12 of the 13 monitoring stations in the Dublin area showed four to five times the EC level?  Can he indicate in what way specifically he sees that this problem can be dealt with? Would he consider giving grants of one kind or another to assist people to switch to electric heating or gas central heating or indeed gas fires which are smoke free or smokeless fuel which would avoid the necessity of importing solid smokeless fuels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The December smog in Dublin taken in isolation, did not reach the EC air quality standard.  I agree with the Deputy that Ballyfermot is a particular problem and it has exceeded the limits under the directive on a number of occasions.  It would seem to be the area to which we would give our first attention and that is the reason the pilot survey of the 900 houses was undertaken.  I would not like anybody to get the idea that the grants system would be by way of betterment of present housing conditions. It would have to encompass all suitable appliances whether gas or solid fuel.  There has been some misleading media coverage about supporting one type of fire box in the recent past.  That <Col N="1018" /> is not my intention.  I would like to think it would cover the whole range so that people would have options and make the best use of the grant available to them depending on their personal circumstances. We are a little bit down the road now because the Dublin City Council will have to make the order and that oral hearing will take some time but I am pressing them.  There was much media comment: &ldquo;What was the point in Dublin Corporation going ahead when there was nothing to meet it by way of back-up or State support&rdquo;?  I was anxious to get the State support in place.  They can go ahead and do it now.  I am asking them as a matter of urgency to get about the business and let us have before the next winter period comes in some control area established where we can do something positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has satisfied himself regarding the standard of work in installing electrical wiring and fitting in new houses; the inspection procedures involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's Memorandum on Procedures to be followed and standards to be applied in providing local authority dwellings stipulates that electrical installations should be in accordance with the &ldquo;National Rules for Electrical Installations&rdquo; of the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland.  A similar stipulation is incorporated in the Department's outline specification for the erection of a grant type house.  I also understand that the ESB will not supply current to a premises unless a certificate <Col N="1019" /> of completion is provided showing that the electrical installations meet the standards set by the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland.  I am satisfied, therefore, that there are adequate arrangements to ensure a satisfactory standard of work in installing electrical wiring and fittings in new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first two items which the Minister referred to &mdash; his Department's Memorandum for guidance purposes and the regulations in relation to new house standards &mdash; would he not agree that the only inspections that are carried out in new houses in those cases are by planning inspectors who have no qualifications whatsoever in the matter of electrical wiring or safety?  In relation to the third matter to which the Minister referred &mdash; the connection by the ESB of supply to new houses &mdash; would he indicate who would prepare the certificate to the effect that the house has been wired to a satisfactory standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the likelihood is that those who are carrying out inspections on behalf of my Department would have no expertise, or very little expertise, in so far as wiring installations are concerned. That was the whole idea of the procedures where the ESB &mdash; and they are the people who are responsible in this matter &mdash; would not allow a house to be lit up or fused until such time as they had an acceptable certificate from a qualified person.  I understand that they are quite stringent about that now.  In the past a lot of sloppy work was done but the ESB will not now give a new supply unless that certificate is furnished to them and unless they are satisfied, when they go out to instal supply to the house, that the installation is up to the mark.  It is well organised at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is not.  Is the Minister not aware that the certificate to which he refers, which must be supplied to the ESB, is to be &mdash; in his words &mdash; prepared and signed by a &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; but there is no definition as to <Col N="1020" /> who a &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo; is?  Is the Minister further aware that the association of electrical contractors in Ireland recently made a submission to him suggesting that there should be a standards authority and that qualified people should be registered with that authority and that certificates would be acceptable only from people who were registered?  In a recent written reply he indicated that he is not prepared to set up such an authority.  In those circumstances, I suggest that the Minister might consider having discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Energy, with a view to seeing whether the ESB, with the expertise which obviously exists within that organisation, might be invited to become the standards authority and that the certificate, rather than being presented to the ESB would be prepared by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what the Deputy is referring to is the question of a register of electrical contractors, which I am opposed to in the first instance.  I would like to think that the industry would regulate itself in that regard.  It was suggested to the associations who were asking for such a register to be set up in 1985, that the industry itself should consider establishing a register of electrical contractors and that they should seek the support of the ESB so far as participation in the formulation of such a register was concerned.  That is the last that was heard about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to set up a register in that regard.  On a voluntary basis the industry themselves could do that very effectively.  I am satisfied that the ESB, who are the competent authority &mdash; I am really answering on behalf of my colleague &mdash; are satisfied that the electrical installations in new houses are very closely watched by the ESB and that the certificate of competence for a new supply comes from established, recognised, qualified electrical people.  On occasions they have refused to give supply where they were not satisfied with the level of competence. It seems to me that there is no need for a register of contractors in this <Col N="1021" /> instance and it also seems that once the ESB are satisfied in this regard the matter should rest there.</P>

May I ask that the Minister would have his Department, in conjunction with the Department of Energy and the ESB, examine this entire matter, which is extremely important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 44 and Question No. 41 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the incident referred to, which occurred on 12 June 1980, was dealt with initially by the company concerned but that the measures taken were not sufficient to prevent the entry of the substance containing PCBs to the river Breagagh.  Once informed of the incident, the local authorities required the company to remove accumulations of the substance from the bed of the Breagagh, to replace contaminated drains from the company's premises to the river, to excavate a channel across the river in an effort to collect any remaining quantities of the substance, and to arrange for the safe removal and disposal of the recovered material abroad.  In line with their responsibilities for environmental matters, the local authorities have continued to have sediments from the river bed monitored and to pursue investigations to establish that there are no residues of the substance which could still affect the river.  I am satisfied that any action necessary as a result of these investigations will be taken promptly by the local authorities in so far as the matter comes within their area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any public health aspects of the incident or any question of a prohibition on the taking of fish from the affected waters is, however, a matter for the health and fishery authorities.  I am informed that these authorities have been actively involved in relation to these aspects and <Col N="1023" /> are at present considering what measures, if any, may be appropriate in the light of the monitoring of fish which has been carried out by the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>What I find most disturbing about this is that the people in County Kilkenny were never made fully aware or even warned about the effects of this extremely toxic chemical.  Can the Minister tell us whether there is any acceptable limit of this chemical and whether there will be any adverse effects if people were to eat fish caught in this stretch of the Nore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the question is really a health matter.  As I understand it, there are no generally accepted international standards in regard to the danger level of polychlorinated biphenyl. I must be very careful here because I am answering a question in regard to a health matter but I understand there is no danger in so far as eating fish from that particular stretch of the river is concerned, which is a very short stretch of river as the Deputy is aware.  I think the Deputy will accept that an enormous amount of work was put into cleaning up the river at that time.  Excavations were carried out and much of the waste was exported for incineration.  I understand that this chemical is persistent and it has to be continually monitored and such monitoring has been going on in recent times.  The minute quantities which remain will be removed.  Options are being considered as to how best to deal with both the fish element and the residue which may still be there in the affected areas.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is quite right to say that this is a very persistent chemical. Once it gets into the fatty substances of fish it accelerates and that is why we are back to this situation again.  As this chemical is insolvent in water it can regenerate itself.  Consequently, we will have to keep doing it until such time as it has been finally cleared.  Quite an amount of effort has been but into trying to get to the level of satisfaction which both the Deputy and I desire to achieve.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment there were a number of points I wished to make in regard to the differences in the attitudes adopted by Deputy Desmond and myself and the Fianna Fáil Party.  This budget continues the budgetary policy which was adopted by Fianna Fáil prior to coming into Government.  Before the last election we said that we would stabilise the national debt and the GNP ratio.  The figures before the House show that, in fact, we have gone a long way toward achieving that and to getting this economy back into shape.  Most commentators agree that this and the last budget have had that result.  Before the adjournment I referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Bradley referred to the fact that while growth may not manifest itself this year undoubtedly in 1989 and in successive years there will be growth and the possibility of extra jobs being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came into power they basically had two alternatives. First, they could have increased taxation or, secondly, they could have reduced spending.  All of us in this House <Col N="1059" /> will agree that the option of increasing taxation was just not on because by all accounts we are one of the most overtaxed countries in the world.  Therefore, we had to reduce spending.  The reality is that with 250,000 people unemployed the amount of income coming into the State is reducing all of the time and the amount of expenditure is increasing all of the time.  We are and have been living beyond our means.  I would say that the cuts in the last two budgets have had the effect of taking a lot of the fat and unnecessary spending out of our economy.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election various commentators laughed at the fact that Fianna Fáil had said they would reduce spending, that that was the only promise they were going to make, that they would get the economy going again by restoring confidence. However, confidence has been restored and all commentators agree on that.  The Minister for the Environment told us that the representatives of the CII at a meeting he had with them were bullish about the prospects for the economy. Business people I have met have expressed similar sentiments.  The fact is that interest rates have reduced by 5 per cent.  We hear a lot about the need for tax equity and concessions for the PAYE sector but before the budget, as a result of Government policies, interest rates had been reduced by 5 per cent and that meant a big saving to mortgage holders. They must be aware by now that their mortgages are costing them a lot less than they did in 1986.</P>
    <P>Industrial output last year increased by approximately 10 per cent and that came about because of the confidence of the business community in the actions of the Government.  They are prepared to invest their money.  Those people were reluctant to invest their money under the last administration because they did not see any prospect of getting a return from that investment.  Our monthly trade figures have been the best for 30 years and that has helped to instil confidence in the economy.  The black hole in the economy has been eliminated.  The decision to allow people to repatriate money from <Col N="1060" /> abroad will also be to the advantage of the economy.  It is pleasing to note that, unlike in previous years, vast sums of money are not leaving for investment abroad.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister of Finance to introduce the 48-hour rule in regard to goods purchased outside the country has helped business people in Border areas. Being from a Border constituency I could not help laughing when I heard Opposition Deputies say that it did not prove of any benefit to businesses along the Border.  Dundalk, my home town, which is in what is called the frontier zone, has benefited from that decision.  Very few people who live along the Border travel to the North of Ireland on shopping expeditions and we do not have coaches from Dublin, Cork and other parts of the country passing through going to Newry.</P>
    <P>Inflation has been reduced drastically mainly as a result of the actions of the Government in recent months.  On taking office the Government identified a number of areas for development such as the marine, horticulture and so on. Resources have been made available by the Government to develop those sectors of the economy and that is to be welcomed. We hear a lot about personal taxation and the need for justice and equity in the system.  The Government have made a great effort in the budget to introduce equity.  Nobody can accuse the Government of not moving on the taxation front.  Following the PAYE march in the early eighties there was a lot of talk about the need for change but there was little action.  The day when people can throw requests from the Revenue Commissioners for tax returns into a wastepaper basket has gone, and rightly so. People now realise that if they owe tax they must pay it.  Concessions, totalling £91 million, have been made by the Government to taxpayers.  There has been an increase in tax free allowances and a widening of the various bands, as we promised during the election campaign. It is our intention to bring two-thirds of those on PAYE into the 35 per cent band.  As a result of the measures in the budget 93,000 people will drop to the <Col N="1061" /> 35 per cent band while the widening of the 48 per cent band will mean that a further 55,000 people will pay at that rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond harangued the Fianna Fáil party for our attitude to the building industry.  I do not accept his criticism because the measures we have taken have helped to revitalise an industry that has been in a bad state for many years. The decision not to change the mortgage interest relief will also help the building industry.  I have no doubt that the decision to reintroduce the section 23 relief for a further three years will result in greater activity in building industry in Dublin.  I hope the decision will encourage developers outside the Pale to avail of that concession.  The decision of the Minister for Finance to introduce a 5 per cent rate of stamp duty on property valued at between £50,000 and £60,000, resulting in a saving of between £500 and £600 per transaction, has been glossed over my many commentators.  I welcome that decision which will benefit those buying upmarket.</P>
    <P>The yield from corporation tax up to now has been low and I agree with the commentators who stated that the various State incentives favour companies buying plant and machinery rather than taking on labour.  I am pleased that the Minister will be having a look at that. The reduction in the capital allowances in the budget will prove beneficial and we could go a little further down that road. Companies will buy plant and machinery, irrespective of the incentives, and we must try to encourage them to create more jobs.  The decision to increase capital allowances and running expenses in relation to motor vehicles should help the beleaguered motor trade.</P>
    <P>The special incentive to help people bring their tax affairs up to date is close to my heart because I have received representations from many people who have received very large tax bills.  Quite recently a man came to me late one Sunday night.  He was nearly in tears because he owed £40,000 to the Revenue Commissioners.  I understood this debt had accumulated between 1975 and 1979 <Col N="1062" /> and that most of it was comprised of interest.  He admitted that he owed the principal but claimed he was not in a position to pay this money.</P>
    <P>The recent changes in collection and the appointment of new sheriffs in various areas has had an effect. Some people are critical but I consider the system to be reasonably good.  In some instances the sheriffs may have been too intent on taking goods rather than giving people a chance to come up with the money.  Once a warrant has been sent to the sheriff it seems the Revenue Commissioners will not make any deal or come to an arrangement whereby money can be paid by instalments.  The Minister should look at the inflexibility of the system.  The sheriff may not be interested in taking the job if he knows that a person can go to a politician who might be able to make an arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Employers often make the point that they have to collect tax for the Government and that they get no allowance for carrying out this time-consuming task. That point was made at a meeting I attended recently.  If they get into arrears the Revenue Commissioners come down on them like a ton of bricks.</P>
    <P>Self-assessment will mean quicker processing and result in fewer appeals.  There will also be an increased flow of revenue to the State coffers.  At present the system is overburdened with tax appeals.  It is a two-fault process.  The Revenue Commissioners send out assessments which bear no resemblance to reality; this means a person must appeal, thus clogging up the system.  It must also be said that many people have hitherto thrown the assessment into the wastepaper basket hoping it would go away.  The tax demand was always last on the list of priorities.</P>
    <P>The power of attachment is similar to the law of garnishment.  A number of commentators have said there may be constitutional problems relating to the power of attachment, that the power of the Revenue Commissioners may be excessive.  It should be obligatory on the <Col N="1063" /> Revenue Commissioners to go to court and apply for an order for attachment, as in the case of the law of garnishment.</P>
    <P>I was pleasantly surprised that the Minister for Finance was in a position to increase social welfare payments.  This is an area where Deputy Desmond and others on the opposite side of the House often accuse us of being Thatcherite and monetarist.  That accusation has been disproved. This has been shown to be a caring Government.  An effort will always be made by a Fianna Fáil Government to alleviate the problems of the lower paid to the extent that the budgetary situation allows.  An extra £45 million is being provided in 1988 for increases which will come into effect in July.  The overall budget in 1988 is £2.6 billion, a massive sum.  The scope for increasing it is very limited but generally the Minister has seen fit to increase social welfare benefits by 3 per cent.  The caring attitude of the Government is shown by the increase of 11 per cent for the long-term unemployed. The alleviating payments introduced by the previous Government to deflect the brunt of the equality legislation are to be continued.  If these payments were to be discontinued there would be horrendous consequences for over 20,000 families.  Once again the accusation that this is an uncaring Government has been disproved.</P>
    <P>All parties on all sides of the House would agree that the extension of PRSI to the self-employed and farmers is a laudable idea.  These people will be entitled to old age, widows or orphans pensions.  Less well off self-employed people have had to try to make ends meet by keeping their business going.  The alternative was to apply for a non-contributory pension.  The extension of the PRSI scheme will mean that they will have stability and security at the end of their days.  People have quibbled about the percentage to be paid but I believe a 5 per cent imposition to be very fair.  It will recompense the State for the pensions being paid.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that self-employed people over the age of 55 may <Col N="1064" /> have to contribute to the persion fund although they may not be in a position to obtain the pension when they retire. Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond complimented the Government on the reintroduction of the drugs refund and long-term illness scheme.  I have had many representations regarding disabled drivers.  There appears to have been a change in the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners towards the rebates to which disabled drivers are entitled.  It seems that during the past few months it has become necessary to fill in a more detailed form and they felt this was trying to reduce the number of people who would get this facility.  The announcement was made by the Minister in the budget of an extra £2.8 million to the health boards so that they could administer a mobility allowance and it remains to be seen how this will be administered.  I hope proper consultation will take place with the various groups involved.  Obviously we have to help people who are disabled.  I think this Government have always shown in the past their caring attitude to this section.</P>
    <P>Coming from a Border constituency I would have liked to see no increase in the excise duty on petrol.  I would be living in cloud-cuckoo land if I were to say the opposite.  Obviously we have to be reasonable and take the rough with the smooth: a budget cannot be all give and no take.  The increase of 8p in the price of petrol must be set against the background of a reduction of 21 per cent in the price of petrol over the past ten or 11 months more or less because of Government action.  The point had been made earlier in the debate that this increase was made when the price of petrol is on the decrease whereas when the previous administration increased the price by 8 per cent they did so at a time when there was a trend of increasing prices for petrol.  That is the difference between then and now.  It surprises me to see people coming in here and crying about the 8p increase in the price of petrol when they did not come into the Chamber and vote against it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> In his speech the Minister mentioned the decentralisation programme and he referred to my home town of Dundalk as one of the places where decentralisation will take place in the near future.  This is great news for my home town because allied to the recent inclusion of Dundalk in the urban renewal package it leaves a tremendous potential for Dundalk town centre to be revitalised.  Anyone who knows Dundalk would agree that over the past four or five years it has been devastated.  As I said earlier, these announcements coupled with the 48-hour rule and various other proposals for the Dundalk area show that Dundalk has done very well since the return to office of this Government. For the four and a half years before we came to power the town got virtually nothing and no attention.  We had a manufacturing industry base of 6,500 which has been reduced to 2,800,48 per cent of the population are on medical cards and there is a staggering 30 per cent unemployment in Dundalk.  I hope these measures, together with other measures such as the gas pipeline which is being brought to Dundalk, will have the effect of revitalising and attracting industry into the town of Dundalk.</P>
    <P>A number of local commentators have made great play of the fact that all of these announcements for Dundalk have not meant a penny being spent in the town.  That is totally incorrect.  The gas pipeline is being funded by Bord Gáis Éireann.  The Lake Muckno water supply scheme which is being constructed at present at a cost of £22 million should give Dundalk which has had a very bad water supply over the past number of years a better water supply.  A sum of £22 million is being spent on this scheme which is the biggest public works contract in the history of this State.  To say that Dundalk is not getting its fair share of State money is nonsense.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will come back to my original point, that this budget addresses the problem of the economy.  It continues the policy the Government laid down when they came into power.  Ultimately it will bring the economy to the stage that <Col N="1066" /> it will be fit and hardworking and at that point jobs can be created for our young people.  Hopefully, we can entice them back to our country and prevent them from leaving in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is safe to say that the budget was the prime event in the political calendar down the years but the publication of the Estimates has now taken on that role.  Most of the decisions relating to our State spending and economy were made with the publication of the Estimates.  The budget has now taken on a secondary role at present.</P>
      <P>There were a number of very positive things in the budget &mdash; it would be unrealistic not to accept that &mdash; but there were some areas which should have been attended to and dealt with which were overlooked.  I think it can be safely said that 1987 was the year in which reality came back into politics.  In the years 1977-87 we had a full decade of what we could call &ldquo;Disneyland&rdquo; politics, when certain groups and parties felt that we could spend and spend and promise and promise without ever asking how this spending or how the many promises would be financed.</P>
      <P>In the first months of 1988 there was some consensus of opinion among politicians and commentators on what this country's economic policies should be for the years ahead.  I think almost everybody agrees that the highest priority should be to reduce the extent of State borrowing because, unless State borrowing is brought down, the interest repayments will take up more and more of our public finances, resulting in reduced services and reduced benefits for the less well off and higher taxation levels for those in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference of opinion that exists at present is how quickly we should reduce our public expenditure.  One school of thought accepts the need for spending cuts but argues that it should be done on a gradual basis over a number of years and that areas such as health and primary and secondary education should be exempt from any reductions.  The other <Col N="1067" /> school of thought argues that the quicker the necessary reductions are made the sooner the economy will return to a position of growth.  We have had two conflicting reports; the report from the OECD supports the latter view while the recent ESRI report takes a more optimistic view and suggests that the present level of expenditure reduction is broadly correct and should bring the country back to a growth situation by the early nineties.</P>
    <P>In my opinion in our attempts to reduce public spending at present we are seriously ignoring the damage we are doing in the social area.  I believe there is an over-emphasis on the cutting of services and very little attention being given to the elimination of restrictive practices abuses and in efficiencies in all sectors of Irish life.  In my opinion the economic policies of the present Government have affected the least well off and those who do not have political clout while, at the same time, the vested interests and the most powerful groups in our society have largely remained untouched.  Unless we make efforts to take on these vested interests and to try to eliminate restrictive practices abuses and inefficiencies, I believe the whole of our rationalisation programme will fall apart.  In addition, we must introduce in a more forceful way the concept of accountability within the public service.</P>
    <P>In future I can see the youth of today cursing our generation for the debt with which they will undoubtedly be burdened.</P>
    <P>If we meet the cost of current services by borrowing from abroad we are compelling future generations to pay for these benefits.  Every taxpayer in the labour force at present is required to pay a growing percentage of his or her income to meet the cost of past spending.  Potential taxpayers will opt out and are opting out. Many people who are emigrating at present are not doing so because of lack of work.  They are emigrating because of the punitive tax system here. As a result many of our best qualified are emigrating and will emigrate to North America and Europe and we will <Col N="1068" /> be left with a greater burden on our hands.  What has been happening and which started in 1977 will inevitably leave an inheritance to future generations they surely will not appreciate.</P>
    <P>There is ample evidence to suggest that if spending cuts are made the debt burden will fall rapidly.  There are many examples of spectacular turnabouts in other economies.  For example, in Britain the public sector borrowing requirement &mdash; the difference between public expenditure and tax revenue &mdash; was negative in 1987, which means that Britain is reducing its national debt.  Britain had a very serious debt crisis for almost a decade.  We have only to look at countries like New Zealand which had a very serious economic crisis and took the very necessary, hard economic measures to bring their economic crisis under control.</P>
    <P>Policies in relation to public expenditure cuts may be painful but at least they offer hope not only to this generation but to future generations.  If we do not control our national debt at this stage there is very little hope for any of us in future.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to the year coming up, the three main problems that must be tackled are (1) the control of our debt, (2) elimination of inefficiencies and (3) a reduction of disincentives in our system. It is obvious that cuts in public expenditure must continue.  The cuts that will have to be made this year will be harder to apply and the Government will be forced to look at options they rejected in the past year.  Factors which add to the Government's problem are two serious major errors made in recent months.  One was the Government's commitment to increase public sector pay which has wiped out many of the advantages that accrued from decisions made in relation to public expenditure cuts previous to that.  Pay represents 40 per cent of Government current spending at present. Therefore, the Government by committing themselves to increases in the rates of pay, are forcing themselves into having to make stronger and harder decisions in the year ahead in areas such as health, education, defence and security. <Col N="1069" /> This country should look at Denmark where budget cutting was combined with employment growth in the early eighties and where there was no serious reduction in public services.  They set about the task by freezing pay in the public service and limiting social welfare payments to the absolute minimum required.</P>
    <P>As I have said, inefficiency is one cause of our economic stagnation because we have failed to put our resources to the maximum use in a world that is rapidly changing.  The Government must move to eliminate public sector monopolies and professional restrictive practices and must deal effectively with political pressure groups.  One of the major barriers to any change has been the growth of these pressure groups, at most times encouraged by reckless opposition in the years past.  The power of these pressure groups in manipulating public opinion must be dealt with effectively.  Pressure groups usually exist to defend the <i>status quo</i> whether it be for existing pay relativities, tax concessions or conditions of employment. The only way the political system can deal with these pressure groups is by becoming more efficient itself and sticking by decisions made.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the disincentives in the present tax system let me say that major disincentives still exist.  These have not been dealt with in the present budget. Unfortunately, there are many disincentives to work in the social welfare system.  This system must be changed so that the resources available within the social welfare Estimate are channelled to those most in need.  One thing I must give the Government credit for is giving the people on long-term unemployment assistance a greater percentage increase this year.  It must be acknowledged that there is a start in focusing social welfare moneys into the most needy areas.  I hope that trend will continue.</P>
    <P>Ireland's economic problems can be controlled provided we have consistent, clear-sighted policies and a political will on all sides to take the necessary decisions.  There must be co-operation among all sectors of Irish society.  We will not improve the economy by just <Col N="1070" /> reducing the national debt alone; we must make a frontal attack on our costs and lack of competitiveness in comparison with other nations within the EC.  If we do not achieve the necessary economic growth the net result will be more and more unemployment and more and more emigration.  We must make the system work.  The problem at present is that there is no incentive to invest or to work.  We see week in and week out examples of public companies investing their assets in gilt investments where they can get 10 per cent plus return when, if they invested in risk venture, they would get 1 per cent or maybe 2 per cent growth. Naturally it is easier for them to sit by the fire at night and have their assets appreciate in value by investing in gilts. This area must be reviewed.  We must make the investment climate more attractive.</P>
    <P>In dealing with some of the budget provisions, speaking now as a Cork politician, let me say certain elements in this budget had a very anti-Cork bias. Four announcements in the Budget Statements discriminated against the Cork region.  The first was the changes made in the urban renewal scheme involving the extension of the boundaries of designated areas in Dublin and Limerick as well as the area around Tallaght town centre.  These changes give a further advantage to these areas.  The Cork urban renewal programme, encouraged by the designation of areas in Cork city, has not really taken off, unfortunately.  In what is really a criticism of my own Government, let me say that the areas selected and the boundaries drawn at the time were difficult to understand.  The time is now ripe for the announcement of an extension of the Cork designated area.  I fail to understand why the Watercourse Road industrial area in the oldest part of Cork city, the Blackpool area, as well as areas around Shandon could not be brought in under the changes announced.  Certain parts of the centre of the city were also excluded even on this occasion.  I ask the Minister to examine the position before the publication of the Finance Bill.  The Minister's announcement that he will <Col N="1071" /> introduce provisions in the Finance Bill to enable companies in the Shannon Airport area to qualify for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax gives a further unfair advantage to the mid-west region.</P>
    <P>The decentralisation of Government Departments referred to in the budget to areas such as Ballina, Galway, Cavan, Sligo, Athlone, Limerick, Ennis, Nenagh, Killarney, Letterkenny, Waterford and Dundalk, involving one seventh of the Civil Service workforce, 3,000 staff, is welcome and very sensible. However, I cannot understand why the second city of the Republic, Cork, has been totally excluded from the decentralisation programme.  This comes from a Government who are headed by a Taoiseach who, previous to the last election, gave a firm and clear commitment to the Cork region that a decentralisation programme would be initiated on taking office and that Cork would be one of the beneficiaries of that programme.  That promise has been totally reneged on. Because I believe the areas picked were selected for purely political reasons, I hold the view that Cork has been penalised again in the budget by a Taoiseach who is seeking to avenge the fact that his party were politically defeated once again in the Cork region in the last election.</P>
    <P>The fourth factor I want to refer to is the announcement on the smoke-free zone and the allocation of £250,000 to the Dublin region.  Cork has a smog and air pollution problem as well as Dublin but there was no acknowledgment in the budget of that problem in the Cork region.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Tourism and Transport is in the House because the absence of an announcement in the budget of a commitment to the Swansea-Cork car ferry is another indication of neglect of the Cork area.  The Swansea Cork car ferry has an unfair disadvantage in comparison with other routes because the latter enjoy Government support The Cork-Swansea car ferry enjoyed Government support last year but to date this year there has been no <Col N="1072" /> help forthcoming from the Government.</P>
    <P>As I said already it has been widely acknowledged for some time that the country is suffering from over-centralisation. The continuing growth in the population of the greater Dublin area is unhealthy.  It is clear that this does not help either Dublin or the rest of the country. I believe that to date no serious action has been taken to rectify this.  While Dublin is drawing more and more of the country's population to its core, Cork has been suffering one hammer blow after another.  Its recent ills were well chronicled. This led to the setting up of the Government task force and later to the appointment of a high powered task force for the Cork area within the IDA who, ironically, are based in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Hume report which was recently approved in the European Parliament highlighted the fundamental problem of over-centralisation in Ireland and indicated that it was the worst of its kind in the European Community.  It recommended a radical new policy of decentralisation and that a structure of devolved regional development agencies should be established.  If a positive effort is to be made to prevent further centralisation there can be no better place to start with than Cork but, unfortunately, that has not happened.  Cork has a basic framework in terms of physical, educational and social infrastructure and has plenty of scope for development.  I have no doubt that any realistic initiative taken by the Government would win a very ready response from the Cork region.</P>
    <P>As the Hume report was being adopted in Strasbourg, the Government announced their intention to proceed with a limited number of integrated development programmes for selected areas throughout the country.  To my knowledge, no indication has been given as yet as to which areas are to be selected.  I urge that the greater Cork area should be one of the first to be chosen.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear in Europe &mdash; and this links in with some of the budget announcements &mdash; that if the objectives of the Single European Act are to be <Col N="1073" /> achieved &mdash; the promotion of economic convergence and social cohesion &mdash; greater resources will have to be made available to the less well off regions and planning in these regions will have to be carried out on the basis of integrated programmes.  This means that the various Community, structural and financial instruments, together with national and local authority resources, must be used in a co-ordinated way in the areas under consideration.  The philosophy is that various sources of development finance, including Community, national, regional and local, should be mobilised in support of a coherent set of priority measures covering all the main aspects of the economic potential of a region and that all parties concerned should make a multi-annual commitment to the proposed development programme.</P>
    <P>I want to take as an example the largest public project under consideration in the south west region, a tunnel under the River Lee.  I firmly believe that this would be considered in a favourable light in Brussels if it was packaged as part of a broadly based and coherent plan for the greater Cork area.  Such a plan would feature its key role in exploiting the potential of the Ringaskiddy industrial zone &mdash; which again was not referred to in the budget &mdash; which has a deep water berth, an abundant supply of fresh water and has attracted Government investment of over £40 million in recent years. Therefore, I ask the Government, in the decisions that will be taken shortly, to consider the Cork region for one of these integrated programmes.  The area covered by the Lutz plan which is now drawing to a close would be an obvious area to be considered for an integrated programme.</P>
    <P>There were a number of decisions in the budget which affected the area of health.  By general consensus, 1987 was the worst year ever for Ireland's health services.  Doctors and patients alike felt the effect of Government policies of fiscal rectitude as they announced that there would be reductions in the health estimates. The Government elected last March proposed even tougher medicine <Col N="1074" /> for the health services than what had been planned by the outgoing administration in January.</P>
    <P>Serious damage has been caused to the health care system through the use of a blunt instrument approach to controlling expenditure.  There has been no evidence whatsoever of a planned approach to date and serious inadequacies have already come to light because of the Minister's policies.  Serious thought has not been given to the following points.  Do we have too many health boards or do we need health boards at all?  No consideration has been given to the revision of the community care service programme or the revision of the general medical services.  This unplanned approach which has been adopted by the Government in the allocation of resources is &mdash; and I agree with what Deputy Barry Desmond said this morning &mdash; creating a two-tier health system in which the better off will have access to the better services and the poor will be excluded.  It is certain that more hospital beds will have to go in the coming year if health boards are to live within their budgets and in some health boards there is already great alarm at the prospect of losing these beds.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decisions in recent months have caused an increase in the proportion of private hospital beds and has seriously exposed the inadequacies of our health care programme, especially our community health care programme. Now is an opportune time to take a look at what has been happening in the area of health.  This morning I raised an appalling problem involving a child in Cork who was rejected seven times in the last five weeks when trying to get into Crumlin hospital.  The child required urgent surgery for a cardiac problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen, I have listened with great interest to your contribution to date, dealing as it should with the budget, financial policy and so on.  The Deputy will appreciate that there will be other more appropriate opportunities for him to refer to the <Col N="1075" /> matter he has raised but it is not a matter appropriate to the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The decisions made have caused serious hardship.  Even a member of the Minister's Commission on Health Funding has said taht in recent days old people are reluctant to go to hospital because they have to pay for services.  That is a serious allegation.  This is a relevant time to raise these issues.</P>
      <P>The Government in their budget have shown that they are politically paralysed. The Government do not have a health policy and are therefore not equipped to deal with the fundamental issues affecting health services.  It is time for the Government to start reforming.  I will not go into detail on reform but the health board structure where money is just being devoured must be reviewed, as must the whole area of hospital services, and changes must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any rationalisation programme we must consider the facilities available in private hospitals as well as in public hospitals.  It is amazing that in an examination of the health services, for example, in my region, the facilities <Col N="1076" /> available in the major private hospital were not included in the assessment.  That shows a major defect in the assessment going on at present.  There should be an attempt to allow for interaction between private and public hospitals.  There should be a contracting out of services. That has not been looked at but I will not go into it in detail.  The health services must become better equipped to meet the demands of consumers rather than to pander to the interests of the providers.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that the Government are wallowing in inconsistency in relation to health policies and there is havoc in the entire health service. In relation to the decision to deduct £9 million in retention tax from consultants over the next 12 months, from their VHI payments, I understand that the Attorney General is examining the practicalities of introducing the scheme.  This proposal would affect about 1,000 consultants. Until the Finance Bill is published we will not know the details of this but the proposal will mean that for many consultants there will be a retention tax of about £16,000 per year in addition to their PAYE contribution on their contract salaries and income tax from money from non-VHI insured patients.  I do not argue with that, but to make this change it is obvious that the Government will have to direct the VHI to deduct retention tax and they must change the current regulations whereby the VHI make payments to their members and not directly to the doctors involved.  I can see many problems both practical and legal.  Many members of the VHI will insist that they want to continue paying their consultants directly and, on the other hand, consultants can lawfully claim that their contracts are directly with the patients and could refuse to accept payments from the VHI which would cause a clash between patient and doctor and doctor and VHI. This proposal opens up a minefield in an area already devastated by Government decisions.  I warn the Government to tread carefully here.</P>
    <P>The scheme for the refund of excise duty to disabled drivers is one that needs to be fleshed out.  The Minister for Health <Col N="1077" /> should make a clear statement on this as soon as possible.  I have spoken to the organisations whose members have used the scheme to date and asked for their comments on the proposal.  I have also asked the Revenue Commissioners for a breakdown of the £3.3 million spent on the scheme last year, but I have not got that yet.  My initial reaction to the scheme is to question the logic of the move.  The refund of excise duty is essentially a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. It is a bit misleading to say that it cost the Exchequer £3.3 million last year.  The scheme involves the waiving of the collection of excise duty and VAT.  If the scheme did not exist many disabled drivers would not purchase a car.  There is no real loss to the Government.  If the scheme as is suggested now is transferred to the Department of Health, there will have to be communication between the Department of Health and the Revenue Commissioners and it will create another bureaucratic layer of confusion.  How will the £2.8 million being allocated to the health boards be divided out?  I hope there will not be a quota system for each health board so that once the quota runs out the patient must wait.  Another misgiving is that health boards in their present financial constraints may absorb some of that money into other services. I await with interest the Minister for Health's explanation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the PRSI proposals, the indications are that the scheme will not be self-financing.  The idea of expanding the scheme was to get a contribution from the self-employed sector towards the cost of benefits being given to them at present. It would be a typical Irish solution to an Irish problem if the people paying tax under PAYE ended up financing this scheme for the self-employed and for farmers.  This scheme must be explained in detail.  I will reserve my position on this until we get an assurance that the PAYE sector will not end up footing the bill again.</P>
    <P>The budget, as has been said by our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan, is one of lost opportunities.  We await <Col N="1078" /> with interest the publication of the Finance Bill to have fleshed out many of its provisions.  It is a budget which did not do very much for the PAYE man.  As a result, as one representing an urban area, I am deeply disappointed in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It allows me to emphasize the continuing commitment of this Government to resolve our serious economic problems and to get the economy moving again.  It also allows me to outline the policy framework which has been put in place for the sectors of the economy for which I am directly responsible, namely tourism and transport.  Finally, I refer to the initiatives that are now being taken in those sectors.  But before addressing these matters I would first like to refer to some aspects of the budget, and to the Government's economic strategy.</P>
      <P>The financial statement delivered by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, last week, underlines once again this Government's commitment to deal with our nation's economic difficulties.  As you know our first budget last March was a necessary step back to reality and sanity. It was geared towards improving the public finances, tackling the national debt problem and controlling public expenditure. We also set ourselves the corollary task of putting growth back into the economy. I want to emphasise that getting the finances in order is simply a means to that end.  The measures introduced in the budget last week reinforce and continue this overall Government strategy in the management of the economy &mdash; a strategy which encompasses two key objectives &mdash; improving the public finances and revitalising the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of the economy, just like the management of a business or a home, must be effected through medium as well as short term policies.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which has the support of the major social partners, sets the medium term policy framework for Government.  It seeks to regenerate <Col N="1079" /> the economy and to improve the social equity of our society through the combined efforts of Government and the social partners in the period up to the end of 1990.  The principles that govern such efforts were set out in the National Economic and Social Council's study &ldquo;A Strategy for Development 1986-1990&rdquo; 15 months ago.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> recognises the importance of putting in place a fiscal policy which faces up to our financial realities. For that reason this Government have set themselves the target of stabilising the national debt to GNP ratio during the period of the programme.  That commitment requires a reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement to between 5 and 7 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>In making progress towards this target, last week's budget seeks to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1988 to 8.2 per cent of GNP, which is the lowest since 1973-74, and is a reduction of 2.1 percentage points on the 1987 outturn. The House will remember that 1973 was a significant year, the year of the first major hike in the price of fuel oils.  This reduction in the borrowing requirement is a clear indication of how we are definitely on the path to improving the public finances.  However, as the House is only too well aware, reductions in Exchequer borrowing do not just happen.  The reductions which are now coming on stream required a new balance of macroeconomic policies to be struck, necessitating a curtailment in public expenditure in a number of areas.  Despite opposition from some sections of the community, I feel that there is nevertheless a broad acceptance of our policies across a wide spectrum of Irish society. This reflects a realism within the country that public expenditure needs to be controlled if we are to remove the burden which the national debt places on all our shoulders, individuals and businesses alike.  There is also a realism that strong government is needed to implement such policies unflinchingly, regardless of how unpopular they may be with selected interest groups and that we at the <Col N="1080" /> moment are giving such government.  We cannot see how people who subscribe to our philosophy, nevertheless, in individual instances choose to oppose and to vote against our policies adducing, as the reason, that they agree with the cuts but that they do not agree with the way the Government are carrying them out.</P>
    <P>The benefits of Government policies are already coming on stream.  As you are aware, the economy has responded positively to the measures which were introduced by this Government last year. These policies have brought renewed confidence to Irish business.  Both interest rates and inflation have fallen, while Exchequer borrowing has been significantly reduced.  Furthermore, the level of growth in the domestic economy of 3.5 per cent in 1987 exceeded all expectations, with the decline in overall domestic demand being offset by the improvement in exports of goods and services. The improvement in our balance of payments last year was quite significant, with the current account moving into surplus for the first time in 20 years.  The economy also benefited from the substantially improved performance of the tourism sector.  The measures outlined in this budget for initiatives in this sector reflect the Government's continuing commitment to the development of tourism, a process which we set in train last year with the crash programme for tourism. Furthermore, through the publication of the Price Waterhouse report and the concentrated efforts of those who attended the tourism forum recently held in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, we have brought the issue of short and medium term strategies for tourism to the forefront.  I will be turning specifically to this sector a little later.  I just want to emphasise how important the reduction in interest rates and the reduction in inflation are to this sector.</P>
    <P>The progress we have made so far does not mean that we can now rest on our laurels.  The present budget demonstrates that this Government have no intention of relaxing in their efforts to achieve the goals they have set themselves in relation to both restoring order to the nation's <Col N="1081" /> finances and securing economic growth. The Minister for Finance referred in his statement to the fact that the recent OECD-Ireland survey takes a less optimistic view of the economy's medium term prospects than the latest ESRI medium term outlook and, therefore, a less optimistic view of the level of budget adjustment.  As the Minister indicated, this Government are prepared in their budget plans to seek additional significant savings, should this be necessary.</P>
    <P>We are all too aware of the extent to which our domestic economic fortunes are dependent on developments in the world economy.  We had the benefit in 1987 of a relatively favourable international environment, particularly with strong domestic demand in the UK and the EC, our main trading partners, even though we had a significant hiccup when the Stock Exchanges in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo began to wobble in the month of October.  The outlook for 1988 and beyond may appear less favourable&mdash;mainly a reflection of the imbalances between the major world economies.  The prospect of lower than expected world economic growth and higher real interest rates cannot be ruled out.  Such unfavourable developments would obviously have negative effects on our economy from a range of different perspectives.</P>
    <P>Developments on the domestic front will, on balance, contribute little to growth in national output this year.  Inevitably, the necessary curtailment of spending in the public sector will modify domestic demand.  By contrast, there should be a significant increase in investment in plant and equipment.  Anyone who reads the report of the Central Bank will see that while investment was nothing to write home about, the plant and equipment area had a significant increase last year, and we are expecting the same for 1988.  Personal consumer spending could show a small increase following an improvement in disposable income on foot of the personal tax reliefs given in the budget, lower interest rates <Col N="1082" /> and, as I mentioned, a 2½ per cent inflation rate as is forecast for 1988.</P>
    <P>The continuing bright spot on the economic landscape is exports.  They should again achieve a substantial rate of growth this year.  Accordingly, both the trade surplus and the overall surplus on the current balance of payments should increase further.  When all the different components are taken into account, a growth in gross domestic production of between ½ per cent to 1 per cent is projected for 1988.  A rate of 1 per cent is mentioned categorically in the Central Bank report.</P>
    <P>The rate of growth projected for this year lies far below the true potential of our economy.  This is inevitable.  We first need to correct the imbalance in our public finances before we can achieve higher rates of economic growth.  Such growth is attainable as was pointed out in the recent independent review by the ESRI of medium term prospects for the Irish economy.  That review illustrated that, with sufficient financial discipline, improved competitiveness and a stable external environment, our economy could aspire to sustained economic growth of 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, in GNP terms, once the public finances have been corrected.  As I said at the outset, that is the objective for which we are striving.  A cut in public expenditure for its own sake would be a fruitless exercise.</P>
    <P>If we are to realise the untapped potential of our economy we must ensure that effective use is made of our resources and productive capability through effectively targeted policies.  In seeking to restore growth in this economy the Government are pursuing a wide range of policy initiatives. Though we have heard criticism in this debate that the budget fails to address the critical issue of unemployment and job creation this is without foundation. As the Minister for Finance pointed out in his financial statement, practical measures are being intensified on a sectoral basis to exploit the economy's potential and to create new job opportunities.  Our ability to create jobs and tackle the unemployment and emigration problems lies in improving the competitiveness of Irish <Col N="1083" /> industry.  It also depends on developing and improving the performance of the internationally traded sectors and developing our natural resources by targeting specific sectors of the economy for growth.  Through competition, greater efficiency can be promoted, costs can be held down and companies encouraged to innovate.</P>
    <P>Specific measures to improve the competitiveness of Irish industry include the commitment to pay restraint and to ensuring that industry does not suffer any relative cost disadvantages in terms of its other main input costs.  The Central Bank thinks there will be a significant increase in input costs in the agricultural sector, namely fertiliser costs, in 1988, and this will have to be coped with.  In this context, as Minister with responsibility for the transport sector, I am concerned to ensure that a range of sectroal policies for transport are in place which will increase efficiency and reduce the cost to the customer. Finally, as I have said, a series of practical initiatives have been taken, or are in hands, which target key sectors. The Government wish to harness the potential of these sectors, many of which have been underperforming in recent years, in order to create sustainable new jobs in the economy.  Therefore, I cannot accept these somewhat emotional claims in relation to unemployment and emigration. This Government are concerned about these issues and we are facing up to them.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a consideration of the sectors of the economy for which I have responsibility, namely the tourism and transport sectors.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government established the Department of Tourism and Transport to ensure effective and co-ordinated management of these two sectors of the economy.  The decision was a recognition of the inter-relatedness of these two sectors, particularly for an island country where low cost, high quality and frequent access transport services are essential for the growth of the tourist industry.  I think you will agree that the amalgamation of functions has had a beneficial effect. <Col N="1084" /> Since taking office the Government have stressed time and again the importance of the tourism sector to our economy both in terms of the foreign revenue it brings into the country and the employment it sustains.  Internationally, tourism is a bouyant area with experts currently predicting a doubling in the world tourism market by the year 2000.  These same experts have also expressed the view that Europe will remain the greatest single focal point of world travel.</P>
    <P>Yet there is no doubt that the tourist industry in Ireland has been failing to reach its full potential in recent years. This fact, however unpalatable needs to be faced, as a prerequisite for the changes which must be effected across the whole industry.  These range from our administrative structures to our marketing stance and to the measures necessary to protect and develop our product.  If we are to put the economy back on the right path to growth, we must make optimum use of our natural resources.  Yet, though the tourism industry is based essentially on a range of natural resources, we have failed to harness its full potential.  Inevitably, the effects on the economy have been significant.</P>
    <P>One indicator of this is the Price Waterhouse estimate that our foreign tourism earnings would have been £500 million greater in the period 1975 to 1986 had we not fallen behind the general level of international trends.  We are all too aware that this is only an estimate of the direct effect; there is no doubt that the wider effects on the economy as a whole are in fact far greater.</P>
    <P>A number of recent reports on tourism have cited a variety of reasons for our poor performance.  I think everyone will agree that our cost uncompetitiveness, including access transport costs, marketing approach lacking penetration and deficiencies in our tourism product, have been the main reasons Irish tourism has not prospered as much as it should.  The failure of successive Governments to recognise the true potential of tourism and its importance to our economic wellbeing undoubtedly contributed to this situation.  It is true to say also that <Col N="1085" /> the Irish tourism industry itself has not responded adequately to the changes in world tourism.</P>
    <P>Given this background it is fair to say that much has been achieved in the tourism sector since the Government took office.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, pointed out in his financial statement last week, our improved tourism performance contributed to the strong economic recovery in 1987.  In fact, he attributed the economic growth to this improved performance, allied to a major advance in exports and a big increase in agricultural incomes.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the 1987 crash programme for tourism was a resounding success, with significant increases recorded in tourism revenue and visitor numbers.  Tourism revenue from out-of-State visitors is predicted to have totalled £721 million in 1987, an increase of 12 per cent on the 1986 outturn.  The estimate, and this is more consoling, for the home holiday market, is for revenue of £290 million, over a third greater than the figure recorded for 1986.  There is a market for us in this very competitive area.  In total, therefore, tourism earnings for 1987 are predicted to have passed the £1 billion mark for the first time in the tourism industry's history.  Overseas visitor numbers are predicted to have exceeded two million.  We must now build on that success.</P>
    <P>On taking office this Government undertook major policy initiatives which have introduced more competition into the access transport market.  These have had the desired effect of lowering access transport costs.  I can assure the House that further initiatives in this area will follow and that our transport policies will continue to be oriented towards increasing tourist traffic to Ireland, not just in the peak but also in the low and shoulder season.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, the Government have set ambitious targets for the tourism industry.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> targets the tourism sector as a sector for major development.  The objective over the next five years, as set <Col N="1086" /> out in the programme, is to increase foreign tourism revenue by £500 million, to double the number of foreign visitors and to create an extra 25,000 jobs.  These are very ambitious targets.  To achieve them will require radical changes in the whole structure and organisation of the tourism sector, in our marketing and product development.</P>
    <P>As I have said, considerable progress was made in 1987 and the measures referred to by the Minister for Finance in the budget are aimed at continuing this work.  In his Budget Statement the Minister announced the allocation of £4 million for a special package of measures for tourism in 1988.  This decision takes account of the proposals which emerged from the recent tourism forum.  A special advisory group have been established by the Government to ensure that these additional funds are expended in the most effective way possible.  This task force includes representatives at the highest level from the industry and from my Department.  In summary, their specific brief will be to identify how best this money can be invested for the betterment of Irish tourism in 1988.  This is the first occasion in the history of the State when the Government have appointed a special advisory group for tourism and it is indicative of the importance this Government attach to the development of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>Access transport will be a key element in our tourism strategy.  It is clear, however, that our marketing approach is in real need of an overhaul.  Our marketing stance has been too generalised and vague and needs to be much more sharply focused.  While the destination Ireland type marketing strategy portraying Ireland as a green island may have been effective in the fifties, sixties and early seventies, it is no longer so, although it is no harm to have the image. Today's tourist is much more discerning. The world is at his feet so to speak and he needs to be convinced that one particular destination offers him more or something different than another.  With competition being so keen in the marketplace, we <Col N="1087" /> must adopt a more penetrative and effective marketing campaign with more emphasis on the selling aspect of promotion. With access fares falling there are enormous benefits to be derived from a more intensive and effective targeted marketing campaign.  Bord Fáilte have been instructed to gear their promotional and marketing programme in this direction and to target in on special segments within those markets offering the greatest potential.</P>
    <P>The failure of our marketing approach in the past is probably highlighted most in the German market.  That market is the world's single biggest source of foreign tourism revenue.  That comes as a surprise to some people but it is a fact. Yet Ireland's share, despite our relative proximity, is a miserable 1 per cent.  This Government are determined to attack this market and our other main markets such as Britain, the USA and France much more vigorously in 1988.</P>
    <P>The tour operators in the marketplace must be aware of the qualities and attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination. It will be a specific task of Bord Fáilte to put Ireland in the shop window much more prominently than heretofore.  Bord Fáilte, however, must have the support of the industry in putting together the holiday packages and selling them abroad.  Unless there is increased industry participation in marketing and selling Ireland, the forward momentum seen in 1987 and our lower access transport costs will be to no avail.  There is no doubt that the industry itself will have to come closer to the marketplace, to heighten sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of the modern-day tourists.</P>
    <P>To sell Ireland we must have the right product.  The recently published Price Waterhouse and <i>Economist</i> Intelligence Unit reports on Irish tourism referred to the need for increased investment in the tourist product.  The former report also highlighted the growing importance of the special interest holiday market.</P>
    <P>While the standard of our tourist accommodation premises is quite high, <Col N="1088" /> there is undoubtedly a need for developing amenities and facilities catering particularly for the special interest or activity conscious holidaymaker.  Here again, this Government are determined to address this problem.  As pointed out by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech, the Government last year decided to extend the tax benefits of the business expansion scheme to the export tourism sector.  The scheme covers most of the tourist accommodation sector as well as a wide range of tourist-related facilities and amenities.  I have no doubt that this scheme will attract significant private sector investment in the tourism product because of the many letters I got looking for information as to how it will work.  It will help to expand the range of our tourism product and services.  In addition, marketing companies specifically involved in marketing those tourist undertakings which qualify can also benefit from the scheme.  That is very important as we are putting an emphasis not merely on product development and competitiveness but especially on marketing. I am convinced that this will give added impetus to industry involvement in marketing overseas.</P>
    <P>The climate is indeed right for investment. In the general area of equipment and machinery, investment increased quite significantly last year and it is expected to continue this year.  We have seen growth in Irish tourism in 1987, the rate of inflation is being held down &mdash; 2.5 per cent as I mentioned already&mdash; interest rates have fallen significantly and the Government are totally committed to achieving further growth in tourism.</P>
    <P>There are other financial incentives which will help to improve the quality and range of our tourism product.  The House will be aware of additional funds which are available for tourism development in the Border counties and Sligo. The board of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) have allocated IR£3 million to a tourism development programme for this region &mdash; £1.35 million for an accommodation amenity development scheme <Col N="1089" /> and £1.40 million for an amenity development scheme.  An allocation of £0.25 million has also been provided for a marketing scheme which offers incentives to North American tour operators to feature both parts of Ireland in their tour programmes.</P>
    <P>I understand that considerable progress has been made in evaluating projects submitted for funding under these schemes and that, in fact, the IFI board will shortly be making offers of grant aid to selected qualifying projects.</P>
    <P>In addition to the IFI programme, the Minister for Finance recently announced the availability of IR£8 million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund Special Border Area Programme for the development of tourism in this region.  Matching funding will be provided by State agencies such as Bord Fáilte, the Office of Public Works and local authorities.</P>
    <P>A steering group, chaired by the Department of Finance and on which my Department are represented, have been assigned the task of selecting projects suitable for funding from the large number of submissions received to date. The emphasis of my Department in so far as they can influence or advise in relation to these funds is on revenue generating projects which make a positive net value-added contribution to the economy and have significant potential for job creation.</P>
    <P>The allocation from the national lottery of major funds towards the provision of a wide range of sports facilities and many other cultural and recreational facilities will also significantly benefit tourism.  Indeed, the performances of some of our sportsmen overseas last year have put Ireland on the world sporting map and will undoubtedly highlight the attraction of Ireland as a venue for sporting events.  There are no free holidays for anybody guessing who these sportsmen were who have done this.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the quality and range of our tourism products, particularly all-weather facilities, is vital if we are to develop the domestic holiday market.  In recent years the home holiday <Col N="1090" /> market has been a victim of the economic recession not to mention the competition from the sun destinations.  I am glad to say that in 1987 we saw a growth of 33 per cent in revenue from Irish people holidaying at home.  The improving economic climate, the more vigorous Bord Fáilte and industry promotion of the home market&mdash;there is the launching of a brochure this week&mdash;and more competitively priced holiday offers will ensure that this growth is maintained in 1988.  In fact, I have paid tribute already in many places to the co-operation of the industry itself when the major drive was being made in 1987.  Each sector came in with their offers of reductions in charges and this contributed in no small way to the success of the venture.</P>
    <P>Our natural environment is crucial to the development of our tourist industry. The world today is much more conscious of the importance of a clean and pollution-free environment, to such an extent that it has stimulated the development of political groupings in all countries in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere.  It is important therefore that we take great care to protect our environment. Some of the measures announced in this budget are specifically aimed at improving the quality of our environment.  It is important, however, that the public at large play its role in ensuring that our environment remains pollution-free and our magnificent scenery remains so.</P>
    <P>The activities of many Government Departments have a tourism dimension which had become somewhat neglected because of the inadequate degree of priority accorded to the industry prior to our accession to power last March.  As one of the mechanisms which we instituted early on to place tourism at the top of the political agenda, we revamped the inter-departmental policy co-ordination committee on tourism which has high level representation from all Government Departments whose activities have a significant relevance to tourism.</P>
    <P>My Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, <Col N="1091" /> has had exhaustive rounds of discussions with the members of the committee and reported to Government on a number of initiatives of relevance to tourism which are now being taken or expedited as a result of the committee's deliberations. Our natural resources, our environment, our cultural and architectural heritage all have significant possibilities for tourism and the Minister of State, Deputy Lyons, has injected a concern about their tourism dimension into these activities which was lacking heretofore.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has come in for much criticism of late.  It is reasonable to say that the board's administration costs relative to the level of its direct promotional expenditure have been high.  This was the main reason why this Government reduced Bord Fáilte's operational budget in 1988.  I am currently reviewing all aspects of Bord Fáilte's expenditure programmes with a view to maximising the effective use of our resources.  We are determined to maximise the level of direct promotional expenditure and to create a more lean and hungry promotional agency which will be capable of responding to the challenges ahead.  It is our belief that the board's role should focus primarily on product development and marketing and that their resources should be spent primarily in these areas. A strong Government with forthright and positive policies, an active Department discharging a leadership and co-ordinating role and a development and marketing agency properly equipped to implement the policies of Government &mdash;these are vital to the progress of Irish tourism and to bringing the best out of the industry.</P>
    <P>This Government are indeed bringing out the best in the industry.  With our positive approach we have given the industry a new sense of purpose.  We are prepared to listen to the industry and to give them a voice in the formulation of Government tourism policy.  This was apparent in the Government's decision to convene a Tourism Forum recently which involved well over 100 industry representatives.  I was most impressed by <Col N="1092" /> the extent of the positive contributions expressed by the industry at the forum. A number of the recommendations emanating from this forum will be considered by the special advisory group in the coming weeks.  This group will come up with the necessary initiatives which I am convinced will see much further growth in Irish tourism in 1988.  The tourism industry is fully behind this Government's efforts.  I mentioned that already they responded positively to our 1987 crash programme.  I am in no doubt that they will respond even more positively to our latest initiatives and that we can look forward to a bumper 1988 tourist season.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to the second sector of the economy for which I have responsibility, namely transport.  In doing so I should like first to make some broad comments about the overall direction of transport policy, before dealing with a number of specific issues.  As the House knows the Green Paper on Transport Policy, published in November 1985, presented the many initiatives and legislative developments which had been taken with regard to the sector.  It also sought the views of interested parties on the direction of future transport policy. The response to this invitation has been very positive in that over 80 submissions were received by my Department.</P>
    <P>All of these submissions were assessed fully within my Department and have been taken into account in developing policies for the transport sector.  It cannot be stressed sufficiently, however, that there have been significant changes in priorities in the last year&mdash;both for the economy as a whole, and also for transport. We are all only too aware that the transport sector, as with all sectors of the economy, cannot be immune to the steps that have to be taken to secure long-term sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>At the sectoral level, there has been considerable pressure both nationally and internationally for more competition in the market-place.  Liberalisation and deregulation are now an established part of our vocabulary.  These are, however, more than mere &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; words. <Col N="1093" /> The trends to liberalise are evident in the transport sector more than in many other sectors of the economy.  It is important therefore that the sectoral policies which are put in place ensure that transport operators can compete successfully in the market-place.  Transport operators must not be frustrated in their efforts to tap the opportunities now being presented by the sharp increase in international competition, particularly within the European Community.  Within the transport sector there is need for greater efforts to respond to customer needs, to hold down the level of charges and to apply new technology to improve efficiency.  As always more dynamic management in the sector is a vital ingredient for commercial success.</P>
    <P>The most significant shift in priorities for the transport sector in the last year was the reorientation of transport policy to service tourism.  This is particularly evident in the case of access transport. This development underlines the fact that, as transport is a derived demand, the industry must be prepared to adapt to the changing needs of the economy and to the priorities for sectoral development which have been determined by Government. The transport sector has a significant role to play in helping to instil further growth in our tourism industry, and must recognise that servicing tourism is now one of its primary functions.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister with responsibility for transport I have been putting in place a range of sectoral policies. In doing so I have sought to define the transport sector can operate&mdash;a framework designed to enable the industry to respond quickly to market fluctuations.</P>
    <P>In setting a framework for transport my primary concern is to ensure that a sector operates efficiently within the domestic economy and that it helps to enhance our competitive position with our main trading partners.  Productive resources must be employed efficiently in producing each transport service.  At the same time, the transport sector should be producing the combination of transport <Col N="1094" /> services most perferred by society.  It must also help improve the competitiveness of other sectors and ensure that it does not impose relative cost penalties on industry.  Cost competitiveness is essential if Irish industry is to compete in the international market-place.</P>
    <P>To conclude these broad comments on transport policy, I would stress that transport is a sector which absorbs a large proportion of scarce national resources. That has been quantified and it is on the record of this House.  The manner in which these resources are used must support and contribute to the primary goals of national economic and social policy as set by Government.  The State's involvement in the transport sector is significant, not least through the State transport companies.  Within the sectoral framework for transport I am determined that these bodies must operate efficiently and profitably.</P>
    <P>As regards the air transport sector, low air fares and easy access are two vitally important components in the formula devised by the Government for the development of our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In relation to fares, increased competition in our main markets together with the support by our own air carriers for the Government's plan for tourism now mean that for 1988 we will have the most competitive fares in the market for a number of years.  On the London-Dublin route inbound promotional fares are available at £57 sterling, IR£63 equivalent. Fares at somewhat similar levels are available from UK provincial points, e.g. Liverpool or Manchester-Dublin at £61 sterling and Glasgow or Birmingham-Dublin at £81 sterling.  The French and German markets are key target markets for tourism.  I have mentioned these already.  Very attractive new fares from these key markets have been approved by me in recent days; for example, Apex fares of 599 Deutsche Mark, IR£225, and 659DM, IR£248, from Dusseldorf and Frankfurt respectively will apply this summer.  A new midweek Apex fare level of 1,090 French francs, IR£125, is available from Paris. These fares are considerably lower than <Col N="1095" /> the lowest fares available from these continental points in summer 1987, which were 747DM, IR£281, from Dusseldorf, 830DM, IR£312, from Frankfurt and 1,355FFR, IR£151, from Paris.</P>
    <P>On the North Atlantic, Are Lingus, Northwest and Pan Am have introduced a low advance purchase &ldquo;sale&rdquo; fare which will apply to sales up to 29 February for travel this summer at levels of $449 in the shoulder season and $479-529 in the peak season from New York-Boston to Shannon. The &ldquo;sale&rdquo; fare involves up to a 25 per cent discount off the apex fare level and is up to $225 cheaper than the comparable level to London which of course was the competitor.  Delta Air Lines have a &ldquo;sale&rdquo; fare from Atlanta to Shannon at $577 in the shoulder and $607-657 in the peak season.  Despite the weakening of the dollar, these fares are broadly in line with 1987 levels.</P>
    <P>As regards easy access, there have been a number of initiatives in recent months to open up access to Ireland as a tourist destination.  Three new services have been introduced to open up the west of Ireland&mdash;it is a pity to have the beauty of the west concealed from the rest of the world.  Sligo and Galway airports are now served from Dublin by Aer Lingus while Connaught Regional Airport is served from Dublin by Ryanair.  These new services should give an added and valuable boost to the west.  In addition, I have applications before me for scheduled services from Farranfore which I will decide upon shortly.</P>
    <P>As a result of the adoption of the EC package on the liberalisation of air transport in December last, a number of new services have been approved.  Ryanair have commenced direct services between Cork and Luton and next month they will commence new services between Shannon and Luton, Galway and Luton and between Dublin and Manchester.  I hope to announce shortly further decisions on a whole range of applications from Irish carriers to operate new services between Ireland and the UK and Continental Europe on a third-fourth freedom basis and also on a fifth freedom basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Tourism is also being given an added fillip as a result of the liberalisation of charter rules which I announced in November.  This is very important and we should continue to highlight it.  As a result of these initiatives new charters to Ireland from France, Germany and Italy will operate this coming summer and will be allowed to compete on the same routes as scheduled flights and that is another important point.  They will be allowed to mix in some Irish custom with their indigenous custom.  In an expected difficult year on the Atlantic the new charter rules will sustain charter flights which might otherwise not have come here.</P>
    <P>Turning to sea transport, I am glad to see that the ferry companies are not bemoaning their recent loss of market share in the traditional foot passenger market associated with the low cost air services.  On the contrary, as evidenced by recent fares and promotional initiatives from B &amp; I, Sealink and Irish Ferries, the ferry companies are vigorously defending their market position and are making a special effort to exploit their competitive advantages in the motoring holiday sectors.  There is some trouble at present in the Sealink operation.  I hope it does not last too long.</P>
    <P>Staying with the B &amp; I, the House will be aware that the B &amp; I line is implementing a plan of action aimed at remedying the company's financial problems. On the basis of this plan and its across-the-board support by the company's workforce the Government have agreed to provide the company with up to £11 million in Exchequer equity in 1988.  The position of the B &amp; I will be reviewed not later than the autumn of this year&mdash;we are very insistent on this&mdash;on the basis of detailed comparisons of the company's performance against budget.  We expect that the B &amp; I management and work-force will continue to work hard to ensure that the plan will be a success.  When I say will be a success I mean that the company will become viable and will not depend on support voted in this House.</P>
    <P>In a growing tourism market there is clearly scope for all operators, both air <Col N="1097" /> and sea, to enjoy the benefits of increased passenger traffic and in the process contribute to the overall growth of tourism.</P>
    <P>Finally, the sea carriers also make a significant contribution&mdash;in fact are vital &mdash;to the economy in the transporting of freight.  The amount of contact with my Department today as a result of the problems in Sealink, for example, by people who are trying to get fresh meat out of the country, is an indication of how much a contribution they actually make.  In this context the strike by the National Union of Seamen in the UK is a cause for concern given the impact it is having on freight services to and from Ireland.  I would be particularly concerned for the impact on Irish exports if this strike is not soon resolved.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the commitment of the Government to stay on course and to secure a resumption of economic growth.  As I said at the outset, that is the whole purpose of getting the finances in order.  It is not an exercise we are indulging in for its own sake.  It has as its objective, economic development, the development of the country and the consequent provision of employment. The budget is clear evidence of that commitment. We shall continue with our policies to control and curtail public expenditure to achieve the fiscal targets set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Those targets are part of a comprehensive strategy for economic recovery which includes maintaining a stable exchange rate, improving competitiveness through pay moderation and changes in structural and incentive policies. The Government are making the right moves in a situation of limited options.  In essence, we are seeking to provide an economic environment which will attract productive investment and create sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>We had an opportunity before Christmas to debate in some detail the activities of the major inland transport company, CIE, and for that reason I have not emphasised CIE in my speech on the budget.  The House had an opportunity to go into great detail on the activities of CIE on the two Acts which are now on <Col N="1098" /> the Statute Book and which were debated in full in the House before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, caithfidh mé a rá gur léirigh an Rialtas sa cháinaisnéis seo a dháiríre atá siad beart a dhéanamh chun feabhas a chur ar an staid airgeadais poiblí agus fás a chruthú athuair in eacnamaíocht na tíre.  Glactar leis i gcoitinne anois go bhfuilimid ar an mbóthar ceart. Leanfaidh an Rialtas ag cur leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta go dtí seo chun fás aíocht, chun níos mó fostaíochta a chur ar fáil agus caighdeán maireachtála níos airde a chruthú do chách.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the £4 increase in social welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed the budget was by and large dull, non-productive and uncaring.  That view has been accepted by many people.  The anticipation was there, the build-up was there and so was the advance PR.  We had all the necessary political chemistry that invariably leads up to such a budget.  There was an air of expectation that when the Minister opened his briefcase he would unveil an imaginative plan which would again ignite our economy.  However, when the Minister had concluded his speech there was an air of gloom, shared by economic commentators and the various segments of our economy and, indeed, by outside experts, that it was a deflationary budget, one which will take money out of the economy and which will, sadly, provide zero, minimal or minus growth.  It was not the type of budget we required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sides welcomed the Minister's generosity to the long-term unemployed It was long overdue because those recipients deserve special care and attention. That concession should have been introduced many years ago, particularly when the upward spiral of unemployment commenced. However, there is another sector of our society in need of special attention, widows, orphans and deserted wives.  I welcome the addition of 11 per cent to the income of the long term unemployed but the windows, orphans and deserted wives should have been given special treatment.  Those people suffer <Col N="1099" /> heart-rending loss that cannot be compensated for by all the money in the world.  I urge the Minister, or the person who will have charge of the Finance portfolio next year, to look at the plight of those people and consider giving them a substantial topping-up in their benefits. There are many ways the Minister could help those people apart from a cash increase.  He would be well advised to look into the possibility of giving them some of the ancillary facilities given to old age pensioners.  I am referring to the free telephone allowance, which would be of great benefit to widows who lose the companionship of a partner, and the free electricity allowance.</P>
    <P>The general consensus is that the budget was a budget of missed opportunities, particularly in view of the fact that there is widespread consensus about the need for drastic remedial action to right our economy.  There is a consensus about the need to get our economy back on course, to reactivate growth, to generate dynamism and confidence.  Most people believe the Government missed an opportunity to introduce tax reforms. We saw under the Coalition that while we may hand out additional tax free allowances, increase PAYE allowances, juggle the tax bands around and move more people into the lower tax band at the end of the day it all amounts to tinkering and juggling with the system.  We are not reforming it fundamentally.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Fine Gael Party are fully committed to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation I regret the Minister did not grasp this nettle and bring about a fundamental reform or restructuring of the tax code. I regret he did not harness the goodwill that has been evident from this side of the House.  Had he done so he would have left an indelible mark on our economy. The year 1988 would go down as the year when the disincentives of our tax regime were removed.  People could look at a more kindly tax structure which would give them the necessary incentive to invest, to roll up their sleeves and work, happy in the knowledge that they <Col N="1100" /> would not be clobbered by punitive taxation every time they added another pound to their pay packet for productivity. I am sorry the Minister did not grasp that nettle particularly when there is a danger that consensus might break down in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the startling features of the budget&mdash;it was alluded to by way of denial by the Minister&mdash;was the omission of any positive or constructive input by way of job creation.  It is incredible that at a time when we have 250,000 people out of work, a projected emigration figure of 30,000, and in the region of 140,000 non-status and unregistered Irish people in the United States who are looking across the Atlantic Ocean for some beacon of hope, the Minister did not brig forward an imaginative job creation programme.  There is no doubt that emigration is the greatest human tragedy we have experienced since the Famine.  Collectively, and individually, we have done very little to stem the tide of emigration.  There seems to be grim acceptance of the fact that it is inevitable. It seems to be ingrained in us that there is little, if anything, we can do about it. Surely it is an indictment to us all that we have failed to make a substantial dent in that problem.</P>
    <P>Up to now emigration has been confined to young people, post-intermediate, post-leaving certificate and those with RTC diplomas or university degrees. They were mainly single and unattached people.  However, there is evidence of a new type of emigrant who was part of the emigrant trail some years ago.  There is evidence that young married people are being forced to emigrate leaving behind children, wives and mortgages.  The budget has not addressed that tragedy.</P>
    <P>We all accept that there is a need for prudent management of the economy and that there must be fiscal rectitude.  If it is described as monetarism so be it, but the important thing is that we must stabilise the national debt and get our ratios and percentages right.  One would have thought it would have been possible for the Minister to achieve a balance between cutting on the one hand and <Col N="1101" /> giving a stimulus to the indigenous growth potential areas on the other hand. This did not happen.  The Minister for Transport has just alluded to progress and innovations in the area of tourism but there are other indigenous areas of the economy which were not give the necessary stimulus.</P>
    <P>One of our traditional labour-intensive industries is the constructon industry.  We all received pre-budget submissions putting forward cogent arguments for the resuscitation of this industry.  I am sure the Minister for Finance received far more compelling submissions than those which were sent to backbenchers.  The Minister's concession in re-introducing section 23 will not have the desired effect of regenerating growth in the construction area.  Whether we like it or not, this industry has become used to being fed on loans and grants.  We have virtually abolished SDA loans and terminated the grants which were a vital support.  In view of the frightening number of lay-offs in the construction industry, it was felt that the Minister might conceivably reintroduce some modified form of the house improvement grant scheme.  Apart from creating jobs, this scheme was singularly effective in luring people out of the black economy and ensuring that much needed remedial work was carried out on dwellings. The money expended by way of grants quickly found its way back into the economy by way of taxes and spending power and made a significant impact on employment.  The mortgage subsidy was also abolished and this decision should have been reconsidered.  People applying to local authorities for essential repairs grants and disabled person's reconstruction grants are receiving replies to the effect that the local authorities have not yet been notified of their allocations for the coming year.  This is an indication that the grim news is about to be conveyed to them that the schemes have been terminated for this year.  Another meritorious grant which should have been reintroduced on a scaled down or modified basis is the special tenant grant. Nothing substantial has been done for the <Col N="1102" /> construction industry and one can readily identify with their sense of bewilderment.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the initiatives in the tourism area.  There would be general consensus that the Minister for Transport and Tourism has taken on the task of rolling up the sleeves and doing something to shake up the tourism industry.  I am somewhat bewildered by the global figures for tourism earnings last year.  We are told that earnings from tourism in 1987 exceeded the amount earned in 1986 by £2 million.  I do not know where those tourists were.  I wonder what kind of system is used to collect the data on which these global figures are based.  Tourists were certainly not evident in increased numbers in the Ireland west region.  I would imagine that our tourist statistics for last year were down.  There is certainly a case for a transport subsidy or some kind of additional incentive to lure people to what is generally recognised as the most beautiful part of the country. People should be encouraged by every means possible to come to this largely untapped tourist haven.  I do not believe, however, that £4 million is enough.  I look with a certain amount of scepticism at the setting up of the task force.  We have had too many think-tanks and task forces in the past.  What we need now is positive action.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in calling in the various interest groups and tapping their inspiration, experience and knowledge.  An emergency package should have been developed to get our tourist programme off the ground for 1988.  The Minister has rightly identified the fact that there is something seriously wrong with our tourism industry.  We have failed to exploit the marvellous chemistry for an all-year-round industry, perhaps due to lack of marketing, maladministration or lack of administration. Nobody comes here for the weather.  We have other factors which are marketable on a year-round basis, but for some reason we have not produced the desired results.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the proposal by the Minister for Finance to transfer responsibility for the recoupment of various duties to disabled drivers from the <Col N="1103" /> Revenue Commissioners to the eight health boards.  These people are given concessions in the form of exemptions from duties and taxes.  These concessions were introduced by various devices in this House.  The first movement in this direction was in section 43 (1) of the 1968 Finance Act which gave a percentage exemption from road tax to drivers of cars which had been modified for disabled drivers.  Subsequent Finance Acts amended that section.  Then we had Statutory Instrument No. 57 of 1979 which related to exemptions from excise duty.  Statutory Instrument No. 307 of 1975 dealt with excise duty on petrol.  I think it was in 1980 that we had another statutory instrument which brought in a concession in value-added tax.</P>
    <P>All of those concessions have been vital with regard to rehabilitating the disabled. I honestly do not believe there is substantial evidence of any abuse of the scheme.  It has been acted upon with discretion and fairmindedness by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister now proposes to devolve power for this particular scheme from the Revenue Commissioners to the health boards.  The health boards are already under pressure. They do not have the competence to deal with the scheme and in my honest opinion if they were asked whether they wanted to run the scheme they would run a thousand miles from it because they have enough administrative problems already.  I welcome the indication by the Leader of this side of the House in his address on the budget that he would be seeking on Committee State of the Finance Bill very clear valid, definite and compelling reasons for this measure from the Minister.  I think there was a message from this side of the House to the other side that unless those valid answers were forthcoming we would be compelled to vote against that section of the Bill because there is no saving involved.  It does not make rhyme or reason and will merely create another administrative red tape jungle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision on the retention <Col N="1104" /> of mortgage interest relief.  I think the intention to change it was headed off by this side of the House.  Again I welcome the decision to retain tax relief on voluntary health insurance, and also the decision to restore the young farmer's installation grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Tourism laid heavy emphasis just now on the need to have greater access from the transport view point.  We share this view. However when one looks at the funding that has been given to local authorities this year one sees in fact that the funding to every single local authority across the board has been cut to the bone.  The minimum amount of money for maintenance, repair and improvement for roads has been provided.  If we are to achieve road standards which are comparable with those of Europe and if we are to lure people in on the ferries at Rosslare, Cork and Dún Laoghaire, we have to promote the development of national, primary and secondary routes, and funding is what is required.  I see in my county, which is on the furthermost perimeter of the European Communities, that we are to get this year a princely sum of £1.4 million for national, primary road development.  This is negligible; it would hardly remove a decent sized S bend on a national primary road. Unfortunately this has been the pattern thus far in relation to our commitment to funding, particularly on our national primary and secondary roads.  We go along and see fine stretches of marvellous road, in some cases dual carriageway and then we have bollards and clowns hats and all types of palings and railings warning us that the road is narrowing and narrowing drastically and that there are black spots ahead, of which unfortunately we have far too many.  However, there is money in the EC which we have not drawn down and we are not drawing down our share of the Regional Fund. Perhaps it is difficult to come up with the pound for pound finance that is required, but I honestly believe that if we are to make the impact that the Minister for Transport and Tourism feels we should make in the tourism area we must have <Col N="1105" /> a greater input in development of the national primary and secondary road system.  As a Mayo man I was very disappointed that the total amount of money allocated to Mayo this year for roads was £6.8 million, when a link road on the outskirts of Dublin is being given £7.5 million &mdash; but more of that anon at Mayo County Council level.</P>
    <P>The budget has been generally accepted as being mild, because the soft palliatives are what we have seen so far, the increases in social welfare, the tax concessions, the rejuggling of the tax bands <i>et cetera</i> and a little bit of stimulation here and there with the reintroduction of section 23 for the construction industry.  But the real trauma and drama have yet to come.  You will recall that just over 12 months ago when the budget was being devised by the previous administration the race of death for the pull-out of the Labour Party was their inability to cope with cuts in capital expenditure of £250 million.  That budget was eventually adopted by the Government of the day together with the cuts of £250 million.  This budget proposes cuts in the region of £480 million, so that it is only when it is taken Department by Department and as the revelations of further hospital closure, ward closures and people being turned away from hip replacement operations and failure to develop on school buildings, it is only when all the cutbacks begin to happen in each Department, that the real political crunch and build up will come on this budget.  It will build up because £480 million is the net cut.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We do but we want a little dynamism and imagination as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school building programme is one of the areas I wish to talk about because, while a certain amount of play was made of the fact that £6.8 million was being provided in the budget for this area one notices that the word &ldquo;refurbishing&rdquo; is an addendum to that particular section.  I am <Col N="1106" /> afraid that refurbishing is where the vast bulk of the money will go because we will see very very little by way of start-ups this year.  By and large in the immediate future we can expect refurbishing, nailing up, and new windows and doors to keep out the draughts in the primary sector, and £6.8 million will not go very far in that area.</P>
    <P>One of the most forceful of the pre-budget submissions that have always been made to public representatives and to the Minister for Finance, in particular, is from the motor industry.  However, there was nothing positive for the motor industry in this budget.  The motor industry, like the construction industry, has a high job content and has been high on the casualty list in terms of job losses. There was nothing in the budget for this industry.  We collectively bemoan the decision to put an additional 4p on diesel and 8p on petrol.  The facts are quite compelling and startling.  New car sales are down from 106,000 in 1981 to 60,000 today.  Petrol sales are down by 17 per cent from 1.3 billion litres in 1980 to 1.1 billion litres today.  The total motoring taxes are up from £482 million in 1980 to over £1,000 million today.  In 1980 there were 734,000 cars on the road and today there are only 700,000 cars, many of which are substandard vehicles which are not being put through the necessary rigorous inspections and test to ensure that they are roadworthy.  One should look at the job losses in the motor industry which are down 9,000 from a figure of 24,000 in 1980 to 15,000 today.  That is apart from the loss of something in the region of 9,000 jobs in the auto-motive components exports.  Again another, albeit service area, of the economy has been struck a devastating blow.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening remarks the social welfare increases are welcome. Everybody lauded the Minister for giving the additional 11 per cent to the long term unemployed.  However there is real poverty in this country and the Combat Poverty Agency and various charitable organisations have made very strong submissions. What is noticeable in particular with regard to poverty is that it is not just <Col N="1107" /> ordinary pressure groups who are making the pleas; submissions are coming from religious orders, social workers and people who are in day-to-day contact with people who are in crying need through poverty.  I honestly believe the politicians have failed to identify and reach out to this section of the community. While the payment of £4 per week might seem to be a significant increase for a single person on unemployment assistance, that person receives no other ancillary benefit apart from the welcome addition this year of the free fuel allowance for such people &mdash; and this is denied to people in rural areas or anybody who has a square perch of land. Apart from that, £42 per week in this day and age is not adequate.  I know resources are scarce, but we must do something significant in this area.</P>
    <P>Going back to the genesis of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, there seems to be determination in the Department of Social Welfare to retain the dual structure in relation to social welfare.  We have the urban rate and the rural rate and the urban rate is approximately £2 higher than the rural rate.  That was done on the very valid evidence and assumption years ago that it was more expensive to live in a city or a large town than in rural areas. I submit that the shoe is now very much on the other foot in view of the fact that competitiveness among distributors, etc., door to door services and the proliferation of chain stores in urban areas and cities have made possible access to cheaper services and facilities all round than have people in rural areas.  It is time to look at this disparity.</P>
    <P>The marriage rate of £70 is not a living wage; it is an existing wage, a subsistence wage.  The 11 per cent does not apply to disability benefit holders.  I share the view that unemployment assistance people are a special category.  The Minister in his Budget Statement said that the rate of disability benefit for a married couple is £71.80 but only if it is topped up with pay-related benefit, and that does not apply in all cases.</P>
    <P>Years ago in rural Ireland what I <Col N="1108" /> regard as a very laudable scheme operated. It was superseded by the small farmer's dole.  Many people in rural Ireland would genuinely welcome going back to the system where people had six months on and six months off.  They worked for the summer period and were on the dole for the winter.  Many people on small farmer's dole would welcome a working wage from a local authority.  One thing that strikes me is the mental breakdown that seems to exist when moving resources form one Department to another.  There is so much work to be done and so many people to do it, it is only a case of gelling the lot into some scheme which would give people six months on and six months off, a scheme so much part of the system in rural Ireland years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Wilson, made an excellent speech in this House this evening.  I was struck by the vast contrast between the rhetoric he used and the rhetoric used by the Minister for Finance of the last Coalition Government in greeting the budget.  Things have changed utterly.  It is unfortunate that the conversion came late in the day.  The cuts and reductions of £480 million and the public outcry we witnessed and will witness as the cuts bite in every departmental area would not have been necessary were it not for the fact that from 1982 until 1987 every logical economic cutting measure proposed by Members now on this side of the House was taunted and obstructed in its passage through the House.  Had we learned the economic lesson and introduced consensus politics five years ago we would have a much easier existence now.</P>
    <P>The halving of the capital allowances has not been greeted with any type of welcome by the business community. Even though targeted for the job area to take the emphasis and focus away from machinery and plant to employment, I fail to see it having the desired effects. My analysis and that of people far more expert than I is that, while 1987 was a dull year, 1988 is going to be a grim year, in particular for people on the periphery <Col N="1109" /> or in marginalised jobs because their standard of living will drop.</P>

      <P>I see the greatest chance of economic survival, apart altogether from revival in rural areas, in a speech made in October last year by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. She said this Government were committed to integrated programmes by way of utilisation of the Regional Fund.  I hope structures, ideas and plans are now in place to do that.  I make a special plea that the Ireland west region, a region that has been devastated by emigration and has never got cothrom na féinne, should be the target of an integrated programme.  The regions themselves, apart altogether from the west, have the necessary dynamism to harness the indigenous resources that exist within them if only given the chance and if we could eliminate much of the centralisation that is so much part of the economic fabric at present.  I was disappointed that, when an announcement was made of grant aid to various parts of the country and various projects some three weeks ago amounting to £239 million, the entire western seaboard from Donegal to south Kerry got a mere £600,000.  That underlines and emphasises the need for areas to be designated for integrated programmes.  The people have the ability, the will, the indigenous fabric and the necessary capacity to develop ourselves if we get an opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport laid heavy emphasis on the need for competitiveness.  We should be looking at our main competitor, our main market. England is where the bulk of our goods go.  England is our main competitor and should be our target in relation to increased or better competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in relation to the reduction of air fares.  Deregulation of air fares imposed from the outside and supported by national <Col N="1110" /> Government here has been one of the singular success stories in the past year, but I am baffled as to why the Minister refused to grant Aer Lingus the licence to operate from Horan International Airport and decided to keep it monopolised by Ryanair.  I admire Ryanair.  They brought rationale common sense and low fares into the system and are responsible more than any other factor for the greater numbers of people in the air today. However, it is shortsighted on the part of the airport directors and the Minister to keep the national carrier, who, after all, bear the prestige name, out from any airport.  While my view is not shared by the members of the board of Horan International Airport, it is shared by the vast majority of people who have the interest of the airport at heart.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's thrust in the direction of the German market.  It is scandalous, in the context of our entire tourist population and the revenue derived from tourism, that we get only 1 per cent from Germany.  There is a rich harvest out there.</P>
    <P>One thing that to an extent has gone unnoticed by John Citizen is that part and parcel of the Government's revenue this year has been the £31 million total clawback of repayments from the ESB.  While it is fine as a short-term measure, I hope it will not become the norm.  One looks with a certain foreboding at references in the newspapers to the possibility of privatising Irish Life which offers a very attractive prize in a sale price in the region of £232 million.  Privatisation is OK in its own way, but there must be always a fairly substantial State control of many sectors of the economy.  If we begin to shed those, where do we end?  If we start with Irish Life will it be the ESB next, BTE, An Post and Bord na Móna?</P>
    <P>Basically, the components of the economy have come right and much of what is now happening has been built on the foundation that was laid by the previous Administration, an Administration who took a lot of flak, stick and derision from the public and paid a high political price, an Administration who did much the <Col N="1111" /> same in the years 1973-77 and, again, paid the price at the polls.</P>
    <P>Our interest rates are coming down and long may they continue to do so. Inflation is down to something in the region of 2 per cent.  Competitiveness is becoming part and parcel of our fabric and is something that we were seeking, and rightly so.  Our balance of trade achievements have been startling and substantial and are very welcome.  Debt stabilisation is no longer something to be vainly sought after: at least it now appears on the horizon.</P>
    <P>So long as the Government chart a sensible fiscal rectitude course, coupled with the necessary imaginative, stimulative growth promotion, they will, by and large, have the responsibile support of this side of the House.  I do not think there will be any equivocation about that. However, one thing that does worry me is that while we have zero growth this year, and it is anticipated that growth next year will be in the region of 3 per cent to 4 per cent &mdash; and that is what is required if we are to stabilise our borrowing requirement &mdash; will the necessary incentive for investment or money be there in the first place?  I hope so.</P>

      <P>I listened with amusement to the contribution of the Deputy on the far side of the House, particularly when he accused the Minister of not putting enough money into the roads in Mayo because his two colleagues in Wexford are forever accusing the Minister of hijacking all the moneys for Mayo and not giving enough to Wexford.  He should have a word with them and tell them that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget, as put forward by the Minister for Finance, is a good one.  It reflects the Government's determination to get the finances of the country right while, at the same time, looking after and developing the economy in the best interests of the people.  It is a continuation of the policy initiated by the Government when they came into office last March and confirmed later in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which <Col N="1112" /> was signed by all the social partners.  The priority of the Government is to build up confidence in the economy, to sustain a strong level of growth and open up the way for new employment.  Recent months have demonstrated that the Government are on the right course: interest rates are down substantially since last March, investment in plant and machinery is rising, inflation is at its lowest level for 20 years, there have been major new specific development initiatives in the food processing and tourism areas; there has been the Custom House development in Dublin and urban renewal development throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy on the far side spoke much about his party's support for us.  I think it is a case at this stage of the Government doing what they feel is in the best interests of the country and its people and if the Opposition parties dislike what we are doing they have the option of voting against us, going to the country and letting the people decide what they want. However, I am confident that the people are very much in line with what the Government are doing at present.</P>
    <P>The budget outlines a number of important changes and strategies that will be in the interests of people in the months and years to come.  The taxation package in the budget adds up to a major reform. Many Governments in the past spoke about the taxation system and the need for an incentive, particularly in the PAYE sector, to encourage people to continue in a work environment but no Government had the conviction to change it.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on the changes he has made. They incorporate the most significant changes for years, perhaps since the introduction of PAYE in the mid-sixties. It is a concerted plan to overcome the problems in the tax area.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be complimented also for trying to tackle the problem of mounting arrears.  Numerous business people, farmers and self-employed people who want to pay their taxes, without having to pay the crippling interest involved, have come to Deputies with <Col N="1113" /> their problems during the past number of years.  I have heard of cases of people who owed £40,000 in tax but because interest had accumulated over the years they owed about £80,000 or £90,000 and there was no way they could pay their tax arrears without folding up their businesses. The Minister has now given those people an opportunity to get their taxes up-to-date and if they pay between now and next September the interest will be written off.  The introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed is another move in the right direction. There is also a fundamental overhaul of corporation tax in the budget.  Each one of these items represents a major reform in its own right and, taken together, the taxation package is a move in the right direction and is a courageous decision by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> included a number of tax packages for income tax payers who would benefit over a three-year period.  The 1988 tax relief of £91 million is more than three times the cost of indexing the personal and PAYE allowances and the bands that were expected.  The PAYE sector are targeted for a special relief with an increase of £100 in the PAYE allowance. This package goes more than half-way towards putting two-thirds of taxpayers onto the standard rate of tax.  Ninety three thousand taxpayers will move from a marginal rate of 43 per cent to 35 per cent.  Without the package taxpayers would be paying tax at the standard rate of 48 per cent.  In addition, some 55,000 taxpayers will have their marginal rate reduced from 58 per cent to 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>The people in the PAYE sector in the real world recognise that this is a move in the right direction.  Those people feel that we now have a Government who are prepared to look at the taxation system, who see that it needs reform and who will do something about it.  I hope that next year or the year after we will see more courageous reforms in the taxation system that will benefit the PAYE sector. For far too long they have carried too heavy a burden of taxation while other sectors have not paid their fair share.  I <Col N="1114" /> hope the Government will continue on the courageous road they have gone in reforming the taxation system and will ensure that in the future there will be an incentive for people to work and that all sectors will pay a fair and equitable share of taxation.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments will be increased by about £44 million from July 1988.  In passing, I would like to refer to the free fuel scheme which is being extended to rural areas.  As a Deputy who comes from a rural constituency, I can assure the House that the decision by the Minister to extend the free fuel scheme to people on unemployment assistance in rural areas was very welcome.  It means that those people got an extra £5 per week and in many cases that extra £5 meant that they could have heating, could live above the poverty line and have a reasonable standard of living during the winter months.  I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on extending the free fuel scheme to rural areas.  I agree with the Deputy on the far side of the House that there should be no discrimination between rural and urban people in the area of unemployment assistance.  I hope that the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare will move in that direction when more finance is available.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent increase in widows' and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefit and other weekly benefits is in line with inflation.  I welcome most the increases in unemployment assistance and in the supplementary welfare allowance. There is an 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of long-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances and a 6 per cent increase in the rate for dependent children. The streamlining of rates for child benefits is very welcome.  The special increases are a major step in the Government's plan to provide additional assistance for those on low social welfare benefits.  Single people particularly have been on very small incomes.  This is the first time any Government have recognised this.  Some people will say that the Government have not gone far enough, <Col N="1115" /> but they have made a start.  The last Coalition Government, strangled in many ways by the Labour Party, did not make any changes in this area.  The single person on long-term unemployment assistance will now get an increase of £4 per week and the married couple with three children will get an extra £6.70. Single people very much appreciate this extension in unemployment assistance. While they would like to get more they appreciate that we are moving in the direction of giving increases and hopefully those increases will continue next year and in future years.</P>
    <P>The Government must look at the position of widowers who do not get a fair deal.  There has been a lot of talk about equal rights for women and about women's movements and so on.  I support everything that has been given to widows and I would like to see them get an increase but there are many cases where a man, a widower, is at home trying to look after children and his only income is unemployment assistance plus an allowance for the children and his income is way below the income of a widow. There is a serious problem here causing hardship, poverty and misery for families. This problem should be considered very quickly so as to raise the living standard of these people.</P>
    <P>When people talk about homelessness they tend to refer to homelessness in Dublin and in the major cities but this problem extends throughout the country. I hope that some of the allocation of £3 million for the next three years will be spent in the rural constituencies where it is also needed.  Many young people for various reasons seem to be moving out of their homes and into unfit living conditions. This problem must be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been compassionate in his attitude to the refund of drugs scheme.  There has been an increase in the moneys available for this scheme which caters for unfortunate needy people.  I welcome the fact that the Government are providing money for this despite the many cutbacks and the demands on our resources.  It is important <Col N="1116" /> to continue to care for the sick and less well off in our society.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of changes which will benefit the agricultural sector. The reintroduction of the installation grants for young farmers is most welcome. Deputies have fought for the last nine or ten months to ensure the reintroduction of this scheme.  The scheme is retrospective and is certainly in the best interests of the development of farming. It is important for young farmers to be able to avail of lands as soon as possible. This scheme encourages older farmers to make over their farms to young people. The young farmers are the people who will develop agriculture.  The stock relief has been maintained as has the calculation of levies on income after capital allowances, which has been a bone of contention with the farmers for a number of years.</P>
    <P>In relation to the tax amnesty, that will be of major benefit to the farming sector who are in arrears in their tax.  It should certainly encourage them to pay up.  Self assessment will benefit farmers in the future.  I hope that as many as possible will avail of this system if introduced in the near future.  When they get this opportunity I hope the farmers will pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>Some farmers have said that it is not equitable for them to pay the rates of PRSI being demanded.  The PAYE sector have been paying PRSI for a long number of years.  It is only right that the self-employed and the farming community should be asked to pay their share towards old age pensions.  I would ask the farming organisations to make the necessary sacrifices and pay the appropriate PRSI rates.  It is in the best interest of the country and in the best interest of the farming community in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning referred to local government reform and the need to have reforms implemented.  We all agree that local government reform is an urgent priority.  There is need to put local government on a sound financial footing so that local authorities can provide services for the people in future.  The Minister did not spell out what he has in mind <Col N="1117" /> but I hope the charges in relation to water and refuse will be looked at.  We should have a system which will provide a more constructive financial package for the development of local authorities.  The charges at the moment are inequitable. They vary from county to county.  Some counties have strong local authorities while other local authorities are feeling the pinch, such as my own in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>County roads are in poor condition. There is need for more money in this area.  Because a large amount of investment went into the building of these roads it would be a pity and not in the best interests of any government to see them end up as dirt tracks or dust roads again. We must look at the roads structure and ensure that finance is available to bring it up to the necessary standards.</P>
    <P>A development much welcomed in Wexford town was the urban renewal scheme.  Wexford was designated as an area for urban renewal.  I hope the business people in conjunction with Wexford Corporation will avail of this package to create much needed jobs in our county where unemployment is causing a serious problem.  Unemployment is one of the big problems for all parties in this House.  We all recognise that having a quarter of a million people unemployed is not in the best interests of this country. It leads to all sorts of social problems.  I hope the Government will continue to develop our natural resources to ensure that jobs are created quickly.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about tourism, the food industry and other areas but one must look at fisheries and forestry.  What is needed is quick development of those areas to create jobs.  In 1986, 7,000 hectares were planted and, in 1988, 10,000; this is a 50 per cent increase in two years. It shows that the Minister in charge of Forestry, Deputy Smith, is doing a good job.  We need now to translate that development into jobs as quickly as possible. Dramatic improvements are taking place in forestry.  There is need for more financial support at EC level.  There are one million acres of land ideally suited for forestry industry.  I should like to see <Col N="1118" /> private enterprise, the farming community and others take an interest in forestry, particularly in view of the problems in agriculture at present.  There would be financial and job spin-offs from investment in forestry in the next few years.</P>
    <P>I could not conclude without mentioning unemployment in County Wexford which has the highest rate in the country and there are many reasons for that.  The county has been neglected over the last six or seven years by Government and by the IDA.  Many of its old industries which were related to agriculture have closed down because of lack of resources necessary to change with the times.  In general, Wexford, which is the model county, the home of agriculture, has seen a decline in that area.  The IDA have not done anything to solve the unemployment problem there.  I realise that they cannot provide the answer to all problems, but they can at least ensure that people are brought into the county and encouraged to set up industries there.</P>
    <P>Regionalisation has been the priority of different Governments over the years. I would say to health boards, to the IDA, to all these bodies based in County Waterford, that Wexford has had no advantage whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Waterford does not have a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a shame that the IDA continue to neglect Wexford as they have done over the years.  How can jobs be developed in a county where there are no advance factories?  IDA policy is not to build advance factories there because there are too many factories in Dublin and other parts of the country.  My answer is that if there is not an advance factory in Wexford, people will not be encouraged to set up business there. Recently, Padraic White announced that he expected a major job creation programme by the IDA in 1988.  I hope that he is correct.  I hope he looks further than Dublin and the other major cities, that he looks at counties such as Wexford <Col N="1119" /> which has massive unemployment and from where young people are emigrating in their thousands and that he decides to encourage industries into that county.</P>
      <P>Minister Reynolds has given us every encouragement in the last few months to attract industry to Wexford and even more pressure should be put on the IDA. There should be more streamlining, more reorganisation.  We are not getting value for money from the IDA at present.  They have fancy offices; they are full of bureaucracy and red tape.  Their output and job creation in the last few years leave a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>Overall, I welcome the budget.  It is going in the right direction.  The tax incentives, social welfare incentives and others announced by the Minister will show the people that while this Government are interested in getting the finances and the national debt in order, they also care about people.  If we continue on that road, in a year's time the country will have turned the corner and there will be a return to prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  At the outset, giving consideration to this 1988 budget, we should consider setting down parameters with regard to the direction in which this country should go in the next couple of years.  A budget should not be regarded simply as an annual document put before the nation from year to year.  In the long term strategy, it should provide a clear indication of the direction in which we should be attempting to go for a number of years to come.  Under the weight of statistics that we are given in pre-budget estimates, budget estimates and forecasts, it is difficult to see a clear picture emerging.  For too many years Governments have not taken the long-term approach.  There has been a jump from one budget to the next, simply and solely to get over the coming year.  The price that we have paid for that kind of attitude <Col N="1120" /> has been a lost generation that we have seen depart on the emigration boats and planes over the last two or three years. This probably will continue for at least another year.  We can no longer afford to lose another well educated generation. We put much money into the education of our youth who have an excellent education at the end of the day.  The cost to the Exchequer and to the people is great and here we are happily funding the education systems of many other counties by providing them with well educated raw material to continue to enhance their economies.  We honestly need this highly educated, highly motivated force to remain here.  This is what the long-term strategy within the budget should be beginning to indicate, so that this raw material can be used here and not anywhere else.</P>
      <P>One of the problems that we have faced over many years is a divisiveness in our society.  We have the farmers against the PAYE worker, the self-employed against somebody else, unions against management.  We are behaving as if we had a population of 100 million people and could enjoy the luxury of this behaviour. The reality is that we cannot.  If we continue along this road we will never have a real future.  All these sectors are interdependent.  One example that I never heard enunciated over the years is the number of PAYE people who are directly employed as a result of activities in agriculture.  There is a dual relationship and interconnection between both facets.  It is in that spirit that I would like things to develop in the future.</P>
      <P>It behoves politicians to start behaving with goodwill.  Over a long number of years they have encouraged this divisiveness and pandered to sectional groups when it suited, to the detriment of other areas within the community.  There are people at loggerheads in too many areas of society.  The energy put into that divisiveness should be channelled in a much more controlled and definitive direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government have, for the first time in over ten years, faced up <Col N="1121" /> to the responsibility of being the largest party.  Many cliches have been used to express the change of direction but what they are doing is infinitely preferable to the manifesto on which they fought the 1987 general election.  There is a real desire in this Government to go in the right direction and in a sense I do not doubt that for one moment.  I am concerned that there is an even greater desire to prove to themselves and to the world at large that they are going in the right direction.  This is beginning to cloud the underlying weaknesses and some of the underlying strenghts.  If we rely on statistics which suit our case and promote our cause, we may miss the point.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister for Tourism and Transport spoke about the general support for this Government from the Opposition benches.  We supported the Government last October when the Estimates were discussed.  I believe that was the right thing to do.  Given the financial situation the Government tried to divide the total amount of money available between the various Departments.  In many ways I have no argument with the budgets they allocated in many areas but, as a responsible Opposition Deputy, I would be failing in my duty if I did not take issue with many of the policies emanating from the various Departments.</P>
    <P>The easiest thing for any Government to do was to introduce cuts.  I have no disagreement in many ways with the type of financial constraints imposed and what the Government are trying to do but I disagree when I see cuts taking place with no planned advantage coming from them.  I believe the gains that could be made will not be realised in the next few years if the systems and policies of various Departments are not changed.  If we leave in place systems which are no longer relevant, the sacrifices which have been made to date and the continuing cuts, will be wasted.</P>
    <P>I could allow the Government some leeway last year because they had only come into office, but the time has come when clear definitive policy directions must begin to emanate.  I want to see very <Col N="1122" /> definite policy directions beginning to emerge in many Departments.  If that does not happen I, for one, will not support the cuts and I will not be afraid to oppose the Government.  I will not have them claim we were supporting them and I will be able to defend my position.  It is all very fine to support the cuts but if they do not achieve any long-term benefits, then the sacrifices made will be wasted and we will be back to square one.  That is how I feel about the situation. In many ways it is how the Progressive Democrats feel about it also.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss taxation and some of the points made by the Minister for Finance.  We had the obvious simplification in the sense of the tax bands being changed, the annual sop to the PAYE sector which at the end of the day produces no real benefit because by the time the workers get the salary increases, we are back to square one.  I cannot argue that the Government did not do their best in this area.  I am not decrying how small the sums were, because at least an effort was made but to me that is only tinkering with the system.  I have heard many Government speakers say this.  We need to take another look at the taxation system because if we do not we will continue to tinker with it knowing in our hearts and souls that the system is ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced the system of self-assessment.  As I sift through what he said I become very concerned that it may be merely a cosmetic exercise.  I want to know how it works. There is already self-assessment in the taxation system.  People assess their tax liability, go to the inspector, they either agree or disagree, or they get assessed by the inspector.  There is nothing new or fanciful in that.  The only change I can see now is that the Revenue Commissioners will allow the individual to assess himself and present his tax liability as he sees it, and if the inspector disagrees, he will reassess him.  I think that is the way the system operates already.</P>
    <P>The self-assessment system must be brought onto an actual year basis to be effective.  At what stage will the inspector <Col N="1123" /> assess the individual or the company if they fail to assess themselves?  What role must he play in the breakdown in this area?  One of the keys to self-assessment is that it should be very definitive and the penalties for those who try to get around the system must be such a deterrent that it would not pay anybody to do so.  For that to be effective the Revenue Commissioners must have access to all accounts, even bank accounts if necessary. It is unbelievable that they should not have access to some accounts but should have access to others.  It is all or nothing as far as I am concerned.  Let the defrauders be caught.  I have no compunction about putting them in jail.  It is up to them to assess themselves fairly and honestly.  We should be going in that direction.</P>
    <P>I particularly commend the Minister on the introduction of the tax amnesty.  It has been most far-seeing and imaginative amnesty introduced for many years.  I sincerely hope it is what the Minister wishes and that it will benefit the Exchequer.  By getting this amnesty, if it works, out of the way, with real self-assessment being rolled in following on that, we could bring the taxation system, particularly in the areas which cause concern, up to date. This could mean an effective return to the Exchequer.  We would not be pretending every year that there are £600 million, £700 million or £800 million owed in taxes when most of it is assessed as notional and does not have any real relevance.</P>
    <P>As regards corporation tax the Minister has taken a step in the right direction. We needed to reduce this rate from 50 per cent and bring it more into line with our European partners.  The move to 47 per cent and then to 43 per cent is a step in the right direction.  The counterbalance of that has been the halving of the capital allowances.  In my view this too will prove to be a step in the right direction in the long-term.  I hope in years to come we will be properly aligned with the SEA.</P>
    <P>One of the points I would like the Minister to answer deals with the export sales relief which is being phased out and <Col N="1124" /> which will disappear in 1990.  He said the companies operating in the Shannon area would automatically go onto the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  There are many companies in the rest of Ireland, including my constituency of Waterford, which operate under this scheme. What will happen to them in 1900?  Do they get the same incentives as those companies operating in the Shannon area?  I would appreciate that point being answered.</P>
    <P>It is wrong when regional departments do not have control over the funds collected in their area.  If these departments have total autonomy there will be better co-operation between those paying the tax and those collecting it; the flow of information will be better, and the net result from the point of view of the revenue and the Exchequer will be extremely beneficial.</P>
    <P>In general the Minister has taken steps in the right direction but there is still a lot more which needs to be done in overhauling our taxation system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbot</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill regarding the divide-up of property of the family on a judicial separation are quite numerous, many of them innovative. Many are desirable and one that is particularly striking is the provision in section 13 (f) which allows a court to take into <Col N="1125" /> consideration when dividing up the shares of the family home, making provision for a lump sum payment or other financial provisions for a wife or husband in the separation, and the contribution made by each of the parties to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home or caring for the family.</P>
      <P>This is a very valuable addition to the corpus of the legal criteria which are to be applied in the divide-up of property between a husband and wife in a separation. It looks after a basic instinct of the partners of marriage to seek appreciation and recognition for the toil in the home &mdash; and outside it &mdash; in relation to the ordinary day-to-day looking after the family.  In constituency rounds one meets many people, women especially, who express their concern in their later years for the lack of appreciation from their family or the State through its laws of the toil they put into the home.</P>
      <P>I recollect that some years ago there was a proposal in an election campaign that women would in some way be recognised by a credit in respect of their contribution to the home.  This was widely appreciated and enthusiastically received by women.  There are situations in which men would feel equally entitled to that type of recognition and this section gives the court the power to do that.  That is to be welcomed, the paragraph should not be deleted.  I enthusiastically support it and I would be very surprised if anyone in this House took a different view. However, I have one reservation regarding that paragraph which I expressed to Deputy Shatter already at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights. My reservation is that it tends to create an imbalance between the persons who are in the course of working out a judicial separation in the courts and those whose marriages never come near the judicial separation stage, whose marriages are quite normal and begin and end in the happiness, fidelity and success which we expect of the normal, average marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My misgiving relates to the fact that this very desirable paragraph may, where marriages are marginally approaching <Col N="1126" /> the judicial separation stage and might possibly be saved with a bit of effort, actually be the straw that breaks the camel's back in driving a spouse into court to seek a full-blown, judicial separation. It is an incentive to the partner in the marriage who is anxious to have that appreciation and recognition of his or her efforts in that area of looking after the welfare of the family.  I am not saying that it could ever be an overriding factor in causing marital separation &mdash; that would be far too much to say &mdash; but I wish to point out that it creates an imbalance and somehow devalues the ordinary toil of the woman in the home whose marriage does not break up in the court of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the implications of this radical section will be for law in other areas, for example, community property, and the attitude of the ordinary husband and wife to their rights within normal marriage when this very special right is being given to those whose marriages have broken down or are in the throes of breaking down.</P>
    <P>In relation to the whole structure of the Bill, one might tend to react to its rather lofty and erudite style, which is very much in the tradition of family law legislation which it follows.  It is consistent with the very major effort put into it by Deputy Shatter whose ability in this area as an academic, writer of text books and a practitioner is undoubted. However, I warn against getting perhaps too lofty about the situation and I would direct Deputy Shatter, the Minister and the Government to consider the situation as it might affect the people in local authority houses who cannot get ready access to the courts, even using generous legal aid and who, psychologically, do not feel up to going into court and do not like facing up to even the more informal arrangements which might result from the passing of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people in every constituency in local authority housing are in that situation. They are mostly wives whose husbands have left them and they are stuck there with the tenancy in the name of the husband.  Their only response, very <Col N="1127" /> often, to their marital plight is to go down to the housing officer in the local county council or authority and ask him to put their name on the tenancy of the house, their only asset, to give them the comfort and security of knowing that they have a roof over their head.  There will be many who will say that the wife is secure in that instance, that there are provisions in the Family Home (Protection) Act and in common law to give her the security under the law which she requires, notwithstanding the fact that the husband has flown.  As a lawyer, I concede that is the case but my experience is that wives will go to the housing officer or the local authority to make that request.  They take great solace from the fact that the local authority will make some arrangement, legal or illegal, to change their name to the tenancy of the house which they occupy.  One cannot know whether it gives a psychological or emotional boost which solves their problem, but I report it to this House as a fact which is mirrored in other constituencies apart from my own.  Various local authorities treat it in varying ways.  Some of these ways would be conceded by the officers of local authorities to be contrary to the strict legal rights of the husband but practical local authority officials, in the interest of the wife and children or whoever may continue to occupy the house and in the interest also of the local authority, will very often change the name as requested. In some cases they take the view that nothing should be done and that the wife's request to have the house transferred to her name should be ignored.  In those cases the officials are far from happy that they are doing the just and appropriate thing.  I cannot see anything in this Bill which deals with that simple forthright situation which does not comply with the framework and the scheme we have inherited in relation to the lofty judicial concept of marital separation.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputy Shatter and the Minister to consider bringing forward an amendment on Committee Stage to allow for this procedure to be formalised and <Col N="1128" /> to give the local authority, in that position, the power which would be expressed under statute to grant the wishes of the wife to the security of her home without putting her through the throes of an application to the Circuirt Court or the High Court or any interim application which may have to be made.  These matters can often be too weighty for the person on the ground especially the woman who, possibly after six months or a year, is unsure as to whether her husband will come back.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the power which would be given to the local authority to change the name on the tenancy at that stage would be a power to change the ownership, subject to certain equities remaining outstanding in the husband's name, pending the passage of a generous period. Perhaps a three year period as mentioned in the Bill would be sufficient in relation to certain requirements for irretrievable breakdown or, possibly a further period when the equities might well be discharged. Application could be made by a wife by putting in a simple straightforward affidavit of the desertion of the husband and filing it with the local authority housing officer or some such officer of the local authority.  This very nominal change can be made with the minimum of difficulty and delay and with no expense.</P>
    <P>Looking at the situation in practical terms I would echo the sentiments of Deputies who expressed concern about the difficulty of service of documents. When one gets into the practicalities of family law, especially in relation to poorer people, one finds that no matter what legal aid exists very often there are insurmountable expenses resulting from the fact that the husband or the wife &mdash; the party who is sought to be served with the proceedings &mdash; has vanished without trace.  It is no easy job to trace anyone who has gone to England, the United States, Spain or any other country.  This is a problem which plagues and besets every area of family law no matter what relief one is seeking, whether under the family home protection Act, barring orders or whatever.  Because this legislation encompasses the type of relief <Col N="1129" /> being sought in all other areas of family law the difficulty of seeking remedies for the person who cannot trace his or her partner, to serve documents on them, should be looked after and more efficient procedures should be provided in the Bill which would not only cover the difficulties encountered in this legislation but would also cover the difficulties in finding a partner to serve proceedings on them in relation to the proceedings sought to be enforced.  I would like that this House would consider the Bill in terms of ensuring that whatever rights are conferred on people by the Bill would be accessible not only by the provision of legal aid which exists in larger or smaller measure for people who cannot afford lawyers at present, regardless of how we might criticise the system, but legal aid will only go so far.  If the structure is basically unworkable no legal aid will remedy the deficiencies.</P>
    <P>A critical mould for this Bill would be to examine how it would affect the person of small resources, of limited emotional commitment, in going through the whole gamut of legal proceedings and who would be frightened by the most informal procedure, if these procedures, in technical terms, have to be set out and described in the terms of this Bill.  I hope that through the work of the Government in preparing amendments for Committee Stage and, by way of the special Committee Stage, this Bill will have added to it many refinements and additions which will result, at the end of the day, in very fine legislation that will result in much happiness for people.  I hope it will stem the tide of family break-up and result in firmer and happy marriages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this Bill and will be supporting it on Second Stage.  The purpose of the Bill is to widen the grounds on which a spouse can obtain a judicial separation.  The Bill is a fine and welcome reforming measure and will provide an opportunity for some of those whose marriages have tragically broken down to put some semblance of finality and order on their family situation. I said for &ldquo;some&rdquo;, the limited <Col N="1130" /> category who will be able to take advantage of this reforming measure will be those who have plenty of money on hands to pay the teams of lawyers who would be needed to avail of the new remedies proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is the same old story, the legal system provides procedures for people and in theory these remedies are open for all to avail of but there is one serious snag.  It costs money to come into the halls of justice to avail of these new remedies &mdash; a great deal of money.  As the old saying put it: &ldquo;Justice is open to everyone, like the Ritz Hotel&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is interesting and sad to note that the Minister in his entire speech gave not a single thought, or a single comment, to the fact that a substantial proportion of the Irish people just could not afford to avail of the new procedures being proposed in this Bill.  He did not say the one thing &mdash; the most important thing I was waiting for him to say &mdash; namely, that he will ensure, with his Government colleagues, that whatever legal facilities are necessary will be provided to ensure that all people, whose marriages have irretrievably broken down, will be enabled to avail of the new remedies being made available for the first time in this Bill if they wish to do so.  There has not been a single word about that aspect of the matter which is crucial.</P>
      <P>There is no point in giving fine new remedies when a substantial proportion of the people cannot afford to avail of them.  I note, too, that Deputy Shatter, in introducing the Bill, made no comment about the need to provide funds to enable all the children of the nation to be treated equally and to avail of the new remedies sought to be put on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown stated that access to justice must be available to all irrespective of their means. The same report went on to state on page 111 that the present structure of the Government law centres is grossly inadequate, and certainly does not ensure equality of treatment for all.  The same report pointed out that in 1985 it cost anything from £1,000 to £2,500 to <Col N="1131" /> have a hearing of a separation case in the Circuit Court or in the High Court and that this level of legal costs was a major disincentive and in many cases effectively prevented people from obtaining the remedy they required.  If anything, the costs of these proceedings have escalated since then.</P>
    <P>What has the response of the Government been?  We all know that the free civil legal aid scheme has now virtually collapsed and that all of the centres have massive backlogs.  The most basic recourse which people need in situations often involving tremendous distress is being denied to them at present.  How will the legal aid centres cope if and when it becomes possible for people to apply to them for help under this new Bill?</P>
    <P>The allocation of free civil legal aid has been a pittance, substantially less than £2 million a year.  In the Book of Estimates published last October that allocation was actually cut in real terms.  Far from recognising the need to improve facilities and resources available, the Government have left a serious doubt over the very existence of the centres for the future. All of them are suffering from the same problems.  In addition to their backlogs, they have extreme difficulty in retaining and recruiting staff.  In a word, there is no point at all in introducing an efficient and fine new system such as is being proposed in this Bill if those in need cannot afford to avail themselves of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not appear to be concerned about the people of little or no property.  In his speech he saved his concern for people of such substantial property who would have to have their cases heard in the High Court rather than in the Circuit Court.  With the record of cutbacks introduced and promised by this monetarist Government, aided and abetted by Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, it is quite clear that there is little prospect of justice being made available to all under this Bill.  Accordingly, the Labour Party have no choice but to look at some possible method under which some of the benefits in the Bill could at least be opened up to a much <Col N="1132" /> larger section of the community who might need to avail of its benefits.</P>
    <P>There is one way only to achieve this and that would be to give a jurisdiction in some judicial separation cases to the District Court.  On Committee Stage of this Bill I propose to introduce amendments on behalf of the Labour Party that would give a commensurate jurisdiction to the District Court to make judicial separation and ancillary orders in certain circumstances.  This is certainly not to be taken as an alternative to the need for a proper free legal aid scheme in civil cases. However, the District Court procedures are far simpler and far quicker than procedures in the Circuit Court or in the High Court.  Most important of all they are considerably cheaper.</P>
    <P>The spouse in poor financial circumstances or on social welfare might have some hope of obtaining a much needed judicial separation or other protective orders from the court if such a person could avail of the simple and cheap procedure using the services of a solicitor alone.  Also, a spouse might have less fear of appearing as a litigant in person in the District Court than in one of the superior courts.  The staff who work in the family law offices of the District Court are always particularly helpful to litigants appearing on their own and I would like to pay a particular tribute to the work they do.  The need to have recourse to family law is not confined to the well-to-do.  Indeed, quite the reverse is the position.  Trying to get by on the dole or on low wages in itself puts a great strain on many families and must be at least a major contributory factor to marital breakdown in very many cases.</P>
    <P>If a jurisdiction was given to the District Court it would open up the remedies in the Bill which are needed so much to a far wider extent than otherwise would apply.  It might be said that district justices are not sufficiently qualified or sufficiently elevated in the judicial hierarchy to deal with such important matters as judicial separation cases.  I would disagree with that suggestion.  By and large district justices are practical, down to earth people and, if anything, are more <Col N="1133" /> in contact with the everyday lives and difficulties of working people than would be experienced in the more refined and rarefied atmospheres of the superior courts.  I would have every confidence in the ability of the district justices to deal very effectively and fairly with certain categories of judicial separation cases.  I have to point out that they are already dealing with analogous matters in the form of barring orders, custody and access applications and other allied family law matters.  It would be a logical extension of their work if they were accorded a jurisdiction within certain limits to deal with cases of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>Comment has been made on the fact that the existing judicial separation procedures which have always been there have been availed of so little.  The existing system was indeed archaic but I believe that a major factor was that the cost of availing of those procedures was so high that they were out of reach of very many people who urgently needed the remedy of a judicial separation and the other connected court orders that go with it.  I think that an analysis would show that most of the people who did avail of the procedure were well-to-do and, as we know all too well, the well-to-do never have any problem in using whatever legal remedies there may be either in this country or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Even before this Bill those with money could get judicial separations in this country under the old system or divorces in the UK or elsewhere if and when they wanted them.  It was those with little or no resources who could not avail of the remedies, and the Bill in its present form if that is all we get would not change that very much.  That is why I believe the opening up of the Bill to the community at large who need it can only be achieved in present circumstances if a jurisdiction is given to the District Court.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the so-called spirit of <i>glasnost</i> which is showing itself here in the fact that this Bill is being put forward and accepted by the Government as a consensus measure.  <i>Glasnost</i> was the word used by Deputy Shatter.  I <Col N="1134" /> think that <i>Realpolitik</i> might be a better word to use.  The Government may well know that if they were to fight the Bill they might well be defeated on it.  Nonetheless the Bill is to be welcomed.  I have no doubt that there will be many amendments to it on Committee Stage but I am a bit concerned about the hint in the Minister's speech that there may be a prolonged delay before the Bill advances to that Stage.  I hope the Government do not have an idea of putting the matter on the long finger because that would not be accepted by the House.  I do not feel that the measure, valuable though it is, meets the real needs of the people affected.</P>
    <P>When one analyses the Bill, which has been accepted in principle by the Government, one must come to the conclusion that it is identical to a full divorce procedure in every respect as regards personal rights, parties living together, property rights, separation, barring and so on, except one &mdash; the right to remarry. I must refer to the antics of other political parties represented in this House on the divorce referendum.  It is regrettable that this <i>glasnost</i>, this consensus that is showing itself today, was not evident in that referendum.  The Fine Gael Party, apart from a few notable exceptions such as Deputy Shatter, who has introduced the Bill, and Deputy Barnes, were not behind the divorce referendum.  The role of the Fianna Fáil Party left a lot to be desired.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are prepared to reach a consensus in regard to this matter, are prepared to agree to mutual family positions being set out which are identical to divorce in all respects but deny the right to remarry. Why should we deny a person the right to remarry if that person is anxious to do so?  I accept that there may be a religious precept against it and that is quite in order.  It is a matter for the individual whose religion forbids him or her to remarry to decide if he or she will remarry <Col N="1135" /> but to impose that condition, as was done by the bulk of the Deputies in the House in the divorce referendum and come forward with this consensus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was not a point of order.  Deputy Shatter may avail of his right to reply to answer the question. The Deputy is in a privileged position in that he will be afforded an opportunity to reply to the debate and, consequently, it is disorderly of him to intervene in this fashion.  He has a right to reply at the end of Second Stage.  Deputy Taylor should be allowed to proceed without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated that Deputy Shatter would not raise a point of order. I do not know why Deputy Shatter is so sensitive on this point because, after all, he was on the right side on this issue.  I do not think Deputy Shatter, or any other Member, is so naive as to take up the position that canvassing, posturing and influences, both overt and covert, that are taken up by political parties and other organisations, do not in any way influence how people vote in a referendum or an election.  Otherwise, I do not think many of us would waste our time canvassing, explaining policies or trying to canvass people to vote for a particular party or an item of policy.  I find it cynical to think that we have reached the position of consensus, much as I welcome it as far as it goes, on this issue.  What is required is <Col N="1136" /> divorce and the proposal before us is not that far removed from it if it goes through in its present form.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter suggested that if the Bill is adopted, as I hope it will, it will be taking the family law position from the 19th century to the 21st century.  That is getting a little carried away.  If this is all we have, I do not think it will bring us into the 21st century.  We must make more progress before we can clap our backs and say that we are far advanced on this issue.  I regard it as important that District Courts should have jurisdiction on judicial separation.  I hope I get support for my proposals on that when I introduce them on Committee Stage. Details of the limits of the jurisdiction can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Ideally, as was pointed out in the report of the joint committee, the court which should deal with this issue should be a specially designed and staffed family court with judges, qualified assessors, social workers and child guidance officers and not the High Court or the Circuit Court.  Such family courts should deal with all questions of judicial separation and family matters.  Having regard to the fact that the establishment of such family tribunals would involve some expense, it would be too much to expect the Government in their full flow of monetarism to allocate money for such courts.  Anything we have in retaining the adversarial system in family law matters will be far less than the optimum but we must continue to press for family courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need to provide legal aid for the less well off sections of the community who may need to have recourse to a family law system.  Their need is the greatest.  Many families are in distress because of a lack of finance.  The number of people living below the poverty line here is shattering.  I hope the Minister will introduce amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that people will be able to seek a remedy to their problems. Those remedies should not be the preserve of the rich and well-to-do who exploit them and use them to the full, like most legal remedies.  As an interim <Col N="1137" /> measure we should ensure that the District Court is given jurisdiction over these cases up to certain agreed limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>For a moment I thought Deputy Taylor was about to say that there was a consensus for <i>The Way Forward</i> but he stopped himself in time.  I welcome the Bill and I should like to congratulate Deputy Shatter on his initiative and concern for the unfortunate people who await this legislation.  It is a Bill which is legally and socially desirable, if for no other reason than that it brings within its scope people who are deserted, mainly women who will be entitled to get judicial separations.  That is a glaring omission in the present law.  Furthermore, it is accepted that the present law is founded on the fault principle.  One can only get a judicial separation in court if one can establish cruelty, adultery or unnatural causes.  Obviously the present law is very restrictive in its present operation. I therefore welcome the Bill, particularly sections 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>The Minister had reservations about section 1 which specifies that the sole ground will now be that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.  I do not necessarily share those reservations but I wonder about section 2 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>If the court is satisfied on the evidence of any such fact as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, then unless it is satisfied on all the evidence that the marriage has not broken down irretrievably it shall grant a decree of judicial separation.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, that would mean that even where one establishes one of the grounds the court might not make an order.  Section 2 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the respondent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one reads subsection (2) in conjunction with subsection (1) (a), it would appear to mean that the court could make a finding that the applicant could not be reasonably expected to cohabit with the <Col N="1138" /> respondent and would then find that the marriage had not broken down irretrievably and would refuse the applicant the judicial separation sought.  To me that does not make a great deal of sense but I would respect Deputy Shatter's greater experience in the area and look forward to his comments.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section 2 (3) acknowledges the constructive desertion principle which is already enshrined in the law.  I mention that point specifically because I recall that Deputy Harney in part of her speech seemed to overlook the fact that there is in the present law, and will be under the new Bill if passed, an acknowledgment of the principle of constructive desertion.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is in many ways one of the most important sections in the Bill.  It deals with the duty on an advising solicitor to discuss the possibility of reconciliation, of engaging in mediation and the certification by the advising solicitor that he has advised the client accordingly. It is fair to say that most solicitors advising would normally tell their clients that they should at least consider the possibility of reconciliation and mediation. Most solicitors in my experience certainly do.  I wonder if it is worth having this very important section in the Bill unless one imposes a consequent obligation on the client to respond to that advice and to engage in seeking the advice of a marriage guidance counsellor or some other suitably qualified person.  If the solicitor is to have imposed upon him or her a duty to advise about the possibility of reconciliation and mediation, surely it is much more important that the client should act upon that advice?</P>
    <P>That is not meant by me as a means of holding up the process of obtaining a judicial separation where the facts warrant it but I believe that many people rush off to a solicitor when their first job should be to explore the possibility that somehow the marriage could be saved.  In almost all instances of marital breakdown there is a fair amount of bitterness on both sides and a great deal of bad advice very often given by family members or friends who are not qualified to give that <Col N="1139" /> advice.  I would respectfully suggest to Deputy Shatter that he might consider incorporating some subsection which would oblige the client to take the advice of the solicitor.  The solicitor when certifying to the court that he has advised the client about the possibility of reconciliation and mediation would include a statement to the effect that the client followed that advice and at least talked to a marriage guidance counsellor.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) covers the situation where a judicial separation has been sought and obtained.  The parties are subsequently reconciled and by consent go back to the court to have the decree rescinded. Subsection (3) goes on to state that the court may make ancillary orders which would have been covered in the first instance under Part II of the Act.  I have a slight difficulty from a practical point of view.  Is it not at least arguable that the power as provided in the Bill of making these ancillary orders might result in further strain upon the recently reconciled marriage if the court in making such an ancillary order were not obliged to do it by the consent of both parties?  It could be making an ancillary order which would satisfy one of the parties to the marriage only, thereby reimposing a strain on what would at that stage be a fairly fragile marriage.</P>
    <P>The ancillary orders made at the time of the judicial separation would cover maintenance, succession rights, property rights, custody, etc.  If the order for rescission gave merely a discretionary power to make ancillary orders which might satisfy one party only to the marriage, it would be regrettable if the making of such ancillary orders by the court were to reimpose a strain on the marriage.  That might be a defect in section 6 (3).</P>
    <P>A more minor reservation is in relation to section 7 and that part of the section which defines household chattels.  Anybody engaged in advising clients about legal separation and all that entails knows that from a practical point of view one of the things that causes a great deal of trouble is who owns what.  Personally I <Col N="1140" /> think the definition of household chattels should be confined to the negative final two lines of the definition in the Bill, in other words that &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; should be defined as</P>
    <P>... does not include any chattels used by either spouse for business or professional purposes or money or security for money.</P>
    <P>If it is found necessary that the definition should be couched in the positive form as it is presently drafted in the Bill, I think, given the value of most household goods now, that it should specifically include electrical and mechanical goods and the family car.  In most cases nowadays they are the most valuable items in the household from a financial point of view.  If you are going to have a definiton which specifically covers certain items, I think they should be specifically mentioned. However, I think the definition itself would be much better if it was simply couched, in the negative form.</P>
    <P>Part of section 10 deals with rights of maintenance.  Again, speaking as a practical lawyer who has done some work in this area I would like to see incorporated into the present law a specific statement that maintenance payments by one spouse to another for that spouse and children take precedence over any other legal obligations of the person making the payment.  As I understand the law that is in fact the case.  But in my experience many people feel that they are under a prior obligation to a bank or some such financial institution to pay that bank or financial institution first and then make provision for their spouse and children and themselves.  It is amazing the number of banks and financial institutions who seem to have the same idea.  I have often been in court on a maintenance application, to hear a spouse say, &ldquo;I would love to give my wife and children more and indeed to have more for myself but I must pay the bank £20 or £30 per week&rdquo;. Possibly the bank concerned should not have loaned the money in the first place. I think it would be of benefit to the people for whom this Bill is intended and also to the said banks and financial institutions <Col N="1141" /> if the law stated specifically and categorically that the very first people the spouse has a right and a duty towards are the people themselves and after that any banks or financial institutions that may be involved.</P>
    <P>Given the present state of the law and of thinking in this country, there should be a specific statement in the law on this subject which would point out that the responsibility for making maintenance payments rests with the person who is working.  Again I appreciate that that is in fact the case but it would not do any harm to spell it out in clear and unambiguous language.  There are very many men in this country who are unemployed but whose wives are working and I think it would be no harm to spell out to the community at large that the responsibility for the maintenance of a spouse and children is that of the spouse working and earning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill, as drafted by Deputy Shatter, which would allow the court to cover most items that would need to be covered in a legal separation situation but with regard to section 10 (1) (g) which deals with the right of a court to make an order extinguishing or reducing the share in the other spouse's estate, I see no reason that the present law which says, if I can use the old term, &ldquo;the offending spouse&rdquo; is disinherited might not be retained.  I appreciate that part of the intent of the Bill would be to do away with the fault principle and I welcome that.  However, I feel that the whole object of a legal separation is to allow the parties to get on with their lives separately in a most civilised way.  If the question of succession is left open for dispute and debate at a later stage I cannot see that that meets with the spirit of the Bill.  I would prefer to see a situation where, for instance and the more likely case is where a man deserts his wife and, say, he goes to live in England and is there for 20 years, under this Bill the wife would be allowed to get a legal separation.  I think that the husband should be automatically disinherited in such a situation.  It would be very unusual indeed in the drafting of <Col N="1142" /> a deed of legal separation which was done by agreement between the parties if a waiver clause of succession rights were not included in that Bill.  Why should it be any different where a party is forced to get a legal separation in court?</P>
    <P>Section 15 deals with the power of the court to make retrospective maintenance orders.  Again, I have no great crib with that section but it seems, in view of the fact that section 8 allows the court to make interim maintenance payments while the case is pending, that that should be enough and that the parties should not be allowed on the final determination of the case to go back over the previous six or 12 months or whatever and, as it were, seek an increase in maintenance or seek to have the interim payments varied in some way.  If the court has power to make interim awards of payments, surely that is enough and on the final determination of the case I do not see that there should be any power vested in the court to vary the interim payments.  Perhaps that is a small criticism but it seems a valid criticism.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like once more to compliment Deputy Shatter on bringing forward the Bill.  At this stage I anticipate, as most Deputies do, that this Bill will be passed substantially as it is drafted. However, I think there is a case to be made at this stage for the codification of all our laws relating to the family and children, maintenance of spouses, legal separations and so on.  This is something the parties in this House could get together on because I feel there is a great deal of consensus.  Despite what Deputy Taylor said, I feel that there is a fair amount of genuine consensus in this House on the main provisions of family law.  I think it is unfair to expect people who are caught up in the tragedy of family breakdown to have to seek their remedies in various Bills and Acts.  There is a case to be made for codification of the law and we should look at that very seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the previous speaker's last suggestion, that we should have a unified code of family law because there is such a need particularly <Col N="1143" /> because of the patchwork way in which a great deal of our legislation has been introduced or its introduction delayed.  I think all of us would heartily support that suggestion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor talked about <i>Realpolitik</i> and that is what we deal with in this House sometimes to a frustrating extent in so far as the <i>Realpolitik</i> is far too real and not sufficiently ideal.  In as far as it can go this Bill, as drawn up by Deputy Shatter within the constraints of a Private Members' Bill, is to be welcomed. Regardless of what side was taken by legislators and activists outside this House during the divorce referendum campaign, all kinds of pledges were made particularly to spouses in the home regarding their right to the family home and protection therein and also the value of the work of the spouse in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of great distress and sadness to many of us was that a great number of wives during that period, some of them deserted or victims of violent marriages, found themselves conned &mdash; if I may use the word &mdash; with regard to the Constitution into the belief that in some way they had a constitutional protection in and right to the family home and its contents and that there was some legal acknowledgment of the work they do in the home.  We who have been working and lobbying for this matter and dealing with women in bad marriage breakdown cases realise how unprotected these women were and how they were being misled.  The Constitution, with its high sounding words with regard to the value of woman's work in the home and the value of the family unit to society, in legal terms offered nothing.  Many of us in this House, particularly those dealing in courts day after day with marriage breakdown, know of a belief abroad that there is far more protective legislation for women, particularly as spouses in the home, than exists.  At times of great trauma, anxiety and sometimes violence, a woman has to cope with the fact that we as legislators have failed dismally up to now to give her the protection that <Col N="1144" /> the Constitution promises but does not legally entitle her to.</P>
    <P>We agree that this Bill is only part of what we would like to see as a codified practice.  Deputy Taylor referred to procedures and court access under which these cases can be taken.  Deputy Taylor does not have to tell any of us in this House about lack of access and of free legal aid.  However, within the constraints of this Bill there is much to be welcomed of a radical nature in the best sense of the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will not go into all sections of the Bill now because we will have Committee Stage.  A concept I commend which is fully recognised and acknowledged in this Bill is that of judicial separation being available in cases of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in their report presented the well developed argument that that would be the concept under which separations and marriage breakdown should be judged.  The Minister last night in his Second Stage speech seemed to have some difficulty about accepting the irretrievable breakdown clause as the sole ground on which a decree of judicial separation should be granted, despite the fact that such a representation was made by the joint committee. He said that his first objection was a conceptual one, that judicial separation does not put an end to marriage and the parties remain free to come together again and have the decree discharged. All involved in marriage breakdown in this House and outside recognise that a spouse does not seek a decree of separation unless the marriage has irretrievably broken down and is no longer viable.  Nobody seeks a judicial separation until one or other spouse or both spouses can no longer go on within that relationship.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter in bringing in this Bill has shown the constraints and rigidity of the proof needed for a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>.  It could be obtained only on proof of adultery, cruelty or unnatural practices.  Since the Minister mentioned his objection I have thought of the difficulty we have in trying to make <Col N="1145" /> lists or to define legislation too specifically. We run into all kinds of problems. Our Constitution is very detailed and presents us with incredible difficulties and obstacles 50 years after it was adopted. We could make out a list of 200 aspects of issues which could earn legally a judicial separation but we could leave out a 201st issue under which a spouse or spouses were suffering which should entitle them to a legal separation.  Within this Bill the whole area of irretrievability is treated very responsibly in that cruelty, adultery etc. are covered.  Section 2 (1) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the respondent;</P>
    <P>That would apply to violence or cruelty. Paragraph (b) reads:</P>
    <P>that the respondent has committed adultery;</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) reads:</P>
    <P>that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent.</P>
    <P>Research in many countries shows cases where living separately is physically and psychologically much more secure and healthy not only for the two people concerned but also for the children who may also wish to live away from a tense situation.</P>
    <P>We welcome the committee's recommendation that judicial separation should be based on irretrievable breakdown.  We should not seek, as has been done so destructively, to assign fault to one or the other spouse.  This can sometimes make spouses more hostile in a situation that is difficult already.  It is a total contradiction of what we are attempting within the difficult legal position when judicial separation proceedings have to be commenced by one spouse or both spouses. The last thing we want is that through our legal proceedings people would end up in more conflict and in more adverse <Col N="1146" /> situations with far less conciliation and mediation.  Unfortunately, in a number of cases it is not right to assign fault to one or other spouse and both spouses involved should welcome that shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister had doubts about the conceptual definition of irretrievable breakdown and referred to the fact that the approach of the Oireachtas Joint Committee differed from some of the findings and recommendations of the Law Reform Commission who had reported earlier.  Mindful of the fact that all parties were involved in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and that they brought out an agreed report, I quote from page 232 of <i>Family Law in the Republic of Ireland</i> by Deputy Alan Shatter:</P>
    <P>The approach of the Oireachtas Committee differs from that taken by the Law Reform Commission in its <i>Report on Divorce A Mensa Et Thoro and Related Matters</i> published in December 1983 to the extent that the Commission recommended an extension of the existing grounds upon which a separation decree might be granted but did not propose that irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be the one overall ground for the granting of a decree.</P>
    <P>If they had extended their list, the commission might have come to the difficulty I have already alluded to &mdash; how does one set up a list and who defines it?  The Oireachtas Joint Committee studied in detail and with great seriousness the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission but they believed that that was not the way to approach the issue and that irretrievable breakdown should be the definition used.  If it is the concept used, it will be a very practical one.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to section 4 of the Bill.  Some speakers have already referred to the fact that every effort should be made so that couples do not have to apply for judicial separation unless every other avenue of reconciliation and conciliation has been gone <Col N="1147" /> through.  Under section 4 Deputy Shatter, as a result of his wide experience in this area, has attempted, in so far as it is humanly possible to do so while at the same time leaving independence to people, to ensure that the hearings and proceedings for judicial separation in a court would not proceed unless attempts at reconciliation had been effected.  The previous speaker questioned whether it would be a matter of forcing one or other of the spouses to have marriage counselling. All of us hope and believe that any mature adult would not end a long term commitment and a very serious relationship without going through all those avenues.  Deputy Shatter has, in section 4 (3) tried to cope with that by providing:</P>
    <P>An application for judicial separation shall be accompanied by a certificate by the solicitor, if any, acting on behalf of the applicant that he has complied with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section and, where a solicitor does not so certify, the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it deems reasonable for the applicant's solicitor to discuss with the applicant the matters referred to in that subsection.</P>
    <P>That would go a long way, if not the fullest possible way, towards ensuring that all forms of conciliation and reconciliation have been endeavoured before judicial separation proceedings reach the court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill is to be heartily welcomed because it provides for ancillary orders to be made in judicial separation proceedings.  Many mothers who stayed at home had no economic independence because they had given up the opportunity of independence to become homemakers.  Very often they got small maintenance payments and a judge, even with the best will in the world, was restrained from making lump sum payments to them.  All of us, and even spouses who are involved in a marriage which has broken up, agree, that the first concern in a marriage break <Col N="1148" /> up must be the children.  Everything that can be done to ensure the fullest maintenance for children and the parent in the home has got to be justified and this has been overdue for far too long.</P>
    <P>I cannot begin to tell this House how long overdue I and every other woman in Ireland feel &mdash; and I am sure many fairminded men feel also &mdash; section 13 has been.  Under section 13 the court will have the right to take into consideration the highly acknowledged work of the spouse in the home.  Many spouses found themselves in legal difficulties when their marriages broke down and they had no entitlements.  Section 13 is one of the first great steps we have taken towards ensuring an acknowledgment of the partnership of marriage and the value of the work done in the home.  Having taken everything into consideration &mdash; the age, physical and mental health of each of the parties to the marriage, the duration of the marriage and so on &mdash; the judge can order maintenance and property allowances based on the standard of living of the family before the breakdown of marriage.  This is very important in human terms.  I have been approached by many bewildered and bereft women whom I have tried to help who, when they had given 25 or 30 years to marriage, to a husband and children, were forced by the lack of legal protection to seek employment which they probably would not get because unfortunately we cannot even employ our youngest, our best and physically and mentally most healthy people.  It is an absolute injustice that a woman after a lifetime of contributing to the family and to society can be faced with that kind of insecurity.</P>
    <P>Section 13 will give immense protection and will give great help not just to the spouses concerned but to the Judiciary dealing with family cases.  The Judiciary must have been incredibly frustrated in being powerless to help such people because there was no law to protect them even with regard to the family home.  Section 16 provides that the court may discharge or vary maintenance orders at any time on the application of either party to the marriage, if it thinks <Col N="1149" /> it proper to do so having regard to the circumstances of the case and the matter set out in section 13.  This is one of the most welcome sections.  I am sure most Deputies have dealt with women who have called on the meagre legislation we have at the moment for protection who perhaps have got some kind of maintenance. A person's circumstances may change because children grow older and expenses get higher and her husband's lifestyle and income may change as well. Section 16 would allow her legally to go back and make a case for an increase in maintenance.  On the other hand a spouse may need to have the maintenance varied downwards because of a change in circumstances. This is a human and practical way of dealing with the varying fortunes and misfortunes of people's lives.</P>
    <P>An area that could not be addressed in this Bill by Deputy Shatter relates to the setting up of family courts.  The present court system to deal with family law cases is intimidating and many people find that it adds to their distress.  We must all work towards a situation in which family courts will be set up as quickly as possible.  In a submission from the Family Law Association to the Women's Rights Committee recently, it was put to us that the situation in rural Ireland in family law cases is unsatisfactory as cases are listed every three months and those not taken up on circuit are put back.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor talked about the rights and privileges of well-to-do people who never had to worry about which courts they went to and he decried the fact that we insisted that the Circuit Court should deal with judicial proceedings.  There may be well-to-do families but few of them have well-to-do economically independent wives.  Whilst judicial separation proceedings went on at the very highest level if the husband wished it, this did not apply even in that privileged class to the economically independent wife.  This is what this Bill goes a long way to redress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in welcoming this Bill which arranges for the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Joint <Col N="1150" /> Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  When I spoke in the debate on the divorce referendum, seeing that this proposal arose from an all-party committee, I thought that if the Government had proceeded on the basis of implementing agreed recommendations we might have been able to agree on taking a step to introduce a constitutional amendment on the right to remarry.  At that time the Government broke the spirit of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  We should have implemented agreed recommendations and on the basis of that we would have been better able to gauge, without introducing acrimony, whether to move towards a constitutional amendment in relation to divorce.  We might have had a better and more informed debate on divorce.  However, that is parliamentary history at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on channelling his talents to introduce a Bill like this in Private Members' time.  This Bill in principle has universal approval.  The area of judicial separation has been locked in Victorian times.  The limited grounds on which one could seek a judicial separation in our courts did not reflect the realities of modern day living. The limited terms on which one could seek a judicial separation did not encompass all the grounds upon which one could justifiably seek the right to live separately from one's spouse.  This Bill introduces grounds which illustrate the reality of modern day living.  I am glad that my party have allowed this Bill to be discussed dispassionately in a non-party political way in the House so that the many people locked in a very unsatisfactory marriage can now be in a position, as a result of the inevitable passage of this legislation, to seek redress in our civil courts on wider criteria than at present.  As I said initially, this Bill incorporates many of the recommendations of what was an excellent committee, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It proves the value of that committee that we now have, a year and a half later, the proposals in the form of a Bill to start to redress the day to day <Col N="1151" /> problems of persons who find themselves in an unsatisfactory and difficult situation. Irretrievable marital breakdown should form grounds, or a criterion, upon which persons can seek in our courts the right to live separately.</P>

      <P>First, I disagree with the decision to close Barringtons Hospital and I also disagree with the manner in which that decision was made.  There was a meeting with the board of Barringtons Hospital on 8 June 1987 when the Department officials travelled to Limerick as part of an overall review of the provision of acute beds in the country as a whole.  The situation was discussed in general terms but there was no suggestion that the hospital would have to close and certainly no suggestion of amalgamating the facilities in Limerick.  On 14 August there was a further meeting with the officials in the hospital.  That meeting agreed to set up a sub-committee on the specialty needs of the region.  Now, that was a meeting between the officials and the board of Barringtons Hospital and no further word was heard.  So, why was not the sub-committee set up to look into the specialty needs of the region as had been agreed?  That is the first question to which I should like an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no word until the decision to close the hospital on 10 December was announced.  An official came from Dublin and announced to the hospital authorities the Minister's decision.  There were other meetings, of course, not to do with the main issue.  There was a meeting on 17 November when the Department of Health officials on the nursing side of the Department came to meet the matrons, representatives, staff and authorities of the three hospitals in Limerick. The Minister of State and the House are aware that a decision was taken nationally that there would be no intake of nurses to nursing schools in September. This was the national situation but, arising from the discussions of 17 November, not only was Barringtons Hospital authorised to take in the full complement which in a normal year would be done in September, but it was also authorised to take in four additional students from 1 February 1988.  The other voluntary hospital in Limerick was also authorised to take in its intake, with a further five.  As late as 17 November officials of <Col N="1153" /> the Department of Health were making arrangements with Barringtons Hospital and with St. John's Hospital which implied that both of these would exist long enough to carry nurses from the first point of entry on 1 February through a full three year training course.</P>
    <P>Then, on 1 December, the Minister answered questions in this House.  In reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Allen, Fine Gael spokesman on Health, the Minister said that any announcements which would result in the closure of acute beds in the country had already been made, or decisions were in the process of being implemented.  There was no indication to the board of Barringtons Hospital that anything was in the process of being implemented for their hospital.  Certainly, there was no implication whatsoever that the hospital was to be closed, or that any hospital in Limerick was to be closed.  Ten days later, out of a clear blue sky, an official came from Dublin and closed down the hospital. That sequence in the decision making process requires an explanation.  We can add to that the fact that when the Estimates were published a provision was made to allow Barringtons Hospital to continue for a full year and an adequate provision was made also for St. John's. We all know that there are cutbacks in the health services in general and both hospitals would have had to trim to live within the Estimates, but the facts are that the Estimates published and noted in this House in mid-October had a provision of £1.6 million for Barringtons Hospital which would, with economies, have carried it for a full year and a provision of £1.5 million for St. John's, the other voluntary hospital.</P>
    <P>No discussion leading to a closure took place.  A series of meetings took place which implied that the hospital would remain open.  Permission was given to recommence nursing training from 1 February 1988 and provision was put into the Estimates.  That sequence of events would correspond to our experience in Government.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, we know, drew up a list of hospitals for closure and Barringtons Hospital was not <Col N="1154" /> recommended for closure.  I sat in Cabinet when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, brought in proposals for the closure of hospitals and there was never one through that Minister from his officials to close Barringtons Hospital. What changed between 1 December and 10 December?  What pressure was put on the Minister to change his decision and how is it that the officials of the Department of Health who had advised Minister Desmond in one direction now seem to have advised his successor in a different direction?</P>
    <P>So much for the manner in which the decision was made.  I would like now to deal with the decision itself.  It is unjustified on medical, on social and on economic grounds.  First, on medical grounds, it is a full working hospital, working for 24 hours around the clock.  It has 84 beds, it has a full casualty unit.  There were 34,400 people treated in that casualty unit last year.  A further 8,700 people attended as out-patients.  We have a total of over 43,000 people getting attention in the casualty and out-patients units.  I do not think that there is a suggestion by anybody &mdash; and I have not heard the Minister for Health suggesting &mdash; that the excellent medical facilities and the renowned nursing care in Barringtons Hospital are not recognised by him and by his Department.  I do not think that the Minister has made the case that there is any inadequacy in the medical service or nursing care.  If he were to make such a case, it would not be true, because it is known far and wide that the medical facilities were excellent and the nursing care was renowned far beyond the city and county of Limerick.  As a matter of fact, when the Pope visited this country in 1979 and came to Limerick and there was a massive crowd on the race course, it was Barringtons Hospital rather than any other hospital which was designated as the emergency hospital in case of accident or sudden illness occurring, in case of his Holiness the Pope requiring medical attention.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody would cast any doubt on the qualifications of those who evaluate hospitals for internship for <Col N="1155" /> the Royal College of Surgeons.  That college decided that Barringtons Hospital was an appropriate hospital for four interns and that they would proceed to fellowship doing their practical work in Barringtons Hospital.  The normal county hospital, and there are many of them around the country, would be recognised by the Royal College of Surgeons as appropriate for one discipline, and in exceptional cases possibly two, but Barringtons was recognised for four.  The quality of training must have been very high and the experience gained there must have been considered by the Royal College of Surgeons as appropriate for training surgeons.  Everybody knows the emergency hospital for major accidents in Limerick, as far as Shannon Airport and Clare is Barringtons.  I wonder what would happen now if there was a plane crash and Barringtons were closed?</P>
    <P>Last year, 1,100 people were treated for ear, nose and throat operations. There is no other facility in Limerick which can take up that number of ENT cases.  There is no slack in the Regional Hospital to do so and there is no facility in the other voluntary hospital, St. John's.  I wonder will the prospective 1,100 ENT patients now join the lengthening queue of those who come from Limerick city and county to Dublin for treatment?  On the medical side, nine of the 11 medical posts were shared with St. John's. Despite the pressures on Barringtons Hospital, a reasonable attempt was made to share facilities and to provide medical services as economically as possible.  I do not see any case on social grounds for the closure of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The hospital was founded by charter in 1889 in the reign of Charles IV.  The charter says the hospital was founded for the benefit of the poor of Limerick and it carried out that mandate very well over the years.  It is recognised as a hospital for the poor of Limerick.  It is in the poorer parts of Limerick that you will find the greatest support for Barringtons Hospital.  The decision to close that hospital is socially discriminatory.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this and I <Col N="1156" /> would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it.</P>
    <P>Barringtons is a down town hospital, two blocks from the city centre.  It is a hospital where all accident cases are brought late at night.  It is the hospital where victims of crimes of muggings and other incidents on the streets are taken. Everybody knows that Barringtons doors never shut.  In common parlance in Limerick people do not say they are going to hospital; they say they are going to Barringtons.  Many medical people, paramedics, ambulance attendants and nurses would argue that over the years if that down town facility had not been there patients would have had to travel a number of miles to the alternative facility in the Regional Hospital and those people would have died.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any reason on financial grounds for closing Barringtons.  There was an allocation of £1.6 million in the Estimates, and this was noted in this House.  That was the result of a certain amount of trimming because it was a reduction of approximately 15 per cent on the previous allocation, but the hospital could have lived with it.  The total wage bill there is £1.8 million but the redundancy package which the board of governors put in place would have reduced that figure by at least £200,000. The Minister is aware that the board can supply the names of staff who would voluntarily take redundancy.</P>
    <P>In his announcement of closure, the Minister said the jobs of all staff would be preserved in the region.  Therefore, to come into this House and say he was going to save £1.6 million is not true because all staff jobs are guaranteed. Even after the redundancy package &mdash; which I say would cost as much as £200,000 &mdash; is taken out of the budget, a residual £1.6 million will remain if the staff are deployed to other hospitals in the region.  I cannot see where there can be a financial saving when we look at that kind of arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a pledge to provide alternative facilities, especially on the casualty side.  He has committed himself to an overall expenditure of <Col N="1157" /> £400,000 to provide extra facilities in the Regional Hospital and St. John's Hospital for casualty services.  He is suggesting that £400,000 would provide adequate facilities.  A minimum of £500,000 would be needed for the Regional Hospital to even modify and extend the present casualty facilities.  A sum of £100,000 would not provide a decent first-aid station in St. John's.  We are talking about very large sums of money if the 43,000 people who use the outpatients and casualty departments of Barringtons are to be catered for by providing extra facilities in the other two hospitals.</P>
    <P>But that is not the end of the story. There are 84 acute beds in Barringtons Hospital.  The Minister says he will provide equivalent bed space elsewhere.  He is not saying he will take 84 beds out of Limerick, he is saying he will provide these beds in St. Johns and the Regional Hospital.  The figures I have, which have been agreed by the Mid-Western Health Board and checked by a well-known Dublin economist, have shown that it costs £10 a week less to keep a person in an acute bed in Barringtons than it does in St. John's, and it costs almost £90 a week less in Barringtons than in the Regional Hospital, Limerick.  Therefore, not only is there no saving on the staff side and there will be extra expenditure of at least £500,000 on the Minister's figure on the capital side, but there is the extra cost of providing the beds elsewhere. I repeat, on the figures which are agreed by the Mid-Western Health Board, which are not challenged by the Department of Health and which have been vouched for by a leading economist in one of our universities, it costs £10 less to keep a patient in an acute bed in Barringtons than it does in St. John's, and almost £90 a week less in Barringtons rather than the Regional.</P>
    <P>If St. John's are to provide any kind of casualty service they will need a second X-Ray room.  There is an extra cost involved there.  Also, Barringtons have two modern well-equipped operating theatres, St. John's have one.  If St. John's are to take up any of the workload <Col N="1158" /> of Barringtons, they will need another fully equipped theatre, and that will cost a minimum of £500,000.</P>
    <P>If the approach to the health cuts is a concentration on financial rectitude, and we all agree there has to be rationalisation and a trimming of costs, this is a bad decision not only because of the way it was taken.  It is a bad decision not only on social and medical grounds, but it is a bad decision if we look at it in its rawest terms.  It is a bad decision on simple financial grounds because it will cost the Minister and the Exchequer more in the current year, next year, the year after and as far as one can project.</P>
    <P>The Minister is an impressive performer on television.  He makes a good case.  He made great play of the fact that there are two and a half acres in the other voluntary hospital and said that was the place to expand.  When did we last hear the Department of Health expanding in current circumstances?  The Minister forgot to say there were two acres in Barringtons and that when you build on a site it does not look very big.  When people in Dublin hear that St. John's has two and a half acres they have a vision of rolling fields down by the river.  There are two and a half acres in St. John's and two acres in Barringtons and the Department of Health acquired two terraced houses contiguous to Barringtons for £60,000 in 1986.  There is a two acre site, owned by Limerick Corporation, available to the hospital if they seek it next door to Barringtons. The Minister need not say that there is no space for development.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the fact that you have been very patient with me.  I want to make a final point.  The Minister will argue that the two voluntary hospitals are four hundred yards apart and that it does not matter which one closes but the 20,000 people who marched in the streets of Limerick gave the answer to that.  The Minister will also say that because there is a private interest in St. John's that <Col N="1159" /> proves his point it is the better hospital. The reason there is no private interest in Barringtons is that their charter says it must be for the poor of Limerick and that cannot be changed except by an Act of Parliament.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to defer his decision and to reaffirm the Estimate for both voluntary hospitals in Limerick.  I am not asking him to spend extra money. I am merely asking him to examine the situation again and to consult all interested parties and it will be a good day for medicine and Limerick if he does that.  I am authorised to say that the board of Barringtons will facilitate the Minister and help him in any way to streamline the services in Limerick city and Barringtons Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is unavoidably absent this evening.  He had a prior engagement and he requested me to be present.  I appreciate Deputy Noonan's concern about the closure of Barringtons Hospital.  In order to put the matter in proper context, I should perhaps outline the background and the sequence of events which have taken place.</P>
      <P>It is not well known that shortly after the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, took up office he initiated a comprehensive review of the acute hospital system.  The group which carried out the review held discussions with the managements of all acute hospitals and had meetings with Barringtons and St. John's in June and again in August 1987.  At the June meeting the desirability of rationalising both hospitals on the one site was discussed. At the August meeting, the policy of rationalising both hospitals was discussed again and both hospitals made submissions as to which hospital should be retained.  Therefore, it was clear that both were aware that one of the hospitals would be closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At these meetings, it was pointed out to both hospitals that there was an apparent surplus of beds in the Mid-Western Health Board area as a whole.  The health <Col N="1160" /> board had permanently closed a number of beds in their hospitals but it was clear that further rationalisation was still required.  The review group indicated to the management of St. John's and Barringtons Hospitals and to the management of the Mid-Western Health Board that the voluntary hospital sector in Limerick needed to be rationalised on one site and that it would have about 100 beds.  Both hospitals later put forward detailed submissions as to why each of them should be retained.  It is very significant that neither submission suggested that both hospitals should be retained and it seemed that the logic of the situation was accepted by them.</P>
    <P>In deciding which hospital should be retained, the Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, had careful regard to the outcome of the meeting with the Mid-Western Health Board and management of St. John's and Barringtons Hospitals.  In addition, he obtained an architectural report on the suitability of both hospitals as to their future participation in the public hospital health service in the area. All the evidence from the outcome of these meetings and the architectural aspect pointed to the retention of St. John's.  Having carefully examined all the evidence before him, the Minister decided that St. John's Hospital should be the site on which the voluntary hospital services in Limerick should be located.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for this decision.  St. John's has a more spacious site, the building is in better condition due mainly to the fact that £500,000 was spent on improving the fabric of the building in 1986.  St. John's is more readily adaptable to the changing emphasis in the practice of acute medicine.  For example, it has a unit which is extremely suitable for day hospital services containing as it does an endoscopy room, two five-bed rooms and an area for a theatre.  There has been a considerable shift in emphasis from traditional inpatient care to treatment on a day basis. The mechanical and electrical services are superior to those at Barringtons.  The Minister arrived at his decision purely on <Col N="1161" /> the basis of the physical facilities and the management co-operation of the two bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister announced his decision, he has been accused of inconsistency in view of the statement made in the Dáil that there would not be any further hospital closures other than those which had already been announced or were in the process of being closed.  I should like to make it clear that detailed discussions regarding the future role of the two voluntary hospitals in Limerick have been in progress since June 1987.  It is very important that the House should know that and that it is totally consistent with the Minister's speech in the House in December 1987.</P>

      <P>As the process which led to a decision had been under way for a number of months, in full consultation with the management of the hospitals concerned, there is no conflict whatsoever between his statement in the Dáil and his subsequent announcement about Barringtons Hospital.  Since he announced his decision, many people have expressed great concern about the effect the closure will have on hospital services in Limerick.  At the start of 1987, acute hospital services in the Mid-Western Health Board were being delivered from nine different locations, five of which were in Limerick city.  Clearly, this was not a sound basis on which to build <Col N="1162" /> an efficient hospital system and, while subsequent bed closures by the health board reduced the number of locations to seven, it was clear that further rationalisation was still required.  It is more economical to effect these closures in one hospital rather than have them spread over a number of centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There have also been fears expressed that the casualty services in Limerick will be adversely affected as a result of the closure of Barringtons. The position is that in a city the size of Limerick we simply cannot afford to have two 24-hour casualty services available seven days per week.  Indeed, it is worth mentioning that Tallaght, which has a population roughly the same size as Limerick, does not have a casualty service and that in Dublin as a whole there are only two hospitals in the accident-emergency rota after 5 o'clock each evening.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that a significant proportion of the casualty cases which attend at Barringtons are of a minor nature and should be properly dealt with by general practitioners.  Moreover, the numbers attending at night-time were relatively low, about 14 per night.  The closure of Barringtons requires some improvements to be carried out in the accident and emergency departments in Limerick Regional and St. John's and plans for this work are already well under way.  A casualty service will be available at St. John's Hospital and considering that it is only 400 yards from Barringtons the new location will not present any difficulties.  This service will operate on a <Col N="1163" /> daytime basis from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. since, as I have already said, it is simply not viable to maintain two 24-hour casualty units within a few miles of each other. This change will not present any difficulties since the numbers attending at Barringtons outside these hours is quite small.  As already announced, it is the Government's intention that the inpatient facilities will transfer to St. John's and the Regional Hospital as appropriate by 31 March 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister met the board of Barringtons Hospital and confirmed the decision to them.  The logic of the situation is that one of the two voluntary hospitals in Limerick had to close.  This was an extremely difficult decision for the Minister to make but he was satisfied that he made the right one.  He is also satisfied that with the necessary improvements at Limerick Regional and St. John's the two hospitals will provide a very adequate general hospital service for the people of <Col N="1164" /> Limerick.  I hope this clarifies the situation for the House.</P>

      <P>Monitoring of acidity in rainfall is carried out at meteorological stations throughout the country.  Monitoring of rainfall is also carried out by Dublin Corporation. Three monitoring stations are equipped to measure the longer range effects of air pollution: stations at the Burren and Slieve Bloom, operated by <Col N="1029" /> ESB, and the meteorological station at Valentia which participates in the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme. A further two stations are planned, at Kilkenny and Turlough Hill, County Wicklow, to monitor long range air pollution effects, particularly in the trajectory of Moneypoint-Tarbert.</P>
      <P>The most recent general assessment of the effects of acid rain in Ireland concluded that while there are some indications of acidification along the eastern seaboard, mainly during easterly airflow conditions, there is little evidence to date of marked environmental damage.</P>
      <P>Action to combat acidification depends on effective national and international controls.  As regards national measures, the Air Pollution Act, 1987, provides the necessary legislative framework.

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was compiled several years ago and the situation has since changed considerably. A computerised data base on waste has recently been developed through information furnished by local authorities.  The total volume of waste coming within the EC definition of toxic and dangerous waste which was produced in this country in 1985 is put at 52,500 tonnes.  Of this total, 66 per cent was disposed of by the producers on their own sites, a further 28 per cent was exported for disposal overseas while the remaining 6 per cent was disposed of by landfill.</P>
      <P>Prior to the coming into operation in January 1983 of the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, local authorities did not have their present wide range of powers and obligations in relation to hazardous waste disposal.  As the control regime has progressively developed, the local authorities are better able to trace waste movements from source to final disposal and to ensure that waste is disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of waste disposal policy is to ensure that all wastes, and particularly any hazardous wastes which call for special disposal arrangements, are safely disposed of without risk to public health or to the environment.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to my announcement on 26 January last that earlier proposals to provide a central waste facility at Baldonnel are being abandoned and that I intend to make capital grants of up to 50 per cent available to private sector waste disposal interests to encourage them to extend the <Col N="1033" /> present range of treatment, recovery and disposal facilities for hazardous wastes.  I can assure the House that it is my intention to see to it that an adequate range of facilities is made available to cater for the various types of hazardous wastes and that any unauthorised disposal of such wastes is eliminated.</P>

      <P>The EC Council of Environment Ministers is currently considering a proposal from the Commission for a five year Community-wide programme of projects illustrating how actions in the environmental field can also contribute to employment creation.  The Commission proposes that financial support be given to innovatory projects intended to demonstrate that environmental protection actions can have a beneficial effect on job creation.  While Ireland has supported the Commission proposal, we have argued for a larger fund with a greater scope.  A number of countries have opposed the proposal on budgetary grounds but it is hoped that agreement on a package can be reached before summer.</P>

      <P>Powers available in the Planning and Housing Acts facilitate the preservation of listed buildings.  Under the Planning Acts a planning authority may include, as an objective in its development plan, the preservation of buildings or internal fixtures or features of artistic, architectural or historic interest.  The effect of such listing is to bring under planning control any alteration or demolition of the building or interior which otherwise might be exempt.  The Planning Acts also empower planning authorities to make grants and other assistance available for the preservation <Col N="1037" /> of buildings of architectural or historic interest.  I might add that the urban renewal incentives available in the designated areas under the urban renewal scheme apply to the reconstruction and refurbishment of existing buildings in those areas as well as to new construction.</P>

      <P>An application to extend the Waterford City boundary into County Kilkenny was received from Waterford Corporation in May 1979 but little progress has been made.  A similar application, received at the same time, to extend the city boundary into Waterford County was finalised and the boundary has been duly extended by about 7,500 acres.  My understanding is that the application to extend into Kilkenny is strongly opposed by Kilkenny County Council and the approach of successive Ministers has been that some measure of agreement between the local authorities affected is necessary if the extension is to go ahead.  As there would clearly be major financial and other implications for both authorities it would be desirable that further efforts be made to negotiate an agreed approach.</P>

      <P>According to the information furnished <Col N="1051" /> to my Department in connection with the application for assistance from the European Social Fund, the purpose of the pilot project was to test the feasibility of creating on-farm and off-farm enterprises in under-developed communities by developing small scale agri-business and food processing projects over the three year period, ended 31 December, 1987.  Representatives of rural co-opertives were trained in such activities as deer farming and the production of venison; geese farming; the cultivation of cranberries, blueberries and herbs, and foliage processing.  A number of State agencies co-operated with SFADCo in providing the training.  I understand that the final results of the project are still being evaluated by SFADCo.</P>
      <P>It is open to other Irish organisations to apply to the European Social Fund for assistance for experimental projects relating to vocational training and job creation but the promoters in each particular case would have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the European Commission that the project was innovatory and was likely to yield practical results.</P>

      <P>The pilot project in question was completed on 30 November, 1986 and an evaluation has been carried out by the promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From information furnished to my Department by SFADCo in connection with its application for assistance from the European Social Fund, I understand that the objective of the scheme was to <Col N="1052" /> establish in Southill, Limerick a Community Development Co-operative containing five manufacturing projects, five service projects and one horticultural project, including the provision of appropriate training for the participants.  The promoters found that the severe social and other problems which existed in Southill were greater than anticipated. Nevertheless, at the end of the period of the pilot scheme, eight enterprises, employing 23 people, were established.</P>
    <P>I understand that the sponsors of the scheme, SFADCo, consider that many valuable lessons were learned which could be useful for the formulation of national policy in the development of small businesses or co-operatives in disadvantaged areas.  More detailed information on this aspect should be available from SFADCo.</P>

In 1986, County Kildare had an infant mortality rate of 7.2 deaths per 1,000 live births which was somewhat lower than the national rate of 8.7 per 1,000.  The most recent statistics relate to the second quarter of 1987 and record an infant mortality rate of 4.2 per 1,000 live births for County Kildare.  This compares favourably with the corresponding national rate for that quarter of 8.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.</P>

      <P>The survey to which the Deputy refers is, <Col N="1054" /> I believe, the food sampling and monitoring programme of the Southern Health Board.  The most recent results of this programme are contained in the 1986 report of the health board's food hygiene laboratory.</P>
      <P>The report shows that of a total of 631 samples of cooked meat taken from hotels, restaurants and retail outlets and sent to the laboratory for microbiological examination, 307 samples were found not to comply with the microbiological guidelines set by my Department.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the microbiological guidelines do not by themselves constitute the criteria of fitness or otherwise of food.  Where the guidelines are exceeded they indicate the existence of a possible defect in hygiene standards and the need for further inquiry.</P>
      <P>In all cases where the guidelines were exceeded the health boards environmental health officers inquired further into hygiene standards and took additional samples as necessary.  Where a problem was identified remedial action was taken.</P>
