      <P>Before Christmas this House passed legislation which amalgamated AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service. The practice for many years in this House was that Members on all sides were able to put questions to the Minister for Labour about the activities of AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the National Manpower Service.  Since the House resumed this session the Minister for Labour has taken the view that because these are now amalgamated in a new body he will not answer questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved the Adjournment last night I was speaking about the taxation system and the need to totally overhaul it.  At present the Government are making some moves in the right direction, particularly in regard to corporation tax and that is essential in order to get us down to the levels applying in other countries within the EC.  As I said last night, it is not enough just to tinker with the system, a total overhaul of the system is necessary.  In the area of self assessment I am concerned that some of the moves being made at this stage are only cosmetic as most of what is being proposed now has in fact been happening for the past 18 months or so.</P>
      <P>I would now like to refer to the trading houses which the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, announced in the last day or so.  This is another move in the right direction.  Over the years we have identified that one of the areas where we are lacking is in the area of marketing so the setting up of trading houses can only be for the good.  It has been pointed out that this should not be an area for smart accountants to operate in.  While I do not think that we will just see smart accountants operating in it I suggest that the key to success in this area is that those who are going to get licences to operate in this area should have a background in marketing.  I am the only Member of this House who is a full member of the Marketing Institute of Ireland and an understanding of where we should be going in this area is essential.  If we are to make an impact in foreign markets it is not enough for us to look at the prospects on a purely financial basis.  All of the financial resources and back up are already in existence and much of this will feed into the trading houses.  One of the essential components of these trading houses should be the concept of marketing itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> When licences are being granted the main criteria used should be the efficiency, the knowledge and background of the applicants.  They are the criteria that should be looked at before a licence is granted.  Their track record and the knowledge they possess should be looked at so that a real break through can be made in foreign markets.  It is also interesting to note that the Minister of State speaks about exports which do not exist.  The corporation tax rate of 10 per cent which is going to apply to these trading houses is a very encouraging move particularly as the Minister of State himself pointed out that we are talking about exports which do not exist.  What we are looking for are new exports.  This is a very positive move in the right direction and I hope it will be successful.  It has all the ingredients to be successful if the approach adopted by the Department is the correct one and if the vetting procedures are properly adhered to.</P>
    <P>I will now move on to different areas of departmental spending.  The Minister said that each programme being developed will now have to be justified. That is certainly a step in the right direction but it is not enough to have a programme justified on its individual merits, it has to be related to the overall sense of direction.  Any of us could draw up a programme and justify it on its own merits but to me that is not enough.  All programmes should be looked at on an annual basis.  The Ministers responsible should look at these programmes on an annual basis from the point of view of their merits and on a financial basis.  Over the years the system which has operated is that when you were given a budget for a year you automatically put in for the same budget for the following year with the usual percentage increase irrespective of whether that programme could be justified.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would introduce a Private Members' motion if there was a change in a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should allow me to continue.  I was about to say that <Col N="1174" /> the direction the Government are going, and the fact that they have referred to this area and to the need for real justification is correct.  Ministers who spoke on the budget have made that clear.  I can only encourage such action and accept that it is a step in the right direction. It is important that there should be coordination between all Departments. That is lacking at the moment, as mentioned by the Minister for Tourism and Transport yesterday.  His brief touches on the environment, fishing and our inland waterways.  If a Department decide on a course of action it should be referred to a co-ordinating committee to ensure that the proposal is appropriate to the work of other Departments involved.  That may sound simplistic but if it does not happen our approach will be misdirected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear the comments of the Minister for Tourism and Transport yesterday.  It surprised me that the views I have been expressing in the last six months were contained in his speech. I welcome that.  The Minister admitted that in recent years we have failed to reach our potential in tourism and there is little need to elaborate on that.  However, we must consider how we can reverse that trend.  Tourism has been identified as the greatest area for job creation but a lot will depend on the direction we take.  Over the years Ireland has been promoted as a nice island and a misty land, as the Minister said, but that is not sufficient in the eighties.  People have become far more discerning.  We have an enormous number of facilities to sell to tourists.  We have a natural coastline, superb inland waterways and golf courses, to mention but a few.  We must promote those facilities in countries that do not have them.  It is not every country that has golfing or fishing facilities that can compare with ours and we must promote them where they are in demand. We must identify the type of holiday that appeals to continentals and, having done that, promote them to the greatest possible extent.  The Minister appears to hold the view that it is necessary to prove, over and above everything else, that we are going in the right direction.  Statistics <Col N="1175" /> can be used to prove anything but it would be wrong to be led by them.  They can be used as a guideline and to identify trends in various areas but on their own they are not enough.  Indeed, they can cloud many of the weaknesses, and some of the strengths, of our tourism industry.</P>
    <P>We have been told that 1987 was a boom year for tourism.  I agree that the number of people who visited Ireland last year increased substantially.  One of the biggest areas of increase was in the number of flights between the UK and Ireland.  We have had a big increase in the number of people stopping over for a weekend, Irish people returning home for a weekend break, and I accept that there was an increase in the number of business people travelling to Ireland.  I welcome those improvements but I wonder if there has been a real increase in tourism.  Our future lies in an improvement in the number of people who come to Ireland for holidays, not only in the number who travel here for a weekend break or in the Irish person who returns home to stay with his relations for a few days.  Many of our hotels are on the breadline and they say they have not seen any boom in tourism.  I agree with them because the real growth in tourism will come if we can attract people here for a long stay.  We have a potential to earn a lot of foreign currency from such holidaymakers. We have the potential to earn a lot of money from visitors who hire cars, stay in hotels and guesthouses and use all the facilities available here. We do not want those people to stay in one base.  We want them to spread the money they have to spend throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If we get caught up in statistics we will lose sight of the real development that is necessary.  We must keep this area under review.  I welcome the decision to establish a task force on tourism and I hope they will look at all aspects of the industry. I hope they will concentrate on trying to get visitors to visit as many parts of the country as possible rather than encouraging people to take short breaks here. We do not have a very warm climate and <Col N="1176" /> as a result we are not confined to a short tourist season like other countries.  It is because of our climate that we can encourage visitors for almost ten months of the year.  There are many seasonal activities such as fishing, shooting and golfing that would prove attractive to visitors. We need not concentrate on the summer months.  I agree with the Minister that we should spread the tourist season throughout the year.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the income that can be derived from business people holding their conferences in Ireland.  That business is expanding throughout Europe and we are managing to get a share of the market but we should concentrate more on it.  That is an essential component of the tourist industry.  I was interested to hear the Minister say that Germans are the biggest tourist spenders.  I was not aware of that.  Bearing that in mind it is disappointing to note that we attract but 1 per cent of the German market.  We need to attract Germans here and the key to that is access fares.  It is pleasing to note that we are moving in the right direction in that regard in that the air fares between Germany and Ireland for the new season will be substantially lower than last year.  We must decide on the type of product the Germans demand and, having identified it, we must sell it.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know the number of applications that have been received under the business expansion scheme.  It is a good incentive but I am anxious to know the type of projects that are being funded and if this scheme is part of an overall co-ordinated approach.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has raised enormous amounts of money, far beyond expectations, much of which will be spent on the development of sports facilities.  This is to be welcomed because Ireland badly needs new and far more sophisticated facilities.  Sport gets massive television coverage worldwide.  If we had the facilities for international events which would be covered in the European and American markets it would be of enormous benefit to tourism.  One of the <Col N="1177" /> facilities badly needed is a 50-metre pool and I know that many proposals for such a project have been made to the Minister responsible.  Having spoken to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, I understand that if we had a 50-metre pool Ireland would be considered for the European Championships in the short-term and eventually for the World Championships. The cost of promoting Ireland worldwide would be phenomenal but if we had these facilities we could put Ireland on the world market for very little expenditure.  The utilisation of lottery funds for the development of sports facilities can develop our tourism potential as well.</P>
    <P>The recent CII report backs up the support given to tourism and particularly identifies business tourism, language, culture and agri-tourism as areas with potential for development.  Agri-tourism seems to be low on the list.  We have a lot of farming land which is underutilised and which may not be suitable for particular aspects of farming.  Certain parts of the land bank could be used to develop agri-tourism, which is a major source of income in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fifth freedom rights for Aer Lingus.  It is essential that Aer Lingus as our national carrier and as one of the major world airlines should get fifth freedom rights out of other countries. Pick-up points in foreign markets would also develop tourism to this country.</P>
    <P>I now refer to B &amp; I which is now operating again, although on a scaled down basis.  I commend the management and workforce for their effort in the past few months and I sincerely hope it has not come too late.  I should like to be optimistic that they will put their act together over the next six months and that B &amp; I will be a strong shipping line which Ireland badly needs.  The current strike in Sealink brings home to us the volume of traffic out of this country.</P>
    <P>The meat industry is experiencing grave problems because they are unable to get fresh meat out of the country due to this strike.  B &amp; I are coping with as big a volume as they can.  This brings <Col N="1178" /> home the essential point that it is imperative we should have our own shipping line.  It would be appalling if we as an island nation did not have a shipping line. I can only hope that B &amp; I and the workforce will put every effort into making this company a success once and for all.</P>
    <P>I was surprised the Minister had so little to say about road transport.  The CII have pointed out that agreement has not been reached in the EC for the removal of restrictions on the carriage of goods within the Community.  The blocking by Governments of some of the larger member states of proposals to increase international haulage permits by 40 per cent per annum over the next five years will hinder the expansion of Irish hauliers in Europe.  It also puts in doubt the political will of some Governments to allow free movement of goods and services which the Single European Act provides for.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport might tell us what the position is with regard to the removal of tariffs and the opening of free movement of freight within the EC.  This is very important for Ireland because approximately 80 per cent of our exports go by road and sea. These policies which are being blocked within the EC must be implemented immediately.</P>
    <P>We have an extensive budget available in the area of social welfare but I believe that in times of financial strain the Government should look at areas where people are receiving social welfare payments who should not be doing so. Resources in the social welfare budget are spread too far.  It is fundamentally wrong that everybody who has children is entitled to children's allowance.  People like myself should not be entitled to children's allowance because on a certain level of income there is no need for it.  If funds were targeted at those who were really in need there would be far more realistic funds available to assist them. Those who genuinely do not need these payments should not be a burden on the State.  There is nothing illogical about that, even from the point of view of the Left, those who claim to have the only answer to poverty.  People like that <Col N="1179" /> should realise that targeting of resources on those most in need must be a sensible approach, particularly in a climate of financial restraint.</P>
    <P>Within the Department of Social Welfare there is an urgent need for a thorough re-examination of the whole system.  Payments are spread too far and we have a myriad of payments which nobody can keep up with.  Different categories of people such as the single or the widowed seem in monetary terms to have different values.  That is not the way a society like ours should be heading.  We should have a simplified code with a minimum number of rates applying.  This would be far more simple and fair and would remove those who have learnt how to defraud the system.  One of the reasons such people are capable of defrauding the system is the entanglement of rates which enables them to work the system to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Rather than talk about those who are defrauding the system, we should talk about the system itself which in many ways has encouraged people to defraud it.  This is essentially wrong.  We make a mistake when we talk about poverty, unemployment and taxation as if they were all distinct and separate areas from each other which are not interlinked in some way.  I believe that the three of them are linked, particularly in the Ireland of today.  The poverty of unemployment is not being properly addressed at all.  In many of the speeches I have heard in this House it would seem that poverty was in some way separate from unemployment. I believe that is not the case.  The new poor in Ireland are those who are unemployed. It is no good simply to find more money to throw at people who are in these appalling and unfortunate circumstances. That does not solve or in any way attempt to deal with the problem.  If you are going to seriously deal with the problems of social justice, unemployment and taxation you must fundamentally look at what is causing them.</P>
    <P>One of the major things that is causing the problem, and it has been identified by everybody, is the huge levels of taxation <Col N="1180" /> today.  Taxation in Ireland is fundamentally a taxation on jobs and on work. The system should be geared towards a productive incentive taxation.  If you move in that direction you will get more productivity because the incentive will be there for it.  The eventual long term spinoff will be more jobs and in that way you will move people from the unemployment sphere and out of the poverty trap, which unfortunately many people find themselves in.</P>
    <P>I will turn to the area of the environment which touches on many different aspects of life today.  We have environmenal problems.  The problems which most affects tourism in Ireland is litter and public services such as public toilets. In many hotels and restaurants the standard of hygiene is extremely poor.  I believe education is the key to improvement in the area of the environment. People have to understand the impact that their attitudes and total disregard for the environment has eventually on their own lives and their own ability to earn a decent living in this country.  Over the past six months we have seen the horrendous pollution of our rivers.  A lot of this was caused by silage spills from a number of farms, but I hasten to add that it is not every single farmer who is polluting our rivers.  However, there are a few obvious culprits and it appears they are not taken to task over this.  The deterrents for such actions are not sufficient and they should be made to pay dearly for the total disregard for the law in regard to pollution.  It has a horrendous impact on many aspects of life in Ireland today and, in my opinion, it is a criminal act.</P>
    <P>In terms of local government in Ireland today, I do not know whether it really exists.  Local government has to operate under the cap-in-hand mentality of central Government which is a complete waste of time.  Local government is unable to function without finance and without control of its own finances it is even worse.  We have spoken about a local property tax.  I believe that if local government is to function properly, to be autonomous and to control and develop <Col N="1181" /> community life in its own area then it must have control of its own finances. That is the key component to successful local government.  I believe in the long term there must be a local property tax.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that central Government, which is crumbling under the weight of demands from local government and is unable to cope because the finances are not there, can succeed in that area.  However, unfortunately at present with the huge levels of direct taxation, particularly on the PAYE sector, one could not conceive of putting another tax on top of what they are already trying to pay.  In a restructured taxation system with a substantially lower base rate than at present, I believe that at that juncture a move towards some form of local property tax would certainly be a move in the right direction.  It would benefit those in the local communities who can now see the lack of many of the facilites which were available ten years ago before rates were removed.  Funding was available locally for the infrastructural needs of those areas which is not there at present because the funds have disappeared. Central Government does not have the funds to properly fund local government. Communities who otherwise would be progressive and forward-looking are stymied because they are unable to operate in their own area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decentralisation programme which the Minister for Finance mentioned in his budget speech.  This has been talked about for many years and is a major step in the right direction.  The Minister announced that phase two of the programme is to begin shortly.  My own constituency of Waterford was mentioned and I am very pleased about that. I would like to know what plans the Minister has for that particular area and whether it has been decided which Department is going to the constituency. I would like to know if the inspectors who were investigating the area have found suitable premises or has it been decided to build new premises.  I would like to know the results of their investigations. It is a very important matter for us in that area as it is in the Minister's own <Col N="1182" /> constituency of Sligo where the programme is underway at present.  Obviously we are anxious to get the programme underway in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Whereas the budget has set out certain parameters, I think it remains to be seen over the next 12 months and in the years ahead if they will grasp the real need for changing the structures themselves.  The Government are doing well in certain areas with the restraint in the public finances, but if they can get real value for money out of the systems that are in operation I think that will be the key to totally turning the economy around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget presented to the House last week is perhaps the clearest evidence to date of this Government's determination to continue pursuing the objectives which we set ourselves when we took office less than 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>As you know, those objectives incorporate an integrated strategy for dealing with the problem of the public finances by stabilising and then reducing the national debt-GNP ratio and at the same time creating the environment for sustained, longterm economic growth.  These strategies are mutually consistent.  It is now abundantly clear that high levels of borrowing have an adverse effect on interest rates and contribute to a reduction in new investment and economic growth.  Loss of confidence in the economy and reduced employment prospects for our people are inevitable consequences.  The Government have now broken that particular vicious circle and are determined to ensure that it does not close again.</P>
      <P>I am pleased this morning to acknowledge the recognition which has been given to the Government's efforts by the leaders of the business community as reflected in the poll in <i>Business and Finance.</i> This indicated that 90 per cent of the chief executives of organisations in this country recognise the great work being done by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that economic performance over the past year proves our twin strategies to be correct.  We have now demonstrated clearly that tackling <Col N="1184" /> the imbalance in the public finances and the promotion of economic growth can be achieved simultaneously.  Last year we set ourselves specific budgetary targets for 1987: the current budget deficit was to be reduced from 8.5 per cent to 6.9 per cent of GNP; total Exchequer borrowing was to be reduced from 13 per cent to 10.7 per cent while public sector borrowing was to be reduced from the untenable level of 15.2 per cent of GNP, the rate during the term of the last Coalition, to 12.5 per cent.  This Government's painstaking review and monitoring of all aspects of public expenditure have ensured the achievement of our targets. We have re-established credibility by meeting budget targets.  We have demonstrated the determination of the Government to follow through on their decisions.  We have generated respect and confidence which will be reflected in higher capital inflows, higher investment, renewed confidence and new employment.</P>
    <P>A large degree of confidence has already been restored as evidenced in particualar by the acceptance of the financial markets of our policies.  Interest rates have fallen continuously since this Government took office and are now at their lowest levels for 15 years and confidence in our economic future is such that the trend is still downwards.  The benefits for all sectors of the economy, particularly industry and mortgage holders, are obvious.</P>
    <P>Overall, economic performance last year was very encouraging.  A significant first step was taken towards achieving budgetary adjustment and, in addition, a considerable pick-up in the level of economic growth was achieved despite the direct short-term impact on domestic demand of Government actions in the area of public expenditure.  Manufacturing output increased by about 10 per cent compared with 2.75 per cent in each of the previous two years.  Inflation for the year at little more than 3 per cent was the lowest for 20 years and is set to decline further in 1988.  The external position improved considerably.  The <Col N="1185" /> trade surplus for 1987 was over £1.5 billion &mdash; an all-time record and more than double the 1986 surplus.  Tourism earnings also improved on last year.  Overall, the balance of payments on current account moved into modest surplus for the first time since 1967.  There was a good recovery in machinery and equipment investment last year which rose by over 4 per cent.  Agricultural output and incomes showed a considerable rebound from the poor outturns in 1985 and 1986. Overall, despite the impact of continuing fiscal adjustment, GDP growth may have exceeded 3.5 per cent in 1987.</P>
    <P>These encouraging results give us grounds for renewed confidence and optimism and demonstrate that the process of adjustment which we have embarked upon must be and will be continued.  The record trade surplus last year, for example, represent a vote of confidence by buyers in the countries with whom we trade and demonstrate their willingness to buy more and more of our products. The vicious circle which I spoke about earlier is steadily being replaced by this Government with a set of policies which will ensure our economic recovery and that our financial and economic sovereignty is preserved.</P>
    <P>The placing of the public finances on a sound footing is now accepted by almost all shades of political opinion and economic commentators and there is now a high degree of consensus that our policies are the correct ones and should be pursued. The position with respect to public borrowing and taxation which prevailed before this Government took office could not be sustained.  In this context the Government recognised at the outset that it was not feasible to effect the necessary reduction in borrowings through further general increases in taxation.  The adjustment had to come, therefore, primarily through savings in public expenditure. To this end the Government have taken steps to rationalise essential State services in order to ensure that duplication and overlapping are eliminated, that resources are not absorbed in unnecessary administration and that financial resources are allocated so as to provide <Col N="1186" /> cost-effective services which will maximise returns to the economy and give taxpayers the best value for their money. It is a priority of this Government, however, that sacrifices to be made are broadly and fairly spread across all sections of society while protecting the position of the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>The abridged Estimates for 1988 published last year underline our commitment to reducing Exchequer expenditure.  Savings are being made right across the board because there is no alternative, but I must emphasise that these savings are distributed fairly with special attention to the needs of the poorer sections of our community.  Overall, the target for 1988 for the Exchequer borrowing requirement is £1,457 million or 8.2 per cent of GNP, a reduction of 2.1 percentage points on the 1987 outturn and is the lowest since 1973-74.  The comparable percentage in 1986 was 13.2.  The current budget deficit for this year is estimted at £1,125 million or 6.3 per cent of GNP and represents a reduction of 2.3 percentage points on the 1986 outturn, the lowest percentage figure since 1980. Public sector borrowing will be further reduced from last year's outturn of 11.8 per cent of GNP to 9.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>A major achievement in 1987 was the conclusion by this Government of an agreement with the social partners on a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> embracing goals for fiscal adjustment, a plan for the evolution of pay, sectoral development policies, taxation policy and the pursuit of social equity.  The programme recognised that a fiscal policy which faces up to the financial realities is the key to putting the economy back on the path to long term sustainable economic growth.  Simultaneously, however, the programme provides an opportunity that must not be missed for dealing with the enormous related problems of unemployment, excessive taxation and social equity.  It provides a basis for industrial peace and the climate and stability for enterprise to flourish.  Key areas of the economy which have undoubted potential for growth have been identified in the programme and these together with other <Col N="1187" /> realistic opportunities will be vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>The budget takes an important and significant step in implementing several of the specific initiatives included in the programme.  On taxaton, for example, this Government are determined to achieve much more effective collection and enforcement mechanisms and are moving towards a broader base for tax liability. Substantial progress has been made towards the Government's objective of having two thirds of taxpayers on the standard tax rate; in fact, the provisions in this budget will mean that almost 63 per cent of taxpayers will already be paying tax at the standard rate in the coming tax year.  As well as the extension of the 35 per cent tax band by £1,000 and £2,000 for single and married persons respectively, this budget provides for increases in the personal and PAYE allowances and for increases in the general and age exemption limits.  This package of income tax relief costing £91 million in 1988 and £152 million in a full year represents a substantial measure of relief for the hardpressed income tax payer.</P>
    <P>Measures are being introduced to improve tax administration, simplify tax assessment and collection, eliminate arrears and make life more difficult for the tax evader.  The self-employed, including farmers, will be subject to PRSI payments, initially at a rate of 3 per cent rising to 5 per cent in 1990-91.  Our policy to protect the underprivileged in our society and those on low incomes is evidenced by the decision to continue the community drug refund scheme and the long term illness scheme and by the provision to increase by 11 per cent the personal rate of long term urban unemployment assistance with <i>pro rata</i> increases in other personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>I do not intend in my intervention today to go through all the budgetary provisions announced last week by the Minister for Finance.  However, I think it must be crystal clear now to everybody <Col N="1188" /> in this House and to each and every citizen in this country that this Government are determined to maintain the necessary strategies commenced last year for the national benefit.  The ultimate rewards are indeed attractive: growth of our industry, prosperity of our commerce, more employment and better living standards for all our people.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the areas of my own responsibilities.  With regard to major future developments in the energy area, I intend to continue pursuing a programme as quickly as possible: first to reestablish Ireland as a prospective territory for further oil and gas exploration following on the amendments to the licensing terms which I announced last year; secondly, to press ahead with the extension of the natural gas grid northwards to Drogheda and Dundalk so as to extend the benefits of natural gas supply to industry, commerce and domestic consumers; thirdly, to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the energy State companies with a view to ensuring the best possible deal for all kinds of consumers.</P>
    <P>Because of the tremendous potential which it holds for our economy, the area of oil and gas exploration is, I can assure the House, an area to which top priority is being given.  While the potential of our offshore sedimentary basins for oil and gas reserves is great, unless exploration drilling is carried out and reserves defined, we cannot hope to realise that potential.  One of my principal priorities, therefore, on coming into office in March 1987 was to create the conditions and climate which would encourage the exploration companies to take a renewed interest in our offshore and to invest in meaningful exploration programmes. This Government want further commercial reserves of hydrocarbons in our offshore found and those reserves developed in a manner which recognises the realities of current and perspective oil market conditions, oil industry needs and the adequate protection of the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I announced in September 1987 radical changes to our oil <Col N="1189" /> and gas licensing terms designed to provide a much needed impetus to exploration in the Irish offshore by making the Irish terms very competitive with other European areas.  I will not reiterate the new terms which are well known by now.</P>
    <P>As a follow-up to my announcement of the new licensing terms I have met with representatives of exploration companies in order to further promote exploration offshore Ireland.  I am meeting a favourable response to the new terms.</P>
    <P>The next few years will be very important for exploration in Ireland.  This year's drilling programme will commence shortly and I wish the companies concerned every success with these wells.</P>
    <P>In the context of exploring for oil I have been reminding the industry that very sizeable reserves of oil have already been found in the deeper waters off the west coast and that considerable scope exists for a great deal more exploration work in that area.  Our Porcupine Basin has hitherto been under explored but I believe that the availability of the Porcupine report published last July should help greatly to rekindle interest.  The first 1988 well is scheduled to be drilled in the Porcupine and negotiations are at an advanced stage to licence other blocks in the Porcupine Basin.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that I will continue to take every step possible to promote interest in and exploration of our offshore areas and to ensure that, in the event of commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons, such indigenous reserves are developed with the utmost speed in the national interest.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of exploration I would like to briefly mention hard minerals.  There was a substantial increase in the number of applications for minerals prospecting licences in the latter half of 1987.  Zinc and lead remain a major target but, as the House will be aware, there is also significant activity in investigating the country's gold potential. One hundred and eleven new licences were issued in 1987 and I have approved the grant of a further 205 licences which are in the pipe-line towards issue.  This step up in exploration activity increases <Col N="1190" /> the prospects of new mine developments with the resultant increase in employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Despite lower oil prices and a more relaxed energy environment generally, I will continue to press ahead with our energy conservation programme.  This programme is designed to improve the awareness of energy efficiency and to reduce our dependence on imported fuels.  It also aims to keep the message of energy conservation alive because I am well aware that in times of low oil prices the notion of energy efficiency may be forgotten.</P>
    <P>The programme consists of a range of advisory and information services for industry and for the public, as well as the provision of electricity audits and grants for fuel efficiency surveys.  The range of services which comprise the programme will continue to result in energy savings and, hence, cash savings.  There can be no doubt but that energy consciousness and conservation contributes in no small way to the overall competitiveness of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In relation to electricity, as announced in the budget by the Minister for Finance, we have arranged with the ESB to lower their prices by 5 per cent across the board. This reduction will offset the effect on domestic customers of the 5 per cent VAT on electricity and will result in a real reduction of 5 per cent to industrial customers.  Coupled with three decreases in electricity prices over the past two years, this latest decrease brings Irish electricity prices further in line with those in other EC countries and will help to increase the competitiveness of Irish industry.  The fact that Irish electricity prices are now close to the EC average is a remarkable achievement by the ESB when one considers that many European countries draw their energy supplies from cheap sources such as nuclear and hydro. ESB costs will be kept under continuous review and I can again assure the House that any opportunity for continuing the downward trend in electricity prices will be availed of.</P>
    <P>The major development side of the ESB has now been completed and while <Col N="1191" /> there is a continuing improvement on the distribution system to be effected, additional generating capacity is unlikely to be required before the end of the century.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware I recently introduced the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1987, and they will shortly have an opportunity of debating it.  The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the ESB to set up subsidiary companies and to engage in the wholesale coal trade from Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>The board continue, with the assistance of the FEOGA grant scheme to improve the system's supply to farmers and further work on this EC assisted scheme will be continued.  It has been of significant benefit to thousands of farmers and considerable further work will be done.</P>
    <P>Natural Gas now supplies nearly 14 per cent of Ireland's primary energy needs. During 1987 BGE delivered approximately 59,000 million standard cubic feet to their customers.  The amount of gas which BGE may obtain annually from Marathon, 60,000 million standard cubic feet, is governed by a decision of the Supreme Court in 1986.  During 1987 the price of natural gas to industry and the utilities fell in line with the continuing fall in world oil prices.  Sales of natural gas to the utilities and industry now represents 27 per cent of total sales.</P>
    <P>The legislation which I brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas in June of last year gives BGE the freedom to engage in the gas distribution business which they did not previously have.  The acquisition by BGE of Dublin Gas has been completed and I look forward to a prosperous future for natural gas in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The order which enables BGE to operate as a gas distributor can be amended from time to time to allow them to participate in gas distribution in other parts of the country.  In this way I am confident we will see the development of an integrated national gas industry run to the highest standards of safety and efficiency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other gas utilities, <Col N="1192" /> the Limerick and Clonmel link-ups and conversion programmes have now been completed.  Kilkenny gas has been integrated into BGE and satisfactory interim arrangements have been made pending the upgrading of the network.  BGE are now also owners of Waterford Gas&mdash; they formerly being a subsidiary company of Dublin Gas.  BGE are at present examining the feasibility and economics of using natural gas in Waterford.</P>
    <P>Last April the Government approved the construction of a north-eastern pipe-line project subject to receiving EC regional funding.  The EC approval has recently been obtained.</P>
    <P>The line which will extend to Drogheda and Dundalk will also have spur lines to population centres and to the horticultural industry in north County Dublin and other large industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an enlightened approach.  Work on this project is already underway and it is expected that construction of the pipeline will be completed before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>During the construction phase of the project which will last about five to six months, an average of 200 jobs will be created, giving a significant boost to the construction industry.  Board Gáis Éireann have always made a considerable effort to maximise the contribution of Irish goods and services to their pipeline projects and I anticipate that a similar contribution to the economy will be made by this project. The estimated total cost of the entire project is of the order of £30 million approximately.  I expect that the availability of natural gas in the region will prove an asset in attracting new industrial and commercial opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my portfolio I have the utmost concern for safety issues.  Foremost among these is the matter of nuclear safety and the transboundary effects of the operation of nuclear plants which I have dealt <Col N="1193" /> with at length in reply to various parliamentary questions tabled in this House.</P>
    <P>Provision for £250,000 to enable the commencement of the phasing in of an emergency plan to deal with the effects of a nuclear accident, has been included in my Department's Estimate for 1988. This is an indication that despite the serious financial situation the Government are determined to do as much as possible to protect the Irish population from the effects of any nuclear accident. As I said in this House last week, I will be publishing details of the plan shortly.</P>
    <P>I have allocated £895,000 to expenditure by the Nuclear Energy Board in 1988.  This grant-in-aid will be reallocated to the new Radiological Protection Institute when they are established.  I intend to bring the necessary legislation before the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to gas, in the year since the tragic events at Raglan House we have seen the publication of various reports related to safety in the gas industry.  I am pleased to say that by the end of February all of the recommendations of the Cremer and Warner report relating to Dublin Gas, will be implemented.  The gas related recommendations of the other reports will all be implemented within the required timescales.  The monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations in the various reports is continuing in my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, I was pleased to announce in October last the completion of a portfolio of 34 gas standards produced by the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The standards cover all aspects of the supply and usage of both natural gas and LPG.  The 1987 target of 25 kilometres of mains and service renewal in Dublin has been achieved.  The target for 1988 is 100 kilometres.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have made a very useful contribution to the economic and development life of this State since the late forties and never more so than in recent years when the cost of imported energy soared for a time to a multiple of four times what it was.  After a few good years of profit, and an acceptable <Col N="1194" /> arrangement with the ESB, the board fell victim to the very adverse weather conditions of the years 1985 and 1986.  In consequence the board's finances were badly hit and their reserves of harvested turf heavily depleted, except for briquettes which were conserved for the domestic market.  Attention is now focussed on the tasks of replacing these reserves and of endeavouring to rehabilitate the board's financial position.  The loss of revenue as a result of the two bad production seasons was £33 million.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the board achieved over 102 per cent in their target for milled peat and 105 per cent in their sod peat production.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be engaging consultants to examine the board's financial situation and their operations with a view to maximising their overall efficiency and identifying new products and services which can be delivered on a profitable basis.</P>
    <P>Under the EC Valoren programme an amount in the region of £19 million will be used to fund a package of measures compiled by the Department of Energy which includes the development by Bord na Móna of additional bogland, principally in the west and west Midlands; the development by the ESB of smallscale hydro-electric facilities at 10 locations in Cork, Kerry, Leitrim and Donegal; the promotion of energy conservation and the more efficient use of energy, particularly our indigenous energy; further evaluation of the potential for wind energy applications at suitable sites in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The work involved in this programme of measures will span the five years of the Valoren programme itself and it is estimated that 600 jobs will be created under the scheme.  The total cost of the programme is almost £35 million inclusive of EC funding.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation continues to operate the Whitegate refinery and to make a valuable contribution to the economy of the country in the purchase and refining of crude oil.  It also plays a valuable role by maintaining stocks which contribute to the oil stock holding obligations placed upon <Col N="1195" /> Ireland by the EC and the IEA for security of supply purposes.  The INPC also maintains the Whiddy Oil Terminal where there is provision for the storage of 1 million tonnes of oil.</P>
    <P>As I said recently at Question Time, I will make a detailed statement about the Nigerian negotiations, if and when the business is satisfactorily concluded, at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>This Government have a progressive policy and programme for development of forestry which we are now implementing. We are convinced that this is an area which will contribute significantly to overall national development.  There is a compelling case for this development.  A dynamic forestry policy will generate further employment, improve the balance of payments, and redistribute incomes into regional areas as well as having a tourism related aspect through wildlife conservation and amenity development. Forestry is also one of the key areas identified in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as having real potential for growth and increased employment.</P>
    <P>The policy of developing, expanding and restructuring the country's forest resource &mdash; in order to maximise its benefits &mdash; is continuing.  This has resulted in the development of broad strategies geared to achieving this policy and include such measures as: development of a semi-State company to operate the commercial activities of State forestry; expanding the level of forest planting in both the State and private sector; increasing domestic and export market shares for Irish timber; encouraging the establishment of new industries to use forest products.</P>
    <P>Preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to the establishment of the new forestry State company is well advanced and it is intended to introduce it at a very early date.  This will be a commercial operation.  I am happy to acknowledge that our activities in this connection have a wide degree of consensus.</P>
    <P>It is my aim to increase even further <Col N="1196" /> the record national level of planting achieved in 1987.  Last year some 8,000 hectares were planted by the Forest Service and 3,000 hectares by the private sector &mdash; a national total of 11,000 hectares. This year the State will increase its planting to 10,000 hectares.  This dramatic improvement, which reverses the declining planting patterns of recent years, has been made feasible by the Government's decision to plant areas of Bord na Móna cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>In addition, an active programme of encouraging further private sector forest development is being pursued.  Domestic grants for conifer and broadleaf planting have been increased to £500 and £800 per hectare respectively.  The Forest Service will continue to encourage forest development under the EC assisted Western Package.  Proposals for more EC aid which are now before the Commission will, if successful, further increase the level of incentives for private forestry development.</P>
    <P>The rapid production of timber from our State forests has begun.  This year the Forest Service will produce a total of 1.4 million cubic metres &mdash; this will rise to 2 million cubic metres by 1992 and 3 million cubic metres by the year 2000.  Considering that with current output of 1.3 million cubic metres Irish timber holds a 50 per cent share of the domestic construction market and is also impacting considerably on the export market, the prospects for forestry contributing further to an expanded wood-using industrial base, job creation, import substitution and foreign currency earning within a few years are now very real indeed.</P>
    <P>The Forest Service is determined, together with the wood industries, that through adequate research Irish timber is used for the highest value end uses and that by good marketing it maximises its market share of both the domestic and export markets.</P>
    <P>I am confident, judging by the Forest Service's successes last year, that under a commercial company structure this service has the necessary competitive drive to enable it to fulfil the Government's <Col N="1197" /> faith in its ability to manage and expand this resource for the good of this country. Such successes include increased planting of 1,000 hectares; increase in production to 1.3 million cubic metres and improved revenue earnings of £20 million.  The dramatic improvement in performance which these figures reveal can be judged by a comparison with output and revenue performance in 1975 and 1980 when total production and revenue stood at 288,000 cubic metres &mdash; £2.3 million and 530,000 cubic metres &mdash; £6.6 million respectively.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann's accounts for 1986-87 showed a loss of £8 million and the company expects that the current year's accounts, when published, will for the first time show a profit.  The impact which the company has made on the State's telecommunications system is noticeable in the increased level of connections made each year since vesting day, fewer faults and lower call failure rates, not to mention the advanced technology represented by the company's mobile radio telephone system, its packet switched data network and its electronic mail box service.  Further new services are in the pipeline and the current outlook for BTÉ is distinctly bright.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for BTÉ in this year's budget is £135 million.  This causes no drain on the Exchequer as the money will be found partly from BTÉ's own resources and partly by borrowing through the company's financial subsidiary Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd.  The Telecommunications Capital Programme will be used mainly to improve the quality of service, to provide for business growth and to exploit new business opportunities.  New business development depends on sustaining the technological advantage achieved through the introduction of digital systems under the Accelerated Development Programme.  Investment in technology will continue to be necessary to maintain Ireland's competitive position in the growing market for information based services.</P>
    <P>The Government attach considerable importance to the development of an international financial services sector in <Col N="1198" /> Ireland and intend to pursue this matter vigorously.  This is made possible by the substantial investment and major technological advances in telecommunications. Ireland has a number of strengths which make it an ideal location for this type of development.  I would mention among these our time zone location, the English language which is the language of international finance, our sophisticated professional infrastructure particularly in accounting, banking and law, our highly educated and &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; workforce, the existing hardware and software industries and our digital telecommunications network.</P>
    <P>The disparity in rates for international calls from this country compared to charges for calls to Ireland originating abroad has been well documented and widely commented upon and it is central to Telecom Éireann's strategy to bring these charges closer into balance.  Telecom Éireann will shortly be making an announcement about substantial reductions in charges for international calls, an announcement which will be widely welcomed by the business community.</P>
    <P>An Post's allocation for 1988 under the Public Capital Programme is £8 million. There will be no draw on the Exchequer as An Post will provide all the necessary funds from its own resources and borrowing. The funds will be spent on the further improvement and extension of post office accommodation, vehicle replacement, security facilities and the provision of equipment.</P>
    <P>An Post is now in its fifth year of operation. Since it commenced operations in 1984 the company has achieved improving financial results each year.  Losses in 1984 and 1985 were replaced by a profit of £700,000 in 1986.  Preliminary results indicate that there was a further significant improvement in the financial performance of the company in 1987.</P>
    <P>Basic postal rates have been increased only once, in March, 1986, since An Post commenced operations.  There was no rate increase in 1987, nor will there be any in 1988.</P>
    <P>The competence and capacity of An <Col N="1199" /> Post to carry out effectively not only traditional functions but also new ones has been well demonstrated by the highly successful operation of the national Lottery. The national lottery's new game &ldquo;Lotto&rdquo;, which is still at the development stage, is likely to create up to 40 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important developments taking place in the broadcasting sector which will also make their modest contribution to the generation of economic activity and employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to RTE, the establishment of a new long-wave radio service is specifically adverted to in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as one of the measures to be undertaken by the State-sponsored sector and arrangements are proceeding apace on this project.  While the direct employment content of this project is relatively small &mdash; the station will have a staff of about 25 or so &mdash; the real benefit from this project will accrue through what, in effect, will be its export earnings.  The station will have extensive coverage of the UK mainland and one of its major objectives is the generation of revenue through the sale of advertising air time in the UK.  Likewise, the service will be a useful medium for Irish firms seeking to promote sales in the UK.</P>
    <P>There are proposals currently before this House embodied in the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987 to establish a new independent national radio service as well as local and neighbourhood radio services.  The provision and operation of the radio services which we envisage will, I believe, create considerable employment opportunities &mdash; as much as 500 to 600 jobs in the medium term &mdash; and this is one of the reasons I am most anxious to have the Bill enacted and have the work get underway.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, our priorities in Government continue to be: to reduce dependence on borrowing which has been crippling our efforts to get adequate growth in the economy; to improve the environment for more investment and <Col N="1200" /> higher employment; to reform the taxation system and protect the living standards of those on low incomes and to develop our natural resources properly.</P>
    <P>The budget measures, together with all the other strands of this Government's policies, will build upon the restoration of confidence which has already manifested itself in our country, hasten us on the road to full economic recovery and stability, provide employment for our people and hope for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any of us would deny that this budget has gone a long way to achieving its primary objective and I do not believe and never have believed in the politics of confrontation that will attempt to decry all the efforts that have been made by any particular Government.  The Minister who is now departing would perhaps have recognised that in the past.</P>
      <P>However, I want to draw attention to the crisis within our society that is shared by the three parties that now make up the majority political consensus in Dáil Éireann.  This budget is not about creating employment; it is about solving the fiscal problems of debt in our society.  In choosing to go down one particular road for which there is clearly a majority consensus, the Government have effectively abandoned the prospect of increasing employment in our society for at least the next two to three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to international statistics, Ireland is the 27th richest country in a world of 160 nations.  In this rich country, one in three of our population is dependent on social welfare and the great majority of those who are so dependent live below the poverty line.  Poverty is now a major and growing part of Irish social reality.  So, tragically, is ostentatious wealth.  We are well on the way to becoming what an English commentator has recently described as &ldquo;a society of the haves, the have nots and the have lots&rdquo;.  In a major pre-budget submission, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and the Catholic Justice Commission asked each Member of this <Col N="1201" /> House to accept as a fundamental principle that there should be no poor in Irish society.  That is a principle to which every Member in this House is willing to pay lip service but, tragically, as the budget that we are discussing unfolds, it is becoming clearer by the day that the submission of the conference has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The Irish Labour Party have argued for years that the gap between rich and poor is not necessary.  It is that gap which has left so many of our people without a home, without health, without education and without jobs &mdash; the famous phrase of Jim Larkin, &ldquo;It is the gap between what ought to be and what is&rdquo;.  The principal mechanism available to us for closing that gap is public expenditure.  The approach to public expenditure as it has been followed by Fianna Fáil however laudable it might be in banking circles, means that that gap is actually being widened day by day.  If we are serious about poverty, now is the time, even in our present circumstances, to consider a radically different approach to this problem.  There is considerable evidence that the payment of low levels of social welfare to people who must remain in enforced idleness if they are to receive it is dehumanising. There is increasing evidence also that the very lack of work itself is damaging to health and welfare.  Our society, with all the wealth at our disposal, is capable of overcoming this problem.</P>
    <P>In many other societies in Europe, radical ideas are now being considered.  I should like to put on the record of this House one which we now need to consider if we are to pay more than lip service to solving the problem of unemployment. One of these ideas worthy of very serious consideration &mdash; and I believe a budget debate is where such thoughts should be aired &mdash; is the idea of a basic social income payable, as of right, to every citizen of the State who is not currently employed and who is between the ages of 18 and 66 years.  It would replace the present social welfare benefit system and would act as a guarantee, irrespective of circumstances, to anyone caught in the trap of poverty.  It would give a real <Col N="1202" /> meaning to the term &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo;, which is too often used by those on the right in Irish politics to suggest that we should reduce levels of welfare to make badly paid work attractive to those who are forced to stay idle.</P>
    <P>In return for a basic social income there is a wide range of activities available and now ignored which can involve thousands of unemployed people in useful and fulfilling activities, doing, in effect, work worth doing, to borrow a phrase from a previous time.  Some examples of this would include a programme of rural tree planting to maintain the wild life habitat and so develop and conserve our tourism industry; a programme of planting in urban areas, not just in Dublin city under Crann sa Chathair but right across the urban landscape of this island; the systematic restoration of our canal system to provide for tourism and recreation, as well as a cheap system of bulk transport if that were required, and a major insulation of all public buildings; a major assault on all urban dereliction and finally &mdash; the Minister for Energy and Communications has just referred to this &mdash; a massive increase in the programme of afforestation to bring Ireland up to European levels.  I calculated that approximately 10,000 hectares a year would achieve this and would provide a basis for an enlarged and substantial timber and paper industry.</P>
    <P>My basic point is this &mdash; and I welcome very much the increase of 11 per cent in the moneys for the long term unemployed but we are forcing people to stay out of work in order to benefit from such an increase &mdash; no matter how dramatic the percentage increase may appear relative to the rate of inflation, in absolute terms the amounts of money about which we are talking are ludicrously small.  Our society under various Governments has simply failed to tackle the problem of unemployment.  This budget will actually increase that problem.  This Government, perhaps the first in the history of the State, are borrowing taxpayers' money to create unemployment in the area of the public service.  This Government readily recognise that they are not <Col N="1203" /> in a position in 1988 to do anything other than suggest that unemployment is likely to increase.  I am not in the business of bashing our Government and I do not believe that this Government, it they use the available instrument open to them, are capable of doing anything other than introduce a budget similar to the one before us.</P>
    <P>The problem is not unique to Ireland. Right through the whole of the EC despite the fact that we are getting richer by the year as a Community, levels of unemployment are increasing and they are dramatically increasing in those member states within the Community that have a growing labour force population. No matter what kind of political attacks we may make upon each other, it is quite clear that we have entered into a new phase of economic development within our society where, as we have seen in the private sector, including large open, competitive companies, in order for them to remain competitive and in order for them to increase production, they have had to reduce their labour force.  In any sector of industry that one wants to talk about the paradox of modern society is evident.  We can produce more with fewer people and, indeed, in order to produce more at competitive rates, we have to get rid of large sections of the people currently employed in those industries.  This is not peculiar to our society.  It is not peculiar to our economy.  It is commonplace in all the economies of the OECD.</P>
    <P>If we are to respond to the considered submission of the Irish Justice Commission and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors called, <i>Widening the Poverty Gap,</i> we have to tear up the Victorian rules that underpin the social welfare system and replace them with an enlargement of a concept of a basic social income which already has a model in place in the form of the social employment scheme introduced by the previous Government and which has continued to win support from the present Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> If the work I am talking about were to be undertaken under the framework of local authorities, Government Departments or voluntary organisations, up to 80,000 people could be taken off the live register and given meaningful activity as well as the 11 per cent increase in the unemployment benefit which they will receive sometime in July.</P>
    <P>Budget debates are occasions when we talk at each other but I invite the Minister and this House to begin to look coldly at the reality.  Our society will never solve the problem of unemployment within our current frame of reference.  We would need to acquire levels of economic growth of the order of 8 per cent to 9 per cent for a period of five to ten years in order to generate the level of activity that would possibly increase jobs, but there is no guarantee.  Unless we come up with a radically new approach which tells everybody they have a place in society and that that place will be guaranteed a meaningful activity related to a basic social income if they are unable to find economic employment, then our society will fall apart and fail.  That is the basic challenge which confronts us.</P>
    <P>I would like to read into the Official Report the substantive article written in <i>The Irish Times</i>, 28 January 1988, by the economics editor, Maev-Ann Wren, when she summarised very fairly what this budget was.  She said:</P>
    <P>This budget takes over £300 million out of the economy, which represents both its strength and its weakness.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to recognise those strengths because this Government are attempting to deal with the problem of our debt.  The Labour Party have never denied that there was a debt problem.  The strength of the Government's resolve, is represented by the Minister for Health who is here this morning. He is undertaking a difficult task in relation to health expenditure &mdash; more difficult than when he was in Opposition and thought that the then Minister would be able to tackle this problem painlessly &mdash; and the £300 million he has taken out of his budget, plus the Estimates, <Col N="1205" /> represents the strength of the budget at one level but paradoxically it represents the weakness of the budget as it represents employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy said in his opening paragraph that the budget presented to the House last week was perhaps the clearest evidence to date of this Government's determination to continue pursuing the objectives which they set themselves when they took office less than 12 months ago.  Those objectives were not set during the election campaign, and they bear no resemblance to any of the promises made or hinted at to the electorate.  Until such time as we, collectively, have the honesty to recognise that we have to do something radical about unemployment, we will continue to have this problem as well as the associated problems of poverty, alienation, crime and dereliction with which we are all too familiar.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a serious and substantial article written in the same issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> by two senior economists of the ESRI.  I do this because this Government, and particularly the Taoiseach, have frequently referred to the ESRI and the ESRI model of the Irish economy as the basis of reference for Government policy.  I want to put on the record some of the comments these two economists, who are responsible in part for that model, have made in their assessment of the impact this budget will have on the economy for 1988:</P>
    <P>This Budget and the Estimates of last November are primarily aimed at achieving stability in the public finances. The Exchequer borrowing requirement should be 8.2 per cent of GNP at the end of this year and by 1990, at 6 per cent of GNP, will be within the target zone of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The debt/GNP ratio will rise slightly during 1988 but will stabilise next year and fall thereafter.</P>
    <P>There will be no growth in real GNP during 1988 due primarily to the deflationary effects of public spending cuts.  This Budget does not change the <Col N="1206" /> picture.  In the absence of further major deflationary action in 1989, we can anticipate resumed growth in the economy next year, leading to greater revenue buoyancy and further stabilisation of the public finances. However, the prospects for any major reduction in the numbers unemployed are poor, and some 7,000 more people will be without jobs partially due to this Budget and its associated expenditure cuts.  Emigration will further increase.</P>
    <P>This Budget is somewhat unusual in that the policy stance for 1988 was announced last Autumn in the Estimates and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  We turn to yesterday's speech more in the spirit of hearing again a favourite opera: the music and plot are familiar to us by now but the maestro's interpretation yields additional insight and pleasure. What yesterday's Budget did was to confirm previous decisions of the Government on expenditure and make marginal adjustments to the tax system.  Both the increased provision for social welfare and the income tax concessions were more generous than had been expected, providing for increases above the inflation rate. However, the cost of these measures was more than offset by increases in other taxes, such as the levy on pension funds, and more rapid collection of income and corporation taxes outstanding.</P>
    <P>While attention naturally focuses on its immediate effects, we must look to the medium-term for the rationale of this Budget.  Three aspects are of particular importance; the deflationary effects of the expenditure cuts, the possibility of renewed growth in the private sector, and the likely developments in interest rates, savings and the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Firstly, where cuts in numbers employed in the public sector result in a reduction in the level of quality of services, the community as a whole is worse off.  Some of those quitting the public sector may leave the active labour force (i.e., retire or emigrate). <Col N="1207" /> However, others will either add directly to the numbers unemployed or indirectly by taking jobs which might have gone to other workers.  The net effect will be a significant increase in unemployment this year.</P>
    <P>The cuts also have adverse indirect effects.  Fewer people employed in 1988 means a lower wage bill and reduced consumer expenditure. Analysis using the ESRI's macro-economic model indicates that the cutbacks will reduce the 1988 growth rate of GNP to zero.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the reduction in public sector activity will be compensated to some extent by an increase in private sector profitability and activity.  A general rise in unemployment, accompanied by decreased job security for those in work, will tend to moderate wage demands throughout the economy. This will help improve the competitive position of manufacturing industry and traded services (such as tourism) and lead to increased growth. Such growth will be slow to materialise since investment decisions take time to plan and implement, particularly while the investors are themselves affected by the adverse short term economic climate.  The changes in the corporation tax provisions may result in a temporary spurt in investment in early 1989, but should have no lasting effect. All indications are that private sector growth rates from 1989 onwards will be well above the dismal experience of the first half of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Budget will have a major effect on the financial sector and on interest rates in particular.  We are already benefiting from the downward pressure on interest rates arising from the expected reduction in Government borrowing and the growing balance of payments surplus.  The fact that the cut in borrowing is, if anything, greater than expected will reinforce this tendency. Barring major disruption in world financial markets, we should see further interest rate reductions in the medium term which will give an <Col N="1208" /> additional boost to Irish competitiveness. However, it will take some considerable time to repair the ravages of the exceptionally high real interest rates of recent years and we will not see investment and employment picking up until 1989 or 1990.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacSharry's task was not to be envied.  He clearly faced painful tradeoffs in his efforts to restore stability to the State's finances.  His overriding objective was to stabilise the debt-GNP ratio so as to break out of a vicious circle of ever-rising debt, an increasing tax burden, loss of competitiveness and spiralling un-employment. The price of achieving debt stability is higher unemployment in the short term.</P>
    <P>In bringing in his budget, Mr. MacSharry has opted clearly for fiscal adjustment by expenditure cuts.  Such cuts take longer to reduce borrowing than do increases in taxation.  Furthermore, the cost of the public sector redundancy package is high.  Nevertheless, by 1989 and subsequently, when the up-front costs of the cuts are paid, the economy should bounce back and the Exchequer borrowing requirement will fall continuously in future years if public expenditure can be held constant in real terms.</P>
    <P>If Mr. MacSharry had opted for a policy of large tax increases there would have been a bigger initial reduction of borrowing but repeated doses of the same medicine might well have been needed.  A tax induced wage spiral could have further eroded Ireland's precarious competitiveness position.</P>
    <P>Finally while making ritual and well meaning noises, Mr. MacSharry has failed to tackle tax reform.  The limited reduction in depreciation allowances is to be welcomed.  However, this does not change the situation, high-lighted by the OECD, that the tax system is severely biased against employment.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of Section 23 relief for building and the extension of corporate tax allowances for commercial development in suburban areas <Col N="1209" /> (a piece of creative fiscal gerrymandering) means that the tax base has been further diluted.  In introducing a special levy on pension funds, the Minister has recognised that there is a problem in the taxation of financial institutions.  However, the introduction of temporary levies is not the way to deal with the problem.  The answer lies in treating all forms of income on a consistent basis for tax purposes.</P>

      <P>Continuing distortions of the tax system have very real costs since the increased tax burden falls elsewhere. The loss of efficiency and output from the highly taxed areas of economic activity may greatly outweigh the gains from these exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for allowing me to read that into the record.  It is a succinct article by John Bradley and John FitzGerald from the very source to which the Government frequently refer as the Authority which has underpinned their economic strategy. In essence, it says that the Government, with all the strength they have commanded with the support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, may put through an enormously expensive and difficult to accept public package of massive expenditure cuts and they may succeed in 1991 and 1992 in sorting out our fiscal problems and rebalancing the books but that it will be at the cost of employment. At the end of the day, with a balanced set of books, there will be an increased problem of unemployment. We cannot allow one to be postponed at <Col N="1210" /> the expense of the other.  There is no necessity to say to the unemployed and the poor that until such time as our books are balanced they must wait.</P>
    <P>As the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors said, the two must go hand in hand and if this country, which is the 27th richest nation in the community of 160 nations cannot do that simultaneously, then we should look at the entire economic system to which we cling and ask oursleves if there is not a better way to give effect to the principle that there should be no poverty in our rich society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past ten months, the measures introduced by the Government to correct the countries serious financial problems have shown tangible results.  Exchequer borrowing has been greatly reduced, interest rates have fallen, as has inflation, and there is renewed confidence in the Irish economy both at home and abroad. We have demonstrated our ability and commitment, to break out of the cycle of deficit financing that has had a crippling effect on our economy in recent years.</P>
      <P>The full details in relation to the Government's fiscal policy were outlined in the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement.  Nevertheless, it is important to reflect on the real financial and economic improvements which have taken place under this Government in such a short timespan.  The current budget deficit in 1987 at £1,180 million was £20 million less than originally planned. Exchequer borrowing, a reduction of which is a key element of Government strategy, was also inside target by £72 million.  The current deficit of 6.8 per cent of GNP was the lowest in eight years and Exchequer borrowing was the lowest in 11 years.  In addition, economic growth in 1987 was in excess of 3.5 per cent and was considerably better than forecasted earlier in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget reiterates the Government's intention to continue with their objective of improving the public finances <Col N="1211" /> while at the same time developing the economy.  It also very clearly shows the Government's commitment to protect the less well off in our community.</P>
    <P>This latter commitment is reflected by the fact that additional resources for the health services, over and above the October Book of Estimates provision are now being provided for.  Provision has been made for a 3 per cent increase in allowances to disabled persons, the blind, and in respect of handicapped children living at home while £11 million extra is being provided to ensure continuation of the community drug refund scheme and the long term illness scheme.</P>
    <P>Later in my speech I will be referring in greater detail to these schemes and to changes in the disabled drivers' schemes announced by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget, total health spending in 1988 will amount to just below £1,300 million.  While this is slightly less than the provision for 1987, I am satisfied that in all the circumstances, it is a generous provision when account is taken of the full year effect of measures adopted in 1987. These measures will contribute in no small way, to the health agencies' ability to contain expenditure within the approved limits in the current year.</P>
    <P>Last year was a difficult year for health boards and voluntary hospitals partly because of the unavoidably late notification of their allocations.  Indeed, health agencies responded well to the challenge in 1987 which was presented to them in managing and ensuring that services would be available generally to meet genuine need.  It is important that such a contribution be acknowledged and placed on record.  The early notification last October of the 1988 allocations to agencies was clearly an assistance to health boards and voluntary hospitals to adopt a strategy of service delivery consistent with the financial reality we must operate in.</P>
    <P>I have advised the agencies to secure the necessary reductions in expenditure in areas which do not directly affect patient care in as far as possible.  I have <Col N="1212" /> requested that key services for the old and housebound are protected and that services such as community nursing, home help and meals on wheels, as well as services for the handicapped, children and disadvantaged communities, be maintained at 1986 levels in real terms.  I am glad to say that the response of the agencies to these requests has been very positive.</P>
    <P>It is important to record that this House has approved the overall allocation to the Health sector in 1988.  In other words it is accepted by this House that a figure of almost £1,300 million is sufficient to meet the health service needs of the country in 1988 given the existing budgetary reality.  While Members of the House might differ over some of the spending details, nevertheless the bottom line is that the overall level of funding of the health services will remain as approved.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation measures, initiatives and proposals which effect a saving when implemented mean that services elsewhere within the health sector will benefit given that an overall fixed sum has been approved.  This reality tends to be overlooked at times when particular measures are being implemented.  As Minister for Health I must have a national perspective on the entire health sector rather than a narrow, localised one.  Of overriding concern must be a general improvement in the health sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>The much needed rationalisation programme which is currently underway, when completed, will provide a health service nationally which can respond effectively, timely and effectively to genuine demands, be responsive to changes in service requirements and facilitate future developments in order to provide improved as well as a greater range of services for all.</P>
    <P>I believe that the co-operation between my Department and its agencies, as demonstrated last year, will continue to show itself during 1988 and that the practical advantages of that co-operation will be of immense benefit to all of us who are involved in the health services.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances no service or <Col N="1213" /> institution can be regarded as immune from critical analysis and discussions. General hospitals as consumers of over 50 per cent of current spending are the prime candidates for an examination of their effectiveness.  Where other opportunities exist for either tighter control or the most appropriate location of responsibility for particular services those opportunities will be taken.  In general, it means that we will, as a Government, spare no efforts to ensure that we get the most out of the State's and taxpayers' investment.</P>
    <P>A major rationalisation of the general hospital area is underway.  This is to ensure that our acute hospitals can respond, in the appropriate way, to the need for hospital care.  The rationalisation of course involves taking out of the system beds which are no longer required, but it also involves: encouraging co-operation between hospitals; development of services with long waiting lists; putting in place and maintaining well equipped hospitals better able to respond to the needs of the population; responding to changes in medical practice; development of five day wards and day surgery; and planning for self-sufficiency at regional level in regard to certain specialties.</P>
    <P>The year 1987 has seen the first important changes in the hospital system for some time.  The financial restrictions have, perhaps, concentrated people's minds on the need to eliminate duplication and waste.</P>
    <P>There has been a media concentration upon closures of hospitals but very little upon the provision of new facilities at Beaumont for example or at Ardkeen, Sligo, Cavan, Mullingar, Castlebar and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Government have, to date, allocated £10.1 million from national lottery proceeds to the health-welfare areas and it is a very welcome addition to these funds.  Of this allocation, £2 million was allocated to the Health Education Bureau in 1987 and a further £2 million has been earmarked for the 1988 Health Capital Programme.  Of the balance of £6.1 million, I have, to date, allocated <Col N="1214" /> £1.5 million to individual projects and I will be allocating the balance during 1988.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the £6.1 million will be used by me to fund the following services: about £2.25 million will be allocated for services for the physically and mentally handicapped, this being allocated for the implementation of resocialisation programmes designed to assist in the transfer of patients from institutional to community-based services.  The object is to ensure that such persons will, through a programme of resocialisation, be able to meet the challenge to live independently in their own community. The programme will necessitate the purchase of houses, the provision of day nursing facilities, day care centres, and the employment of house parents to encourage independent attitudes and behaviour.</P>
    <P>Nearly £1 million will be allocated for the provision of services for the elderly and this will be spent on the development of community-based services.  The provision of these services will reduce the level of admission of the elderly to institutional care and, at the same time, greatly enhance the lifestyle of our senior citizens.</P>
    <P>About £700,000 will go to the psychiatric services and will be used to accelerate the continuing programme of transferring long stay psychiatric patients when appropriate to live in the community. The programme will involve the provision of a range of modern community-based facilities.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million is being provided for the development of community information and development services.  Particular attention will be given to the service provided by voluntary agencies but it is intended that they will operate within a broader framework than heretofore provided under the aegis of the National Social Service Board.</P>
    <P>A sum of £450,000 will be spent in 1987 and 1988 on the provision of AIDS prevention programmes.  Special emphasis will be placed on the need to minimise the spread of HIV infection amongst intravenous drug abusers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £700,000 is to be provided <Col N="1215" /> for the development of a range of services to facilitate investigation and management of cases of child abuse.  Innovative prevention programmes for the support of families and young children will be developed together with new projects to assist the young homeless and movement of children from residential to community-based services.</P>

      <P>It would be understandable if some people have the impression that there is little forward movement in the health services at the moment.  The problems which have been created by our difficult economic situation could lead to the belief that new thinking and development in relation to health issues have been submerged in all the <i>ruaille buaille</i> of trying to live within our limited resources.</P>
      <P>That is not the case.  On various occasions in recent months I have referred to the various initiatives which are underway in regard to the creation of a positive health promotion policy.  I would like to return to the subject again because I think it is a very important one. A consciousness of the influences which determine the quality of our health has become a distinguishing feature of all developed countries.  Such countries have reached the stage where they are adequately equipped to cope with sickness and are now in a position to contemplate the social and economic changes required to advance the quality of the citizen's health.  We have reached that stage.  As Minister for Health I feel that the time has come when I should interpret the description of my post in a more literal sense and get away from the traditional notion that my main role is to preside nationally over a range of services for sick and infirm people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have integrated into my Department the functions of the former Health Education Bureau and created a new Health Promotion Unit.  The unit will continue <Col N="1216" /> to carry on the type of health educational campaigns directed at the individual for which the bureau was responsible.</P>
    <P>In addition, the unit will take on the responsibility for developing a broad health promotion policy with, I would hope, the support and participation of the many other agencies which influence the quality of our health.  The unit will have the expert advice of the Advisory Council on Health Promotion which I established last month under the chairmanship of Professor Ivor Drury who is President of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  The council's members are drawn from a range of interests.  They include not only persons of standing from within the health services but also influential persons from the farming, commercial, educational, local government, food, sporting and communication sectors.</P>

      <P>The Government as a whole have committed themselves to supporting my efforts to create a comprehensive health promotion policy.  I have been given the support of a committee of Ministers drawn from the Departments which impact to an important degree on the influences which determine how healthy we are as a nation.  I shall act as its chairman, and it will be a very powerful vehicle for securing the participation and co-ordination of the various sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course I shall not have to await the guidance of this new council in order to push ahead with preventive and promotional activities which have already been clearly identified.  Cancer and heart <Col N="1217" /> disease are the two greatest killers of our times.  While a great deal has yet to be learnt about their causative factors some of their origins have been identified beyond any reasonable doubt.  The main one is tobacco smoking.  I have an obligation as Minister for Health to continue the efforts of my predecessors and to work towards the complete eradication of smoking.  It is not an unrealistic goal but its achievement will, of course, require a joint international approach.  I think we are fast approaching the situation where people will demand such an approach in order that they and their families can be protected from the destructive consequences of tobacco.  I have asked the new Health Promotion Unit to continue the anti-tobacco campaigns conducted with considerable effect by its predecessor, the Health Education Bureau.  I will refer to legislative support measures at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in particular to the need to face up to the hazard of cancer. As a result of initiatives taken by the Heads of State and of Government at the summit meetings in Milan and Luxembourg in 1985 a European programme in the fight against cancer was launched. I confirmed this Government's commitment to this programme at a meeting of Health Ministers of the Community in May 1987.  The aim of the Europe Against Cancer campaign is to reduce significantly the number of cancer related deaths, perhaps by as much as 15 per cent by the year 2000, by a programme of prevention, early detection and cure. Many cancers are curable, particularly if they are detected in the early stages.</P>
    <P>We propose to participate in a &ldquo;European Week Against Cancer&rdquo; from 1-8 May this year and the &ldquo;European Cancer Information Year&rdquo; in 1989.  The committee of cancer experts which the Community has appointed, and on which this country is represented, has identified the fight against tobacco as a priority area.  I have established a National Committee on Cancer to co-ordinate the Irish activities associated with this campaign.  This committee will be chaired by the chief medical officer of my Department and <Col N="1218" /> will include representatives from the Health Promotion Unit, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish representative on the European committee of cancer experts.</P>
    <P>Of course, in directing the fight against cancer, one of the most important requirements is the possession of accurate information on the incidence of cancer in the community.  With this in mind, I have been actively considering how best to establish a national tumour registry.  Such a registry would provide invaluable and detailed information on the prevalence of cancer and would facilitate the investigation of possible environmental factors related to cancer incidence.  In addition, it would greatly assist in evaluating our success in bringing this disease under control.  I will shortly be establishing a representative group to consider all practical aspects of the setting up of such a registry.</P>
    <P>I have also established a working group to examine arrangements for cervical screening.  This group will initially examine the current arrangements for the taking and analysis of cervical smears and recommend how these arrangements can be improved to deal with the present work load.  They will then identify the population requiring screening and optimum frequency of screening for an efficient and cost effective cervical screening programme for this country and recommend how such a programme could be developed.</P>
    <P>I have just returned from the London AIDS Conference which was organised by the UK authorities and World Health Organisation.  Every country affected by AIDS was represented and the disccussion was very frank and open.  What emerged was that our own strategy was very much in line with that of the other countries present.  All countries have recognised that education both of the general public and of at risk groups is the most effective measure against AIDS.  I have come away from London convinced that we must continue to pursue our current policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> Following our mass media public information programme which was launched in May 1987 a survey had been carried out at the end of 1987 to assess its effectiveness. A clear majority considered the programme to be very good in helping them to understand AIDS and people's knowledge was improved as we had planned. We will continue to provide information to the general public particularly through poster advertising, our telephone services and through our booklet. I have decided to address specific groups in 1988 for intensive and direct action.  A sum of £430,000 has been provided by the Government for this work from lottery funds.  Sixty per cent of HIV positive individuals here are IV drug abusers.  This is the group in which the infection appears to be spreading most quickly. It is also the category from which the majority of new cases are coming.</P>
    <P>One to one contact with addicts will, I feel, prove the most effective way of motivating the necessary personal behavioural changes.  I have already provided the drug agencies with £70,000 to enable them to expand their outreach programmes and further substantial funding is being provided this year for further expansion which will include research into the drug culture with particular emphasis on how the culture is responding to the AIDS threat.  I note that the World Health Organisation are proposing similar research on an international basis and Ireland would like to participate in it.  We are already participating in an EC study on paediatric AIDS which, in Ireland, is a problem related to IV drug abuse among mothers.</P>
    <P>I am also concentrating upon the educational system.  It is my intention that no child should leave school without being aware of the facts about AIDS.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, fully supports me in this and planning for the introduction of such a programme of information is now in hand.</P>
    <P>Apart from the human misery involved in drug abuse, the rapid spread of AIDS and HIV infection amongst intravenous drug abusers demonstrates the serious <Col N="1220" /> threat which drug abuse poses to society today.  The Government have developed a coherent and comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through the National Co-Ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse which is chaired by my colleague and the Minister of State, Deputy Terry Leyden.</P>
    <P>Drug traffickers are the root cause of drug abuse and grow wealthy by distributing drugs to others, an activity which results in misery and death and which is affecting the community at large, as evidenced in the AIDS situation.</P>
    <P>I propose to introduce legislation designed to prevent drug traffickers from being able to benefit from their ill-gotten gains or to finance further drug trafficking operations.  The legislation will be designed to provide a framework to seize the assets of drug traffickers, I hope to submit proposals to Government on this as soon as some constitutional issues in this area are cleared up.</P>
    <P>As part of the continuing development of services at the levels of primary health and community care, my Department introduced a measles immunisation programme in October 1985.  The programme is aimed at eradicating this disease which, regrettably, the majority of persons regard as not being serious but which, in fact, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst infants and young children.</P>
    <P>The measles immunisation programme is being delivered through the health boards, with the participation of general practitiones.  This joint approach of health board personnel &mdash; community physicians, public health nurses and administrators &mdash; and general practitioners resulted in an uptake of 95 per cent in measles immunisation during the first 18 months of the programme.  The high uptake brought with it a dramatic reduction in the number of cases of measles reported and the number of persons suffering from the disease admitted to hospital.</P>
    <P>In 1984, a total of 5,275 cases of measles were reported and in 1985, a total of 9,903.  In 1986, the number of cases reported had dropped to only 451. <Col N="1221" /> Admissions to Cherry Orchard Hospital of persons suffering from the disease dropped from 283 in 1984 to 13 in 1986 and only four in 1987.  In addition, there have been savings to the GMS of medicines prescribed to persons with measles.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the measles immunisation programmes has been a success to date, both in terms of cost-effectiveness and, more importantly, in preventing serious illness and human suffering.  Since 1986, however, the uptake of 95 per cent has dropped to a disappointing 45 per cent nationally and there is a danger that the objective of the programme to eradicate the disease will not be achieved.</P>
    <P>Eradication requires a constant uptake of 95 per cent of susceptible children and I am taking steps with the health boards and with general practitioners to ensure that this is achieved.  I would like to take this opportunity, however, to ask both directors of community care and general practitioners to participate fully in the immunisation programme and parents of children to have their children immunised against the disease.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware from the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement that the Government have found it possible to provide an additional £11m in the current year to fund the community drugs schemes.  This will enable the long term illness scheme and the drugs refund scheme to be retained in full.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I am particularly pleased that in spite of the current financial situation we are able to do this. I am all too well aware that there was a considerable degree of worry and anxiety on the part of people who avail of these schemes following recent speculation that they may be abolished or severely curtailed.  I am sure that the House will acknowledge that this further reflects our commitment to protect services for those most in need and particularly the handicapped and those with heavy expenditure on drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the two schemes as they operate at present have been the subject of some criticism over the years.  Personally I believe that there is some basis for this.  Consequently my <Col N="1222" /> Department will, in conjunction with the health boards, immediately review the operation of the two schemes in conjunction with other aspects of community care services.  Following this review I hope it will be possible to bring about some improvements resulting in more effective and equitable arrangements in the provision of the schemes.</P>
    <P>Food and nutrition policy is a major element in health promotion.  The Food Advisory Committee have produced a number of excellent reports which form the basis of our food and nutrition policy. My Department continue to fund the nutritional surveillance system which was set up on the advice of the Food Advisory Committee to monitor the diet of the general population and to assess the effect of policy interventions.  The Food Advisory Committee has just completed a major review of their guidelines for preparing information and advice to the general public on healthy eating.  These guidelines will be published shortly and are intended for health professionals and others such as teachers who provide advice on diet.  I propose to have special publicity campaigns to encourage the development of healthy eating habits.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the Minister for Finance's statement in relation to the schemes operated by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to disabled drivers. Rationalisation of the schemes which also involved the Department of the Environment is to take place.  Specifically, the present schemes will be discontinued. They will be replaced by schemes to promote the mobility of physically disabled people administered by my Department through the health boards.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Department are in consultation with the health boards about proposals for new and revised schemes and will be meeting the organisations representing the disabled within the next week.  Following these consultations I will announce details of the new or revised schemes.</P>
    <P>The full cost of the revenue and environment schemes in a full year is £3.34 million.  A sum of £2.8 million will be added to my Department's allocation <Col N="1223" /> to cover the balance of 1988.  The full amount will be used to promote the mobility of physically disabled people.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be fully aware of my view that re-organisation of health services both from the statutory perspective and from a service point of view will take place within the existing eight health boards.  Insufficient evidence in my opinion is available which would warrant an alteration in board numbers.  I consider that a debate on those lines is misdirected and only tends to deflect from the central issue of how, within defined resource parameters, a quality service to meet genuine need in an equitable and effective manner can be provided.</P>
    <P>My examination of existing structures is primarily concerned with the role of health boards, the relationship between boards and their management, and the requirements of an effective and efficient delivery system geared to meet the health needs of the country in the future.  Deputies will be aware that the existing system and statutory structures were proposed in the mid-sixties.</P>
    <P>The health board structure as we know it to-day came into operation in 1970 to meet the health and personal social service requirements which existed at that time and which were perceived would exist in future years.  The changes which have taken place since then in economic, budgetary and social terms have been immense.  In addition the health and social services requirements of the mid-sixties are different to those which are now required and which will be required in future.  It is precisely because of these changes, and potential changes in the future, that I have initiated a review of existing services and an assessment of current and future conditions. Structures which have been in place for well nigh 20 years and have remained virtually unchanged since then must be examined to see whether there is a need for such structures, what contribution they have made to the effective delivery of services and what role, if any, they should have in the future.  It is an obligation on all public representatives to <Col N="1224" /> ensure that services which are in receipt of Exchequer funding are regularly scrutinised to answer the questions I have just posed.</P>
    <P>In recent months major developments have already taken place within the health service.  While the pace of change has caught many by surprise, on reflection there is general agreement that many of the initiatives which have taken place and the direction the health services have taken were long overdue.  As Minister for Health in the present difficult financial situation I have noted a genuine concern for and a reappraisal of the role of health care workers.  The recognition that the patient is the core and pivot around which the entire delivery system is built is critical for future development.</P>
    <P>In the management of change in an era of rapid change it is important that the pace be such that improvements are correctly planned, phased and implemented. It is also important that change be part of a genuine consultative and co-operative process.  Such an approach is best reflected in selected areas or sites where pilot studies can be initiated, developed and readily scrutinised as to their benefits, wider application and possible role model for wider application.  From careful study of such pilots new organisation structures may emerge, suitably tested concepts and delivery systems may be introduced.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of this House to two specific projects which are at the very early stages of implementation. I have identified the North Western Health Board area as a suitable pilot site for the development and testing of new options for organising and managing health services.  This project which will commence following appropriate consultation with professional organisations will assist in establishing what changes are needed in existing organisation of services to ensure that they are appropriate and responsive to the needs of the population, that the personnel resources are sufficient to achieve an appropriate service standard and that the working relationship between the personnel concerned is fully productive.  The pilot will <Col N="1225" /> cover a range of services including community medicine, mental handicap and some social services.  I have allocated funding for this project from national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that particularly in the recent past health section managers have been asked to perform with limited financial and personnel resources and yet the demands on them for a greater range and quality of service have never been higher.  An effective resolution of the conflict between demands and resources will be reflected in the calibre of management in the health service.  There is no denying that the quality of health sector management is reflected in the quality and range of services even within resource constraints.  The reporting hierarchies and relationship will come under particular stress with greater flexibility and more fluid and responsive arrangements to meet the demands of a changed situation.  There is a clear case for change of moving from the existing programme structure to a structure within which managers will have an integrated responsibility for a specific geographical area.  The divisions between programmes of care are generally regarded as artificial divisions which have increasingly less relevance in the future direction of health policy and the emphasis on primary care services.  A geographic manager, easily identifiable within the community would be responsible and accountable for the effective delivery of health and social services within a designated catchment area. With an employment level of approximately 60,000 in the health services a high quality of management is vital.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken of legislative changes which may well be needed in the organisation, development and delivery of services in the future.  While my thinking in some of those areas is not finalised I am convinced that where changes have been identified as desirable and the existing legislative framework is insufficient to meet today's requirements legislative changes should be introduced, as expeditiously as possible.  One such area concerns the control of smoking in public places.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> The statistics on smoking in Ireland indicate that while there are broad trends pointing in the right direction, there remain areas of particular concern and there is absolutely no room for complacency. On the positive side, only one-third of the adult population are now smokers as against some 43 per cent of the population in 1972/73.  This represents a significant improvement on the overall position in regard to smoking.  However, closer analysis of the available data gives some cause for concern in regard to the proportions of young people who smoke. In particular, the proportion of teenage girl smokers appears to have increased. The research shows that while in the early teen years, more boys than girls smoke, by age 17, the percentage of each sex smoking converges at around 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>While we have had some success in controlling the promotional activities of the tobacco industry in this country under the Tobacco (Control of Advertising Sponsorship and Sales Promotion) Act, 1978 and regulations made under this Act there have been no legislative initiatives so far to control the activities of individual smokers for the benefit of nonsmokers. We intend to introduce such legislation within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Another controlling legislative measure which I propose will concern a restriction on the use of services outside a person's health board area without the approval of the appropriate board.  There has been much misinformed comment about the so called &lsquo;tertiary referral charges&rsquo;, which are wrongly named.  I am glad of the opportunity in this House to explain briefly the measures I propose.</P>
    <P>What has always been a source of concern and at times wonderment to me in my capacity whether as general practitioner, health board member or Minister for Health is the genuine vigour with which local interests demand the development, extension and retention of acute hospital services to meet the needs of a particular population in a defined catchment area.  Yet when it comes to the use of such services which have been made available for local use, a certain proportion of the local people choose to <Col N="1227" /> ignore those services and avail of similar services of similar quality elsewhere.  In many cases there is no medical reason for a referral to external services; perhaps it is historical, or lack of understanding that the necessary services are available locally. It is my intention to introduce a controlling mechanism which will discourage and unwarranted use of external acute services where quality and adequate services are available locally. The basic principal of the change will be that referrals outside a person's health board area will be subject to the approval of the appropriate health board.</P>
    <P>The disincentive will be by way of a charge on patients who refuse to accept services made available by their health board and opt for similar services elsewhere without board approval.  Patient well-being will be the overriding concern of the administration of this control. Deputies will appreciate that the existing situation of referrals of patients to other sites for services which are available locally needs to be rationalised.  I will be in a position to introduce this measure shortly and I trust that Deputies will be supportive of my initiative in this regard. It has nothing to do with a limitation of the use of high technology services.  Such services will continue to be available for use, subject to what I have outlined above.</P>
    <P>Work on the drafting of a new child care Bill is almost complete and I expect to be in a position to circulate it within a few weeks.  The Bill will replace the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985 which lapsed with the change of Government.</P>
    <P>We hope to proceed with the Committee Stage of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill, 1987 in the Seanad within the next few weeks.  My Department are examining, in consultation with the office of the Attorney General, a range of complex issues relating to costs and the constitutional rights of the child which have been raised since the Bill was published.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Health, I have become increasingly concerned at the rise in the number of cases of alleged <Col N="1228" /> child abuse being reported to the health boards.  In July last, my Department published a new set of guidelines which incorporate procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse.</P>
    <P>They set out in some detail recommended procedures for the reporting, recording, investigation and management of cases of child abuse, including sexual abuse, which are suspected or have come to notice.  They are primarily designed to ensure a systematic and sensitive approach to caring for the victims of abuse.  The problem of child abuse above all requires an effective and coherent multi-disciplinary response from our health and social services and this central aspect is emphasised in my Department's guidelines.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that there is a real need to increase the range of services available, particularly for sexually abused children and I have already allocated special funds to enable the present services at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals to be significantly expanded.  There is, of course, a need also to improve services on a countrywide basis outside the Dublin area and I will, therefore, be allocating special funds from my Department's share of the national lottery surplus to the different health boards to enable them to improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>It is over 20 years since the last overall review of health and social services.  A White Paper entitled <i>The Health Services and their Further Development</i> was published in 1966 which signposted a number of major initiatives and developments in the administration and delivery of health and social services.  Since taking up office almost a year ago I am convinced of the need to develop a strategic plan for the future development of health and social policy.  In order to be effective such a plan must have specific developmental targets against which the progress of various elements of the plan can be monitored and assessed.  It must also have specific target groups who require particular attention over the lifetime of the <Col N="1229" /> plan.  A considerable amount of preparatory work has already been carried out.</P>
    <P>The Beaumont conference on my Department's discussion document entitled, &ldquo;Health &mdash; The Wider Dimensions&rdquo; was highly successful in that, despite the financial constraints and the limited resources available to health services, a large degree of consensus was apparent in the general direction of future health policy.  My Department will be working on this plan taking into account the valuable contributions made at the conference.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Health Funding which I set up after coming into office will be reporting later this year.  I look forward to receiving their report and incorporating their recommendations in our development plan for the future of the health services.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the deliberations of the commission will assist the refining of the developmental plan for the health and social services.  The merging of expert funding proposals and health service proposals into a single strategic plan for implementation over a specific period will give greater direction and purpose to the efforts of those engaged in the health services.  I hope to have the document available before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Government to the country's economic and social problem is, as I have said, positive. From my experience as Minister for Health I am convinced that the goodwill and the commitment of health sector workers generally will produce a maximum level and quality of services within the resources allocated to the health services.  I look forward to the continuance of the cooperation of effort required to continue to have in place a quality health and social service to meet the genuine needs of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute following the comprehensive speech by the Minister for Health and before I make any other comments I would like to respond to some of <Col N="1230" /> the points he raised.  The Minister has outlined his plans and planning is probably the most important area because in all our hard-won lessons on financial stringency and the sacrifices that have to be made we have all come to realise that we must have planning.  I particularly welcome the fact that the Minister when outlining his plans and assessments of the health service has aligned them with social planning.  We hope, and I know this would be the Minister's wish, too, that we can achieve, as the Minister said in his last remark, a quality health and social service to meet the genuine needs of our people.  We hope it will meet the needs of all our people because part of our concern at present is that some of the cuts have been carried out in a mandatory and peremptory way without, perhaps, being able to see the full implications and consequences of them.  There would seem to be a danger, unless we are all very careful, of creating a two-tier health system which people who have insurance or money to cover fast health assessment, examination and relief could avail of easily.  However, a great number of our population are not in that privileged position. Our health service should never be based on privilege.  People find themselves, even now, having to wait for attention for very long periods sometimes for examination and treatment for serious conditions, particularly in regard to children's illnesses.  I would like to outline in the Minister's presence a few details of the type of waiting periods that I have learned of this week.  A young child with what would seem to be a very serious hearing problem will have to wait four months for an examination in the Eye and Ear Hospital.  During that period the problem may not alone intensify but maybe a huge deterrent to the child in learning.  It may in fact act as such an impediment that the child will fall back in class to the extent that he may never catch up.  That is an example of the social consequences we have to take into consideration when we curtail our health services to any group within our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that his Department concentrate on monitoring <Col N="1231" /> the extension of dental treatment to the spouses of insured workers.  Again, let me quote an instance.  I met a mother of six children, whose husband is now unemployed but who had paid contributions for years.  She lives in an area where there is about 60 per cent unemployment among the whole community. One of her teeth was literally shaking and was ready for removal.  It was causing her great pain but within her particular catchment area there was not one dentist on the list who would accept her.  A great many dentists have refused to include among their patients the spouses of insured workers.  This scheme was broadly welcomed.  We had lobbied for it for years.  There never was a greater need demonstrated than the need for dental treatment for women in the home.  These women had voluntarily given up their economic independence and social insurance contributions in order to stay in the home and bring up children.  They find now that not alone are their teeth rotting in their heads but that they are actually suffering pain for which they cannot get a remedy.  I have addressed my remarks to the Minister because this innovation which we welcomed when it was brought about is not working.  We have raised expectations after many years of frustration without being able to deliver.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as do many Members of the House, the decision by the Minister to continue the community drug refund scheme and the long term illness scheme. I have noticed, and I welcome the fact, that the Minister is going to monitor those schemes and review the efficiency and efficacy with which they work.  When the review group are examining those schemes they should bear in mind that there is one group who really call out to be included.  It has been argued up to now that the cost prohibits the inclusion of this group.  I refer to the people who suffer severely from asthma on a long term basis.  They suffer in a life or death situation with breathing difficulties and they would need to be included in the scheme for a long term refund.  It was <Col N="1232" /> suggested to me that the inhalers should be included in the scheme and given free because for some very severe asthma sufferers it is absolutely essential that they never travel anywhere without inhalers. This usually means that they should have at least two.  People on low incomes or on social welfare find that these are very costly.  In the long term I think that if the review group could make some savings within other areas of expenditure asthma sufferers could be included in the scheme. I think all Members of the House have great compassion and understanding for those who suffer from asthma, which is a frightening and long term illness.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear that the Minister is funding from the national lottery a pilot scheme in the North Western Health Board area to establish what changes are needed in the existing organisation of services and to ensure that they are appropriate and responsive to the needs of the population.  Like every other discipline or area where bureaucracy enters there comes a point where perhaps the very reason for it being set up would seem to be overwhelmed by the bureaucracy that actually guides it.  The Minister is quite right when he says that we have to set up a health service and spend the country's money &mdash; and a large amount of it at that &mdash; in an appropriate and responsive way to the needs of the people who most need it, and not in containing and continuing a bureaucracy and administration that takes far too much money proportionately and denies the population their needs.  I honestly believe that in a small country with a population of 3.5 million it is ridiculous that the Minister should insist that we need eight health boards.  This point was confirmed more than ever, taking into consideration what I have just said about administration costs, when the Minister said that he would look to setting up a geographic manager to deal with the catchment area within a certain sized community and that that geographic manager would be accountable for the effective delivery of health and social services but also &mdash; and this is really the most important point and I applaud it &mdash; that he be easily <Col N="1233" /> identifiable within the community.  Surely such a structure, hopefully a less costly structure, should confirm once again that we do not need eight health boards but that if we had community health workers working within designated catchment areas who are easily identifiable and also accountable on a personal level instead of the empires we have managed to build around the country, the cost effectiveness would be tremendous.  Also we would be giving a much more personal and pivotal health service within the areas where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the services for the treatment and assessment of child sexual abuse are now operating at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's Hospitals.  The setting up of those two units within childrens' hospitals was widely welcomed as being the more appropriate approach but I would ask the Minister to monitor the services on all levels, first, to try to find out the level and severity of the incidence of such abuse and secondly, to ensure that statistics are kept right along the line.</P>
    <P>The problem seems to be increasing every day, probably not in reality but certainly in terms of its reporting.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's admission of the need to improve services countrywide outside the Dublin area and his commitment to allocating special funds from his Department's share of the national lottery to the health boards to enable them to improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child sexual abuse.  It has been suggested that there would be a real case of geographic discrimination, so to speak, if children and their parents or sponsors were obliged to travel the length and breadth of the country to reach two units in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In discussing this on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights the point was well made that there is a need for anonymity because of the sensitivity and seriousness of the type of abuse we are talking about.  Even so, it is not right that people be expected to travel to just two units.  Moreover, those two units alone will be unable to meet the needs in this <Col N="1234" /> area.  When such abuse is feared or suspected and units for treatment are not accessible, it is a matter of shame to us. We claim we cherish all children equally; we must surely cherish the victims of such damaging and destructive abuse.</P>
    <P>Monitoring is absolutely essential on all levels.  I am delighted the boards will be able to produce statistics and figures relating to their area and break them down into levels of abuse and areas where abuses occur inside or outside the home. At the moment we have not the facts we need to set up the kind of programme the Minister is anxious to set up.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Within a few weeks&rdquo; has become the slogan for the Children (Care and Protection) Bill.  In the tortuous progress of that Bill through this House we were disappointed to find so many amendments necessary under the last Administration and we agreed that the incoming Minister for Health might be well advised to draft the Bill anew. However, that means we start again at stage one when we had reached Committee Stage in 1988, by which time we had hoped, in 1986, to complete Report Stage.  We are told it is hoped to have the Bill circulated &ldquo;within the next few weeks&rdquo;.  It had better be, and when it comes into the House it must be treated with all urgency in an effort to get it through, largely in this session and completed by summer.  I cannot believe we can live with ourselves if we allow such a Bill to go past another year's work in the Dáil and Seanad.  A special committee was set up to deal with Committee Stage under the previous Administration, and that was a welcome measure.  I hope the Minister, in an effort to process this as fast as possible because of the already long delay, will agree that a select committee be set up in order to expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>We all look forward to the many programmes and the education which the health promotion unit in the Department of Health, which replaces the Health Education Bureau, will provide.  We welcome also the establishment of the advisory council on health promotion.  The Minister commented that the council had <Col N="1235" /> wide representation of skills, talents and experience.  He had not time today to give details to me of the exact representation of men and women on that board.  Very often when boards claim to be representative, gender does not enter into the matter in so far as members of boards are chosen on grounds other than that.  Here is the perfect opportunity, if we need an advisory council to promote health rather than ill health, to have full participation and representation of women in that regard.  Women bear the brunt of caring, nursing and even community care, particularly where there are cutbacks in the health service.  If we recognise that the work and experience of women in those areas are proportionally greater than those of men, that women are the great educators in the home where all education begins, then it is essential to acknowledge such experience and influence and insist that at least 50 per cent of members on such boards be women.  In the light of women's education and their influence in regard to health in the preventive and care areas, then that proportion of representation should be higher.  However, we will settle for 50 per cent women on that advisory board.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be using proceeds from the national lottery in an innovative way in setting up pilot schemes and programmes in a return to what the ministry should be about; as he said, he is Minister for Health, not Minister for disease.  The people must realise we should be talking about a state of health, of &ldquo;wellness&rdquo;.  The Minister referred to the community, the disabled, the handicapped and the children and I hope he will make allocations to these areas through the budget and from the national lottery funds.  He did not mention women's organisations who have been cut back thoroughly in some ways.  They have no funding to enable them to continue to survive, yet those women's organisations have been providing education, social welfare, counselling and support for people in the community.  If they are prevented from providing that <Col N="1236" /> help and support, even with the meagre funding which they now have, it will cost the country far more in real terms because not alone will the State have to invest money in trying to provide those services but the services provided by it will not be as personal as those by the women's organisations.  The voluntary contributions provided by most of the women in these organisations will be removed to the detriment of the people who rely on these services.</P>
    <P>I hope that the women's organisations who have been working with the vulnerable sections of our community on an incredibly impractical and low level of funding will have that funding restored to them.  The investigation that is going on in the Department of Health should focus on the fact that we should be funding, supporting and acknowledging the work of voluntary organisations in the community.  This would be the most effective way of dealing with cutbacks because the funding given to those organisations would have such a voluntary contribution in it that it would be the most cost effective way of dealing with community care.</P>
    <P>Another fact which struck me as the budget was being read on 27 January is that the Minister, the Government and the majority of people have come around to recognising that it is essential that our financial position and national debt should be addressed and controlled.  I think there is a consensus about that. However, there is a lot of truth in saying that has become the focal point of Government policy.  However, that cannot be allowed to remain the focal point without taking a few other items onto the agenda as well.</P>
    <P>Not alone must we deal with our economy through the sacrifices and cutbacks we are making now, but we must do so in a way that will not destroy the very fabric of our society and be left with a Pyrrhic victory.  I would like to put two other items on the agenda which, outside this House, are real and relevant but have not got the same sense of identity and acceptance as has the national debt. <Col N="1237" /> Unemployment is one of the items and poverty is the other.</P>
    <P>While we have an acceptance and a sense of powerlessness about our unemployment problem, poverty has been to a certain extent ignored or else we like to pretend that it is not there.  The least we can do for the people who are caught below the poverty line or continually on it is first to identify it and, secondly, at least acknowledge that it exists.  From the next budget onwards all of us on all sides of the House should insist and make sure that that poverty is addressed much more fully, widely and radically than it has been up to now.  I do not think we can continue to live in a country that claims to be a republic if we allow the gap between the rich and poor to widen.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the pre-budget submissions received by the Government and all of us before the 1988 budget.  I would like to quote from the pre-budget submission of the Catholic Social Service Conference which I believe is the concept of what budgets should be about:</P>
    <P>The Catholic Social Service Conference believes that the primary goal of all social policy should be to ensure that every citizen has a right to an adequate income related to the prevailing living standards and to equality of access to health care, housing and education.</P>
    <P>That has to be our guiding principle.  If we want to ensure that every citizen has a right to an adequate income related to the prevailing living standards, which is modest, just and unbelievably logical and fair, then we have to redistribute much more of our resources.  The Catholic Social Service Conference also made suggestions as to how this could come about.  They asked the Government to look at the possibility of broadening and extending the taxation base in the areas of corporation tax and capital acquisitions tax.  They suggested the introduction of a property tax, a limited wealth tax and the inclusion of farmers and the self-employed in the PRSI net.</P>
    <P>Above everything else what we should be striving for, and there is no better time <Col N="1238" /> to strive for it than during a time of crisis when all of us feel that our backs are to the wall, is an examination of our values. The values of a country cannot be based on economics alone because, unfortunately, economics in isolation can be at best inaccurate and, at worst totally unfair and indiscriminate.  Therefore, I believe that during a time of crisis we must have a new way of looking at things because crises have shown us that the old ways and outdated structures have not served us.  Now is the time for us to look at transformations, innovation and creativity. My biggest disappointment with this budget is that it did not have that kind of thinking, thrust and direction.</P>
    <P>We should accept the fact that the simple dimensions of left, centre and right power struggles in politics are outdated. Extremes are as much part of the old culture as the <i>status quo</i> they impose. Therefore, we must have a new social value which would not have existed in the old outdated ideological culture.  We must have a value system that addresses itself not just to economics but to social planning.  That means we have to look at our values in a totally new, different and creative way.  We also have to look at them in a cost effective way.  I am wise enough not to indulge in visions of pie-in-the-sky ideas which we do not have the money to meet.</P>
    <P>Our education is totally outdated.  The edifices of education which were built in the past will not meet the needs and demands of a new age.  We should be more flexible in our use of school buildings and structures and we should move education into the community.  We should also invest more in adult education, so that we can ensure equity of access to education.  We should structure education to be a lifelong process and we should restructure our values system so that people who did not have access to education when they were young can have access to subsidised education in later years.  It is ludicrous to subsidise education in the early years and refuse to give but a morsel to people who wish to avail of adult education.  Our policies discriminate against people who want to <Col N="1239" /> avail eventually of adult education and it is not good sense economically.  The evolution of adult education here has shown that education can be much more effective based on human relationships and working within groups without placing all the emphasis on individual achievement and competition.  Our education system should contain conflict resolution skills.  Education is supposed to develop people to live in society so one of the most basic skills needed is conflict resolution.  A large number of our economic ills and our industrial and employment difficulties arise from the fact that we have never developed that dimension of our human capacity.</P>
    <P>At long last we are recognising that we have not yet developed our natural resources to their full potential.  I welcome the emphasis placed by the Minister for Energy during his speech on investment in forestry but we have a long way to go before we realise that resource.  A person working in forestry told me that 60 per cent of the ash used for making hurleys here is imported from Wales and that 40 per cent of the birch needed to build barricades at racecourses is imported from Suffolk.  Surely this hits at our heritage and culture, as well as economically, especially when we consider that this country was once covered with trees and that it has a climate that allows trees to grow faster than is the case in most countries even in Europe.  Europe is running out of timber.  We could fill the gap in the market there.  The optimistic way to look at this is to be thankful that we still have such a resource that can be realised.  We are now becoming aware of how this asset can enrich our environment and of how it can create a huge number of jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, farmers will say that long ago we should have anticipated the dismantling of the CAP.  It would be morally and economically unsustainable to continue the CAP as it was, where we paid people to produce food which we could not use and which could not be used properly in the rest of the world and which cost more to store <Col N="1240" /> or destroy than it cost to produce.  To date we have not realised our full potential in agriculture.  We now have a glorious opportunity to keep our environment clean and to become recognised as an agricultural country producing goods free from chemicals, pesticides and additives. We can serve a market willing to pay a very high price for that type of product. Unfortunately, the environment in other countries has become so polluted that they can no longer produce the sort of products we can produce here.  In the context of the survival of the planet, apart from the potential for the development of agriculture here, it is frightening to learn that the large ranch like factory farms that were created in the South of England on their accession to the European Community, to produce large amounts of food, are now scientifically estimated to be in such a state that a tonne of subsoil per acre is eroded every year from that land because of the over use and abuse of chemicals and additives. If we continue to abuse our subsoil, which is only a layer of our planet, we will end up by not just failing to cope with famine in the underdeveloped world but we will make our developed land a desert.</P>
    <P>I know that some people feel that we throw out the areas of agriculture, forestry and tourism as good hope cards, but if we are to cope with poverty here and do away with unemployment we have to direct our attention to develop these areas.  Our country has the scenery and the climate to compete with any others. I will not believe and do not want to tell future generations or the thousands of young people who have had to go abroad to work that it is beyond our competence to develop our natural resources for all our people when other countries have done it.  We are recognised as an intelligent workforce.  When one looks at the excessive charges we have for transport, telecommunications and energy it is a miracle that we can export goods at the level we export them.  Those extra charges are something that we can tackle in future budgets.  If we can compete, despite the extra charges, there is room for optimism and it points to the fact <Col N="1241" /> that we have a skilled workforce and a productivity here of which we can be proud.</P>
    <P>If the Government, instead of making the decision to take £30 million from the ESB, had allowed them to keep it on condition that they used it to reduce energy and industrial costs here, in the long-term it would have been much more effective and productive.  If in future budgets we find that some of our industrial companies have an opportunity to either pay something into the coffers or reinvest it in order to help productivity and exports, I hope the second choice will be made.</P>
    <P>We should work on the consensus within this House and outside it; we should work on the natural resources whose potential we have only begun to realise; we should work on the confidence that is coming back, against the harsh reality that time is running out for us if we wish to bring our young generation back.  We cannot afford to lose a whole generation.  This country has lost whole generations too often.  That is one of the reasons for our present problems.  This time it is too serious; we know too much; we have experienced it too often to allow it to happen again.  I shall end by quoting Teilhard de Chardin as follows: &ldquo;The future is in the hands of those who can give tomorrow's generations valid reasons to live and hope.&rdquo;  That is our responsibility and that is what future budgets must ensure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Barnes, I should comment that her contribution was most positive.  It is a pity that we do not get that type of contribution from other sides of the House. It is not possible at the best of times to produce a budget which fulfils the expectations of all the various interests in the country which hope to benefit from concessions. We are all painfully aware that the times in which we live are far from being good.  In the circumstances, the Minister for Finance is faced very sharply with conflicting demands.  On the one hand, we try to give relief to the sections of society which, by common consent, <Col N="1242" /> are most hard pressed, the long term unemployed in particular, whilst at the same time keeping firmly in sight the overriding requirements to reduce the budget deficit and stabilise the borrowing requirement.  The 1987 budget and this budget have been described as tough budgets.  This is indeed so, but the reality remains that to finance even these tough budgets we still need to borrow £1,786 million, or 8.2 per cent of our GNP in 1988.  This is better than last year's requirement of 10.3 per cent but is still miles away from the aim of a balanced budget which is now generally accepted by serious commentators as a necessary prerequisite for sustained recovery.</P>
      <P>Given the limited scope available to the Minister to raise additional finance, it is inevitable, in order to go some way towards this goal of eliminating borrowing that he must seek to control and where possible reduce spending.  Nobody denies that the results of these reductions are unpalatable for those who are directly affected.  No Government will willingly embark on policies or programmes which result in people losing their jobs, but it is the task and duty of the Government to take an overview of the nation's affairs, to balance the prospects for the future with the demands of the present, to balance realism with hope, concentrating most of the realism on present problems so that there may be some hope for the future.  This is the theme of my contribution &mdash; realism now so that we may hope that next year and the years after that the country will be given some chance to grow and prosper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken this nation, this House, a painfully long time to come to the realisation that tomorrow cannot be postponed indefinitely, to accept that decisions and actions made and taken today have a direct and proportional influence on the future.  Today's concessions become tomorrow's borrowing requirements.  It cannot go on; it must stop.  We cannot condemn our country to a future of perpetual debt and poverty.  This budget has to be seen in the context of the situation to which I have referred.  It is a step along the road away from over-borrowing debt <Col N="1243" /> and declining hopes and towards self-sufficiency, prosperity and rising hopes.</P>
    <P>But, the budget is not just a financial balance sheet of the nation's affairs.  It is also a social statement.  It states, for instance, that in spite of the overriding need for restraint in spending, those in most need of assistance will be afforded some relief.  The most striking features of the budget are those relating to the public finances and taxation.  Much has been said by previous contributors on public finance so that I shall try to concentrate on one positive development, that is, the reduction in Exchequer borrowing requirement.  The EBR has been reduced very significantly since Fianna Fáil came into Government.  I think that I should repeat the figures that have been produced by the Minister, In 1986, the EBR was £2.1 billion; in 1987 it was £1.8 billion and the target for 1988 is £1.5 billion. This has occurred due to some very imaginative planning and shrewd decisions made by the Department of Finance.  This is more than worthy of mention in the budget debate because from time to time we forget to mention the people in the background who are helping the Minister.</P>
    <P>Firstly, because of the commitment to reduce the borrowing requirement, nonresidents saw fit to buy over £400 million of Irish Government paper last year.  Let us not forget that bank interest rates were around 14 per cent at the beginning of last year and the previous Government were selling our debt to Irish institutions at this rate.  In the period of this Government to date, interest rates have come down from 14 per cent to 9 per cent and the present Government are selling debt to the institutions at 10 per cent.  This has been achieved, in the main, by the reduction in the EBR and the active debt management programme.  The measures adopted by the Department are &mdash; firstly, they have prepaid and refinanced foreign loans at a lower cost.  Secondly, they have issued new instruments in the domestic market such as the ECU bond, £77 million and tax exempt bonds from multinational companies, £60 million.  These <Col N="1244" /> measures have produced saving in funding costs to the Exchequer.  Thirdly, they have been innovative in terms of their interest rate swaps which, especially with regard to the foreign debt, are resulting in sizeable savings this year.  Fourthly, they have introduced 14 and 30 day Exchequer Bills.  This is bringing in more money and making the debt more attractive to institutions.  Fifthly, a very positive development has been the promotion of the small savings schemes as a stable source of funding for the Exchequer especially at a time when equity markets are not safe.  Sixthly, they have prudently managed the Government Stock Market by acting as net suppliers &mdash; i.e. selling and not buying back.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his staff in the Department of Finance are to be commended for being so innovative in their debt management programme.  They have played no small part in helping to reduce interest rates.  I find it amazing that the previous Government could not have seen fit to examine all these options. What, in effect, has been done is that the taxpayer has been saved unnecessary debt serving costs as a result of this Government's actions.  Had we continued the approach of the last Government in managing the public finances, I have no doubt that there was a real danger &mdash; and I am not being an alarmist &mdash; that the IMF would have been called in.</P>
    <P>The PAYE sector have been finally recognised as a sector that has propped up the economy over the last number of years.  The fact that the Minister has reduced tax by three times the amount committed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a deserved boost to the PAYE worker, who has been understandably in a state of depression and frustration for some years.  This is not a cosmetic change but a genuine attempt to restore taxation equity in this country. The PAYE taxpayer will realise a real improvement in take-home pay as a result.</P>
    <P>This relief given to taxpayers while by no means as much as full equity would demand, is seen and accepted by me as <Col N="1245" /> a step along the road towards a more equitable tax regime.  I am particularly gratified that at least a genuine attempt is being initiated to bring some regularity to the position of those pesonal taxpayers who are not part of the PAYE tax scheme.  I welcome wholeheartedly the Minister's move towards a system of self-assessment for self-employed people and company directors.  This move, together with the inclusion of these categories of taxpayers in the PRSI scheme will, if and when properly implemented, go a long way towards removing the suspicion in the minds of the general taxpayers that these groups were somehow not being treated as seriously as the PAYE sector for tax gathering purposes.</P>
    <P>The incentive arrangements to bring tax payments up to-date are to be welcomed. These arrangements which will come into effect on 30 September are most practical.  To be eligible there must be a payment of tax up front.  Tax must be paid in full.  If the conditions attaching to the arrangements are met, interest and penalties subject to limited exclusions will not apply.  The problem of mounting arrears of tax is being finally tackled. We have heard for so long from many quarters, &ldquo;What about the uncollected taxes?&rdquo;  This Minister has faced up to this particular issue.</P>
    <P>Changes in the corporate tax structure appear on the surface to be small and could more usefully be described as a change in emphasis rather than in scale. I welcome the move to remove first year capital allowances on new plant and machinery from 100 per cent to 75 per cent and later to 50 per cent.  I also welcome the corresponding reduction in corporate tax rates from 50 per cent to 47 per cent and later to 43 per cent.  These moves are well in line with current international practice and have found a broad welcome in industry.  However, may I introduce a word of caution.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the introduction of accelerated capital allowances on investment in new plant and machinery was mainly to do with the need to modernise our existing industrial plant and to attract new investment.  One of the real bright <Col N="1246" /> spots in our economic performance in recent years has been the tremendous increase in output from these very businesses which availed of accelerated capital allowances in making investment decisions.  It is important that the rate of capital investment and productive resources should be encouraged and increased.  It is an essential part of our aim for national recovery.  The Minister should watch this situation and be prepared to make adjustments, if necessary, in the light of future trends.</P>
    <P>The introduction of PRSI for self-employed is also ensuring equity and is in line with developments in other countries. The self-employed comprise over one-fifth of the workforce and over £320 million was paid out in 1987 in non-contributory pensions.  The cost of this again falls back on the Exchequer, that is, the general body of taxpayers.  It is only right and proper that the self-employed should contribute to their non-social welfare pensions and to relieve the Exchequer of this burden.  The self-employed will obviously, as a result, improve their financial position against age or death.</P>
    <P>The introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed taxpayers and companies to be phased in over a period is something that has been talked about for so long and finally now is being implemented.  It has to be pointed out that this Government have vigorously pursued those evading taxes since taking office.  This new and radical move towards self-assessment will merely help them in that task.  The self-employed have been a much maligned sector in recent times when it comes to paying taxes.  The reality is that this sector includes the entrepreneurs, the men and women this Government depend on for the development and growth of the economy. These new measures will mean a more efficient means of tax collection and will eliminate abuses, measures that will be welcomed by the sector itself.  It puts the onus on the taxpayer to meet his or her tax obligations.  The volume of appeals will, no doubt, be reduced and there should be a dramatic decrease in <Col N="1247" /> the number employed in the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cutbacks in the number in the public service, I would like to compliment the Minister for Finance on the progress made to date on the voluntary redundancy scheme.  This has, I have no doubt, led to a more efficient public service and the voluntary nature of this programme has allowed for a smooth yet very significant change.  The fact that 1,100 people had left the public service in the period to the end of 1987 is no mean achievement and the Minister for Finance can take a bow for this amazing achievement.</P>
    <P>The fact that this scheme is voluntary is the secret of its success.  I take exception to the remarks by Deputy Keating that the voluntary element of this programme was a weakness in the Government's strategy.  He said the present Government strategy &ldquo;serves the individual rather than the State&rdquo;.  given the success of the present policy, I believe the Progressive Democrats should either withdraw or clarify that statement.</P>
    <P>The general increase in social welfare payments in line with anticipated inflation is also welcome and necessary. This Government have gone further than expected to meet proposals outlined in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We are well on the way to the reforms outlined in that report.  Compared to the previous Government, we are seeing action instead of verbiage on this issue.  Social welfare payments will be kept in line with the cost of living, with a 3 per cent increase from July.  This Government, true to the Fianna Fáil tradition, have set out deliberately to protect those who are less well off.  There is an extra 8 per cent increase in personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare payments on top of the 3 per cent indexation addition.  An increase of 11 per cent for the long-term unemployed is no small effort to alleviate the genuine difficulties of people who have suffered the soul-destroying effects of prolonged idleness.  I wish it could have been more, and I am sure the Minister <Col N="1248" /> does as well, but nevertheless it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The child dependant allowances system has been simplified and a 6 per cent increase for the children of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance recipients has been granted.  The special favourable treatment for families with six or more children is to be welcomed.  An example of this is that the rate of increase for the sixth and all subsequent children of unemployment assistant recipients is 31 per cent.  The cost to the Exchequer to these increases are very significant.  There will be an additional cost of £44.8 million this year and £101 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The figures produced by the Minister in his speech in relation to the Jobsearch programme are impressive &mdash; 141,500 people were interviewed, 40,400 were placed on Manpower schemes, AnCO training courses and Jobsearch programmes and 4,200 found jobs as a result of this scheme.  When invited to avail of assistance under the programme, 12,700 people left the register voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has obviously made considerable progress in tackling the problem of social welfare abuse.  It is most distressing to hear that abuses are still going on in this area.  We all hear of people on the dole working and being accommodated by employers in collecting the dole.  This abuse must be tackled.  I believe the Minister for Social Welfare has genuinely tried to tackle this issue but he must get back-up support from employers.  Unfortunately, a number of employers are not co-operating in this area.  This is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Government have also rightly recognised that a reduction in the community drug refund scheme and the long term illness scheme operated by the health boards will impose considerable hardship on the handicapped and the long term ill.  The allocation of an additional £11 million to the Health Vote to ensure these schemes are continued were examples of the caring and detailed approach adopted by this Government in putting this budget together.  Personally, <Col N="1249" /> I am very pleased to see this measure introduced.  Like other Deputies, I have a knowledge of individual cases where any other move would have caused tremendous hardship.  This is a very good decision.</P>
    <P>The special allocation of £3 million to provide accommodation for homeless persons by voluntary organisations means that this Government have recognised the special needs of the homeless. I would accept that this is only the beginning but it is a very positive step forward. The special grant of £50,000 being made available to Focus Point towards the cost of accommodation for the homeless in Dublin recognises that the problem of homelessness is particularly acute in the Dublin area, as you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will appreciate.</P>
    <P>I believe this policy of granting financial aid to specific projects in the Dublin area is one that should be developed as a means of coming to grips with the immediate needs of the homeless.  To cater for the long term solution, I look forward, as do many Members, to the introduction by the Minister for the Environment of the Homeless Persons Bill.</P>
    <P>The building industry have had to readjust to changing economic climates and to a Government that have taken away many of the hand-outs that were falsely propping them up over recent times.  The introduction of the section 23 relief should give a deserving boost to those in the building industry.  To ensure the success of the scheme, where incentives are established for the construction of modest residential accommodation for renting, I would appeal to planners in local authorities to co-operate and ensure that there are no lengthy delays in processing planning applications for construction or conversion of residential accommodation in the city.</P>
    <P>In Dublin there have been very positive developments in this area in recent times. Old historic buildings have been restored and preserved and, from an architectural point of view, this has been most desirable. However, I have seen cases where <Col N="1250" /> there have been lengthy delays in processing planning applications.  We should be able to adhere to specific planning guidelines on preservation and maintaining high architectural standards and at the same time ensure that developers are not frustrated by lengthy delays in the processing of planning applications.</P>
    <P>In regard to environment, the Government have taken on board a proposal to which other Deputies and I referred in this House some time ago when we debated the Air Pollution Bill, that is, the concession in the excise duty applying to lead free petrol, putting it on a par in cost with leaded petrol.  This will lead to a dramatic increase in the use of lead free petrol and will have a great effect on our environment and health, particularly in the Dublin area.  The allocation of £250,000 to establish smoke control measures in Dublin is also a very desirable development but this decision will have to be backed up at local authority level.  They will have to come up with concrete proposals to tackle this major problem in our city.</P>
    <P>The crucial factor in regard to decentralisation is to ensure that the decision making process devolves to the lowest local level, namely at citizen level.  If there is a need to build a school in a rural constituency it is ridiculous that the decision on such an issue is made in Dublin.  I would agree for more decentralisation and I am sure the Minister will welcome that as it would be much less work for her.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the decision to ensure the continuance of the NSSB.  The community information service provided by this body is very important and their expansion and development will lead to the eventual decline of clientilism.  They always provided an excellent and efficient service in my own locality in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>The budget, in many ways, is a reassessment, adjustment and a statement of how things have been going and will be in the years ahead.  To this end I must also refer to the establishment of FÁS. This move to rationalise the State agencies and to cut down on duplication is a <Col N="1251" /> major step forward and another example of a Government who act rather than speak.  In a marketing survey carried out on behalf of <i>Business and Finance</i> contrasting last year's Government with the present one, business managers expressed confidence in the economy in the aftermath of this budget compared with the negative response of last year. They obviously believe that the Government have a definite sense of direction and purpose.  They have seen results in interest rates falling, inflation coming down and business confidence being restored.  They witnessed the establishment of a <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which has been endorsed by the social partners.  This is a framework within which the business community can expand and plan, cushioned by the degree of stability that this very significant achievement has put in place. There is a feeling of security that has not been there for some time that the country is being managed by a competent and hardworking management team.</P>
    <P>The performance of industrial output and exports has also been most impressive. Industrial output increased by 8 per cent in 1987, more than two and a half times the level reached in each of the previous two years.  Industrial exports increased by 15 per cent in real terms compared with 1986.  The Estimates decision for 1988 has meant a most desirable shift in State support from fixed assets to research and development, management development and marketing support.  Total exports for 1987 have topped the £10.5 billion mark, the first time that the £10 billion figure has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech rightly confirmed that Governments can introduce specific measures to greatly enhance our vital tourist industry.  For example, access fares led to a significant recovery in tourism in 1987 and the decision to introduce another package of special measures for tourism in 1988, costing £4 million, will pay dividends.  I particularly welcome the establishment <Col N="1252" /> of a special task force involving key personnel such as Gillian Bowler and Mike Murphy who are energetic and positive. They are not part of the &ldquo;knocker&rdquo; brigade who encourage people to emigrate to Australia or to shop across the Border. Apart from their expertise and optimistic outlook, their attitude and belief in this country's potential has always created a sense of awareness of the need to look closely at what this country has to offer. I have every confidence in their ability to reach out to new markets and to bring in many new visitors.  The decision not to increase the tax on drink was correct, taking the needs of the tourist industry into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement outlined progress to date on Government performance.  He reaffirmed his sense of direction for the country which has met with a positive response from practically all sectors of the community.  A sense of political and economic awareness has been positively established and also a sense of leadership that has been missing for some time.  The budget is a courageous one as the Minister for Finance has finally taken decisions and action on the taxation issue.  He has recognised the plight of the PAYE sector and introduced self-assessment and PRSI for the self-employed. It has been a skilful budget in that he has been able to introduce for the first time a sense of equity.  He has had time to put his own mark on the budget and the results have been most impressive. It is a caring budget in that it protects social welfare recipients and recognises the needs of the homeless.  He has established a sense of fair play and consensus. The message has now filtered through from this minority Government that we must all play our part in creating a future for our children.  We may have to make sacrifices but the Government have ensured in the budget that the burden will fall equitably on all sectors of society. This sense of discipline and direction, one that is most evident in this budget, must be maintained in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this budget is seen by commentators generally as a competent and well thought out one.  It <Col N="1253" /> is in many ways a scene setting budget. Perceptions are sometimes as important as dry statistics.  There is a perception that this budget is one of an integrated series of budgets, drawn up as a careful part of an overall, longer term plan.  It now appears that clear goals have been defined and generally accepted by politicians, the electorate and industry and commerce.  The means of achieving these goals are also generally accepted &mdash; or at least recognised &mdash; by those same groups. This acceptance of goals and the recognition of the means to achieve them puts us on the right road.  The Minister in the budget advanced us several steps along the road.  He has encouraged us to increase our pace, he has not promised us false comfort but he has shared with us a reasonable expectation that we can get to our destination and still be in reasonable shape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Catholic Social Services Council and the Combat Poverty Agency do not share Deputy Kitt's view that this is a progressive budget in so far as the poor are concerned.  Certainly the start on helping the lower paid is very welcome but the proposed minimum figure of £42 as against the £48 put forward by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Catholic Social Services Council as an interim figure on the way to the £60 recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare is hardly sufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that single people living alone and in receipt of unemployment assistance or disability benefit will not get out of the poverty trap.  I welcome the progress made but we need to proceed more quickly.  In my constituency &mdash; I put my hand on my heart when I say this &mdash; a man is in receipt of £35.50 per week, it should be £40 but he was overpaid by £5 per week when he was on supplementary benefit.  As he is receiving disability benefit he does not qualify for the national fuel scheme and he literally had to burn his sofa to provide heating for his home.  I called on the man and I saw the mark along the wall where the sofa had been.  I am sure Deputies on <Col N="1254" /> both sides of the House have come across similar cases of this kind.  He is considered to be on short-term benefit, and therefore, does not qualify for the national fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>We must identify those poor people as our priority for assistance.  The budget moves in that direction, and I welcome the move but it does not go far enough. In many cases single people living with aged parents are able, with the help of the parents' old age pension and their own unemployment assistance, or disability benefit, to make ends meet. However, when the parent dies, the individual is left at home on his or her own on a small income out of which they have to feed and clothe themselves, heat the house, pay the rent or mortgage and everything else.  That is a deplorable situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts made by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Catholic Social Service Conference.  I read both of their reports last night.  These were both post budget reports.  Those two agencies took the time to inform Members of the House of their reaction to the budget.  That was a very good and useful exercise.  We must identify as people for priority assistance those who are suffering abject poverty.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Education is in the House and I would ask her to raise at the Cabinet table with her colleagues the question of extending the free fuel scheme for the remainder of the winter, to those people living alone on disability benefit, people like the man I referred to earlier who has only £35.50 per week.  The only way he can become eligible at present is by making a case based on special medical grounds.  I have tried to do that for two or three people but it is just impossible to get people into the scheme.  If nothing can be done for the remainder of this winter I hope she will find it possible at least to have something in the Finance Bill for the commencement of winter next year.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to refer to is that the Catholic Social Service Conference and the Combat Poverty Agency also point out that the budget does not make inroads towards tax equity.  The <Col N="1255" /> reality is that those on higher incomes benefit disproportionately to a higher extent than those who are on smaller incomes.  It is time we had a look at the whole question of tax credits.  It is time that any benefits given in the budget are the same for people down the line as they are for people up the line; if not, there should be some sort of inverted bias in the system so that the poorer people, and those on lower incomes, get the most advantageous benefits.  It is of no benefit to tax equity if people who are earning £20,000 a year get £600 of an increase while people earning only £6,000 a year are getting only £200 of an increase. Where is the equity in that?  Tax credits would at least give the same amount to everybody.  It is time we looked at the whole question of tax credits again so that there is equity in the system and also so that those on lower incomes get the same shake as those on higher incomes but, preferably, I would like to see them getting a better incentive from the system.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the administration of the tax system because the resolutions and the Minister's speech affect the whole system of tax assessment. I welcome the introduction of self assessment.  As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts I felt it necessary to make a pre-budget statement this year because my view is &mdash; and the Minister has said this since &mdash; that the whole system of the administration of tax is on the verge of collapse.  It is literally on the verge of collapse because we have got the officials in the tax administration system into the business of moving mounds, tons and tens of tons of paper from one office to another.  The whole machinery of assessment is grinding to a halt.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts have been examining the whole question of the accountability of the Revenue Commissioners, how they administer their system, the accounting systems they use and the efficiency with which they carry out their business.  We will be making a special report on that shortly. I welcome the start which has been made <Col N="1256" /> in the introduction of self assessment because that, in turn, can free officials to audit only one in 20 of those who make the returns.  The penalties for those who make false returns should be severe in order to discourage that practice.  The staff so freed, instead of pursuing complying taxpayers, should be used to pursue those who are not complying. How do we identify those who are not complying?  This is an important point which is referred to in the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>In the United States, within the revenue service, there is a tax compliance measurement programme which is literally a section of the revenue commissioners there which sets about identifying sections of the community, or members of the community, who are likely to be evading tax.  As a matter of great urgency, the staff who will be freed by the introduction of self assessment should be assembled into a tax compliance section within the Revenue service. Their job should be to make profiles of those who are likely to be major tax evaders, whether they be sections of the community or individuals.  They should be identified and gone after.  That is the primary task which should be given to those who are freed from the mountain of paperwork which is clogging up the machinery at present.</P>
    <P>The second thing I would like to see at this stage is the appointment of an external advisory committee made up of lawyers, accountants and tax agents who would advise the Revenue Commissioners of the difficulties being faced by the taxpayer in complying with the present system and as a priority, advise the Revenue Commissioners on how to unclog the administration of the tax system.  If we can free up the administration of the system, we can start looking at the whole question of equity, of fairness of people paying on time and sending out correct assessments as opposed to sending out inflated assessments, which tend to give rise to people thinking there is much more outstanding in tax than there actually is.</P>
    <P>Those two things &mdash; a tax compliance <Col N="1257" /> section within the Revenue Commissioners and an advisory body of experts outside the Revenue advising the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; which are included in the report of the Commission of Taxation &mdash; would, in my view, if coupled with the introduction of self assessment, go a long way down the road to the commencement of the introduction of equity in the tax system.  I ask that that be given urgent and priority consideration. It is a matter the Committee on Public Accounts will be addressing and reporting on by way of a special report, before the Finance Bill comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one or two other points.  Much has been said about the reduction in the budget deficit, the control of the public finances and the great steps which have been made towards this. There are two things I want to say on that.  First, there is little point in reducing one liability on the nation's balance sheet by increasing another liability and there is even less point if that liability happens to be employment because there are already 250,000 people unemployed. What we are doing, because of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; as the Government call it &mdash; is making 10,000 more people redundant, taking them out of the public service in order to pay for the public service pay increase.  Those 10,000 people are going on to the unemployment register to compete with the other people who are there for fewer and fewer jobs.  I do not see any sanity in that. I do not believe cuts should be made in the budget deficit which are cosmetic in the sense that they increase a greater liability, in this case, unemployment, on the same balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Second, a great deal has been made of the reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  If you look at the figures the current budget deficit has only been reduced from 6.8 per cent to 6.3 per cent.  In terms of the actual figures it has not been reduced at all.  I do not see how we can take great joy in making all the savings on the capital budget side.  If there is to be any employment it must come <Col N="1258" /> from the public capital side &mdash; the investment side &mdash; which the Government can hope to use as a State vehicle for encouraging employment.  Where is the point in axing that?  It has been axed to the extent of 1.9 per cent, if my memory is correct, but the current budget deficit has hardly been reduced at all.  I do not see the logic in that and I cannot see why people can welcome this budget with such warmth from the point of view of fiscal rectitude considering that the current budget side has hardly been touched at all.  That is something that needs to be addressed if the nation's finances are to be got into some semblance of good order.</P>
    <P>The budget did not even mention the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; and it did not address the question of unemployment. For that matter, this House has not addressed the question of unemployment which is the single biggest problem facing this country.  There should be monthly debates in this House on unemployment. There should be monthly reviews on unemployment and there should be cooperation from all sides of the House. Unemployment should be public enemy number one and the creation of employment should be our top priority ahead of all others, including Northern Ireland. We have not even spent time in this House debating the possibilities for creating jobs, what can be done to ensure that we do not lose jobs and what can be done to minimise the number unemployed. We have never debated that, at least not since I came into this House in 1981.  A number of us have tried to raise it from time to time but the House should address and monitor that question.  There should be progress reports at least once a month so that people would know that we are aware of and addressing the question. There are now 250,000 people unemployed and that figure is increasing.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House is aware of the number of people who are talking about migrating.  Yesterday I spoke to a very prominent businessman who told me that he is going to Australia for five or six weeks and that he was bringing his family with him.  If he likes what he sees there he is going to go back and stay <Col N="1259" /> there.  The other day I spoke to a young man of 25 who has eight honours in both his intermediate certificate and leaving certificate.  The only job he has ever had was a part time job putting petrol into cars.  He went to New York as an illegal immigrant but, unfortunately, because of a family bereavement he had to come home where he is still unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have never addressed the question of unemployment in this House.  That is not the Government's fault.  It is very handy for all of us on this side of the House and everybody else to blame the Government but if we identify the wrong target we will let the problem escape. Not only should this House address this question now but it should do so on a regular basis and we should seek a pluralist, all-party approach to deal with this cancer in our society.  Until we do that there will be no restoration of hope and there will be a continued haemorrhage of emigration.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, wrote a book called the <i>Spirit of the Nation</i>.  Where is the spirit of the nation now?  We need to harness that spirit and the only way we can do that is by giving people hope.  There is no hope because we are not addressing that question.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that £1 million has been made available in the budget for homeless persons but I deplore the fact that a homeless persons Bill has not been introduced by the Government.  The Bill which was introduced by the previous Government is still on the stocks, and could very easily be reintroduced.  We should make it one of our priorities. While providing money is welcome, a proper framework is also needed.  Regular reviews should be carried out and this can only be done through the provision of a homeless persons Bill.  The Vatican issued a document on this important subject this morning and the Catholic Social Service Council and the Combat Poverty Agency have also raised this issue.  I have received letters from about 20 nuns and community leaders in my own constituency about this issue.  It <Col N="1260" /> is an important issue and should be given priority during this session.</P>
    <P>Little mention was made of the Millennium in the budget.  I believe that provision should have been made in the budget for the implementation of the Metropolitan Streets Commission report on Dublin during this the Millennium year of our capital city.  Probably one-third of the population of the city constantly move in and out of the city.  All of the people of the country take pride in Dublin and I regret that the Minister did not see fit to refer to this fact in his Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>There have been various suggestions in regard to the proposed monument for O'Connell Street.  We are aware of the suggestion put forward by the Metropolitan Streets Commission but in regard to the monument which is proposed and for which financing is available in the private sector, I believe the most suitable project for the site would be a monument commemorating the literary giants who lived and wrote in this city when it was the literary capital of the world.  It is they who should be commemorated on the monument to be erected on the site of the old Nelson Pillar.  I regret, and it shows a lack of imagination, that little or no reference was made to this in the Minister's Budget Statement.  I hope the Minister will find it possible in the Finance Bill to make funds available to enable this project to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister has in mind as regards urban renewal for Tallaght and I do not know whether anybody has been putting a gun to his head or what his relationship with Monarch Properties, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council is, but I do believe the town centre in Tallaght needs to be developed.  I hope the Minister did not find himself being pushed into giving these tax incentives by threats not to develop it but I would like to see at an early date the specific boundaries which the Minister is proposing.  In the urban renewal proposals the Minister should not just incorporate Tallaght town centre but should also look at the possibility of giving urban renewal tax-type incentives <Col N="1261" /> for the development of a rapid rail system from Heuston Station to Clondalkin and Tallaght.  There is no reason why this cannot be done by the private sector if the correct tax incentives are made available.</P>
    <P>Only for Mr. Tom Roche, there would never have been a toll bridge.  There are people with imagination who can obtain the resources and if the State cannot do it we should try to make provisions in the tax system which would enable the private sector to do it.  When the Minister addresses the question of the provision of tax incentives in regard to urban renewal for Tallaght he should also address the question of the provision of a rapid rail system.  Similar tax incentives should be given to the private sector to enable it to develop that system.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by dealing with the question on the way State spending is audited.  If we include Appropriations-in-Aid gross spending is of the order of £12 billion a year.  Half of that figure goes on wages and salaries and let us presume for the sake of the exercise that none of it is wasted.  Of course, we all know that is not true because, for example, there are a number of people in the tax profile section who have been paid for the last six months and yet are sitting at home. Leaving that aside, let us take the remaining £6 billion.  If 2 per cent or 3 per cent of that figure amounted to wasteful expenditure and could be eliminated, we would be talking about a saving of between £120 million and £180 million. Does anyone in this House believe that we could not identify at least 2 per cent or 3 per cent of wasteful expenditure?  Of course, we could.  If we could cut it out we would be making a major contribution towards the elimination of the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that the Committee of Public Accounts have undertaken an examination of their role and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They have appointed an expert advisory group who will report to them by the end of March.  It is my hope that an all-party report will be presented to this House which will recommend the implementation of a modern audit and <Col N="1262" /> accounting system which will cut out wasteful expenditure.  It is very unsatisfactory that the Comptroller and Auditor General has to work under legislation passed in in 1966.  We should attend to these matters and I hope the House will have an opportunity at an early stage to consider an all-party report from the Committee of Public Accounts in this regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he will confirm that in early November a statement was issued indicating that the ministerial discussions were over, that it was now a matter for a group of senior officials and that an action programme for implementation in this calendar year was to be unveiled?  Will the Minister accept that as we are entering into the second month of the year it is a bit off to expect delivery within this 12 month period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. What I said in November was that we had passed a proposal at Cabinet to set up an inter-departmental committee, involving the Departments of Education and Labour, to examine this matter.  We asked that committee to report back at the end of January, if possible.  The report should be with me in the next week or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Following discussions in the House I put a number of questions to the inter-departmental committee. Under the present system 6,000 young school leavers are accommodated on a six month scheme.  It is my view that that period should be extended to at least 18 months or two years.  I would hope to try to build that up to a two-year programme but I do not wish to pre-empt the recommendations of the inter-departmental committee.  Many people who work with early school leavers agree that a period of between 18 and 24 months would be more realistic.  The difficulty is that to do that within the present financial constraints would mean moving from one area to <Col N="1264" /> another.  We will have to look at that. The Deputy is correct in thinking that my view is that the period should be extended to at least 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we dealing only with early school leavers or will the discussions involve all those entering the working environment?  Is it the intention that the group involved will be catered for from within existing resources?  Does the Minister envisage extra resources being made available?  Will the Minister say whether this exercise will have any implications for the number of years that students will be putting in at second level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that additional resources will be available but I do not think that is likely.  We will try to get ESF aid for the programme in 1989 but if we get the programme in operation in the autumn, as I hope to do, it will have to be funded from existing resources.  The programme is confined to early school leavers, those considered to be the drop-outs from our education system.  I do not see the programme having any implications for the number of years that students stay in the second level system.  We have asked the committee to see how we could keep young people in the education system because in my view that would be better for them. However, we must accept that no matter what happens 6,000 will drop out every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the structures which are in place between his Department and the Department of Industry and Commerce which would allow consultation to take place on the subject of the available skills and experience of those who are unemployed in relation to the types of jobs that are being targeted for creation; and whether the type of training and enterprise programmes being offered by FÁS relate to the sectors targeted for growth by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The consultation procedures between the Department of Industry and Commerce and my own Department on the interface between industrial and training policies has been strengthened following the improvements made in my Department's policy formulation role.  Existing procedures are designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to ensure that job creation policies take account of the skills and qualifications of present and future members of the labour force, including the unemployed.  The sectoral job creation objective outlined in section 5 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are consistent with this approach and my Department will continue to consult with the relevant agencies in relation to any skill requirements arising from individual elements of the programme.</P>
      <P>The specific skill programmes of FÁS include courses in many areas of direct relevance to the sectors targeted in the programme, such as tool making, mechanical engineering, electronics, clothing, crafts and the food industry.  The content and structure of these courses are subject to regular review.  I should point out that this review must take account of the skill requirements of all industries, not just those targeted by the Government in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A different approach is called for in regard to the priority unemployed categories of unqualified early school leavers <Col N="1266" /> and the long term unemployed.  Their training often takes the form of basic or intermediate skills which can be applied across a range of occupations rather than specific skills for a specific occupation. Where the qualifications and experience of the unemployed warrant it they are assigned to a specific skill programme of the type I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>In regard to FÁS enterprise programmes, these primarily take the form of opportunities for either unemployed individuals wishing to become self-employed or for communities to engage in job creation.  As such they are not specific to any sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the lengthy reply to the question. However, the real issue in the question has not been addressed by him.  Will the Minister tell the House the structures which have been strengthened?  There was reference to the aim of those structures but I am not clear as to what is happening between the Departments of Labour and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of matters involved.  The first, and the most important, is that under the new FÁS structure FÁS will be running all the schemes.  The policy unit is in the Department of Labour.  My Department have a team working on policy.  Up to this the officials who were involved in the schemes were also involved in policy making and they got so involved in the day to day working of the schemes that they were not able to concentrate on policy.  Their sole objective now will be to prepare policy.  They will have more time to be involved in designing schemes and keeping in touch with what is happening in Europe.  They will also review existing schemes.  In the course of my speech on the budget I stated that it was my intention to carry out a review of all our schemes and decide on what we should keep and what we should abolish. There are a number of other formal groups in the Department engaged in other work and I am not sure of their value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> They include the sectoral development committee and the consultative committee to the management committee on industrial policy.  There are <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and the most common are those involved in the Custom House Docks site.  There is also the joint commission that studies the future skill needs in tool making in the electronics industry and that involves the IDA and AnCO. Industrial policy agencies are participating in some industrial training committees. There is also contact between the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Labour and between FÁS and Governments Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House how many people are involved in the policy unit in his Department? I appreciate that there are formalised structures between the Departments of Industry and Commerce and Labour but I suggest to the Minister that he should strengthen them and make them more applicable to the areas targeted for growth such as the food industry, tourism, forestry and so on.  The prospect of any real growth in jobs will be lost if we do not have a trained work force ready to take up these opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point and will take up the matter. Recently at a meeting with the executive of FÁS I asked them to relate their courses to areas such as tool making, mechanical engineering, electronics and the production of craft products.  I included tourism, where the target is 25,000 jobs, as well as food, horticulture, forestry and marine.  They must try to link up with these areas.  I do not want to guess the number but I will pass the details to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept, notwithstanding the detail of his response, that the great weight of FÁS activity in the next couple of years will be in the area of training for the unemployed as a social service rather than in response to a particular demand?</P>

      <P>I do.  There are areas where both objectives can be achieved. The social employment scheme can, for example, be related to tourism.  Some of the best social employment schemes have been involved in the tourism sector.  Very much credit was given last year to the social employment scheme in Sneem, which won the tidy towns competition. The same thing happened in the previous year in Kinsale.  We should look at where resources can best be used to provide for social and economic needs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>When the amalgamation of manpower and training bodies was being considered last year the Government decided that CERT would retain its separate identity outside the new organisation, FÁS, set up under the Labour Services Act, 1987. I have no plans in mind to change the present independent status of CERT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government also decided in July, 1987, that the hotel, catering and tourism industry should make a greater contribution to the overall <Col N="1270" /> cost of CERT's services.  CERT are holding consultations at the moment with representatives of the various sectors of the industry, with a view to agreeing the level of contribution each sector should make. To date the only direct financial contribution made to the operations of CERT by the sectors to which it provides advisory and training services has been from the hotel sector channelled through the registration fees charged by Bord Fáilte.  In addition, course fees are charged by CERT for inservice training courses.  The amounts contributed in this way in 1987 were £16,000 and £203,000 respectively out of an overall budget in 1987 of £5,705,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What arrangements have been made to ensure that there is substantial contact between CERT and FÁS and that the two bodies work in close harness?  Does the Minister's response indicate that the Government have rejected the views of the Price Water-house report which saw a future for CERT with the Department of Tourism? Regarding the contribution, is it the case that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> envisages that 300 extra trainees should be trained by CERT this year? The Estimates published provide for a reduction in expenditure by CERT and the Minister has explained this by saying that he will get an increase this year. Would he accept that if the target of 300 extra trainees is to be achieved on a smaller Estimate the extra contribution will have to be forthcoming fairly rapidly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe any structures have been set up.  I am not sure they will be necessary.  I think there will be fairly close co-operation.  As part of the considerations on the Estimates for 1988 I discussed with the council of CERT what they could achieve in 1988. <Col N="1271" /> They were satisfied to reach the targets which they had set out, provided they got an increased contribution from the industry.  Like my predecessors, I have been very anxious to get the industry to contribute more.  Deputies will agree that a contribution of £16,000 towards a budget of almost £6 million is not acceptable for a body which provides such extra service to the tourism industry.  The council of CERT have accepted these proposals and the means by which it is hoped to collect the money.  That process is going on.  I do not believe there is any difficulty about CERT reaching their targets for 1988.  If they do not achieve the collection of this money there certainly will be a difficulty but for a number of reasons I intend that the money will be collected.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement on the plans, if any, he has to provide employment in outer city housing estates.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's general economic policies and programmes, including the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> which are framed to develop an environment conducive to increasing the overall level of employment.  These measures will contribute to expanding employment opportunities in outer-city housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own area of responsibility, the <Col N="1272" /> major contributions which can be made to employment generation centre on developing a satisfactory industrial relations climate; assisting industry in improving competitiveness by enhancing the skills and competence of its work force through training; and assisting first time job seekers and the unemployed through the provision of employment and training programmes.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January 1988 An Foras Áiseanna Saothair &mdash; FÁS &mdash; is responsible for the operation of employment and training programmes.  The main task of FÁS is to help those without jobs to find work and to ensure that people entering the labour market are adequately trained and possess the skills relevant to labour market needs.  It is my policy that FÁS should be as responsive as possible to local needs.</P>
    <P>The social employment scheme, the enterprise scheme, the teamwork scheme, the community enterprise programme and the community youth training programme are of particular relevance in assisting local groups and individuals to provide employment at local level.  It is my hope that voluntary groups in outer-city housing estates should avail of these schemes to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Under the 1987 Labour Services Act the day-to-day administration of training and employment schemes is a matter for FÁS.  Should the Deputy require further information on the schemes, including how particular outer-city housing estates could benefit from them, he should contact FÁS direct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree he is giving no clear indication in his reply that he is paying particular attention to the outer-city housing estates around the major cities such as Dublin. For example, in my own constituency of Tallaght almost 100,000 people have been put out there and no consideration appears to be given to them.  Has the Minister any specific plans to deal with the appallingly high, well above national average levels of unemployment that are in these estates?  The people who have <Col N="1273" /> been put out there have been forgotten about by this Government and by the Department.  No special attention has been given to them at all.  There are just houses.  There are no industries or jobs, nothing for the people.  We are still waiting to hear from the Minister on the local initiative, despite his promises before Christmas.  It is now after Christmas and we are still waiting.  Is the Minister going to give any special attention to those huge urban conglomerations, mostly local authority housing, that have been put there?  We cannot be put off by this waffle about schemes here and schemes there. We want to know what jobs will come up there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak for the areas under my control.  I know the particular scheme which the Deputy has referred to in Tallaght.  Unfortunately, it is still under review and it is not an easy issue to resolve.  It was being dealt with before by the Youth Employment Agency.  With regard to other schemes, it is open to communities to apply to take up places under the schemes, such as the social employment scheme and the Teamwork scheme.  A substantial number of communities have done so. The figure at the end of December for the take-up rate for the social employment scheme alone was over 11,000.  I know they are part time, short term jobs but they are some of the things which the Deputy has referred to.  Those schemes are available for any community and any area in the outer-city may apply for them.</P>

I am sure there are quite a number of schemes.  Again, I repeat that it is open to any of the communities in Tallaght to apply for any of the Teamwork or enterprise schemes and to be assessed on the same basis as anywhere else in the country.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that some of the schemes he has mentioned, specifically Teamwork and the social employment scheme, depend for their success on an organised and motivated local community effort?  Does he agree that the experience to date has been that the schemes seem to take more naturally in rural areas where you are dealing with a smaller and perhaps more tightly knit community and that there is a need for a special effort in some of the bigger newer housing estates in urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the experience to date in the tightly knit local communities, particularly rural communities. The closely knit community helps because there are recognised leaders in the community.  However, there are excellent examples in the city, although I would admit that there are not as many localities.  Some of the notable social employment schemes around the <Col N="1275" /> city have involved sponsors who came forward from the community to help to organise them.  However, there is a difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent the Minister has dealt with part of my question.  First, what efforts are being made to actually promote the schemes particularly in areas of extremely high unemployment and deprivation, where the social infrastructure is not very well developed?  Are the schemes promoted in those areas or are there plans to engage in promotion of the schemes or to develop people's skills so that they can engage in these schemes?  Secondly, on a previous occasion we questioned the effectiveness of some of the schemes, particularly the enterprise allowance scheme.  At that time we knew that there was a lot of uptake for the scheme, although there was no indication of what long term jobs were developing out of them.  Is there any further information on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, FÁS have undertaken, now that they have been amalgamated into one unit to have a further publicity drive and to get the information on the schemes out to the communities both in urban and rural areas.  I think the first and perhaps the second leaflets have actually gone out.  Again, I will take that point up because I think it is important. Following a review by the previous Government on the enterprise allowance scheme, there were a number of amendments made to tighten up the scheme and try to ensure that there would be more real and lasting jobs.  A report which will be completed shortly was commissioned by the previous Government to examine that question.  We will await the finding of that report before making any changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the case of rural areas it is perhaps reasonable to anticipate that there will be ideas and suggestions coming forward to which FÁS can respond?  However, would he accept that in the case of some of these areas that a promotion campaign of itself will not produce sufficient projects?  Would he consider asking FÁS to assign people to act as facilitators in some of these areas of high unemployment to get ideas and projects going?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point.  For the information of all Deputies, the regional structure whereby there would be a regional headquarters in communities has not finally been decided yet, but in Dublin there would probably be two or three.  The regions around the country are fairly well established.  That should help because, as Deputy Taylor has said it would save people having to identify back to the head office with the attendant difficulties in transport and finance.  It should be easier to organise once it is on a regional basis.  It is hoped that those regions will be set up by the end of this month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standard training allowances payable to unemployed trainees in FÁS and CERT of 18 years and over will continue to be set at a rate equivalent to the maximum urban long-term unemployment assistance rate.  Persons entitled to social welfare payments higher than that rate will receive allowances set at the equivalent to their social welfare entitlement.  Consequently, when social welfare payments are increased in late <Col N="1278" /> July 1988, these training allowances will increase by the same amount.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to change the rates of the special training allowances set for 15 to 17-year olds who are not entitled to unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Grants to sponsors in respect of wages paid to participants on teamwork and the social employment schemes are not linked to social welfare rates.  I have no proposals to increase these grants at present.</P>
    <P>As regards CERT unemployed trainees, the additional payment for Christmas was made on the same basis as applied to AnCO-FÁS trainees.  In other words, CERT unemployed trainees who obtained a certificate from the Department of Social Welfare that they were on long term unemployment assistance at the commencement of training received the bonus from CERT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal first with the extra allowances for Christmas. Will the Minister accept that his promise to the Dáil that the announcement he had made would mean that there would be no disincentive to trainees proved hollow?  All told, some 4,000 trainees did not benefit from the extra allowances promised.  Trainees who were long term unemployed who would have qualified for the bonus had they remained unemployed were not paid the bonus if they were recruited before 17 August.  Therefore, we had the extraordinary anomaly of people working side-by-side, some getting the bonus and some not getting the bonus.  Also, trainees less than 15 months unemployed at the start of training and, therefore, only short term did not get it while if they had remained unemployed they would have become long term and qualified for the extra 60 per cent.  Will the Minister accept that a number of very serious gaps emerged in what he had promised for Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  I made very clear in August when we cut the training rates that it was for new entrants to the courses and we gave a commitment <Col N="1279" /> to those on the courses that they would continue to receive the same rates.  That is precisely what we did.  When we announced it in the initial statement in early December there was some confusion in this House.  Clearly, I gave the instructions following talks with the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Finance and the Department of Labour on the position.  I also issued a statement which was properly published in the newspapers.  I do not accept that there was confusion.  It may be that people wished to interpret that everybody was going to get the increased rates and an increased bonus, but it was clear from my statements from as early as August what the position was going to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the trainees involved would hold their own judgment of that.  Regarding the Teamwork and social employment schemes, is it not the case that because of the increases announced in the budget these programmes will be of interest now only to people without dependants?  The increases provided for in the budget will bring the rates paid to someone with one adult dependant substantially above the Teamwork and social employment allowance, so effectively those schemes will be confined to young, single people.  Does the Minister regard that as satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The attraction of the social employment scheme was always for single people and people with no dependants.  That is still the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the substantial, unexpected &mdash; I will not say generous because nothing is generous for long term unemployed &mdash; increase, there could be a problem and we will have to monitor that as the year goes forward.  If there is not a take-up on social employment and Teamwork schemes, I will have to examine the matter at that stage, but <Col N="1280" /> it is contrary at the moment.  Demands for the scheme are massive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that he is starting off the year with an imbalance?  He knows that the target group for the social employment and Teamwork schemes will be single people without dependants, yet the vast majority of people on long term unemployment must be those with dependants.  At whom is he aiming the social employment scheme?  Does he think it suitable for long term unemployed people in reality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past three years and up to now the social employment scheme has attracted single people and people without dependants.  I have not got the figure in my brief, but the target number is four or five times higher than the number of places, which is about 9,400 man years.  That can still be targeted to a substantial number of people. Another matter that I cannot change is that my estimates and the man years available under the schemes were based last September-October before any changes or budget were discussed so I still have to live within those figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birminghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that when the social employment scheme was first introduced there was an incentive to take part in that scheme to anyone who was first, single: second, married without other dependants and, thirdly, married with one child: that all of those categories stood to gain financially from participation but it has now been whittled down to where only single people find it attractive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There were always very few people.  That is why it is £85 for a married person and unfortunately there is still a substantial number of married people whom it might attract.  It was never as attractive, and I think that still holds.  On the more important question, if it appears that there is a massive falloff in the schemes, then I can review it because I will be dealing with the same financial figures.  However, there is no indication of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that it would have been more appropriate in the budget to devote more funds to the social employment scheme and make it more attractive to long term unemployed people, instead of increasing unemployment assistance and thereby copperfastening the position of those people outside the labour market? Surely, it would have been more appropriate to do something that would enable them to take part and if you have a given amount of funds to put them into something that allows them to participate rather than keeping them outside.</P>

I said in reply to a previous question that the ESF contribution towards the social employment scheme was far less than we received on the training schemes.  By trying to achieve an increase on the ESF contribution we will finally help the social employment scheme, but that will be resolved in 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood the Minister's earlier reply.  If the social employment scheme is not to be increased relative to the social welfare increases, will he consider increasing it relative to the increases provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was agreed with the trade union movement?  It would seem only fair that an increase be provided.  I understand that the only thing done in this regard in recent years has been a reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There was an increase in the married person's rate and a decrease in the other rate which also allowed more people to be taken on the scheme.  Within the fairly tight guidelines of the financial targets I have to achieve in 1988 I have not the resources to increase it by 3.5 per cent, but it is a matter that can be reviewed based on the take-up during the year.</P>

The Commission's decision on the 1988 allocations is not expected until April 1988.  The <Col N="1283" /> amount of assistance to be approved for each member state will depend on the eligibility of the programmes submitted and whether they qualify for priority under the rules and guidelines of the Social Fund.  I have no reason to think that Ireland will be approved for significantly less in 1988, or Spain and Portugal for significantly more, than was the case in 1987.</P>
      <P>The level of assistance from the European Social Fund, as from other Community Structural Funds, for future years will depend very much on the outcome of discussions on the Delors Plan which is at present under consideration by the Council of the European Communities. Among the main elements of the Delors Plan are that the budgets of the Community Structural Funds should be doubled by 1992 and that there should be a greater concentration of the resources of the funds on the less developed Community regions, including Ireland.  These proposals are being strongly supported by Ireland and I very much hope that they will be adopted.  If they are adopted, Ireland's receipts from the Community Structural Funds, including the European Social Fund should increase substantially. However, the benefits of these proposals would not, in any event, become evident before 1989, when the reform of the funds is due to take effect.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the unease there is about the structure of the Social Fund, the contemplated changes in the way it is administered and the way the regulations affect the implementation of the fund?  Would the Minister have any qualms about the way that might affect our implementation of the use of the funds in future years?  Fears have been expressed that the rules will change because the Commission regard the funds as being too loosely applied. Does the Minister think that will adversely affect us?</P>

      <P>Negotiations are already taking place on the reform of the Community Structural Funds, which include the European Social Fund, as part of the Delors Plan for the future of Europe.  In those negotiations, Ireland is pressing in particular for a doubling of the volume of assistance to the poorer or less developed regions of the Community and for an increase in the rate of assistance to those regions.  I hope that decisions on these issues favourable to Ireland will be taken at the forthcoming meeting of the European Council on 11-12 February next.  When the broad decisions on the reform of the Structural Funds have been taken the European Commission will later this year submit proposals to the Council for the detailed administration of the European Social Funds.  It is my intention, in the Council of Ministers, when the proposals relating to the European Social Fund are being discussed, to press for a special rate of assistance for schemes such as the social employment scheme which are designed to suit the long term unemployed.  The designation of the long term unemployed as a priority category has already been agreed in principle by all delegations.</P>

      <P>In the application of much of the legislation administered by my Department, no distinction is made between full-time and part-time workers. Legislation such as the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979, applies to all workers irrespective of the number of hours worked.</P>
      <P>By means of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, the threshold of eligibility for the legislation pertaining to unfair dismissal, minimum notice and redundancy payments was reduced to 18 hours a week, thereby bringing more workers within the scope of such legislation.  I am not in a position to give any commitment to a further reduction of the eligibility threshold in the foreseeable future, because of the cost implications, which could adversely affect employment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister has to take other views into account but would he accept that there is a significant growth in the numbers of people who are working less than 18 hours, that these people deserve at least the same protection as full-time workers and that the question of costs would not enter into it unless a case was found against an employer for unfair dismissal or against the State in the case of insolvency payments when a company goes out of existence.  The immediate cost would not necessarily be excessive?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the examination proved that some protection should be given to part-time workers, I would be in favour of doing something in that area. <Col N="1288" /> A number of Acts cover a threshold of 18 hours and there is a cost factor involved in changing the threshold.  It is only three years since the time was brought down from 21 to 18 hours.  There is a financial problem in changing the threshold.</P>

Does the Minister agree that one could end up with less part-time work being offered and that there is actually a trade-off here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. We had that debate here not so long ago.  When it was 21 hours a number of employers employed people for 20½ hours and when it was brought down to 18 hours employers offered 17½ hours.  The overall effect was that there was less part-time work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the other side of that coin is that employers appear to be using this threshold as a way of opting out of their responsibilities to their employees and that that is a very strong argument for the elimination of this threshold altogether? Whatever one might decide about amending legislation and the kind of cover to be applied, at least there should be some basic minimum cover for part-time workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>There is a substantial amount of cover.

      <P>Following discussions during 1987 in the Standing Committee on Employment and the Social Affairs Council of measures to help the long term unemployed, a comprehensive set of conclusions was adopted by the Council in December 1987 including an invitation to the Commission to present an action programme in favour of the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Commission have prepared, but not approved, an action programme as requested by the Council. I would expect that this programme would cover a range of measures covering such matters as counselling, placement, vocation training, work experience, assistance in starting businesses et cetera.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to comment on the implications of the action programme for this country before the programme becomes available.  However, the major implications for Ireland is likely to be one of cost.  Given the scale of our unemployment problem and our limited finances, we will have to seek Community support for any new measures or any increase in the range of measures already in operation in Ireland in favour of the long term unemployed.  The question of additional Community assistance will have to be looked at in the context of reform of the structural funds which is being discussed at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to use social welfare criteria when the social employment scheme was set up.  The reason for that was that the live register and classification system could identify those in need of income support and employment opportunities.  It was accepted at the time that a requirement <Col N="1291" /> of eligibility was that the person should be in receipt of unemployment assistance which represented the most appropriate test of the need to replace lost income and regain employment.  A person must be unemployed for over a year, be in receipt of a social welfare payment such as unemployment assistance or be in receipt of a combination of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit or be in attendance at a recognised training course.

      <P>The question of the facilities to be afforded to worker directors on a day to day basis in pursuing issues related to board membership is and must remain a matter for the employer concerned.</P>
      <P>I met with the Worker Director Group in December last to discuss a range of topics of interest to them.  At that meeting a number of points were raised relating to changes which had been made in the facilities which the worker directors of NET had enjoyed while employees of that body.  Since the establishment of Irish Fertiliser Industries, the worker directors have now become employees of this body and the facilities accorded to them as employees of NET have been reviewed and curtailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the facilities which those directors enjoyed since the passing of the worker participation legislation are withdrawn, that they no longer have access to secretarial and telephone facilities and that they are now expected to take time <Col N="1293" /> from annual leave in order to pursue their responsibility as worker directors?  Will the Minister accept that movement in that direction is scarcely compatible with bringing in legislation to increase the number of bodies which will have worker directors on them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agreed with that view in my reply.  Worker directors on the board of NET are employees of IFI which is a private joint venture company between ICI and NET.  I do not have the power nor do my colleagues to get involved in the day to day running of the company.  In the agreement it was agreed that the worker directors would have time to attend board meetings.  What is regrettable is that all of these facilities which they had under NET, which were adequate, were actually withdrawn without any consultation.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that in the run up to the merger into IFI, categorical assurances were given to the workers that there would be no changes in their conditions and that their conditions involved access to effectively operating worker directors with an elaborate system of consultation?  Would the Minister accept that this question of the role of worker directors was raised at length by my party colleague Deputy John Bruton during the course of the debate in this House, and that he received a categorical assurance that industrial democracy would continue to be a feature of the new IFI?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement on the Government's attitude to pay increases for the lower paid during the currency of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The agreements on pay negotiated in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are structured in such a way as to favour the lower paid.  Both agreements provide for increases in pay of 3 per cent on the first £120 of basic weekly pay and 2 per cent on any amount of basic weekly pay over £120.</P>
      <P>Where the application of this formula would result in increases of less than £4 per week in basic pay for full-time adult employees, the agreement covering the public service provides that the increases shall be adjusted to that amount.  The agreement between the ICTU, FUE and CIF covering the private sector provides that the increases can be adjusted to £4 per week by local negotiation and local agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joint labour committees have been established to cater for the negotiation of rates of pay in a number of categories of employment in the private sector and difficulties have arisen in a number of these committees in relation to the application of the £4 per week minimum increase.  The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, sets out the procedure to be followed by the joint labour committees in drawing up proposals for increases in pay <Col N="1296" /> and these procedures are at present being gone through by the committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there appears to be considerable confusion on the part of the employers and the unions as to what exactly they negotiated in the pay agreement which accompanied the national plan?  At the time when the national plan was published, it was hailed by the trade union movement because of its commitment to the lower paid.  Specifically, it was asserted from every rooftop that the lower paid were now guaranteed an increase of £4 a week and it seems now that no such agreement was negotiated. Does the Minister accept that the pay agreement negotiated for the private sector contains within it no guarantee of a £4 increase for the lower paid?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate the present position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions towards the pay agreement and towards the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>?

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that we all would like to see the lower paid obtaining as much as possible under the agreement, that is, £4 a week.  There is some disagreement on that matter.  There is a very clear structure set out for dealing with the matter and that process is being dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute began on Friday, 22 January.  Several days of intensive discussion under the chairmanship of an industrial relations officer of the Labour Court failed to resolve the dispute. I would emphasise that discussions continued in the Labour Court right up until the morning the dispute commenced.</P>
      <P>I have been keeping in constant touch with events.  A considerable gap exists between the parties which has resulted in a complete stalemate.  Talks are scheduled to take place this afternoon under an industrial relations officer of the Labour Court.

      <P>May I ask the Minister to confirm that it is an entire coincidence that these discussions in the Labour Court are taking place on the day on which the question appears on the Order Paper, and after nothing had happened for three weeks?  I am sure the Minister will give that assurance wholeheartedly. With regard to the commencement of the dispute, what was the Minister's role in the hours leading up to the commencement of the strike? Specifically, what attempts did he make to make contact with the trade union involved and what proposals, if any, had he attempted to put to the parties?</P>

      <P>In reply to the first part <Col N="1299" /> of the question, I should like to be able to say to the Deputy that I had been instrumental in getting today's talks going, but I cannot claim credit for that. It is purely due to the efforts of the conciliation officer.  I wish him well in his efforts.  He has been keeping the matter under review for the last few weeks and is still making endeavours.  It is a very difficult position.  The Deputy raised this question before.  On the evening and night of the commencement of the dispute, I had no involvement whatever in trying to resolve it.  I was subsequently told that perhaps some fire officers in Tara Street Fire Brigade Station told Deputy Birmingham that I was in discussions on that night.  In actual fact, I was in the Jesuits' College of Theology and Philosophy, talking about the Dublin Millenium.</P>

      <P>I am flabbergasted. Far be it from me to put any impediment in the way of the Minister's attempts to acquire a Jesuitical education at this stage.  There is a belief on the part of both negotiating teams that there were proposals being hatched within the Department of Labour which were intended to be put before them in the hours leading up to the strike.  There is the belief that if those proposals could be considered, progress could be made, but those proposals seem to have got lost. May I ask the Minister if there were proposals being put together, and if so, what is their status now?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will consider initiating a programme for unemployed persons, both short term and long term, similar to the local employment initiatives throughout Europe, which would be of lasting benefit to both the community and the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The term local employment initiative is used in Europe to describe activity undertaken by the community at local level to increase employment. It normally encompasses such areas as community business and enterprise development.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) of the Labour Services Act provides for FÁS to assist local coununity groups in the provision of employment by the establishment of enterprises. This provision is made operational by the community enterprise programme which aims to assist, directly and indirectly, in the creation of economically viable jobs. FÁS is at present working with 350 local community groups in developing economic projects leading to substainable jobs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the community dimension is also a feature of temporary work programmes such as the Social Employment Scheme and Teamwork. Projects under these schemes are organised by community bodies and local authorities and provide facilities and services which are of value to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's views.  I have spoken to people in FÁS who were in the other organisations dealing with the local employment initiative and accept that this area could be extended.  The Youth Employment Agency were actively involved with a number of communities who, under the work space programme, had taken over old buildings and were setting up enterprise centres.  This is a measure I support and I imagine FÁS, under the community enterprise programmes, would agree with the local communities that we should continue to develop that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any intention of trying to get rid of some of the problems these groups encounter, such as the fact that in some cases they do not have a legal entity and have problems relating to financing these initiatives?  For instance, they have grave problems raising funds to meet their employers liability insurance.  I know a percentage of the grant is payable for those expenses but the basic problem for some of them is that they do not have a legal entity and cannot go to the bank.  They are not the same as a company, they are not a recognised legal entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that that happens.  FÁS are involved in that kind of detail.  In 1988 £2 million has been allocated to the community enterprise programme and there were 60 training projects employing 390 people at the end of 1987.  As I said earlier, FÁS are at <Col N="1302" /> present working with 350 local community groups but the numbers employed may not be very high.  In addition, local communities are providing business advice and support, including some of the work space projects to which I have referred and there are 500 people involved in those schemes.  I take the point in the Deputy's question.  This is an area where rather than being involved in short term temporary schemes, FÁS can foster and develop sustainable jobs.  In my meeting with the executives of FÁS I will continue to pursue that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated previously, when we came into Government in 1987 we inherited a very serious economic and financial crisis.  The problems facing the Irish people were so severe that, unless they were tackled with courage and determination, this country would face disaster &mdash; there would be very unfavourable prospects for all our young children currently in the education system.</P>
      <P>In the past Governments were remiss in not resolutely facing up to economic difficulties and in not identifying strategies and practical solutions.  In 1986 this country was in dire economic straits with the current budget deficit standing at an all time high of 8.5 per cent and a national debt standing at over £24 billion.  The public sector borrowing requirement was £2,506 million, a massive 15.2 per cent of GNP.  The servicing of the national debt absorbs money which we can ill afford. We must ensure that we reduce our dependence as a nation on borrowing.</P>
      <P>As a result of the policy adopted by this Government and the measures taken in the context of the 1987 budget, we have seen Exchequer borrowing significantly reduced, we have witnessed a reduction in interest rates and inflation has come down.  The target for the current budget deficit in 1987 was 6.9 per cent of GNP and we bettered this target and lowered it to 6.8 per cent; likewise the target for public sector borrowing was set at £2,166 million or 12.5 per cent of GNP and in fact the actual borrowing requirement in 1987 was £2,056 million or 11.8 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> It is now evident to everyone that the targets set by this Government have been very successfully attained and indeed surpassed in many instances.  The targets set were realistic and consistent with sound economic and financial management.</P>
    <P>A new sense of direction has been given to the economy.  The sense of despair and the depression that were widespread among the Irish people during the Coalition years are giving way to a realism and a belief that this Government have the willpower and the determination to pursue their stated objectives of progressively reducing the cost of servicing the national debts and the level of borrowing while at the same time creating an environment suitable for investment geared to productive economic activities and enhance employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The fiscal and economic policies introduced by this Government have resulted in a restoration of confidence in the business world and a realisation at home and abroad that the foundations for national economic recovery have been laid.  <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> which has been welcomed by the principal social partners will I am sure result in continued economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>In 1987 our competitiveness in the market place showed a marked improvement against the United Kingdom and our EC partners.  Manufacturing output has increased significantly and there has been a very dramatic growth in exports &mdash; the volume in 1987 increased by some 16 per cent compared to 4 per cent in 1986.</P>
    <P>In order to have continued improvement leading to a resolution of our serious economic difficulties, it is necessary to continue with the policies introduced in 1987.  It is necessary to set realistic financial targets, thereby reducing our dependency on borrowing and lowering the large interest bill which must be paid on borrowings.</P>
    <P>The 1988 budget has been designed to reduce the current budget deficit from 6.8 per cent of GNP in 1987 to 6.3 per cent of GNP in 1988 and a corresponding <Col N="1332" /> reduction in public sector borrowing from 11.8 per cent of GNP in 1987 to 9.4 per cent in 1988.  These targets are realisable and must be attained to ensure our economic recovery.  The size and nature of the financial adjustments necessary to achieve these budgetary targets will, however, create certain difficulties and will require some sacrifices to be made. However, I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish people are prepared to make these sacrifices in the short term and accept a level of services which we can afford rather than place intolerable debt burdens on future generations.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, despite reductions made in public expenditure, it is expected that there will be some growth in 1988 in the gross domestic product and that we will achieve further growth in the volume of our exports.</P>
    <P>In order to resolve our economic difficulties, it is necesary to control the public finances, to provide financial stability and to limit our dependence on foreign borrowing.  These can only be done by maintaining measures for a level of services which we can afford.</P>
    <P>Virtually everyone accepts that something must be done to bring down public expenditure but some object to any of the savings being made in a particular area.  However, since the social services in the areas of health, social welfare and education account for 67 per cent approximately of the gross expenditure by the Exchequer on non-capital supply services, it is inevitable that any worthwhile reduction in public expenditure would have to involve significant savings in these areas.</P>
    <P>We must all accept that we have limited resources.  The question of how efficiently our resources are allocated is closely linked with economic growth and development.  This Government have fully recognised the vital contribution which an efficient, cost-effective education system can make to the economic and social development of our country. In 1988 it is estimated that over 18 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services will be spent on the education services, whereas in 1986 the <Col N="1333" /> corresponding figure was 16.5 per cent. It is a fact that we simply cannot afford to allocate a larger portion of our limited financial resources to education.</P>
    <P>We must make strenuous efforts to ensure that our resources are used to maximum advantage to maintain and improve the quality of education at all levels.  Equity, efficiency and effectiveness must, in future, be the main criteria used for resource allocations purposes.  Greater attention must be placed on educational planning than was done in the past and more attention must be given to the development of systematic cost-effectiveness studies and the production of educational indicators.</P>
    <P>Every level of the education services must be carefully analysed and provision made for the co-ordination of educational planning with planning for other sectors of the economy e.g. labour, health, agriculture, <i>et cetera</i>.  I was listening on the monitor to the questions put to the Minister for Labour and some of them also touched on education.  Of course, planning for education in order to be effective must not only be based on educational considerations but also on detailed and accurate economic and social data and demographic trends.  It must also take into account existing financial constraints.</P>
    <P>This Government will continue to provide the maximum financial support possible for education.  I have already stated that in 1988 over 18 per cent of net Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services will be spent in the education area &mdash; it is simply not possible in present economic circumstances to provide a greater amount.  We must ensure that this expenditure is spent in the most efficient and effective way in order to cater as fully as possible for the varying aptitudes and abilities of all pupils.  In order to do so, we must avoid any unnecessary duplication of resources whether human or physical.  We must foster and encourage various educational interests and groups in a community to pool their expertise and resources for the benefit of that community.</P>
    <P>Demographic trends indicate that over <Col N="1334" /> the next decade and beyond there will be very significant changes in the structure of our population.  These will have very significant implications, in particular for our education system, and we must plan now to ensure that the quality of education will be maintained.  For example, the projection that births will fall from a current level of some 60,000 to between 46,000 to 52,000 by the end of the century will have major repercussions for the education sector and especially for primary schools.</P>
    <P>To assist in the planning process, the Department of Education are finalising a strategic plan for the development of an information technology system which, when fully implemented, will enable a better analysis than heretofore to be made of the effectiveness of the education services and will be of help in developing arrangements for the deployment of resources and in considering the viability of alternative strategies.  A number of projects involving new technologies have been initiated in the Department of Education and a reappraisal of the computing needs of the examinations branch in Athlone is currently being undertaken.</P>
    <P>A number of potential benefits can be achieved by the increased use of information technology in my Department. Information technology could greatly facilitate the evaluation of options which require cross-analysis of all the elements involved in the provision of education &mdash; students, teachers, institutions <i>et cetera.</i> It could improve the information available to support long term planning and allow for more effective monitoring of performance and other educational indicators. It is my intention to proceed, as financial resources allow, with a phased implementation of an effective information technology plan.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> a review body has been established to undertake a complete in-depth review of the primary curriculum which has been implemented in primary schools since 1971.  It is necessary to analyse its suitability nowadays for <Col N="1335" /> imparting basic competences to our young children.</P>
    <P>In addition, it has recently been decided to carry out a major review of the primary education sector.  It is important that everybody involved &mdash; parents, teachers, school managers &mdash; should be fully informed about the sector, including future trends.  The outcome of the review will enable relevant plans to be made to resolve present difficulties and, allowing for demographic trends, to anticipate future needs.  It is not generally realised that the primary school enrolments will fall from some 568,000 in 1987-88 by over 100,000 by the year 2,000.  This rapid decrease will have serious implications and challenges for our education sector and it must be planned for in a systematic and structured way.  We must ensure at all times that the quality of education is maintained and the opportunities offered to our young people maximised.  We have educational problems now but we will have equally challenging problems &mdash; albeit in a political sense perhaps &mdash; when the rapid decrease in the population occurs.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to curriculum reform resulted in the Interim Curriculum and Examinations Board being reconstituted by me as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The composition and <i>modus operandi</i> of the council have been designed to ensure that it will be a dynamic agency which will advise me and my Department on all matters related to curriculum and assessment at primary and second level.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level there is urgent need to review and reform the junior cycle curriculum.  Specific immediate tasks assigned to the council include the development of a new unified junior cycle programme which will replace the existing intermediate and day vocational (group) certificates programmes for introduction into schools in September 1989 and to be known simply as the junior certificate; the development of an overall framework for senior cycle and the review of existing rules and programmes for secondary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> This planned approach to curriculum reform will result in realistic targets and deadlines being set to improve the quality of post-primary education, enhanced standards of pupil achievement and will allow for special initiatives to be undertaken in areas such as modern languages, science and technology.  We have already made a start in regard to modern languages and, small though it is, it will be very significant and indeed vital.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, there are likely to be significant changes in teaching methods and in curricula due to the impact of new technologies &mdash; in particular computing systems &mdash; in education. Research work being carried out on computer aided learning, expert systems and artificial intelligence is changing our perception of knowledge and increasing our knowledge about learning processes.</P>
    <P>New technologies can in theory bring to every school and to every pupil the best in education.  It is theoretically possible, with the aid of expert systems which utilise the best teaching skills, to improve learning environments and to enhance the teaching-learning process for disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>Developments in telecommunications and electronics in association with advances being made in computer technology open up great opportunities for the transmission of computerised data and texts in the education sector.  Already major changes can be foreseen in assessment techniques.  In addition, it is envisaged that computerised data and computer networks could have a significance for the teaching of languages by making it far more interactive and more effective than it was.  Within existing financial constraints we must continue to be innovative and make progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The school transport service since it was introduced in the late sixties has been very successful in achieving its purpose of bringing pupils safely to and from school who, without this service, could not get to school or would endure much hardship in doing so.  The school transport system <Col N="1337" /> is a complex one &mdash; rural Deputies are particularly aware of this since they are dealing with it all the time &mdash; and since it necessitates a very large outlay each year by the State it has been necessary always to keep it under constant review. A study with a view to making the system more cost effective has recently been undertaken and it is planned that four pilot projects &mdash; one in each of the provinces will be introduced for the 1988-89 school year.  These projects will be monitored and evaluated.  The outcome from these projects will enable, we hope, a more cost effective system to be developed.</P>
    <P>Arising out of our Government's programme to have more effective and streamlined administrative structures, it was decided to amalgamate a number of vocational education committees.  This decision will result in a more efficient and cost effective system and will enable the new VECs to provide a better service to the public.  Within the revised vocational education structure a greater degree of autonomy will be given to the nine regional technical colleges.  These colleges will be encouraged to place greater emphasis on applied research and development activities and to strengthen their links with local industrial and commercial interests.  Indeed this is something which the regional colleges have long sought and have gone down the path themselves without full permission but the Act did allow for flexibility.  I hope this will allow regional colleges to fulfil more vigorously their correct industrial role.</P>
    <P>Work has started on the preparation of the required legislation and it is planned to provide for the necessary amalgamations later this year.</P>
    <P>We in Government have always considered that the education system can be a powerful tool for bringing about desirable social objectives.  In the education area the necessary savings in expenditure have been, and will be, made in such a way as to shield to the greatest possible extent the disadvantaged.  None of the measures planned will reduce educational provision for them.  Resources <Col N="1338" /> will be allocated to endeavour to achieve educational equity and this Government will continue to foster and encourage greater participation by the disadvantaged in all levels and activities of the education system.  In our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which we brought about through the co-operation of the social partners, the section on education dealt specifically with the needs of the disadvantaged and the commitment of the Government to serving those needs.</P>
    <P>A special high level task force representative of the Departments of Education and Labour was established in 1987 to examine in particular the situation relating to those who leave school without any formal qualifications.  The task force recommendations and strategies to attract these early school leavers to special vocational preparation and training programmes will be fully considered with a view to their early implementation.  As I said, my colleague the Minister for Labour has already spoken on that matter here in Question Time today.  It is a great sign of progress that the two Departments, Education and Labour, have liaised quite successfully on this issue.  In addition, the Government are determined that adult literacy and community education programmes will be continued and developed as much as possible within the limits of existing resources.</P>
    <P>In the third level education sector there have been substantial developments in recent years.  Outputs have increased and there have been significant gains in productivity. However, like every other sector efforts will have to continue to be made to achieve greater economies while at the same time maintaining academic standards and preserving essential services. A study is being undertaken to determine savings that could be made or additional student numbers that could be accommodated at no extra cost by reducing the length of courses leading to qualifications awarded by the NCEA.  The HEA are to carry out a similar study in their own sector by examining the feasibility of shortening the duration of degree programmes.  In addition, a high level <Col N="1339" /> interdepartmental committee representative of the Departments of Education, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour, Health and Agriculture will be established shortly to examine &mdash; (a) the provision of third level places; (b) the rationalisation of third level departments and institutions; and (c) the funding of third level institutions.</P>
    <P>A study by a task force established to examine admissions procedures and entry requirements to third level institutions is nearing completion.  It is anticipated that measures will be identified which can be implemented to bring about a more co-ordinated and a more efficient admission system.</P>
    <P>Another important development of significance for third level institutions and students was the adoption in 1987 by the Council of Europe Education Ministers of the Eramus project.  This project, which will last initially for three years, and later for a further extension, is designed to increase the mobility of third level students throughout the EC through increased co-operation in a European wide network between universities and third level institutions.  Students participating in the project may spend periods varying from one term to one year in another Community country and will be eligible for financial assistance to help meet travel and other costs involved.</P>
    <P>In the past third level institutions have played a very important role in this country by producing well qualified and highly professional graduates.  The quality of their programmes in recent years has been enhanced by the development of industrial-higher education links, through the establishment of industrial parks and innovation centres alongside higher education institutions and by the establishment of specialised research and development centres.  The necessity for close co-operation between industry and higher education institutions has been recognised by the EC.  Its COMETT programme is designed to ease the skills shortages in high technology fields and will provide grants to develop higher <Col N="1340" /> educational-industry training partnerships and to fund the exchange of students, academic staff and executives from business and industry.  All will benefit through the COMETT programme. Ireland stands to benefit greatly from this programme and three university-enterprise training partnerships involving virtually all relevant third level institutions have been formed to ensure the effective operation of this very significant programme.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Government made a policy decision that in future the national lottery fund would provide all funding for youth and sport.  Youth, sport and recreation are the main beneficiaries of the fund. The investment being made in these areas will have long term beneficial effects for the Irish people.  It will enable our country to make rapid progress in the development of many sporting activities.  In international competitive sports Irish women and men will not be at a disadvantage for want of adequate training facilities here in Ireland and all Irish people will have available to them great opportunities for participating in sporting and recreational facilities.  Many local regional and national sports projects will be developed for 1988: We listed those when we announced the allocations of the national lottery sports money prior to Christmas in 1987.</P>
    <P>Projects will also be initiated in the youth area.  A sum of £4 million is set aside for major developments of community youth projects in disadvantaged areas.  In the allocation of resources special attention will be given to the needs of groups particularly at risk such as young homeless, young travellers and abusers.  A sum of £1 million will be provided for the expansion and development of voluntary youth organisations and voluntary youth councils will be established to provide an efficient and co-ordinated local youth service.</P>
    <P>The total provision for youth and sport is £27.14 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>The six outdoor education centres based in Cappanalea, Burren, Birr, Gartan and Shielbeggan have in the past not been used to the best advantage <Col N="1341" /> because of financial constraints.  In 1987 this Government provided £50,000 towards the cost of these centres.  In the current year £400,000 has been allocated out of the national lottery fund to enable these centres be fully utilised.  This has been due to the take-up of the lottery.</P>
    <P>It is important that the great potential of these centres for developing activities relating to outdoor education, the promotion of tourism, youth exchange programmes etc., be fully realised and I am confident that in 1988 we will see great progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The allocation for primary and post-primary school building programmes originally provided in the 1988 Estimates for Public Services Abridged Version, has been increased by £6.5 million.</P>
    <P>The provision in 1988 for the national schools building programme is £18.875. This is an increase of £3.875 on the originally published proposal to provide £15 million for this programme.  The latter figure was based on the need to provide at least £9 million to meet contractual commitments arising from a number of major projects still under construction in 1988, together with approximately £6 million to service an extensive programme of improvements to existing national school buildings.  The additional sum referred to will now enable my Department to give priority to schools where it is accepted that there are acute problems of accommodation.</P>
    <P>I am sometimes surprised, in dealing with primary school representatives who approach me about the prospect of getting grants for the provision of new national school buildings, to find that a case is being argued largely on the basis that facilities in an existing school are in a bad condition and that the parties frequently admit that they have never given any consideration to improving existing conditions with the aid of the grants which my Department are prepared to make available towards the cost of essential improvements.  The improvement of existing school facilities can often be undertaken in advance of schemes of extension or major refurbishing.  I can assure schools that by availing of this <Col N="1342" /> aspect of the Department's grant scheme their subsequent building grant applications will not be prejudiced.</P>
    <P>It is important to say that because very often if you say to a school who are at the start of the planning process and who have to go through several further stages that you will give them several thousand pounds towards essential refurbishment they will say that that will prejudice their eventual case for a new school.  Therefore, I give the commitment that all things being equal their case for a new school would not be hindered by their taking up of essential grant allocations.</P>
    <P>Already schools and public representatives are flooding my Department with correspondence and inquiries suggesting that the additional capital now being made available would enable me to authorise the invitation of tenders or the placing of contracts for national school building schemes on which for some time now progress has not been possible.  Judging by the number of letters and inquiries I have received in regard to the additional capital which is now being made available to me one would think that I had received a pot of gold.  I must say at once that this extra allocation will have to be very carefully husbanded or housewifed to provide the maximum yield in terms of accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to here go back to a statement, which I made on the occasion of the budget of 1987, which referred to my intention that capital allocations to individual national schools would be made with a view to achieving the maximum impact over the widest possible number of schools.  I expect to be able to offer grants for additional building to a number of schools which have, as I said earlier, acute accommodation problems but only on the basis that their schemes will be confined to the provisions of classrooms with normal basic facilities.  The less urgently required features of their scheme, such as general purposes areas, library and medical inspection rooms, should in the general <Col N="1343" /> interest be deferred to form a later instalment of building.  I would also expect that schools which are offered grants would accept the necessity to provide permanent classrooms only for the staffing levels which may be expected in the school in the long term.  As a corollary they should be willing to retain suitable temporary accommodation in use to serve short-term needs.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the announcement of the Minister for Finance, the additional capital will be devoted mainly to school building in rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to continue the policy of not providing new accommodation where it is evident that sufficient suitable accommodation is available in existing schools within a reasonable distance.  This policy will have particular reference to schools in urban areas, where application for building grants continue to be carefully examined in duplicating facilities.</P>
      <P>The 1988 allocation for secondary, vocational and community-comprehensive schools is £23.625 million and includes provision for expenditure on construction, furniture, equipment and professional fees, and for sites other than secondary school sites.</P>
      <P>The investment in post-primary school building forms part of the ongoing programme designed to: (i) meet the changing patterns in enrolment, and (ii) replace unsatisfactory and uneconomic accommodation.</P>
      <P>I have referred already to demographic trends and while such trends will initially have greatest impact on the primary sector, their effects will also be felt of course in the second level area.  Between now and the end of the century second level enrolments are projected to drop by some 45,000 pupils from approximately 340,000 at present.</P>
      <P>There is continued need in view of this to promote and encourage co-operation between educational interests at local, regional and national level to obtain the most effective and most cost efficient use of existing resources and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where new schools are required or where replacement buildings are necessary <Col N="1344" /> every effort will be made to ensure that there will not be unnecessary duplication of expensive resources and physical facilities. With declining enrolments there are sound educational, social and economic arguments for the development of new initiatives in local communities in the area of educational co-operation and indeed amalgamation.  It is by such initiatives that post-primary schools &mdash; communities will be able to offer a satisfactory range of subject options for their full time pupils and adult education programmes that meet the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that my Department will place greater emphasis in future on the need to achieve greater co-operation between schools in a particular community.  With a view to rationalising educational provision at second level, priority will be given to projects in areas where there is evidence of local initiatives representative of all educational interests relating to amalgamation or the shared use of resources.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the House that I have been greatly heartened since coming into office by the spirit of co-operation from both the vocational sector and the voluntary-religious lay sector in the sharing of ideas in regard to voluntary rationalisation.  Experience in the past had led one to believe that rationalisation only came about as a result of enormous heat, pressure and stormy meetings.  We all have experience of this, particularly those of us living in rural towns.  A sense of pragamatism has set in and, as I have said, the vocational sector and the voluntary religious-lay sector realise that the fall in numbers will necessitate rationalisation. They see it as being in their own interests as well as that of their students to bring about and to co-operate fully in rationalisation.  If a community &mdash; and I mean a community in the fullest sense &mdash; comes forward with ideas for rationalisation those ideas will be carefully listened to and I hope followed through by my Department.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the allocation of £1.68 <Col N="1345" /> million for special schools is for the continuation of the reconstruction of residential and administrative accommodation at St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel.  The balance of the allocation will cover completion of security fencing and other minor works at Trinity House School, Lusk, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Following completion of the major extensions to the Kevin Street and Bolton Street Colleges of Technology, necessary consequential works to the existing buildings are being carried out this year as part of the overall development of the colleges.  Furnishing and equipping of the two extensions and the new Tralee Regional Technical College is also being completed.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the final accounts in respect of the new Tralee Regional Technical College and the extensions to Kevin Street and Bolton Street Colleges of Technology will fall due for payment this year.</P>
    <P>Work on the Engineering Building for UCD is proceeding.  Work is also under way on Phase II of the National MicroElectronics Research Centre, UCC, and on the extension to the Industrial Microbiology Building at UCD.  Both the Microbiology building at UCG and the Grattan Extension at NIHE, Dublin have just been completed and we will have to pay the bill when agreed.</P>
    <P>The total provision for capital projects in the higher education area is £16.795 million.</P>
    <P>I touched on the national lottery earlier and in this regard I now want to talk about the provision of grants to local communities for recreational facilities.  I am doing this because my colleague in the Department of Education, the Minister with responsibility for Sport, may not have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  A provision of £4 million has been made in 1988 from the proceeds of the national lottery for recreational facilities.  That is to cover existing contractual commitments and any new commitments. Expenditure will be by way of grants to various local community groups towards the cost of providing community <Col N="1346" /> and recreational facilities in accordance with established grant-in-aid criteria.  The £4 million provision represents the amount assigned for allocation by me from a total provision of £10 million from the national lottery surplus, for grants to assist local and community efforts in the provision of sporting and recreational facilities and community amenities.  The balance of £6 million is for allocation by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>A total allocation of £6.5 million from the proceeds of the national lottery has been made in 1988 for the provision of various sporting facilities to be expended as follows:</P>

    <P>The significant reform measures initiated in all sectors of the education system in 1987 will be continued in 1988. These measures have been taken not only for educational reasons but also in order to provide financial stability and to promote economic development.  I can assure the House that none of the measures taken will restrict access to education or impair any essential component of the education system.  Indeed, many of the measures will provide for a more equitable, more efficient and more effective system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be said that the whole question of a budget, and the hype that budget day is given, has declined, perhaps more so than ever since <Col N="1347" /> the Estimates were published late last year.  Consequently, most of the harshness of the present regime was clouded by the fairly cleverly constructed Budget Statement read by the Minister on budget day.  There was no reference in that speech to the fact that the Minister had already taken £400 million out of the economy by the severe cut in the Estimates for a whole range of our social services such as health, education, social welfare and a variety of other services. We have the extraordinary position in regard to social welfare in that we are told that increases are being given but when we read the small print we discover that those increases are gained by slicing money off other sectors in the social welfare net.  In fact, those increases are not real in terms of the resources being allocated to the worst off in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget cannot be viewed in isolation from the social and economic policies being pursued by the Government throughout the year.  It is clear from what has been said in all speeches since budget day that there has been no change in direction from the line promoted by the Fianna Fáil Government who remain in power with the support of the Fine Gael Party.  There has been no change in the attitude they adopted when they took office but that attitude is a total turn about from the manifesto they presented to the electorate this time last year.  The significance of the budget is that it confirms the direction in which the Government are moving.  It confirms that they have taken on lock, stock and barrel, the theory and the practice of Thatcherism. Some Deputies, particularly those on the Fianna Fáil side, object to the label of Thatcherism because they feel it associates them too much with the British Establishment and for obvious historical reasons they dislike being associated with the Establishment.  When I refer to Thatcherism I am not talking about the aura of imperialism which Britain likes to surround herself with because she is no longer the imperial power she was in the past.  It may be slightly unfair to unload all the blame on Margaret Thatcher because <Col N="1348" /> we also have Reaganism and, more specifically, monetarism.</P>
    <P>That philosophy aims to remove, in so far as it can, assistance from the poorest in our society.  It tries to hark back to the old days.  In Britain they like to talk in terms of Victorian values: In Ireland we tend to talk about traditional values and all the implications they have in terms of social attitudes which preclude so many people in our society from having any kind of half decent lifestyle.  Underlying the whole idea of Thatcherism, or monetarism, is the idea that the State has no role in society other than to regulate the social forces that operate in it.  It keeps close to the theory of capital and capitalism and the making of profit as the basis of a well-ordered society and, therefore, under no circumstances must it move away from it.  There is the belief that regulations or interference that inhibit the capacity of individuals or companies to make profit should be removed at all costs.  The argument is that profit is the motivation which keeps society running.</P>
    <P>That has all sorts of implications for society.  In the ideological sense the PDs are the clearest exponents of that policy. I can see a tendency in Fine Gael to move slightly away from it, certainly in their speeches they are trying to capture the social democratic areas of society.  Fianna Fáil present themselves as the pragmatists of Irish politics, the people who have no ideology, who do not believe in ideology and simply take decisions on the basis of what they consider best for the people.  In the old days de Valera chose to do that by looking into his heart.  It is difficult to know how the Taoiseach decides what is best for the people other than by listening to the various powerful interest groups who surround the Government.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the monied interest groups &mdash; the builders, the bankers and the industrialists who are the real power in the land and can effectively ensure that there is no real change in the taxation system.  They can ensure that the PAYE sector will continue to bear 90 per cent of the burden of income tax.  They can <Col N="1349" /> also ensure that despite a decision by the Government prior to the budget that they would introduce a 6.6 per cent rate of PRSI for self-employed and farmers, the budget itself introduced a 3 per cent rate, with a promise that it will be increased by 1 per cent next year and a further 1 per cent the following year.  It does not take much cop-on to recognise that the various interest groups, which we are constantly told by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael we should be resisting, have won their battle on the PRSI issue.  The pensions which will now be the right of the self employed and farmers who pay the 3 per cent rate will be paid for out of general taxation and will once again be a burden on the PAYE sector, who pay 90 per cent of income tax.  It is clear that there are powerful interests operating in our society but they are not those who are in trade unions and toil to earn a wage or a salary.  I am referring to those who have power through their bank balances and can influence the Government at that level.</P>
    <P>Most people fail to understand exactly the kind of confidence trick that has been played on them by the introduction of a 3 per cent rate for the self employed and the farmers.  The National Pensions Board recommended that farmers and the self employed should start paying PRSI in order to qualify for contributory social welfare pensions and to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of non-contributory pensions, which in 1987 amounted to £329 million.  The contribution rate recommended by the National Pensions Board was 6.6 per cent of reckonable income.  Predictably, of course, the farmers and the self employed complained that this was unfair and too high.  Specifically the IFA said that they wanted equity with employees, which would mean paying the same rate for pensions as workers, i.e. 2.4 per cent without any liability for the employer's contribution of 4.2 per cent.  This argument ignores some very important points.  When it suits them, in relation to tax, for instance, the self employed and farmers are content &mdash; indeed, they demand &mdash; to be viewed as employers, not employees.  Of course in <Col N="1350" /> relation to PRSI they demand to be regarded as employees.  The contribution rate of 6.6 per cent from the self employed would cover less than 40 per cent of the cost of providing contributory pensions for them.  The contribution required from them to cover the cost would be 16.6 per cent, according to the National Pensions Board.  The Exchequer, that is the PAYE workers who are the general taxpayers, would still be making the major contribution. Ideally the self employed should be required to bear a much higher proportion of the cost of their contributory pensions and to make a reasonable contribution towards the cost of non-contributory pensions, which go mainly to them.</P>
    <P>It is misleading in this context to refer to the employee's contributions to social welfare pensions being 2.4 per cent and the employer's contribution being 4.2 per cent.  In the private sector most workers pay 5.5 per cent for social insurance, plus the health contribution and employment levy, and most employers pay 12.33 per cent.  The Exchequer also makes a contribution to social insurance and covers the full cost of social assistance. Employers' and employees' contributions go towards the cost of all insurance benefits and the amount deemed to go towards pensions is purely arbitrary.  It alters from year to year depending on changes in, for example, the numbers employed and paying PRSI and the numbers unemployed and claiming unemployment benefit, as well as the numbers retiring and the numbers claiming pensions <i>et cetera</i>.  In 1987 when contributory pensions cost 13 per cent it was dedided that this would be made up of 2.9 per cent from employees and 6.2 per cent from employers, with the Exchequer contributing 3.9 per cent.  The figures have been different in other years. However, the Exchequer contribution to contributory pensions tends to stay roughly in line with the overall Exchequer contribution to social insurance.  In 1987 the former was 30 per cent and the latter 31 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given that the Exchequer share tends <Col N="1351" /> to remain fairly stable and that the employer-employee share is broken down in a fairly arbitrary manner, mainly for book-keeping purposes, the question should not be whether a self-employed person's contribution should equate to an employee's contribution; it should be whether the cost of providing an employee's benefit is shared in a reasonable way between the parties in the State and whether the cost of the proposed benefits for the self employed is similarly shared.  If it is considered reasonable for the Exchequer to pay 30 per cent of the cost of employees' pensions, is it not also reasonable for it to pay 30 per cent of the cost of pensions for the self employed?  If this is so, the latter should be asked to contribute 70 per cent of the cost, which would mean a contribution rate of around 11.6 per cent.  The 6.6 per cent rate proposed before the budget represents just under 40 per cent of the cost and as such represents a major additional subsidy to the self employed in comparison with employees.  With the introduction of the 3 per cent rate, only 20 per cent of the cost is covered by contributions, which means a further massive additional subsidy by the taxpayer to the pension fund of the farmers and the self employed.</P>
    <P>Unless the self employed are treated as the equivalent of both an employer and an employee for purposes of PRSI contributions, the self employed will be at a competitive advantage in the labour market.  As the National Pensions Board pointed out, there will often be a choice between employing an employee to carry out a particular duty or contracting with a self employed person to do the job. Clearly there is no good reason the choice should be other than neutral from the income tax and social insurance aspects, whch in turn implies that the self employed person should also assume responsibility for the employer's contribution that would otherwise be avoided. The 6.6 per cent which had been proposed represented less than 40 per cent of the cost of providing their contributory pensions and still asked them for nothing towards non-contributory <Col N="1352" /> pensions.  Thus the Exchequer must pick up the tab for 60 per cent of the cost &mdash; twice what it costs for employees.</P>
    <P>A contribution of 6.6 per cent is about the same as the pension contribution paid by most public servants.  The fact that the latter are covered by occupational rather than social welfare pension schemes and are not covered for other social insurance benefits is relevant to any discussion of how much the self employed should pay towards their pensions.</P>
    <P>I make those points because a lot of hype has been promoted about the fact that at last the self-employed and the farmers are paying PRSI.  Apart altogether from the question of whether the money will ever be collected given the experience we have had in relation to collecting taxation from those sectors in the past, as I have pointed out already the whole question of the derisory rate of 3 per cent has to be taken into account. It is part and parcel of the attempt made by the Minister in his budget speech to present an appearance of it being a giveaway budget on the one hand and of tackling inequities in our social welfare and taxation systems.  It is just that because when you examine the 3 per cent contribution from the farmers and the self-employed you will find that greater inequity has been created under the guise of bringing more people into the PRSI system.  Most PAYE workers at this time do not realise the extent to which they have been conned by this fairly nifty footwork.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the 6 per cent levy on pension funds.  Again, this aspect of the budget has received scant attention from virtually all quarters, whether it be from economists, trade unionists or otherwise.  I think, like the 3 per cent PRSI contribution it is a fairly clever piece of work.  In effect, it is taking a further £15 million out of the pockets of the PAYE sector who pay the bulk into the pension funds.  In order that pension funds pay out this money they must either increase the contributions from those who pay into the funds at present or they must reduce the benefits which derive from those funds.  The Minister has said <Col N="1353" /> in his speech that this is a once-off levy, a once-off tax, but our experience in the past with once-off levies and taxes would lead us to doubt whether the Minister will be happy to forego a further £15 million next year.  Certainly the 1 per cent levy which was imposed in 1982 and which was not removed until last year indicates that there is always a reluctance to forego income from whatever source, once it has been established.</P>
    <P>However, it has to be said that that is not always true in the case of levies and taxes on the self-employed and the farmers. There is a history of abolishing various taxes, whether they be the wealth tax, rates or resource taxes, particularly on the farming community.  This would indicate that they have a special place in the hearts not just of the Fianna Fáil Government, who abolished most of the taxes on them, but indeed of the other conservative parties also.  The levy on the pension funds needs particular examination. It has not got much attention in this House or in the media.  I think that the many people who are contributing to pension funds should look at it more closely.</P>
    <P>I think it has to be said that the budget is not a good budget.  It is not a good budget from the point of view of the unemployed.  There is nothing whatsoever in it for those who are unemployed and whose primary need and demand is for a job.  There is a slight increase in the general rates of social welfare.  There is a £4 increase for those on long-term unemployment assistance in certain categories. However, those increases do not come anywhere near the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Let us remember that the levels recommended by that commission would not keep anybody in the lap of luxury.  If my memory is correct, they recommended a payment of between £50 and £60 as the basic requirement for a person living alone.  In present day terms that would be approximately £55 to £65 per week for a person living on social welfare. Even with the additional £4 on top of the 3 per cent, it brings them no further than two-thirds of the way towards the very <Col N="1354" /> basic income which was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is significant that most of the organisations who are dealing with the poor, i.e. the various religious associations and orders, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, another group whose name escapes me at present which is associated with the Roman Catholic Church, and other organisations such as the St. Vincent De Paul are not satisfied with the level of social welfare payments. They have indicated that much more could have been done in that regard.  The budget is to be criticised not so much in relation to that although, that is a criticism, but it has to be criticised for the fact that it does nothing to create employment.  On the contrary, it sets about creating unemployment in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The cry has gone up from the Fianna Fáil, the Fine Gael and indeed from the PD benches over many years &mdash; it is their basic philosophy &mdash; that the Government cannot create jobs but can only create a climate for investment.  Clearly, as a socialist I disagree fundamentally with that proposition.  It is my contention that the democratically elected Parliament of the people not only has the capacity to ensure that jobs are created directly but has a responsibility and a duty to do it. One hundred and sixty six Deputies are elected effectively to run this country.  It does not make sense to me as a democrat that 90 per cent of the Members of this House, the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrat parties can turn around and say that they do not have the power and the right or the duty to ensure that the resources of this State are used for the benefit of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense that the financial institutions of this State are controlled by a very exclusive and small band of individuals who effectively control the lifeblood of the State through controlling these institutions.  Effectively the banks, building societies and various other financial institutions can in many cases <Col N="1355" /> decide whether there will be development in a particular area or not.  Effectively they can decide whether the money they control remains in or goes out of the country.  They can decide whether there will be a boom or doom.  Our Government, supported by all the other conservative parties in the House, blithely say that they can only create the climate for investment and provide incentives for these people to keep their money in the country to invest in enterprise and provide incentives in grants, tax rates, etc., in the hope at the end of the day of providing jobs.</P>
    <P>The primary function of investors of capital is not to create jobs but to make more capital.  In a capitalist society that is regarded as correct.  My contention is that the primary function of the Dáil should be to ensure that the resources available are organised in such a way that work is provided for all citizens who are capable of work, that education is provided for all our citizens who are capable of benefiting from such education, that those who are handicapped mentally are cared for in a way that gives them dignity and that those who are handicapped physically have dignity and do not have to go scrounging to voluntary organisations for assistance with this, that and the other or worry that various benefits they have at this time will be taken away from them because the climate is not right for others who are better off to invest in the creation of jobs and development of resources. That is the fundamental difference between us.  The people so far have not taken to the message which The Workers' Party and the Labour Party have been promoting for very many years.  That does not mean that the message we are trying to promote is in any way less effective or less worthy than the message which Fianna Fáil and other conservative parties have kept to over the years.  The stark evidence before our eyes indicates that the philosophy and approach various Governments ranging from Fianna Fáil to Coalitions have engaged in over the years in supporting private enterprise and the making of private profits as a way of <Col N="1356" /> developing the economy has failed.  The evidence of that failure is all around us in the numbers on our unemployment registers and the numbers who have had to go increasingly to Britain and the US in recent years to find work.  It is there, too, with regard to the huge waste of resources in this State.</P>
    <P>I heard one of the PD Members here today referring to the huge acreage of land which is unused.  The EC are at present moving towards paying farmers not to use their land, not to produce food. For many years now we have seen Irish farmers producing food which has gone into intervention, and in some cases food produced was destroyed so that it would not go on the market.  At the same time, we have a world in which vast numbers die from hunger.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental flaw in the philosophy that says that private enterprise, private individuals with money, have a right to do what they wish with that money regardless of the consequences to society.  The consequences we see around us every day of the week of unemployment and poverty are too high a price to pay for that kind of freedom granted to those who have private resources and want to hold on to them.  The responsibility of this Government is to ensure that the very considerable resources they have at their disposal, which at present they give to private enterprise by way of grants and tax rates to create the right climate, should be used directly by Government in the promotion of State enterprise which has in the past proved effective and efficient where it has been given an opportunity to be so.  The Government have responsibility to ensure that where companies are getting grants at this time those grants result in job creation and not just the creation of greater bank balances.</P>
    <P>There should be an obligation on those multinational companies who come in here and who, on the face of it anyhow, are making considerable profits from the labours of the Irish working class, to reinvest a significant proportion of those profits back into the Irish economy.  There is a suspicion in my mind that some of the <Col N="1357" /> profits being declared by the multinationals are inflated unrealistically by the kind of pricing they engage in in order to benefit from the tax break that exists as a result of operating here and exporting from this country.  The profit rate reported by them seems unrealistically high compared with what might be possible in other countries and leads me to believe there is significant &mdash; I do not know whether one would call it fiddling of the books; possibly not &mdash; doctoring of the books to show that the profits are being taken here in Ireland, whereas if they were taken in America or elsewhere a higher tax rate would be applicable to them.  In any event, whatever way the profits arise, an obligation should lie on them to invest more of that money here in the State.</P>
    <P>It is often believed, for what reason I do not know, that in some way The Workers' Party are opposed to multinationals investing in Ireland.  That is not and never has been the case.  On the Left we have been criticised for our attitude to multinationals because we have always argued that for so long as Irish native capital has not the capacity &mdash; it has never had the capacity &mdash; to develop this country and its resources, if jobs could be created by foreign investment that should be done by all means.  It is significant that something like 80,000 jobs are provided in Ireland through foreign investment in this State, and that is not an inconsiderable number given the very high figures for unemployment at present.  My remarks are not intended to indicate that we have any problem with multinationals investing here.  However, we have a problem with the fact that the money they gain from their operations here is largely exported back to their parent companies and in many cases the operations they establish here are fairly low level in terms of technology and very little research and development work is done here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a great deal to be done in that regard but it is a mistake to expect that foreign investment on its own will have any major role in or impact on the development of our resources or in <Col N="1358" /> the provision of the kind of employment needed for the solution of our unemployment problems.  There is no reason to believe, given historical experience, that the encouragement and creation of the right climate for investment will provide the number of jobs that are required to tackle the issue of unemployment. There is no evidence to show that Irish capital has the expertise and ability to develop companies with the capacity to compete abroad with the major enterprises that exist in Europe and elsewhere.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ministerial Responsibility for FÁS.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to thank you a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  It is an issue that is of concern to you in so far as it relates to the rights of Deputies.  If Deputy Colley who is in the House, or Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who has indicated an interest in the matter, wants to take up some of my time I am happy that that should be done.</P>
      <P>I want to begin by explaining the circumstances in which I have come to raise this question.  The issue was highlighted for me when I asked one of my colleagues to put down a question to the Minister for Labour.  That question was tabled by my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, the party Chief Whip, and it sought to ask the Minister for Labour if he was satisfied that the arrangements announced by him in relation to additional payments to certain trainees for Christmas, in fact, operated so as to ensure that there was no disincentive to the persons taking up training opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That question drew a response from you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the response was to rule the question out of order.  In doing so you referred to an answer given by the Minister for Labour to a series of questions that were put down to him on the first day back after <Col N="1359" /> the recess.  If that decision was to stand and be taken as a precedent, it would have very serious consequences.  There are a number of reasons why it is entirely proper that Members of the House should be in a position to raise such questions. I will deal first with the specifics and use those as an indication of my wider concern.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O'Brien was seeking to do in his question was to probe a public statement made by the Minister on 25 November and elaborated on by him in this House.  He sought to ascertain whether the commitment made in this House had been delivered.  To suggest that the Minister does not have statutory responsibility in that area is unreal.  It is unreal to suggest that, because at the time the commitment was made and the time certain trainees benefited from the extra payments, FÁS never even existed, the question can be excluded on those grounds.</P>
    <P>The second concern we have is that the question contained within it issues of fundamental policy and funding importance and we understood that it was a fundamental principle of the Government that people who are unemployed should be encouraged to avail of any training or temporary employment opportunities that might be available to them.  It is for that reason we understood the Government introduced the Jobsearch scheme.  Indeed, they trumpeted their enthusiasm by encouraging people to move from unemployment into training or temporary employment opportunities. The question sought to raise the existence of serious disincentives to that. It sought to do that by focusing on the plight of some 4,000 trainees who, we say, were arbitrarily excluded from the terms of the scheme.  That seems to be an issue of fundamental policy and one on which the Minister should be answerable to the House.  We are concerned also because funding implications arise.  What is involved is the adequacy of the funds available to the State agencies operating under the aegis of the Department of Labour to allow them to make payments <Col N="1360" /> which will be sufficient to ensure that there is no disincentive and it is entirely proper that the Minister should be answerable to the House on that.</P>
    <P>There is a further reason &mdash; and I will stick to the specifics before moving to the general &mdash; why we are concerned.  It seems that the question was excluded by your office, a Cheann Comhairle, in part on misleading information provided by the Department of Labour.  It was misleading in the sense that your office were led to believe that the question related only to FÁS trainees, formerly AnCO trainees when, in fact, the Minister's public statement and his statement to this House had dealt with the circumstances of CERT trainees in respect of whom there had been no change in status.  That is a further specific reason why we are concerned.</P>
    <P>However, my concern goes beyond this and it is a concern that is shared by my party.  We discussed it today and it is our intention not to let the matter rest.  If we do not secure satisfaction here today we propose to take it further, either through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or by tabling a Dáil motion dealing with this question.  The right of Deputies to ask questions and to be informed in this area is of fundamental importance. What is involved is a central part of Government policy.  The activities of FÁS in the area of training, the provision of temporary employment opportunities and job placement are absolutely central to the Government's response to unemployment and to seek to exclude this House from an opportunity to consider it is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that what happened simply followed the precedent of what was done when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs ceded responsibility for the telephone services and postal services to An Post and Telecom Éireann.  That argument is, to say the least, disingenuous.  The first reason why this is so is that what was involved in the case of An Post and Telecom Éireann was that the Minister and his Department ceded responsibility to two newly created semi-State bodies.  What is involved in <Col N="1361" /> this issue is simply the transfer of responsibility from a multiplicity of State bodies to one State body.  There is the question of the National Manpower Service for which there was previously direct ministerial responsibility, but that makes up a relatively small part of the package as a whole.</P>
    <P>A distinction has to be drawn between a commercial State body and one that is engaged in the provision of services.  The areas that can be exempt from parliamentary scrutiny in the case of the ESB are inherently wider than is appropriate for a service body entirely State-funded or European Community-funded and operating in an area of central importance.</P>
    <P>I said that we regard this matter as one of fundamental importance, and that is so.  If there is a change of policy and the effect of that change of policy is to exclude Deputies from pursuing questions of concern about the operation of employment and training measures, we have to respond to that and I have indicated that we are prepared to respond very forcibly.  During the course of the day it has been intimated to me that what is involved may not be as all-embracing or sinister as it appeared and that what is involved are simply teething problems. If so, we would be delighted to receive reassurance on that point.</P>
    <P>The first point I want to put to the Minister is that there is no justification for a departure from existing practice. In the past Ministers were prepared to answer, in the Dáil, questions in relation to the activities of AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency and now that those two bodies have been amalgamated and have a new letterhead there is no justification for seeking to exclude parliamentary questions.  If the Minister feels that the existing practice was causing undue difficulties, we are prepared to hear him on that.  We have no desire that the Minister's time and FÁS's time would be taken up in responding to questions about whether an individual applicant would go on a specific training programme or whatever.  That is at one end of the scale.  However, we do assert the <Col N="1362" /> right to ask questions about the general operations of FÁS and we will seek the support of the Chair in doing that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to make some changes in existing practices, it would be appropriate for him to discuss, perhaps, with the spokespersons from the other parties in the House, where the lines can be drawn as to what is so specific that it need not be the subject of parliamentary debate and what is sufficiently general and has sufficiently wide implications, that it is a matter that is proper to this Dáil.  My party have shown that they accept the responsibilities of Opposition. We have shown that sometimes in areas that are politically difficult for us.  We require that the Government accept their responsibilities, too, and we require that a government in a minority Dáil should not seek to exclude the rights Deputies have enjoyed for very many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Birmingham in restating the principles on which Deputies in this House have access to information.  I had an experience in this matter along with a number of other Deputies in the last few days.  I tabled a question concerning the total number of participants involved in the social employment scheme and I received a letter stating that I could not pursue this matter with the Minister, that it must be referred directly to FÁS.  The total numbers involved, rather than individual numbers in any one scheme, is very much an area where we are having regard to whether the policies announced by the Minister are being carried out.  A Deputy must have access to that kind of information in order to monitor the implementation of policies.  For instance, there is a specific amount of money involved, money allocated in the Labour vote, to fund the social employment schemes. How is a Deputy to ascertain whether that money is being spent on social employment schemes, whether it is being spent properly and whether there is a need for more?  One simply cannot look effectively at the policy and how it is being implemented if one cannot have <Col N="1363" /> access to global figures and overall numbers.</P>
      <P>I am a firm believer in the separation of the policy and executive functions of government.  There should be very clear dividing lines between the implementation of a policy in its day-to-day manifestations and the targets that either are or are not achieved.  A Deputy in this House should have access to the information as to whether the overall targets are being achieved.  Access to that information is absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the Minister's statement of 18 June last on the Labour Services Bill in which he specifically declared his interest in relation to policy as opposed to the day to day activities of FÁS.  The Minister also referred to a NESC report on manpower policy which had criticised Irish legislation governing the activities of State bodies.  NESC apparently argued that our legislation is very specific and detailed in relation to financial provisions but completely ignores the question as to how the Minister or the Department might influence the activities of these bodies in the context of overall policy.  I realise that in this new Bill the Minister has taken it on himself to have a very active role in policy making, but of its very nature it is a political activity and something which must be open to examination. That is what this House is for and we, therefore, must have access to the kind of figures and information that would allow us to examine policy.  The Minister in his speech said that the policy function is to rest clearly with the Minister and acknowledged that he left An Foras with a considerable degree of flexibility in day to day operations but that under section 17 the Minister may give a direction to An Foras to carry out or not to carry out specified activities. That is a very wide power.  It is a political activity, something that reflects a policy decision.  If it is a policy decision the Deputies in this House must have access to the information that went into the formation of that policy.  I am afraid that if the type of figures I have looked for <Col N="1364" /> and the information Deputy Birmingham looked for are not available on a regular basis and on the basis on which such figures have been available up to now, we simply will have no input into judging policies that are being implemented.  I would go so far as to say that the democratic process is therefore weakened.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this.  Perhaps, as Deputy Birmingham said, this problem might have arisen because of teething problems in how exactly FÁS will operate in relation to this House.  I hope we can learn from the Minister that that is the case so that this problem can be ironed out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Chair and his office and to my Opposition colleagues for the annoyance and confusion caused by this matter.  That was not my intention.  I totally agree with what has been said.  I will clarify what caused some of the confusion. This motion must be looked at in the context of the formulation of manpower policy and the management of manpower programmes.  The distinction between the policy formulation and the programme implementation was dealt with in the White Paper on Manpower Policy published in September 1986.  The Dáil and the Seanad in their debates on the Labour Services Bill also dealt with the question.  It would be fair to say that during these debates there was general agreement that the Minister of the day and his Department should be responsible for policy.  The major issue was probably the failure of the Minister and the Departments to formulate policy and by default leave the functions to executive agencies.  It is my intention to discharge this role fully and to answer to the Oireachtas for policy matters.  There was also agreement that efficiency and effectiveness considerations would best be served by leaving the management of programmes to the board and management of FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In talking of parliamentary questions relating to day to day matters I have in <Col N="1365" /> mind for example requests for information on the conditions for entry to programmes, the eligibility of a particular person or body to participate in programmes and individual problems or group problems in relation to payments or some related matter.  Clearly, because of limited staff resources, and in the interests of avoiding long delays in communications, these questions are best dealt with by direct contact between Deputies and FÁS or CERT as the case may be.  At one stage a lot of questions from Deputies by way of phone calls to Departments could be dealt with in the Department by an officer walking down the stairs and getting the information. That was the practice in dealing with a lot of these schemes and services.  Now that many of these services have gone out of the Department that is not possible. There is a totally different structure and it is a far more complicated process for individual staff to get the information. In the case of straightforward questions there is that difficulty and it is only possible to have questions answered now in a matter of days.</P>
    <P>For example, of the 31 questions which I received today, almost all arrived into the Department late on Friday afternoon. Thus the Department officials are left in the position of getting all that information to me by mid-day yesterday so that I may prepare for Question Time.</P>
    <P>There is a complication in that we do not have the staff within the Department. These people who gave information or answered queries regarding the schemes are gone from the Department and are elsewhere.  To play the matter down and to say that it is all the same is unfair, particularly as it would pose an impossible burden for the individuals concerned. On day-to-day questions and policy questions, I totally accept how that information has to be given.</P>
    <P>The Labour Services Act which followed two very constructive debates in the Dáil and Seanad provides a framework for policy formulation by the Minister. The Act also uses the expression &ldquo;day-to-day activities&rdquo;.  This is written into the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> Section 12 of the Act obliges FÁS to report to me as to proposed future activities within three months of starting and to obtain my approval and that of the Minister for Finance.  This is a new departure, as Deputy Colley has said, in the relationship between the Minister and the State-sponsored body.  It will allow me to ensure that the programmes of FÁS are consistent with my policy priorities.</P>
    <P>Section 72 of the Act allows me to give direction in writing to FÁS in relation to policy generally, or in relation to their annual accounts, or annual reports, plans for the coming year &mdash; any information which I am entitled to obtain under section 12 (5).</P>
    <P>Section 12 (5) deals with the furnishing of information to the Minister by FÁS at the request of the Minister.  This section obliges FÁS to furnish me with the information on its activities, its strategy, its annual report, plans, or annual accounts. The subsection, however, specifically relieves FÁS of the obligation to furnish me with information on its &ldquo;day-to-day activities&rdquo;.  Legally, therefore, FÁS need not supply me with information on day-to-day matters and, by extension, it would be wrong to say that I am failing to answer questions for which I have statutory responsibility.  As I have indicated, it is my intention, of course, to respond fully to the Oireachtas on policy matters.  I believe that the approach which I am adopting is fully consistent with the Act.  It will allow us to meet the twin objectives of proper ministerial responsibility to the Dáil and the efficient discharge of Manpower business.</P>
    <P>Finally, if it is a matter of trying to formulate exactly what is in or out so that we do not have the confusion we had in the last few days, I should be very agreeable to assist.  I wish to answer any question, I should answer and, at the same time, not to have a cumbersome and perhaps over-bureaucratic approach which would be unfair to the staff involved.  I do not know who can arbitrate in this matter, whether it is the office of An Ceann Comhairle or not, but I should be very agreeable, before Question Time <Col N="1367" /> on the day when Department of Labour questions come up again, to have any of these matters clarified to the satisfaction of the Opposition spokesman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, may I take it that the Minister is agreeable to discussing the situation with <Col N="1368" /> the Opposition spokesman before the next day for questions?</P>

      <P>The EC Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work to the EC Council in December, 1987.  The EC Council Working Party on Social Questions have only just commenced its examination of the proposal and, of course, under the new procedures the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee will also be consulted on the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department will consult with the social partners in regard to the adoption of a national position on the proposal. Generally the aim of the proposal in providing a framework for effective protection for workers from carcinogens at work is welcomed.  Our overall concern will be to reconcile what is occupationally and scientifically necessary with what is <Col N="1303" /> technically feasible and economically viable.</P>
    <P>At present there are many diverse provisions in Irish legislation, both of domestic and EC origin, in relation to the protection of workers from exposure to carcinogens at work.  While it will not be possible to state in detail the changes in law and practice which the proposal entails until the final content of the directive is decided upon, the proposal as it stands would involve updating or replacement of our existing provisions.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to estimate when examination of the proposal will be completed or when it is likely to be adopted, having regard to the technical nature of many aspects of the proposal and the new procedures arising from the Single European Act.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the national legislation to give effect to the EC Equal Treatment Directive, satisfy almost all the requirements of the ILO Convention in question.  However, the absence of specific national legislation outlawing discrimination on grounds of race, colour, religion, political opinion, national extraction and social origin, which are mentioned in the Convention precludes ratification by this country.</P>

Among the areas I would envisage being covered in the discussions are, the question of balloting before industrial action, injunctions in industrial disputes, trade dispute law, reform of the Labour Court, codes of practice and measures to further encourage trade union amalgamations. I have indicated to the FUE and the ICTU that I would be anxious to have the discussions completed by the end of April.

      <P>Official accommodation for married Prison Service personnel at Cowley Place has, for several years, been beyond economic repair.  The houses were built at the turn of the century and it would be inordinately expensive to overhaul them. The outcome would also be unsatisfactory because they have inherent structural and other deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vacated houses are no longer allocated to new occupants and already 29 of the 50 houses in Upper and Lower Cowley Place are empty.  Ultimately the houses <Col N="1309" /> will be demolished and the ten cottages formerly on St. Patrick's Avenue have already been cleared.</P>
    <P>As was already outlined to the Deputy, by my predecessor, in a written reply on 21 May 1986 in the Official Report, (volume 366, column 1878), it was decided in 1981-82 that provision of official accommodation for Prison Service personnel would be discontinued. Levels of service remuneration &mdash; the pay scale for basic grade prison officers is £9,866 to £12,383, plus a number of allowances, including annual rent allowance of £1,015 and £1,353 for single and married officers respectively &mdash; are considered to be sufficient to enable personnel to provide accommodation for themselves, as comparably remunerated sectors of the community do.</P>
    <P>The whole situation as regards the houses and official accommodation generally has been known to staff for some years past and was fully discussed with their representatives under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The Department must be satisfied that claimants continue to satisfy this condition while they are in receipt of payment and for this reason all <Col N="1310" /> claims are subject to review from time to time.</P>
      <P>Reviews of entitlements may take the form of reviews of individual cases which warrant specific attention or they may consist of reviews of certain claims selected on a random basis and the persons concerned being asked to supply evidence of the specific efforts they have made to find employment.</P>
      <P>No particular instructions have been given to staff for reviewing claimants in the Howth area nor have any special criteria been laid down for assessing claimants' eligibility for unemployment assistance in that area.</P>
      <P>During the course of a general review in November to mid-December last of postal claims registered at Cumberland Street Employment Exchange, 75 claims in the Howth area were among postal claims selected for review on a random basis.  Postal claims at the employment exchange are filed in alphabetical order for each area and those selected for review at random for the Howth area were from a batch whose surnames ranged from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;M&rdquo;.  Of those whose entitlements were subsequently disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that the claimants were not available for or genuinely seeking work, less than half had their surnames begin with &ldquo;M&rdquo;.  This was simply a result of the alphabetical group used for the purpose of selecting cases for review on that particular occasion.</P>

However, given the overall volume of payments &mdash; nearly 100,000 applications for new house grants, house improvement grants and mortgage subsidy were paid in 1987 &mdash; it is inevitable that some delays beyond the normal may arise from time to time in individual cases.

      <P>The £2,000 new house grant is normally payable only where the applicant or his/her spouse had not previously purchased or built a house for their own occupation. An exemption from this requirement was recently introduced to allow a grant to be given where a new house was being provided to meet the needs of a disabled member of the household.  In such circumstances also, the normal floor area limit of 125 square metres does not apply. The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension about the £5,000 grant operated by the local authorities.  That grant which continues to be available is confined to the adaptation of existing houses to make them suitable for the accommodation of disabled persons.</P>

    <P>Work will also proceed on three major sports facilities in Dublin to be developed in conjunction with the National Sports Centre.  £100,000 will be used to complete a National Badminton Centre at Baldoyle while £200,000 will be used to upgrade the facilities at Morton Stadium. £300,000 is being allocated to commence the construction of a National Basketball Arena and Community Centre in Tallaght at an estimated cost of £2 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, £3.4 million is being made available for the provision of sports facilities in towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>£10 million is being provided for grants to assist local and community efforts in the provision of sporting and recreational facilities and community amenities.

    <P>Today's announcements give the clearest possible indication of the Government's intention to use the proceeds of <Col N="1322" /> the national lottery in a way that will give maximum benefit to communities throughout the length and breadth of the country.  In a very real sense of the word, all of us who support the national lottery are winners.</P>
    <P Just="Center">List of Sport, Youth and Recreation Projects to be Assisted from the National Lottery in 1987-1988.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government made a policy decision that henceforth the national lottery fund would provide all funding for sport and youth.</P>
    <P>Youth, sport and recreation will be the main national lottery beneficiaries receiving a total of £26.3 million between now and the end of 1988.</P>
    <P>The investment now being made in these areas will enable Ireland to move forward rapidly in the development of many facets of sport.  It will ensure that in elite competition, Irish sports people will not be at a disadvantage when competing internationally and all Irish people will have far greater opportunities for participation in sporting and recreational activities.</P>
    <P>Sport and Recreation</P>
    <P>The sports and recreation funding will be expended as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  National Sports Centre: £2.5 million</P>
    <P>The Government accepts the need for the provision of a National Sports Centre in Dublin which will facilitate the holding of international events to the required technical standards and with spectator capacity appropriate for major international championships.</P>
    <P>This centre will also be capable of being used to meet the training needs of national and other squads for the recreational needs of the local community.</P>
    <P>The centre will be built on a phased basis and will be funded entirely by the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The initial £2.5 million will be used for a finalisation of specifications for the new centre; the identification and purchase of an appropriate site and the commissioning of the necessary design.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> 2.  National Basketball/Community Centre, Tymon North, Tallaght, Dublin: £300,000</P>
    <P>A national basketball/community centre will also be built on a phased basis. It will cost £2 million, £1 million of which will be provided from the national lottery fund.  This will be matched on a pound for pound basis by funds raised by the Irish Basketball Association.  The centre will receive £300,000 in 1988 to commence the project.</P>
    <P>The centre will have seating for up to 5,000 people and will feature all modern technical sports equipment suitable for hosting major international competitions.</P>
    <P>3.  Two major sports projects in Dublin Area: £300,000</P>
    <P>(a)  Morton Stadium, Santry: £200,000</P>
    <P>This funding will be used to build modern dressing rooms, showers and toilets which will facilitate the promotion of top class track and field competitions.</P>
    <P>(b)  Badminton Centre, Baldoyle: £100,000</P>
    <P>This funding will be used to complete the transformation of a factory premises at Baldoyle into a modern Badmintom Centre.  It will be used for elite competition and training and by the local community.</P>
    <P>4.  Regional Sports Centres: £3.4 million</P>
    <P>A sum of £3.4 million is being made available in 1988 for the provision of regional centres throughout the country. This programme will include the major centres designated in the report of the National Sports Centre Committee, prepared under the auspices of Cospoir.</P>
    <P>There will be five major sport centres at Galway, Waterford, Cork, Athlone and Limerick.</P>
    <P>(a)  Galway: £350,000</P>
    <P>For the provision of a major multisports centre which will cater for indoor <Col N="1324" /> games and outdoor facilities, including a 400 metre synthetic running track.</P>
    <P>(b)  Waterford: £300,000</P>
    <P>For the provision of a 400 metre synthetic running track to complement the large sports centre which has been built by Waterford Corporation at Kilbarry.</P>
    <P>(c)  Cork: £300,000</P>
    <P>To include multi-purpose indoor facilities together with facilities for outdoor sports.</P>
    <P>(d)  Athlone: £300,000</P>

    <P>5.  Development of Community Sporting and Recreational Facilities £10 million.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10 million is being made available to fund the provision by local authorities and voluntary bodies of local sports and recreational facilities and projects such as amenity and landscaping work designed to benefit the local environment. Projects will be assisted on a countrywide basis having regard to existing facilities, population and geographic factors.  Special account will be taken of the need to enhance the historical recreational and amenity value of urban renewal areas designated under the Urban Renewal Act 1986 and Finance <Col N="1325" /> Act 1986, thereby contributing to the general effort to secure the renewal of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>A major objective of the programmes which will be administered by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education will be the promotion of youth employment.  It will therefore, be a condition of the grant allocations that at least 50 per cent of the workforce will be under 25 years of age and that other local unemployed people should be employed as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Initial allocations will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>6.  Development of Sports Services: £1.395 million.</P>

    <P>7.  The Olympic Council of Ireland: £100,000</P>

    <P>8.  New Sports Projects: £2.055 million</P>
    <P>The funding will be expended as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Staffing and management of Outdoor Education Centres £400,000</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> For the first time adequate funding is being provided by the national lottery to run the outdoor education centres operated by Vocational Education Committees throughout the country.  This funding will make attractive outdoor pursuits available to both Ireland's young people and young visitors from abroad.</P>
    <P>(b)  Establishment of an Irish Coaching Bureau: £60,000</P>
    <P>The Irish Coaching Bureau will improve the overall level of coaching and is seen as a co-ordinating structure to assist national sports organisations in the coaching area.</P>
    <P>(c)  The introduction of an Action Sports Programme in deprived areas: £500,000</P>
    <P>Action Sport is a community-based programme aimed at increasing sport and leisure activity among the young unemployed, retired people and housewives in the disadvantaged urban areas.  The programme for which it is intended will be introduced in the deprived urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and will be organised by Vocational Educational Committees in consultation with Cospoir.</P>
    <P>(d)  Commercial Development of Sport: £500,000</P>
    <P>The national development of sport involves the promotion and development of various sports and outdoor pursuits as attractive, marketable products, capable of satisfying foreign tourist demand.  The intention is to select suitable sports such as angling, golf and shooting and to develop existing facilities through the provision of small grants.</P>
    <P>(e)  Better use of recreational facilities: £75,000</P>
    <P>This programme will be designed to ensure the maximum utilisation of community centres, sports halls, school sport facilities and swimming pools.</P>
    <P>(f)  Sports Research: £20,000</P>
    <P>The development of sport in Ireland is constrained by a lack of research and <Col N="1327" /> these funds are being provided to conduct research into the key areas of sport.</P>
    <P>(g)  Special Grants for National Sports Governing Bodies: £500,000</P>
    <P>Special grants will be made available to national governing bodies of sports for the development of &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; and the provision of sporting opportunities in deprived areas.</P>
    <P>9.  Dublin Zoo: £250,000</P>
    <P>This allocation is to assist in securing the financial position of Dublin Zoo.</P>
    <P>Youth</P>
    <P>The impact of the new projects on the quality and effectiveness of the youth service for which £6 million is being made available will be profound.  They will allow for planned development based on voluntary effort, firmly set in the context of the local community.  These projects are:</P>
    <P>1.  Disadvantaged Youth: £4 million</P>
    <P>A sum of £4 million be set aside for major developments of community youth projects in areas such as Tallaght, Darndale, Finglas, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and inner city Dublin.  Projects in Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway as well as in other urban and rural areas, where need arises, will also be assisted following consultation with appropriate local interests.  The needs of groups particularly at risk such as young homeless, young travellers, substance abusers and other young people at risk will be given special consideration in the allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>2.  Voluntary Youth Organisations: £1 million</P>
    <P>The contribution of voluntary youth organisations in the provision of youth services is recognised.  A sum of £1 million is being provided for the expansion and development of voluntary youth organisations in areas not previously catered for and for new programmes responding to emerging needs in the <Col N="1328" /> youth area.  Voluntary youth councils will also be set up to provide an efficient and co-ordinated local youth service.</P>
    <P>3.  Special Projects: £1 million</P>
    <P>A variety of new developments to complement the above measures will be funded to a total of £1 million.  These include:</P>
    <P>(a)  Youth Exchanges</P>
    <P>New programmes with other European countries and North America will be established.  The current cross-border and British/Irish youth exchange programmes will be extended.  The emphasis will be on enabling young people, who could not normally participate in these programmes to do so.</P>
    <P>(b)  Network of Youth Information Centres</P>
    <P>In conjunction with the development of local youth services, a network of centres will be established to provide young people with easy access to basic information on their rights, benefits, opportunities at home and abroad, health, welfare and other issues.</P>
    <P>(c)Special Training for Youth Workers and Volunteer Leaders and general co-ordination of services at local level.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention is to maximise the volunteer element in the delivery of youth services.  In order to achieve this, new training programmes promoting good practice in youth work will be supported.  Such programmes will further develop the skills of voluntary and full-time workers enabling them to meet the needs of an evolving youth service. The Government is also anxious to develop a co-ordinated and cost efficient delivery of services to young people.  A programme will be implemented therefore, to establish in local areas a co-ordinating mechanism based on the voluntary principles which inform youth work.</P>
