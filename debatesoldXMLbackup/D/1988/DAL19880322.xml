      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will make money available in the current year for the extension and reconstruction of Ring national school, Dungarvan, County Waterford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the pressure on the capital available to my Department for the national schools building programme, I am not in a position to allocate moneys in the current year for the extension proposed for Ring national school, County Waterford.  However, my Department will be prepared to consider grant-aiding the cost of essential improvements to the existing school building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that improvements will not solve the problem, that one of the classrooms has actually disintegrated and is no longer occupied by the school children?  They have to be placed in a private dwelling.  Is she serious when she tells us that no moneys will be <Col N="446" /> made available in the present year?  Is that definite?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Minister of State met with a deputation from this school on 24 February last.  At that time the questions of possible help in the provision of a type of classroom and improvements to the existing building were raised.  These matters are at present being considered by the management and my Department.  The provision of this type of classroom would eliminate the need for use of the room in a nearby college, which I presume is the room to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This room, indeed, is very small and totally inadequate.  Provision of the classrooms referred to would release an existing classroom for use as a lunchroom-cum medical room-cum teachers' room.  We are most certainly keeping the matter under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the dire circumstances in this school, I ask the Minister to keep an open mind as to whether finances can be made available in the current year.  Will she have the matter examined further?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>Architectural planning of a single co-educational school in Kilcock has reached the working drawings stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the seriously deficient facilities in Kilcock at present?  Would she be prepared to make an exception in this case in view of the co-educational aspect involved, in order to accommodate the large number of students now needing accommodation? She might perhaps make an exception with regard to the financial provisions, it is hoped perhaps in the current year, in order to allow the project to go ahead this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there was a great sense of co-operation with regard to the rationalisation project for this area.  That certainly will be borne in mind.  I cannot at the moment be more forthcoming with the Deputy.  He has made previous representations in this matter.  I shall undertake to keep the matter under review.  With regard to rationalisation proposals coming forward as a process of co-operation between schools, such proposals should be very carefully scrutinised for promotion through the system.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will consider directing special attention to those primary schools where the freeze on capitation grants for the second year running has resulted in a shortfall of £10 per pupil for day to day running costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="449" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The day to day running costs of primary schools are discharged by making funds available by means of State grants and contributions from local sources.  The State capitation grant is not intended to meet operating costs in full.  Each board of management are responsible under the rules for national schools, for making arrangements for the collection of such funds locally, in supplement of the State grant, as will ensure that the school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in proper decorative condition.</P>
      <P>The payment of the capitation grant is regulated by the published conditions, which are of general application.  The only provision for supplementary State assistance for running expenses is through the special fund allocated for schools serving areas of severe disadvantage, part of which may be used for the relief of debt.  The fund is distributed by the diocesan authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the capitation grant to schools was frozen again this year and the hardship this caused to a great many schools where the parents of the pupils are not in a position to give more money, do the Government intend to at least double the special fund for disadvantaged primary schools in order to meet the crisis?  This crisis was clearly spelt out in a full page, horrifying article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 7 January detailing 26 emergency cases in schools involving hepatitis among other things.  This was followed by other articles to the point where they informed us that children in a school in Baldoyle were asked to bring toilet paper to school.  Has the Minister any plans for dealing with the additional problems caused in disadvantaged areas by increasing the fund?</P>

      <P>I cannot say at this point what we propose to produce in the Estimates in October for 1989.  Points <Col N="450" /> have been brought to my attention in regard to the present position of capitation grants and my Department and I will bear them in mind when we are preparing the Estimates and bringing them to Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As these facts have been repeatedly brought to the Minister's attention in the Dáil, when the Estimates are being drawn up will the Minister take every possible step to compensate all schools in disadvantaged areas and to restore the cut in the disadvantaged fund, which needs to be doubled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;does the Minister not consider it terribly important to clarify the situation?  The important review committee were unable to conduct their meeting yesterday because the Taoiseach told them they would deal with current difficulties but the chairman said they could not.  I urge the Minister to clarify these matters before the teachers' conferences so that there will not be unnecessary confusion and alarm among parents and teachers.</P>

      <P>There is absolutely no need for confusion and alarm.  In answer to Deputy Hussey's snide comment about committees, I note that in the action plan for education of the previous Government, she intended to set up 47 committees, although not many of them got off the ground.  With regard to the major primary review which Professor Murphy has promised to chair, they did not break down and are meeting next Monday.  It remains a very important review and we are very pleased that the participants will act.  Like Deputy Hussey, I am greatly looking forward to Easter week.  Some people will be on holidays but I will be doing my rounds.  I am satisfied that the Government, the Department and I will do the very best for education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>In the light of the Minister's reply I am very glad to hear that she has had discussions with a view to taking very seriously the problems arising from this proposal.  May I ask the Minister if she has taken into account that 15 of the 26 Counties of the Republic do not have any Protestant schools and that since 1966 the number of Protestant second level schools has been halved? The difficulty is that if they lose one-sixth of their staff those schools will inevitably close and the Protestant community, therefore, will be deprived of the right of education in schools of their own religion. Have these particular aspects been taken into account which I believe make a very special case for the group?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 26, 141 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>Circular Letter M85/85, introduced the requirement that, with effect from the beginning of the 1986-87 school-year the junior cycle be of three years' duration, and the leaving certificate course be of two years' duration in all schools.  This circular was issued in the context of the <i>Ages for Learning</i> document.  A transition year at post intermediate level was envisaged as developing in some schools.</P>
      <P>All transition year programmes are currently sanctioned on an annual basis and are currently under review.  I hope to inform schools of my decision in this regard in the near future.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> I am not aware of any widespread concern among parents or confusion in schools in relation to the VPT programmes.

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assure the Minister there is widespread concern.  Every year I know that schools have to get renewed permission to have a transition year.  The confusion and alarm arises in the context of the Minister's assertion that all schools will be reduced to a five year cycle.  The problem is that the schools have not been asked to apply for the transition year next year.  There are approximately 74 schools with a transition year.  May I ask the Minister if, within a short period, she will tell the principals of those schools what is the position.  The concern has now spread to the point where at my clinics groups of parents and teachers are coming to me saying that they do not know where they are going.  In the light of the widespread concern that all schools will be reduced to five years and will have no transition year, will the Minister inform the schools who have transition years what their future is and how soon can we expect that?</P>

    <P>Athlone RTC have established a research <Col N="459" /> board and they had their first meeting yesterday evening.  They have an industrial liaison officer funded mainly from sponsorship.  Carlow RTC are engaged in a research contract for the EC.  Cork RTC are involved on the same basis.  Galway RTC have a research and consultancy committee, as have Letterkenny RTC.  Waterford RTC is about to undertake various consultancy work. There are a number of research assistants at Limerick.  Quite an amount of research and development is carried out at Bolton Street College and at Kevin Street.  The general answer is that third level VEC colleges have been forward in their approach to this matter and it is hoped that the forthcoming legislation will copperfasten their right in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the increasing concern among principals and staff of RTCs about the legality of the contracts and work they are undertaking with outside bodies.  They are of the opinion that they need a ministerial order quickly in order to continue on a legal basis this very important work.  Is the Minister aware that there are three reports emanating from the old NBST, now Eolas, all of which address the question of the legal barriers to industry and higher education co-operation.  One report, &ldquo;Barriers&rdquo; was issued in 1986 and two others were issued in 1987, one of which deals with limited liability.  In view of the widespread concern among RTCs and the barrier to the great work which they can undertake, will the Minister look into the question of immediate ministerial orders in advance of the rather complicated legislation?</P>

      <P>They have strongly integrated with their community and with the general remit they have been given. When I came into office and the merger of VECs was decided upon I made it one of the points which must be in the legislation that their remit to do so should be clearly identified and spelled out.  It is being very actively pursued.  In conjunction with Deputy McCarthy, Minister of State with responsibility for technology, we have been enabled to further the cause of research and consultancy within the RTCs and third level colleges in general.  I am keenly aware of what they are doing but I am even more keenly aware of their potential and what they could really do if they got going. Rather than issuing guidelines in advance of the legislation, I would hope that the format of the legislation would be speeded up enough to combine everything together.</P>

I am satisfied that the local government auditor will not call into account the research and consultancy work carried out within RTCs.  Having very carefully perused the 1930 Vocational Education Act, I am satisfied that the act is flexible enough to allow the RTCs and third level colleges to engage in this work, but I want to put it beyond all doubt.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 24 and 25 together.</P>

    <P>The Government's commitment to catering for the educational needs of the disadvantaged is evidenced by the continuing provision in this year's budget for the maintenance of literacy programmes and prison and traveller education under the aegis of the vocational educational committees.  My Department have also acknowledged on an on-going basis the involvement of vocational schools with disadvantaged pupils by consistently allocating to the vocational sector over the last nine years the substantial majority of remedial and special class teacher posts, <Col N="463" /> and my Department will maintain that provision again in 1988.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on 9 March a meeting of the central review committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is to be convened in order to examine the implications of the decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in the vocational, community and comprehensive school sector.

      <P>In regard to Questions Nos. 10 and 24 which relate specifically to Mount Temple comprehensive school, to Scoil Íde and Coláiste Eóin, is the Minister aware that the loss of teachers in those schools will result without doubt in a loss of subjects because of the fact that the classrooms cannot take more pupils?  You cannot increase the size of classes because the classrooms are restricted in size.  Apart from that it would be totally unsuitable to increase the size of the classes anyhow.  Coláiste Eóin and Scoil Íde will lose nine teachers under the Minister's proposed pupil-teacher ratio and this will result in a loss of classes, a reduction in class times, in greater numbers of unsupervised class periods and in a whole range of other losses for the pupils concerned.  The Minister must ensure that whatever arrangements are made the losses will not fall on the heads of the pupils in these schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of primary school building projects in urban areas that have been cancelled or postponed by her in pursuit of her publicly stated policy of not providing new accommodation where there is evidence that sufficient suitable accommodation is available at existing schools within a reasonable distance; and if she will give the details in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the compilation of statements listing and giving details of individual school projects which may be <Col N="466" /> affected by various policies of my Department would involve an inordinate amount of official time, it would not be my intention to provide such statements. I would, however, be happy to answer questions the Deputy might wish to raise about individual projects in which he is interested.</P>
      <P>The policy mentioned by the Deputy is one to which I referred in my statement to the House on 4 February 1988 in connection with the 1988 budget.  It is one of a number of policy areas which are under consideration by a review group &mdash; set up in January 1987 &mdash; currently assessing the framework within which the primary building programme operates.  Pending the submission of the group's report, which is expected in the near future, and an assessment of its impact on building grant applications in hands, it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment at this stage.</P>
      <P>In my statement referred to I indicated that I expected to be able to offer grants for additional building to a number of schools which have acute accommodation problems but only on the basis that their schemes would be confined to the provision of proper classrooms with proper facilities.  I further indicated that the additional finance made available to my Department for their national schools building programme would be devoted mainly to school building in rural areas. It follows that the postponement of major primary school projects arises as much from financial constraints as from other policy considerations including the specific one to which the Deputy refers. While the emphasis in the current financial year would be on dealing with rural schools, urban schools would not be excluded from consideration where they have acute accommodation problems and where their problems cannot be resolved by the use of suitable accommodation which might be available elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.  First of all, there are the financial constraints and Deputy Bruton well knows about them as he framed the 1987 budget.  Secondly, there are the planning needs of an area. These two must go together.  Obviously, we cannot build schools where we do not need them and where full accommodation is available.  As the Deputy knows, demographic changes and the production of new figures showing that an area does not now need a school which heretofore had been sought have led to many rethinks on the building of schools within areas.</P>

      <P>The paper to which the Deputy refers does not include sufficient data on the methodology used to establish the cost of educating the graduates concerned.  In addition I have no responsibility for the training of nurses so I am not in a position to comment one way or another on the figure of £40 million of the £86.8 million, which is the nurses input.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal to transfer responsibility for third level education to the European Community, this possibility is not open to us at present as education <i>per se</i> is not covered in the Treaties of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A recent decision by the European Court of Justice, however, may lead to all third level education being defined as &ldquo;vocational training&rdquo; in which case funding could become available. However, under Community law such funding would have to be made available on a communitywide basis.  There is no provision whereby the funding of a programme may be undertaken in any one member state without similar funding being made available in all member states.  Also, such a proposal would have to emanate from the Commission of the European Communities.  It is not open to member states to make such proposals.</P>
      <P>Much is being done in our schools to improve language teaching.  For details I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 66 of 11 February 1988.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a manpower agency would be a matter for the Minister for Labour and in this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply he gave to Question No. 103 of 11 February 1988 in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the <Col N="471" /> study in question was indirectly financed by the Minister's Department in that it was conducted by a person who was working for the past while with the Department?  Did the Minister make any inquiries before answering this question as to the methodology used in arriving at the figure in the question?  Would the Minister favour as a general principle the idea of Community responsibility in the matter of third level education?  Accepting that legally the Irish Government do not have the ability to make a proposal to the Council of Ministers but that the Irish Government have the freedom to make a proposal to the Commission who can make a proposal to the Council of Ministers, would the Minister indicate if she would be prepared to make such a proposal that the Community should take some measure of responsibility in the matter of third level education as an extension of the idea of a common labour market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Deputy's question very interesting.  The paper to which the Deputy referred &ldquo;Export or Die&rdquo; was read at a conference organised by the commerce and economic society in University College Cork in Jury's Hotel on 20 January by Patrick Diggins, a director of the teachers' centre in Drumcondra in Dublin.  Later I met with Mr. Diggins informally at a function and I had an interesting conversion with him with regard to his paper.  The facts he draws upon are very interesting.  In some instances I would raise arguments about where he has carried through some of his facts, in particular the ones to do with languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to whether this Government should make submissions to the Commission who, in turn, would relay them to the Council of Ministers, that is worth pursuing. The recent court judgment allowing the freedom for all third level education to be seen under the aegis of vocational education has very exciting possibilities for the funding of third level education here.  The general idea of Mr. Diggins's lecture to the Cork commerce <Col N="472" /> and economic society was to highlight many issues.  In doing that he performed a very worthwhile function and the later court developments now appear to be opening up very exciting possibilities.</P>

Therefore, it seems only reasonable that the two Departments of Education, the local authorities, or whatever authorities are involved on a broad scale in this, should co-operate with one another.

I had considered at the time issuing a statement but I knew Question Time was coming up and that it would provide a forum for so clearing.  To answer the Deputy's supplementary question, the target date for the issuing of the 1988 leaving certificate results is the week beginning Monday, 15 August.  Obviously it will be about Wednesday, 17 August.  The target date for the English A-level results is 18 August, so will coincide with the A-levels results in England.  It is worth noting that the A-levels examinations in England begin at the beginning of June and end at the end of June.  We begin about ten days later.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware proposals to the Council of Ministers are a matter in the first instance for the Commission of the European Communities.  I understand, however, that at the meeting of Ministers on 24 May, the Commission will present for discussion a document on the possible contents of a programme to improve the teaching and learning of languages prior to submitting a formal proposal in this matter later in the year.  I will be pressing for a realistic programme with a substantial level of funding which would include assistance for prospective and existing language teachers to spend a period of study in the countries whose languages they teach as well as for linguistic and cultural exchanges of second level pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is unlikely that any formal proposals in the matter of technological education will be presented to the meeting I can assure the Deputy that I will miss no opportunity to try to secure increased funding for technical training from the European Social Fund.  In addition when <Col N="481" /> the COMETT programme comes up for review in 1989 I will be pressing strongly for its continuance and expansion with a significantly increased level of funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that the whole question of the Single European Act and the approach of 1992 have added a nationally new urgency to this question of language learning and that it is something which must be given top priority.  Is the Minister aware of the findings of the most recent survey carried out by the Euro-barometer group, survey No. 28, taken in October and November last year which showed that Ireland is once again lowest on the table of language speakers in Europe?  When people in Ireland were asked if they spoke any continental language other than their own well enough to follow a conversation, 80 per cent said they did not.  This compares with, for example, 28 per cent in The Netherlands. We are proportionately in this respect the highest group in the EC who cannot speak another language fluently.  This is another example of our problem and I would like to draw that to the Minister's attention.  Has the Minister made any proposals to the Commission?  I am aware that the Commission will place proposals before Ministers and that that is the way things are done.  I am also aware that her officials attend meetings, long before the Ministers' meetings take place, at which they can put forward the Irish proposals. I was involved in doing so myself in other areas.  Is it the Minister's intention that Irish proposals will be going to the Commission to be put before her colleagues in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, I have been very active in this regard.  It is one of the issues on which I made a public statement here in the Dáil within a month of coming to office and my Government colleagues, as the question intimates, have been very active in that regard.  A very successful seminar was held about a month ago which the NCEA convened and all the various interests attended.  Following on that I met with <Col N="482" /> Mr. Howard Jones informally when he was here at a dinner and we had a very full discussion on the real need for Ireland to be included positively in any initiatives which will be taken for language diversification.</P>
      <P>With regard to the survey which Deputy Hussey has mentioned, I would question one of its findings because our indications are that we are not bottom of the league and that the take-up of European languages by English students is much lower.  That is by the way and does not excuse the fact that we have a great amount of work to do in this regard. I hope that the business, economic and financial climate, the general European trend towards the very open statement of the needs of countries to participate in language diversification programmes, the steps which we have taken and the forthright statements which I have made in this regard will lead us to prepare proposals.  I intend to give that matter my very close attention.  My objective would be that come September 1988 and subsequent Septembers there would be more young people in this country taking up European languages other than French.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have given careful consideration to the maintenance grants for students taking vocational training preparation courses at second level and are of the opinion that the range and diversity of the course content is much more important to the <Col N="483" /> student than the actual allowance being paid.</P>
      <P>It may be pointed out, that the vocational preparation and training programme represents a significant contribution by the education system to the training needs of young people.  Since its inception in 1984 it has evoked an enthusiastic response from educational authorities and the sustained high level of participation by trainees is a clear indication of its success.  A good deal of thought has been given to the preparation of challenging and stimulating courses containing a solid grounding in skills which offer good prospects of employment in a wide range of occupations.  I am convinced that the basic quality of the vocational preparation and training programme will ensure its continuance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister two very simple questions.  Do the alternative courses of which the Minister speaks not involve moving such provision outside of education altogether?  Is the Minister speaking about money which will be spent from the lottery through FÁS programmes or courses or how does she envisage the new programmes as being accountable within her own Department?  Secondly, the question asks about the implication in terms of decreased participation.  Is it not a fact that those involved in the courses have made representations to the Minister saying that the £30 per month enabled people to continue in education who would otherwise have dropped out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally they have made representations but my answer was based on the fact that the content and the diversity of these courses is of enormous attraction to the young person.  I do not think that the appeal of the courses will be lessened because of that.  I do not think that the intrinsic value of the course that is the Vocational Preparation and Training Programme, to which the Government contribute to the extent of £14 million &mdash; the figure for the last year <Col N="484" /> for which we have details &mdash; to match the £14 million which comes from the EC, will be so affected.  The Deputy asked me another point which has no relation to the question so I will not be answering it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was to ask the Minister if her Department have assessed the implications of the removal of the £30 grant.  Would she not agree that, while to a middle-class family, range and diversity are very important, as they are indeed to all families, for families in the lower socio-economic group £30 per month might make a difference as to whether they attend the courses?  Is she simply saying that it does not matter to lower-income families that they will have £30 less per child per month for these courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that at all.  What I am saying is that the scope and the attractions of the course and the preparation for work skills which the course provides is of enormous benefit to anybody from any section of society and that the commitment of the Government in giving £14 million to match the £14 million from Europe is an enormous contribution to such courses.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a full statement on recent tragic and horrible events in Northern Ireland; if he will outline the steps his Government are taking to break the impasse in Anglo-Irish relations so as to ensure that political activity and progress can replace the present cycle of violence and horror; if he will begin now to take steps leading to a full Anglo-Irish summit and if, in the context of that summit, he will ensure that every co-operation is given to any and all attempts to commence dialogue between the constitutional representatives of both communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the very serious deterioration in the security position in Northern Ireland and of the grave risk arising from increased sectarian tension, he agrees it is of the utmost importance that constitutional politicians should regain the initiative from terrorists; in particular if he will set in train an early meeting with the British Prime Minister with a view to further development of the processes of the Anglo-Irish agreement, including investigation of devolution within Northern Ireland and the establishment of an Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal in detail with these questions I should like to put on record here the Government's total condemnation of recent atrocities, our sympathy for the relatives and friends of those killed and injured and our determination, by every means open to us, to bring violence to an end and achieve lasting peace and justice for the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As announced yesterday, there will be a full meeting this week of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference at which recent events and other items coming within the purview of the conference will be discussed.  The Irish side at the conference will bear in mind the considerations and views expressed in this House on the recent occasions during which the situation in Northern Ireland or events connected with it have been <Col N="487" /> discussed at Questions or in debates since the beginning of the year.  In view of these discussions and the forthcoming meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, I do not consider that a full debate here at present would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>As to the question of a meeting with the British Prime Minister, the House will recall that as recently as last month Mrs. Thatcher and I had a meeting in the margins of the European Council in Brussels.  The House had a fuller than usual debate on the outcome of that meeting.  While I am glad to meet the British Prime Minister at any time when it is necessary or helpful, I consider that at this stage, a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference is the appropriate forum for discussing the current position, which I must emphasise has not arisen because of any actions or omissions of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I know that Members of this House will agree with me in calling for calm and restraint on all sides in the present explosive situation and that everyone has a moral responsibility to refrain from doing or saying anything that might exacerbate matters or increase tension.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that there is an urgent need to reestablish the role of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference as the major agency through which grievances affecting both communities in Northern Ireland and affecting the Irish and British Governments could be aired?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no need because it was never disestablished.  The Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference has been meeting frequently, as often as is required, and will meet again this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the note of sympathy in the Taoiseach's response and, likewise, to assure him that, on behalf of the Labour Party, we would only wish to contribute to the call for calm and restraint in what is a <Col N="488" /> very difficult time.  Does the Taoiseach accept that at present there is an impasse in Anglo-Irish relations?  If he so accepts, does he not feel that this impasse is leading to a political vacuum and that urgent action must be taken by both the Irish and British Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows &mdash; and most Deputies in the House are aware &mdash; following the decision by the British Attorney General in regard to the Stalker-Sampson report, I expressed dissatisfaction and I think most Members of the House agreed with me in expressing that dissatisfaction.  I think Deputies would agree also that, since that decision, the situation has deteriorated by a procession of events which represented a cycle of violence and counter-violence.</P>
      <P>The only thing I can say is that it is proposed to hold a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference this week at which all these matters can be discussed and conclusions arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, while there have been several actions on the part of the British over the last two months in particular that have caused anxiety in this country and in the House, notwithstanding those actions we are now facing a position in Northern Ireland, or more particularly the people living there, are facing a position in which anarchy appears to be breaking out, where there is a danger of widespread sectarian warfare?  Could these irritants and problems that have arisen in the last two months not be put aside and the Governments of both countries come together with a view to trying to sort out the problems and take appropriate steps rather than simply relying on yet another meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference which, over the past two months, has not been successful in coping with these difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not close my mind to anything that might improve matters.  But I would suggest to the Deputy that to have this meeting this week is perhaps the most appropriate <Col N="489" /> step at this stage.  Then we can see what can be done thereafter.</P>

      <P>If progress is not seen to arise from the meeting this week, would the Taoiseach then consider approaching the British Prime Minister with a view to meeting her directly in order that everyone concerned can see that the two Governments view the present situation with the utmost seriousness and concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be understood by everybody that both Governments do view the present situation with very deep concern and are deeply perturbed about it.  I do not rule out anything that might appear from time to time to offer the possibility of making progress, but I would not like to pre-empt the outcome of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference meeting this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach pointed out a moment ago that he was quite prepared to bear in mind, in the course of any discussions that might take place, the various suggestions and proposals that have been made in this House in recent debates.  As long ago as 17 February I made a number of proposals to the Taoiseach as to the course the Government should follow, as indeed did Deputies O'Malley and Spring.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach's readiness to bear those proposals in mind.  In view of what he has just said would the Taoiseach agree that, to make progress in present circumstances, it will be necessary for the British Government to approach the whole question of Anglo-Irish relations with a degree of open-mindedness, of forthcomingness, so to speak, that we have not seen in the last couple of months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, would the Taoiseach not agree that, in order to set the seal on any attitude of that kind on the part of the United Kingdom authorities, it would be necessary for the Taoiseach and the United Kingdom Prime Minister to meet and to reach conclusions together that <Col N="490" /> would make a constructive contribution to the alleviation of the problem?  Furthermore, would he not regard the forthcoming meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference, and perhaps additional meetings at that level, as being nothing more than the necessary preparation for the kind of meeting of minds between himself and the United Kingdom Prime Minister that constitutes the only way in which we can move forward from the present position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's acceptance that a serious deterioration has taken place in Anglo-Irish relations whilst fully accepting that a summit meeting would have to be well prepared and must yield fruit, might I ask him at this time &mdash; when circumstances prevailing over the past ten days are probably more serious than any that have prevailed in the past 20 years &mdash; to take the obvious option and seek a summit meeting at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not evident that the contributions by way of questions, of the leaders of Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party are merely a confirmation of the Taoiseach's view of not so long ago that the Anglo-Irish Agreement and its conference paraphernalia are of little benefit and that since it was instituted things have deteriorated so much that the architects of it are now calling for a summit meeting because they recognise, as the Taoiseach then did, that this conference and the Anglo-Irish Agreement are not of real benefit in solving the troubles in this country?  May I further ask that in any deliberations, <Col N="491" /> whether at summit level or conference level, if we can have a considered opinion arising from what I hope will be a full inquiry &mdash; and if the British do not carry out the inquiry our Government should embark upon it &mdash; into the train of events during the past eight or nine days?  Many questions have been left unanswered.  I do not think we will get the answers from the British, whether it be from the top, the middle or the Anglo-Irish Conference. Are we not playing around and codding ourselves that the Anglo-Irish Agreement means anything so far as the problem of violence in this country is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered Deputy Blaney's question about the Anglo-Irish Agreement last week and gave my views on its efficacy and its machinery.  I think Deputy Blaney might agree with me that the situation at present is of such a nature and so awful in many of its implications that we should not neglect any opportunity or mechanism that might be available to us to achieve progress.  I think the Deputy would also agree with me that it is only through political progress ultimately that these awful happenings can be brought to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On foot of what the Taoiseach said in reply to the last supplementary question, may I ask him, arising from the question put by Deputy O'Malley, if he would, within the agenda of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, ask our British counterparts whether it is now opportune to put in place the parliamentary tier which would provide both this Parliament and the Parliament in Britain with another mechanism, to which he has just referred, that would enable the political dialogue and political process to continue?</P>

      <P>I would not rule that out.  In fact, the matter is being considered at present.  I am sure the Deputy <Col N="492" /> will agree with me that it is a matter that will have to be dealt with very carefully and prudently and we will have to try to ensure &mdash; and naturally I would be prepared to consult with the party leaders here &mdash; that whatever structure we devise or put in place will be an effective one.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, but in Part I, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  (1) The provisions of Part III of this Act shall not come into force until the Minister shall make an order in that behalf.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall not make an order under subsection (1) of this section at a date earlier than a date on which he has made regulations providing for the means testing of persons eligible to receive benefits under Part III of this Act.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may by regulation provide for means testing of persons to determine their eligibility to receive benefits under Part III of this Act and such regulations may include provisions relating to the level of income and ownership of property and other means of such persons.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment, I wish to take the opportunity to set out clearly my party's attitude to the proposed extension of PRSI to the self-employed and to farmers. First, this is not in any proper sense of the word an insurance scheme.  There is a very loose link between contributions and entitlements.  Benefits are automatic and not means tested and I will return to this point.  In addition it is not insurance because the scheme is not properly costed on an actuarial basis.  The interim report was rushed out by the National Pensions Board at the request of the Minister. We are totally dissatisfied that sufficient consideration was given to the long-term cost of the scheme.  To pretend that the <Col N="572" /> scheme has been scientifically and actuarially costed is a farce.  Clearly, the Government have decided to fund this proposal on a pass-as-you-go basis.  Even a casual awareness of the interim report from the National Pensions Board would show their preference was for an investment of the income under the scheme in the early years, when it is in surplus, to offset the cost in later years, when it will be in deficit.  The Government have scandalously disregarded this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Our central objection to the scheme arises from the fact that it will end up costing the very taxpayer the Minister pretends the scheme in some sense is designed to protect.  For too long this country has indulged in putting forward half-baked, ill-thought out schemes, which appear attractive in the short term but prove disastrous from the cost point of view in the long term.  This is just such a scheme and that is why we objected on Second Stage to this measure.  It is quite clear that the Government are still intent on railroading this costly measure through this House.  That is why we are seeking an amendment to alleviate some of the costly implications of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The case in regard to the amendment is simple and straightforward.  The present system of assistance for the self-employed is means tested, consequently, the Department of Social Welfare's figures reveal that 28 per cent of those who qualify for assistance receive less than the maximum rate of benefit of pension.  This is so because the current rules have deemed the payment of full pension unnecessary in these cases.  What will the Minister's proposal now mean?  The answer is that everybody will qualify for the full rate of contributory pension, irrespective of means.  In addition to the 28 per cent who do not qualify for the maximum rate of non-contributory pension, some applicants are refused totally any pension on the grounds that their means exceed the limits set and they are deemed to be too well off to qualify.  I think that point is very important.</P>
    <P>I think it would be worthwhile looking at the question of those who are eligible <Col N="573" /> for the non-contributory pension and those who are not, those who should be eligible and those who will be eligible now.  We know also that many do not apply for the non-contributory pension until after their 66th year because they chose to remain active in the labour force.  All of these people, irrespective of their means and irrespective of whether they wish to apply for a pension under the current rules would automatically qualify for a full contributory pension under the Government's proposals now before the House.  I must also point out there are about 200,000 people in private sector pension schemes who are already adequately provided for, and many of whom never claim or would wish to claim State pensions.  These include the wealthiest self-employed people in the land.</P>
    <P>In terms of basic social justice, is it not a farce to spread welfare benefits with the latitude of a badly focused blunderbuss, when there are so many people living in genuine poverty and dire need and who should have the first and greatest call on the State's limited resources?</P>
    <P>Therefore the Progressive Democrats have moved an amendment to introduce a form of means testing so that everyone who is self-employed and about to be pulled into the scheme, whether they wish it or not, will not automatically qualify for a State handout.  For that reason I am moving this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to be well intentioned in that it highlights some of the problems which arise from the scheme proposed by the Minister but, unfortunately, it goes much further than that and has implications which Deputy Wyse may not have considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, at present a contributor is a person who gets his or her entitlements regardless of means, once he or she has the requisite contributions.  If Deputy Wyse's amendment were to be accepted so far as the self-employed were concerned we would have a perversion of that definition, with obvious implications for people who are already making social insurance contributions.  There could be <Col N="574" /> very serious implications for these people who, for years, have contributed in the belief that, regardless of how well they prosper, there will be a pension for their widows or for themselves if they should live long enough.  In my view, there is a very serious drawback in the amendment proposed by Deputy Wyse.</P>
    <P>However, there are major problems which could arise if this amendment were accepted.  There is no retirement requirement in the Minister's proposal and he does not say he will not introduce a retirement requirement, some time in the future.  The National Pensions Board are considering a retirement requirement but if there is a retirement requirement for the self-employed, would it stand up in the High Court if there is no retirement requirement for the employed class?  At the moment an employed contributor can continue to work beyond pension age and draw his contributory old age pension, and a widow can work and be entitled to draw her contributory widow's pension. But can we legislate to have a differential between the employed and the self-employed classes?  If such a provision were challenged in the High Court, would it be upheld or shot down?  My guess is that it would stand a very good chance of being upheld.</P>
    <P>These are the kind of questions the National Pensions Board, the Minister and this House will have to consider further. If we do not have a retirement condition, there could be very serious implications as far as the handing over of farms and other businesses is concerned. At present these businesses and farms are handed over when the owners are comparatively young.  I think it would be the view of the House and the public in general that businesses should be handed over to the next generation sooner rather than later.  In my view the absence of any retirement condition has major drawbacks. The presence of a retirement condition would affect the existing contributory class in an adverse way.  This is one of the major problems in the Minister's proposal.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be wise to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy <Col N="575" /> Wyse because of the implications which could arise.  Nevertheless, this hits a nerve in the Minister's proposal and touches on a major flaw in that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment essentially would be to scrap the entire scheme of social insurance for the self-employed. It would impose a means test on self-employed people before they could qualify for a pension.  The whole basis of a social insurance pension system is that pensions are payable as a right in return for contributions and are not subject to a means test.  The whole purpose of the scheme is to enable self-employed people to join the rest of the working population in contributing towards the cost of their pensions and have the security of knowing that they are building up rights which will not be affected by other income or assets which they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A self-employed person will now be able to look forward on reaching age 66 to a basic level of pension knowing that the payment will not be affected by the assets he/she will have accumulated through his/her own efforts during the course of his/her career.  In the case of a widow the level of pension she will be entitled to under the Social Welfare Acts will not be affected by whatever assets she has on her husband's death.  This is particularly important where a farm is <Col N="576" /> concerned and the widow is left with the children, trying to make a go of the farm or the son might be trying to keep the farm going.  In that case the widow will have the widow's pension as a right.  If she is in a position to supplement that pension with earnings from employment or self-employment, those earnings will not serve to reduce her pension payment.</P>
    <P>This system is clearly of advantage to the individuals concerned as in return for the payment of contributions they acquire a State guaranteed level of payment in their old age and a guaranteed income for their survivors in the event of their death.  The scheme is not just of importance, however, to the individuals concerned, but also to the community as a whole.  A system of non-means tested benefits encourages enterprise and thrift as the persons concerned know that such efforts will not have the effect of reducing the pension payment they can look forward to in old age or that they receive as widows.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment, however, would remove this basic feature of the scheme.  It would leave self-employed persons effectively in the same position they are in at present, having no guarantee of a basic level of pension in their own right.  On the surface it might appear to be a more efficient use of resources, resulting in targeting these resources on those on the lowest incomes.  That may be what the Deputy has in mind.  The amendment would be another form of taxation whereby many self-employed persons would be required to pay contributions but would never qualify for any benefits.  For the bulk of self-employed persons who are in the middle income ranges, the situation would be one of complete uncertainty in that they would never be sure whether they were going to qualify for anything and whether they should make private arrangements on that basis.</P>
    <P>That is an important element in this whole question of pensions.  Those who control and operate pension funds and those who might make private pension arrangements are happy if there is a basic level of pension provided by the State <Col N="577" /> with provision for them to be able to top it up through their own private arrangements. That leaves room for private insurance companies to operate in that area.  The fact that the self-employed were required to pay PRSI contributions would in any event limit their scope for making such arrangements.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment would give rise to serious inequities as between different categories of self-employed contributors.  Under the proposed scheme contributions are related to the level of income but the same pension payments are made irrespective of the actual amount of contributions paid subject, of course, to the minimum contributions laid down.  Thus, persons on low incomes who on the basis of such income pay a low level of contribution will qualify for the same level of pension as persons on higher incomes paying higher contributions overall.  This ensures that every contributor irrespective of means receives a basic level of pension to provide for his or her basic needs. However, if the amendment was adopted the scheme would not alone result in contributors with higher income paying more but would also result in such persons receiving less.  This could not be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is called equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to make her contribution later.  In fact, she will have three days to make her point.  Finally, I would like to refer to the fact that social welfare pensions are subject to income tax. Accordingly, pensioners on higher incomes will have such incomes reduced through the tax system when account is taken of the pension payments.  I do not know if Deputy Wyse realised that important fact particularly when taking into account the costings.  Obviously, there would be an additional saving to the scheme involved.  Means-testing such persons would not alone lead to duplication of the tax system but would also serve to substitute virtually 100 per cent taxation on the pensions, for the rates of <Col N="578" /> income tax considered appropriate under the tax system.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the new arrangements be equitable as between different categories of self-employed people and as between self-employed persons and employees.  What we are proposing is that the same rules as apply to employees should also apply to the self-employed and this in my view is the only fair way to proceed.  If changes are to be made in the conditions for entitlement to pension &mdash; and I have already said that the National Pensions Board are examining this whole area &mdash; then any such changes should apply equitably to employers and the self-employed.  Deputy Mitchell made a point in relation to a retirement clause.  However, that must be considered in relation to employees and the self-employed.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I can see no justification for applying a means test for pension entitlement for the self-employed.  The amendment, does not specify what form of means test is envisaged.  Has Deputy Wyse the standard old age non-contributory pension means test in mind?  If so then the result is that all pay while noone benefits, other than to the extent that the social insurance pension is somewhat higher than the non-contributory pension. Those who would have got a non-contributory pension in any event would now have to pay for it, others would pay and get nothing.  It is not a fair system and I could not accept it.</P>
      <P>In raising questions about costs Deputy Wyse made sweeping allegations to the effect that we had not done our home-work in that area in regard to them.  I should like to refute those allegations absolutely.  The Government, in considering the report of the National Pensions Board, took on board the actuarial studies.  In addition, they had before them a report of the work of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners publish reports from time to time which I am sure are made available but the point at this stage is that the Government, when taking action on proposals, have available to them advice from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. We have taken that advice and we are now talking about the actual figures.  The actuarial study was carried out by the National Pensions Board but when we are talking about the income anticipated we are talking about the actual figures compiled by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that the National Pensions Board calculated the additional costs on an actuarial basis over a 50-year period.  They were the extra costs in providing contributory old age and widow's pensions to the self-employed. That was over and above the <Col N="580" /> cost of continuing the present arrangements. The additional costs, according to those studies, would be at five years, £6 million; at ten years, £21 million; at 15 years, £54 million; at 20 years, £73 million; at 40 years, £99 million and at 50 years, £89 million.  Those figures had not been questioned by any experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All the experts have accepted those figures as the cost over and above the original figure.  It is meeting that cost that the 6.6 per cent comes in; that is the factual position based on the actuarial studies.  A question was raised about the yield and I should like to tell the House that the yield in practice at 5 per cent is £50 million per annum.  A whole new system of collection will be involved.  Deputy Wyse said that more money would be brought in initially with the cost arising later.  The whole point in averaging out over the 50 years was that initially more money would be brought in.  The social insurance fund will gain substantially in the short term but ultimately the 5 per cent is intended to meet the cost in the long term averaged over 50 years.  That is the position in relation to costs.</P>
      <P>Many people have spoken about a calculation done by one economist and I hope that at this stage Deputies will leave that question aside, although I am prepared to discuss it.  That a plain mistake has been made by that economist is clearly seen from his calculations on figures from the Minister for Finance.  On that basis he calculated £31 million at 5 per cent and his calculation is patently wrong.  If any Deputy wishes to discuss the matter later, I will show how that mistake occurred.  It is mathematically wrong.</P>

      <P>A number of things changed in between.  First, the base has been broadened by the Government.  As the Deputy knows fairly well, the base actually being used at the moment includes, in addition, unearned income. The figures given by the National Pensions Board did not include unearned income.  That is one very major area which we discussed on Second Stage.  This brings in rent, interest and income arising from dividends.  A much broader base is used in these calculations.  On that basis and on the percentage set by the Government, the Revenue Commissioners gave the amount that would be brought in by year five.  Two economists have been quoted fairly publicly and I am sorry they do not say that they made a mistake.  That would put many people right.

      <P>Minister and Deputies, please.  We have had the Second Stage debate.  I hope we will not have the ghosts of these two economists <Col N="582" /> following us, section by section.  Could we come to some agreement on this, to kill them off early on and be finished with them?  If the Minister addresses his remarks to me he will get a less questioning audience than he will get by addressing them to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>There are a number of matters.  First, there is a wider base.  Secondly, there is a higher ceiling than that used in the report and studies.  Thirdly, we have the new collection system &mdash; a much wider, more efficient and very much more effective system.  It was Deputy Wyse's total dismissal of the costings that led me to this.  The amendment of Deputy Wyse is unwise.</P>

      <P>He still seems to give credence to some of these matters.  Once you accept the Revenue Commissioners' figures of £50 million at 5 per cent, you are on the right track.  There will be a review in three years and a look at any minor adjustments required.  Deputy Wyse need have no fear about the imposition of any draconian measures such as are envisaged in his amendment.  On these grounds, I cannot accept his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a couple of matters to put briefly.  First, I find myself to a large extent in agreement with the Minister's sentiments.  In setting up any form of pension scheme or pension entitlements, one must be guided by the advice one gets from an actuary or a financial adviser.  One would want a crystal ball at this stage to see who is right and who is wrong.  It was wise to incorporate in this proposal a review of the situation after three years.  I suggest that the Minister might go a little further than that and, following that three year period, that there should be an annual review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been involved in <Col N="583" /> pension schemes will know that circumstances can change fairly dramatically from year to year, certainly from period to period.  It depends on the number of people contributing to the fund, the changing pattern in population and the age groups.  The numbers of people emigrating, for example, could very well have a very dramatic effect in one year on the income into the fund, or on the number of people who would retire and be drawing from the fund. Another element is the average age, which tends to increase and has been increasing over the past number of years. People are living longer now, perhaps because of the better drugs available and better health care, although there is some doubt about the latter.  I see my colleague smiling about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Deputy.  He was not saying that yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>People are living longer and that will have an effect on the amount of money to be paid out of the fund, so one would want to have a crystal ball to be able to tie down figures.  There are too many imponderables for mathematical accuracy.  My reservation is based on a fear that there would be under-funding. There is no problem when a pension fund is over-funded.  Higher benefits can be given as time goes on, bonuses can be added in and additional benefits. However, under-funding creates a difficulty. At some future date severe penalties have to be imposed in order to make up for the under-funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the amendment as explained by Deputy Wyse, to introduce a means test would effectively put paid to the scheme as it is intended under the Bill.  Whether that would be a good or a bad thing is another day's argument. Means testing would introduce a further anomaly into the already complicated system of social welfare.  The sector of social welfare which is dealt with by means testing raises more problems than any other sector.  It is virtually impossible <Col N="584" /> to take two individual sample cases and find them alike.  You can very seldom come to a conclusion as to how a deciding officer, an appeals officer, or a social welfare officer has arrived at a calculation of a benefit.  Also, means testing would create very long delays in administration. At the moment there is a delay of from 15 to 16 weeks in getting an examination of means for unemployment assistance, as all the Deputies will know.  If you add a further sizeable category there would be a need for a substantial extra number of social welfare investigating officers. There would be all sorts of fiddles to avoid these assessments which, indeed, happens at present.  If you introduce this element to the self-employed, the only people who will benefit are accountants and possibly those in the legal profession who will look for ways and means to get around this assessment.  However well-intentioned the amendment may be, it would have a very serious detrimental effect on the overall proposal.</P>
    <P>I disagree with any taxation on pensions and this is the first time I have heard a Minister for Social Welfare admit that pensions are taxed.  A pension of £40 or £50 is deducted from the person's tax allowance and the remainder is taxed. This is a question for the Revenue Commissioners, but, if a person has substantial means, the adjustment would be made through the taxation system.  For those reasons, I cannot support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A few moments ago, the Minister spoke about the scientist and the economist.  It reminded me of something I heard recently: an economist and a scientist were in a field with a tin of beans which they could not open.  The scientist picked up a stone and tried to open the tin but the economist said: &ldquo;Let us assume we have a tin opener&rdquo;.  Therefore, we should leave the scientist and the economist out of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into the actuarial problem although I read the article by Mr. Mackey from Davy, Kelleher and McCarthy and one by Paul Tansey, a well regarded economic commentator, in <i>The</i><Col N="585" /><i>Sunday Tribune,</i> on this scheme.  It is generally accepted by independent economists that the subsidy to the self-employed and the farmers will be something in the region of 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the eventual pay out.  If that is the case, it is appalling.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, irrespective of means, everybody will get the same basic level of pension.  The problem with the system of social welfare is that we try to spread a very limited amount of resources among too many people.  Everybody gets the same children's allowances and that also applies to other areas.  There are limited resources and we are now about to extend social welfare to a group of people who could well do without it. Regardless of the economic implications &mdash; and they are major &mdash; it is very unjust to pay the unemployed worker from my constituency, who will never get a chance to work, a rate of benefit which will be much lower than that paid to the wealthy stud owner who, by virtue of paying a small contribution each year, will get a guaranteed pension in excess of that paid to the person who has never had a chance to work.  If, in relation to tax, we announced that we were introducing a new tax scheme which would ensure that everybody, regardless of their means, would pay £50 per week in taxation, everybody would scream and roar and say it was unjust.  If that system is wrong in relation to the tax system, surely it is wrong in relation to social welfare, that people should be treated on the same basis regardless of their economic position?</P>
    <P>The Minister asked what kind of means test we would suggest.  I agree with a suggestion Deputy Jim Mitchell made last week.  There is an urgent need to have a single, simple system of means testing people for State benefits in social welfare, housing or education grants.  At present there is chaos in regard to applications for medical cards.  There is a long delay in processing them because of the different criteria applied compared to social welfare.  I have dealt with constituents who had to wait months before their applications were processed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> Eventually they were granted medical cards but only after a lengthy delay.</P>
    <P>The self-employed and the farmers have been very quiet recently in regard to the proposed measure and I can understand why.  As they became aware of the economic reality of what is about to be bestowed on them, they realised that it is the greatest bonanza they will ever get from any Government.  Many of them, quite rightly told their union representatives to keep quiet because they regarded it as a fantastic scheme.  They would be mad to reject it because, in return for three per cent of their income this year which will rise to only five per cent over a number of years, they will now get, regardless of whether they have large farms, businesses or private pensions, a fixed State pension, inflationlinked. It is no wonder they have become so quiet; the wool was pulled over the eyes of the trade union movement in relation to this issue.  As soon as people hear that somebody else will pay more tax, they think it is marvellous, although they have not studied the implications. This was generally welcomed by the representatives of the PAYE sector.  I can see why they felt it necessary to welcome an extension of tax to the self-employed and the farmers but they did not realise the great bonanza it is to those groups. However, they did not realise that it will be a millstone around the necks of the PAYE sector in particular because they will pay for this scheme in the months and years to come.</P>
    <P>We must examine the social welfare system.  Some years ago I sat on a joint committee which consolidated the then Social Welfare Acts.  There is a need to have an all-party committee of the Oireachtas to examine social welfare.  At present the scheme is grossly inequitable and very unjust.  The system does not help those it is supposed to help.  It tries to spread very limited resources over a large number of people.  One of the areas where we can now begin to make differences is in relation to the extension of PRSI to other categories of workers.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  Perhaps some people feel that <Col N="587" /> once they opt in to a PRSI system they are guaranteed something which cannot be taken away from them.  One cannot expect them to make contributions and then to change the rate of benefit which will be applicable after they receive contributions. However, we do that in relation to many other benefits.  Recently we introduced measures in this House which will restrict disability, unemployment and other allowances.  We have increased the number of contributions necessary before one is entitled to these benefits.  We do make changes after people opt to pay PRSI in relation to benefits.  I do not know if the courts would take a different view in regard to that than they would in regard to contributions towards a pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Here we have a new scheme extending PRSI to two new categories of people and, before they begin to pay, surely we can make it a condition of their payment that they will only get pensions on the basis of their means being established at the time they become entitled to make an application, on retirement, old age, when they are widowed or whatever.</P>
    <P>To do anything else would be a scandal. It would be very unjust, particularly to the group of people who never get a chance to work or to make a contribution and, therefore, to get contributory benefits of any kind from the State, but it would be equally unjust to other people who will be solely dependent on this State to survive in their old age, when they are widows or when they are retired, who will have no other separate income, no separate wealth and will have nothing to fall back on.  Their benefit from the State will be their sole means of livelihood.  It would be wrong for them to get the same basic rate of benefit as some of the better off people.  That would be wrong and I do not think there is any need to go that far.  Despite what the Minister has said and despite the justification he has tried to put forward for the introduction of this scheme in this manner, I do not think he would agree that it would be either just or equitable in any circumstance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> The Progressive Democrats believe that PRSI is a tax on work.  Whilst PRSI exists, obviously no category of workers should be excluded from paying it.  We believe that eventually PRSI and the tax system should be incorporated into one single rate with say, 5 per cent or 3 per cent of your contribution in tax being set aside as a social security tax and that all workers should pay it.  Equally, we believe that we will have to move towards a system of means testing people for social welfare regardless of whether we want to do it.  The structure of our population is such that in 20 years' time, because of the number of young people we have in our population, it will not be possible for this country to continue paying out social welfare payments along the same lines as we do at present.  We will not have the workforce to sustain that level of payment of social welfare to so many categories of people.  We must begin to be selective.  We will have to apply some form of means testing.  Economic circumstances will force that upon us even if we do not want to do it.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have had in recent years is that political promises made in the past, because they seemed right in the short term or right to deal with the particular problem that arose on a day to day basis, are the very things that caused this country to borrow so much money and to raise taxes to such a level that we have now got a total disincentive to work.  We now have so many people unemployed because we have to devote so much of our resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way I could support the amendment proposed by Deputy Wyse of the Progressive Democrats.  As the Minister said, the pension which any person receives at present is means tested in the sense that when you become eligible for a pension it then becomes available for calculation for tax purposes.  A point I have frequently made in regard to pensioners who are on low incomes is that their pension is taken into account, for instance, where the husband or wife is working and the pension, therefore, is calculated for tax purposes.  There is no reason that should not apply to the self-employed and to the farmers who are included in this scheme. The problem is that it has always been extremely difficult to apply the taxation system to those two categories of persons who have numerous ways of dodging the tax system.  Following its implementation perhaps the side benefit of this scheme will be that it will bring them more closely under the tax system.  I understand that part of the procedures will be co-ordination between the tax office and the Department of Social Welfare in relation <Col N="590" /> to assessing the means on which contributions will be paid.</P>
      <P>The injustice is based on the fact that the contribution, as it is fixed at present, is far too low and there are too many exemptions of income for assessment of contributions.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be practically to eliminate any contribution from the self-employed and the farming sectors.  There is no doubt it would strengthen the case they have made to date that they would prefer to make their own private arrangements for their pensions and are not anxious to make contributions to the social insurance fund.  For that reason I oppose the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of reasons I disagree with Deputy Wyse's amendment. Some of them have been referred to already but one relates to the question of means testing.  I have two objections to means testing.  One relates to the elderly. I boycotted the committees which were set up because I thought it was a humiliating exercise and my own political philosophy did not allow me to get involved in that area.  People who contributed to the State all of their lives were put through a humiliating exercise and I disagreed with it.  I disagree with any extension of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Harney referred to the cost of administering means testing generally. One of the elements which was missing in rationalising and controlling the cost was the lack of computerisation.  It was physically impossible to do manually what needed to be done.  It was a quill pen effort up to a few months ago but now all employment exchanges and the social welfare offices are being fitted with computerisation.  Direct linking will allow a single means test to be carried out.  I am still against the philosophy of means testing the elderly and I have given my reason.  Deputy Bell referred to this and, like myself, he represents the less well off sections and we are well aware of the problems that arise in this area. Very often we have to make cases which we are criticised for making but the <Col N="591" /> system is there and people do not always get what they are entitled to receive.  The whole matter is clouded in mystery to some extent and some politicians want to keep it that way.</P>
    <P>My second reason for disagreeing with Deputy Wyse's amendment is that he wants to allow the better off section to opt out.  Some people describe them as &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; but I think that is unfair. Deputy Harney did not want to name them today but they have been named here in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know all their names.  If I did, I would name them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have to name them again, we will do so.  I did not interrupt Deputy Harney, much as I was tempted to.  The simple philosophy should be that we should all carry our share of the State's bill.  I was among the one million PAYE contributors for 26 years and nobody ever gave me the opportunity of opting out.  I am amazed at Deputy's Wyse's suggestion that the well-off should be treated differently from the ordinary PAYE worker who is told that he is part of the pension system.  The underlying philosophy is that the weak help the strong, which is as it should be.  In the insurance world they get a mean average between a good risk and a bad risk.  It is being suggested that the better off should be allowed to opt out and that the taxpayer should carry the rest.  I disagree because that would transfer pressure to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Those of us who are members of health boards are constantly being asked to petition the Minister to stretch the rules and give a few pounds to people because of the circumstances in which they find themselves, perhaps due to the death of a breadwinner.  This is because successive Governments since 1978 have failed to introduce a national pensions scheme. This charge can be levelled at all Governments who held office during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wyse will have another opportunity to contribute. Despite the failure to take action, the Minister is now being castigated for taking up the question and doing something about it.</P>
      <P>The point was made that we cannot continue to pay social welfare benefits at the present rates.  I agree totally.  This year we will have to pay £330 million of taxpayers' money to people who have not taken out their own cover and have not contributed to a pension scheme.  We must avoid paying out such sums of money.  We were told at the outset by Deputy Harney not to bring economists into it but she then proceeded to quote four of them.  Obviously the economists will have to be consulted at some level since somebody has to work out the figures. I would accept the costings given by the Minister.  It seems that one man, Massey, got the figures wrong and everybody has jumped on that bandwagon.</P>
      <P>There are still great improvements to be made in the social welfare area.  We have had two Bills in four months containing 50 sections.  Some people have been in this House for years and have done nothing, yet they criticise.  They say we need changes in social welfare and that is what we are getting.  I intend to put in my oar and make my contribution as best I can, either directly to the Minister or in this Chamber.  I will not try to negative every move that is made.  We should support the Minister.  To suggest that we should not adopt the Bill is unreal.  I am amazed at that suggestion that we should wind back the clock ten years.  I am totally opposed to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will avoid making a Second Stage speech.  This measure is not about exempting those who are making their own arrangements for their retirement. That is not the purpose of this amendment.  That matter is dealt with in a later amendment put down by Deputy Mitchell and is a completely separate issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this amendment which is aimed at preventing this House from <Col N="593" /> making a fundamental error in deciding to increase the amount of unfocussed redistribution which occurs through our social welfare system.  One of the problems in a small economy such as ours is that we have limited resources to redistribute and most Deputies, of whatever ideological persuasion, would agree that the business of Government is to redistribute those resources primarily to those who need them most, to focus redistribution on those in need, to take from the haves and give, where just, to have nots, not to take from the have nots and haves and to give to the haves, which seems to be the end result of un-means-tested contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>There has been great silence on the benches opposite in relation to a point made by Deputy Harney.  A man may go through his entire life excluded from the economic life of the country through no fault of his own.  Through social and economic circumstances and his geographical location he may never get a chance to get a good job.  Not least of the reasons for his predicament is the huge burden of PRSI payments which we have put on work, which are a disincentive to employers to offer him work.  Such a man is not entitled to a contributory pension but to a series of benefits which amount to two-thirds of the amount received by people who have a contributory pension. Can anybody opposite give a justification for the fact that such a man is means-tested before he receives some meagre payout from central Government whereas a person who has plenty of assets, rolling acres, large house, large car, large blocks of shares and works of art on his walls, gets an un-means-tested pension on arriving at his 66th year and can continue to operate his company or his supermarket chain?  Where is the justice in giving one man two-thirds of what we will give to another man who does not need the money?  It is suggested here that the tax system will take care of all that. The tax system may take care of it as it stands, but in years to come we will not have marginal rates of 58 per cent.  If we follow the international trend in industrialised countries the rates will be much <Col N="594" /> lower.  The system will not put those people where they ought to be in relation to each other.  There is no answer to Deputy Harney's claim that it is unjust to say to a man or a woman who has spent a whole life in penury that he or she will be means-tested to get £2 for every £3 paid out un-means-tested to the haves in society.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wyse is right to suggest that Part III of this Bill which proposes to give money to the self-employed and farmers should not come into effect unless and until there is a system in place to make sure that those moneys, like all the moneys we vote in this House and which are borrowed are needed.  We have to go to international bankers to get this money.  We have to borrow every year to keep this tottering State on its feet.  These moneys are going to have to be paid out of either borrowed money or tax.  Every pound which would come to me in my 66th year as a self-employed person, if I am still in a position to earn myself a living as a barrister or whatever I might be by then, even allowing for marginal rates of taxation would be a pound not going to somebody who is in need, who is living in a fourth floor flat in Ballymun and who has never had a job in his or her life.  If it is suggested that it is justice for me to receive that money and for the kind of person I have just described not to receive it, I suggest that our concept of justice is very frail indeed.</P>
    <P>The real issue here is whether these sums are funded.  If every penny that is to be spent on the self-employed and farmers was to be funded by way of contributions from the self-employed and farmers nobody would complain as it would be their own money they would be receiving back but, as has been pointed out by Deputy Harney, and which goes uncontradicted, we do not live within a system which has a social insurance fund that is fully funded &mdash; it is pay as you go. It does not pay for itself.  Contributory pensions are not paying for themselves and will not, even as envisaged by the pensions board, pay for themselves.  It is in that context that there are, by definition, occasions on which there will be a <Col N="595" /> subsidy to recipients.  Because they do not pay for themselves we must carefully examine whether we can afford to allocate extra resources, except on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>During the course of the budget debate I said to the Taoiseach when I raised this issue with him that if he wanted to get more from the self-employed in the interests of equity, if he wanted to persuade the trade unions to be a party to his national plan, if he wanted to convince the public and create the impression that those who appeared in the past to get away with not shouldering their fair share of the burden were paying in more, he should do so and should do so honestly. I said to him not to attach to that the price tag of an unlimited flow of benefits to those people in the future which this country cannot afford.  I also said to him that if he proposed something along those lines, something by way of a means test or of a levy which was not going to yield benefits, we would support him but he said to me in somewhat unparliamentary and untypical language that the Government would not and that we were a pack of frauds.</P>
    <P>We have proposed this amendment and we have come to this House to deliver what we said we would which is Deputy Wyse's amendment proposing that these benefits should not be given out except on the basis of need and should only be given to those who can be shown to need them.  I support this amendment.  It is based on a basic concept of justice in a society which has limited resources.  This is going to haunt Members opposite politically for decades to come.  How will they be able to go to someone in Ballymum and explain to them they they will be means tested in the twilight of their days when they will have to look for old age pensions which are non-contributory while the haves in society will be able to pocket their money and be able to spend and fritter it away as pocket money and pin money and will receive £3 for every £2 which is given to those in receipt of <Col N="596" /> means-tested assistance and means-tested old age pensions?  That is an injustice which will haunt the people opposite and I have not heard a rational explanation for it.</P>

      <P>Earlier when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was having trouble keeping some of the Deputies in order, he made the point that on Committee Stage people could not question the speaker.  I must say that I have one problem in relation to this amendment, that is, that we are now discussing the extension of PRSI under a heading which has nothing to do with PRSI.  We have yet to come to the sections which deal with PRSI.  This section deals with means testing. It is strange to see the Progressive Democrats doing what I would have thought was the job of Left wing Deputies. In effect the Left wing Deputies are defending the self-employed whereas the Progressive Democrats are doing the opposite.</P>
      <P>The notion of means testing would bring much uncertainty into the system of PRSI and pensions.  The idea behind someone paying into a pension fund is that at the end of the day they would know that when they retire they would receive a definite sum.  Introducing a means test would do away with that. What would be the point in people contributing to a pension fund if, at the end of the day, they were to get nothing in return?  I cannot accept this.  The more people we can get on a definite pension rather than a means-tested pension the better.  That should be our intention in this House.  As I have said earlier, without such a system these people will not know whether they will receive a definite sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives who have had to deal with the system of means testing know the problems that can be encountered and the amount of red tape which has to be got through to ensure that people receive a very meagre pension at the end of their days.  I know of a person who, as a result of a means test received a pension of £2.  This is not something which should happen to people who come <Col N="597" /> to the end of their days.  The State should ensure that people who have made contributions should at the end of their days receive a reasonable amount of money to rely on.  We are all aware of the delays which can take place in appealing the outcome of means tests and it should be pointed out that extra staff would be needed to improve this aspect.  A new bureaucratic tier would be created which I do not think anyone in this House would agree with.  Therefore, the whole idea of a means test is a flawed one.  The purpose of this section is to bring some certainty into the area of pensions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney said earlier that the self-employed were not taking up this matter as much as they had done before. That may be so in her constituency but in my own constituency last Saturday I received a deputation from the self-employed, mainly farmers but including others, too.  To give some idea of the misinformation which can be put out, these people nearly fell of their chairs when I told them that after only three years their widows or orphans would receive a pension as of right.  They could not understand this and had to receive confirmation of it.  In one sense their meeting with me was fruitful.  Obviously, they wanted me to support amendments in relation to the PRSI system and they made the point that it would amount to extra taxation. When they were told of the benefits which would accrue under this system they went away reasonably happy.  Obviously, the message is not getting across to those who will benefit and who are being asked to contribute to this scheme.  Benefits will start to accrue after only three years and they themselves will receive benefits after ten years.  It is important to emphasise that there will be some certainty in the payment of pensions to these people. That is what a pension scheme should be all about.</P>

I thought this amendment would be misinterpreted and that is a risk we had to take.  Deputy Dennehy should know better.

      <P>The Deputy must remember that those unfortunate people have already been means-tested so we will still be paying out £330 million whatever way we look at it.  The Deputy mentioned the shopkeeper who might go out of business and, of course, that shopkeeper will come in under the non-contributory pension. We put down this amendment specifically to safeguard the Exchequer who will be the biggest contributor to this scheme.  It would not be in order to deal with abuses now but I will deal with them later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes a low contribution rate of £104, that is, £2 per week for the self-employed on very low incomes. However, no such special arrangement applies for employees on low incomes. Deputy Dennehy should study the Bill. There is no concession for the working man; yet those people who in the course <Col N="599" /> of the next three or four years will avail of the opportunity to claim&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell raised the question of an annual review and welcomed the fact that there is provision for a review at the end of three years.  The Deputy suggested that there might be a desire to have an annual review.  There will be an arrangement whereby there will be separate accounting each year. That can be discussed and it can be seen that we are making administrative arrangements so that the figures will be kept separately and will be accounted separately.  They can be discussed in the context of the annual estimates, the budget and so on.  That facility will be adequate to cover the point raised by Deputy Bell.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney talked about the Massey article.  There was a mistake in it.  It quoted the wrong figures.  That is different from talking about the fact that in the long run the scheme is one to which the State will make a contribution just as it does to employees under the insurance fund.  If we clear away the mistake which led to misgivings about the figure of £50 million and bear in mind that the £50 million is the Revenue Commissioners' figure and is the correct figure, the debate can go on from there.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the wealthy stud farm owner who will contribute to the scheme in future.  There are not many of them.  About 250,000 people will come into the scheme and there are not too many wealthy stud farmers in that figure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney said there should be one single means test for State benefits, for the medical card and for other things.  If that is the case, we are talking about a pretty low means test. That has quite a lot of implications which should be recognised.  Deputy Harney raised the question about the PD policy. She said that PRSI is a tax on work but that there must be means testing for people.  We are obviously talking about means testing not just here but across the board on the insurance fund in general.</P>

      <P>Deputies generally understand what is involved and I do not have to elaborate much further.  If the level is set at anything like the present level and the present people who qualify on a means test continue to qualify, the self-employed, over the next 50 years, taking the present rate of contribution, would contribute something of the order of £2,500 million and would get nothing, or almost nothing, back because we would be talking purely about means tested pensions. That would hardly be a feasible arrangement.  That would be the effect of applying the kind of means test we have at the moment.  The Deputy might suggest that we should raise the means a little higher but that is a matter for another day's consideration.  I warn Deputy Wyse to be careful about the means test he is talking about here because I am sure he does not plan to become involved in means tests of that order.  Effectively this is doing away with insurance schemes and presumably&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is fair enough.  I happen to value the scheme from my experience.  Many people would have great difficulty if they had not a social insurance scheme available to them and if everything was to be means tested.  I do not believe the community as a whole would want that.  Deputy Harney said she wants a full review of the whole social welfare system.  The Commission on Social Welfare have just done that and published the whole review.</P>

As I said, we are planning to look further at the question of an overall national pensions plan, but bringing the self-employed in is one of the priority steps in that plan.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also seems to be leaving aside the fact that the haves can make their own provision for themselves and look after themselves and they too get tax relief.  They get assistance from the State in that.  Here they can make a contribution to the fund with everybody else when they have the money and join the rest of the population in supporting the fund generally.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party had tabled some amendments to this section which have been ruled out of order.  However, I might comment on their intent which was to advance the dates of payment of the increases proposed in regard to unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity allowance, injury benefit, disablement gratuity and pension, deserted wife's benefit, and so on, to be granted under subsections (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d).  The intent of our amendments was to advance the dates of payment of these increases to April.  These types of amendments have been tabled by our party and by other Members in recent years.  What has happened is that the effective dates of payment of these increases have been later and later each year to the point at which the payment date is as late as 28 July in respect of deserted wife's benefit, invalidity pension and retirement pension.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House on the kinds of savings involved in delaying the payment of such increases for, say, a week or whatever is the period involved: perhaps he would also inform the House as to the relevant cost of paying these increases from the dates we proposed, in other words, 7 April, 4 April, 7 April and 1 April respectively.  I suppose the word contrick is too strong to describe the position because most people now accept that these delays take place.  Nevertheless there is a degree of double-thinking in this regard whereby, on the one hand, we provide social welfare increases but then delay their payment for weeks or months, as in this case, effectively reducing their annual value in a given year.</P>

      <P>I am always disappointed at the attitude of the parties who consider themselves to be on the left in relation to social welfare.  They tend to think in a straight line regardless of the obvious anomalies, poverty traps and disincentives occasioned by the different provisions.  That straight line thinking is manifest in relation to the dates of payment of social welfare increases.  I contend that social welfare increases should be related to pay increases.  Frequently it is the case that pay deals are agreed for longer than a year, sometimes 15 months, 18 months and longer.  However, if there are more frequent increases in social welfare they can have the effect of exacerbating many of the poverty traps and worsening some of the disincentives which are a feature of the system.</P>
      <P>I would urge those people on the left not to construe it as an attack on social welfare when people may disagree with them.  I am strongly in favour of a good social welfare system.  What infuriates me is that frequently what we do has the effect of being to the detriment of the poor, spreading the beneficial effects among the better off when we should be targeting the less well off in our society. We in this House should be spending our time trying to find ways of refining the system so that the resources will not be spread thinly among everyone, including those who do not need them, but spread thickly and confined to those who do need them.</P>

      <P>I want to explain to Deputies the position in respect of these amendments.  Amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, have been ruled out of order because they pre-supposed expenditure and additional finance which had not been provided for in the budget.  The question we are now discussing is: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo; and in respect of that any Deputy is entitled to plead any case he <Col N="609" /> likes.  There has not been a formal moving of any amendment because none of the amendments was in order.  That is the position in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>I now know that the amendments are not in order.  I wanted to know where the money would come from and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle answered that by saying that the amendments would entail extra expenditure.  As Deputy Mitchell said, these increases are coming sooner than was previously anticipated. The increases last year were supposed to be in November but the Government brought them back to July. These increases are also coming in July. I welcome this section because I believe any increase is worthwhile and it ill-behoves The Workers' Party to look a gift horse in the mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that you clarified that point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We put down amendment No. 6 to indicate our opposition to the Bill because the Government and the Minister have not increased child benefit on this occasion.  I think it is three years since there has effectively been any reasonable increase in child benefit.  I know there has been a national debate on the question of children's allowance, as it was formerly known, and who should benefit from it. Politically speaking, there are sections in this House who would say that children's allowance should not apply to certain categories but I should like to emphasise to the Minister &mdash; and I am sure there are many people on low incomes in his constituency &mdash; that children's allowance is very important, particularly to women in the lower income group who depend on this money.  They draw it on a monthly basis and use it to purchase footwear, clothing and household goods.  To the lower income earners and the lower levels of social welfare recipients it often means that they can afford to buy a decent piece <Col N="610" /> of meat or provide a decent dinner for their children.  I think Deputy Mitchell referred on Second Stage to that aspect as the &ldquo;mince meat brigade&rdquo;.  Because of inflation the value of children's allowance has dropped something like 25 per cent in real terms.  If the allowance had kept pace with inflation that would at least have recognised the importance of this scheme.</P>
      <P>Children's allowance has another value and it is one which may not be recognised. It generates a large amount of employment because the women who traditionally collect this benefit use it much more wisely than their male counterparts in the purchase of manufactured goods. Therefore, the money is recycled back into the economy and this helps to create employment.  Because of inflation the value of the benefit is dropping rapidly and if it is not increased to a reasonable level the net result will be that in future budgets it will cease to be.  On the basis of that alone, we in the Labour Party indicated on Second Stage that we would oppose the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government that, when the question of social welfare is being considered again, an increase should be incorporated into a social welfare Bill under the child benefits section which would at least keep pace with inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of brief comments on the section of the Bill now under consideration and to refer in part to the amendments that have been tabled by The Workers' Party.  The question as to when payments and payment increases should date from is very important and it is a question which vexed the party who are now in Government when they were in Opposition.  It is a question I had an opportunity to speak on at public meetings in the constituency which I share with the Minister.  I listened to him voicing his dismay and at times, disgust at the practice introduced and pursued by the Coalition Government during the days in office of pushing back almost on a monthly basis the rates of increases, small though they were at the time, to the <Col N="611" /> unemployed and other people on social assistance.</P>
      <P>In addition, I listened to the commitment that on Fianna Fáil's return to Government he, as a member of that Government, would pursue a fair resolution and end to this practice and that without delay he would seek a return to the practice that pertained in this State for many decades.  It was only during this decade, if my memory serves me correctly, that for the first time this very dishonest practice of deferring increases in social welfare to later in the year was introduced.  It was always the practice that when an increase was due it would come in as early as was allowed when the Bills which facilitated that increase had passed through the Dáil.  This is a despicable practice and a very mean one when one considers the people who depend so much on the small amounts these increases represent.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to learn from the Minister the scale of the cost of these increases to the Exchequer and what makes it so difficult for the Government to introduce these increases at the time they are promised?  What makes it so difficult for the Minister for Social Welfare, who I know has a genuine concern, to have these increases introduced at the beginning of the financial year when they are promised and expected to be implemented?  The Minister stated that publicly and I accepted his word on it.  I am glad he is here in person so that I can remind him of the last meeting we had with the people of Darndale during the last election campaign when a strong indication, if not a commitment, was given that increases in social welfare would date from the time of their initial introduction, in other words, from the March-April period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, even the dates in the month of July are so selected as almost to run into August.  It reminds me of the pricing schemes in the larger supermarkets, where everything costs £4.99 and nothing is ever priced at £5, skillful selling schemes.  Here when we talk of 21, 25, 28 or 29 July, effectively <Col N="612" /> we are referring to August but it is never put as bluntly as that.  If it is to be the month of July why is the first week of July or the last week of June not chosen? Perhaps I would be complaining then that the Minister was dishonest by not mentioning July.</P>
    <P>Why are increases in payments made towards the end of the month?  What is the cost per week, as Deputy De Rossa has already asked?  The people who wait must wait at the behest of the Government for the hand-out.  The increases are worth very little.  In percentage terms they may represent a significant increase, but we do not need to be reminded that a small percentage of very little is even less in real terms.  Deputy Mitchell talked about relating social welfare deals to pay deals in terms of duration etc.  That would be all very well if there was any relationship in value in terms of these increases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no relationship in value in terms of a pay deal and a social welfare deal.  I think it would be very remiss of us if we did not use this annual debate to speak on behalf of the deprived and less well off in our community. It is essential that as often as possible we are in here debating, arguing and demanding on behalf of those who are so deprived and so poor that they must wait with a begging bowl, virtually, for the small amount put into it by way of the finance provisions contained in the social welfare Bills arising from the budgets on an annual basis.  I would be very slow to defer a debate or discussion on what should be done for these people for a period of 18 months to two or three years, depending on the scale of the deal ironed out.  We cannot speak often enough in this House about the needs of those people.  We are talking about an increase on a weekly basis &mdash; to again talk about the people in Darndale &mdash; equal to the cost of the return bus fare to the welfare department in the city centre. That is the average increase in real terms in the proposals contained in this section of the Bill.  It is miniscule.  It does add <Col N="613" /> up to millions.  It would be interesting to learn the scale of those increases and why the Minister could not bring them forward to April, as has been the practice for so long, and which the Minister promised in an election speech in the constituency would be his endeavour.  There must be a good reason because Deputy Woods is not a man who often stands back from a commitment he gives in public.  There must be very firm reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to refer to the changes in the date of implementation of benefits.  There has been a change and last year's suggested date was certainly brought forward to July from November.  When the Minister is answering Deputy De Rossa's question, I would like him to give us the figure for the cost of implementing the change and giving people the advantage of earlier benefit dates.  The cost must have been astronomical and I welcomed that measure at that time.  I am glad we were able to do so and I hope we will be able to continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions were raised. The question of children's allowance came up again on this section.  I wish to repeat a point I made last week because again we have had a highly emotive display with extreme cases being quoted. Today we were talking about well-off owners of stud farms.  I have seen TDs &mdash; and there are not too many who qualify as millionaires &mdash; at election time going on television, waving their hands and declaring to one and all: &ldquo;I do not need children's allowance.&rdquo;  I made a suggestion last week which I will repeat.  If there is any difficulty they should go to the nearest charity box and pop the money into it.  I do not think it is a balanced argument to quote extreme cases.  I mentioned last week that people were surveyed to find out if they could live on our salaries.  It was totally out of context, as they were asking people who might use it for pocket money.  Let them ask the ordinary guy who like the professional <Col N="615" /> politician has no other source of income, and they will get a balanced viewpoint. Today we were given an extreme case on the question of the PRSI and I do not want to see the same input into the question of children's allowance.  If we are having a debate on it, there are certain points which must be made.</P>
    <P>Probably the section most discriminated against in our community is the professional housewife, the woman who has made a conscious decision to stay at home and rear a family.  Very often the children's allowance is the only source of income that lady will have, regardless of the income coming into the house.  It is certainly the only money she will get directly for her own use, which she can call her own.  I would like people to remember that point when they start coming up with all sorts of cut-off points which would set up another tier of administration. That is an aside, because the points was brought up out of the blue and I did not expect it to come up on this section.  I do not want to see these arguments presented in the highly emotive fashion in which they were presented today.</P>
    <P>On the question of the changes of the rates in the Bill, the Minister is establishing a number of principles.  First, he is rationalising the rates.  If one looks at the rates for children's allowances, previously there were 38 different rates.  This was ludicrous from the point of view of administration as well as everything else. The Minister has now equalised the rates upwards and has ended up with 19 different rates for the different groups of people.  He has rationalised the system and cut the number of rates in half at a cost of £3 million.  This is important.  It is easy to go on an election platform and say this, that, or the other but the Minister had to come into this House and argue to find £3 million and to tell us to get rid of these 38 different rates of pay and to equalise.  Obviously he equalised upwards, as I would expect.  The problem with social welfare is that there are so many anomalies, different rates, means tests and so on.  The Minister has got <Col N="616" /> away from the across the board increase, which would have been 3 per cent this year.  To the least well off he has granted an 11 per cent increase in the personal rates in some cases and 6 per cent in others.  This is the kind of measure people referred to earlier but never implemented.  This move is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister maintained payments when it has been suggested that they should be cut off.  I was glad he granted the increases from the earlier date last year.  We could pluck any date out of the air and decide the increases should be granted from that date but, as Deputy Mitchell said, we have to work with what we have.  I was worried when the increases were granted in November but I accept that July is a reasonable date and I ask the Minister to stay with that date. All these matters should be recognised. As I said, the Minister has taken a reasonable date to pay the increases and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the increases generally, including the new rates of social insurance benefits and social assistance payments, in a full year is £101 million.  Deputy Bell asked about the cost of giving the increases in child benefit in line with inflation over the last two years. That came to £15 million.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned targeting and linking to wage agreements.  The Deputy recognised that a certain amount of targeting has been done and said he would like to see more.  I tried this year to target our resources to those in greatest need. Section 3 deals with the new rates for social insurance benefits.  There is a 3 per cent increase in the weekly personal adult and child dependant rates in both social insurance and occupational injuries benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new rates are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.  These levels of increase are in line with the Government's stated policy to maintain social welfare allowances in real terms and to ensure that the position of recipients is not eroded by inflation.  I would remind Deputies that <Col N="617" /> in these very difficult times there is considerable pressure for reductions, never mind increases, and the Government have maintained in real terms the value of these increases.  That has been done without any increase in the PRSI contribution rates.  I repeat that the Government have managed to maintain the real value of the existing payments without any increase in the PRSI contribution rate.  An old age pensioner with an adult dependant &mdash; where both are 66 years of age or over &mdash; will get an increase of £3 a week.  That is in line with inflation, which is anticipated to be of the order of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the date from which the increases will apply.  Deputy McCartan in particular said I had indicated that I was committed to the increases being paid earlier than November, the date proposed when we came into office.  As the Deputy will know, we brought this date forward from November to July and we are maintaining the July date this year, even in current difficult circumstances.  The cost of bringing the increases forward from November to July last year was between £19 million and £20 million.  I was asked what it would cost if we had introduced the increases from April.  In the current year that would cost approximately £31 million more, a substantial additional cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy said that increases must be looked at as part of the package we had for social welfare recipients.  An objective observer will recognise that we have got a very good package given the present circumstances, with the alleviating payments being maintained, a 3 per cent increase across the board, maintaining the July date and, at the same time, giving substantial increases to those in receipt of the lowest payments.  It is the total package which the Minister for Social Welfare is concerned with.  It is easy for a Deputy to pick out any part of that package and say the increase was not as large as he wished, but Deputies will recognise that we have introduced targeting to those in greatest need.  The point has been mentioned repeatedly in <Col N="618" /> this House, and I am sure most Deputies will support this move.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned linking social welfare increases to wage agreements. The Government's policy is to link social welfare increases to the cost of living, and ensuring that the position of those on social welfare is at least maintained. The Government have given a commitment to do this, and that is what we are doing in this Bill.  Wage agreements grant different levels of payments and there may be an agreement one year but not the next.  The Government's commitment is clearcut &mdash; to maintain the position of those on social welfare notwithstanding other developments, and to maintain the level of social welfare payments at least in line with inflation.  That is what we have done.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also referred to what he described as the phenomenon of going back to July.  Since 1984 July was the month when the increases came into effect.  In 1987 it was proposed to make the increases effective from November but when we took office we made them effective from July.  The same month has been chosen for the payment of the increases this year.  If one goes back far enough one will discover that the policy was to make the increases effective from the January following the budget.  We are continuing to pay the increases from July and, as I informed the House earlier, it is important to note that it would cost approximately £31 million extra to make the increases effective from April this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dennehy said that child dependant rates had been streamlined, that the number had been reduced.  That was in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare.  We have managed to go a good distance in implementing those recommendations.  This change involved an additional cost which the Government were prepared to meet. I hope in future to be able to get sufficient resources to go further towards meeting the general targets set by the commission. The increase in the unemployment benefit will be effective from 21 July &mdash; last year's increase was effective from 16 July.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> Broadly speaking, the increases will follow from the end of the third week in July.</P>

      <P>I do not have any wish to delay the House on this section which I support but I was glad to hear the Minister correct Deputy McCartan who spoke from the benches of The Workers' Party with the authority of an amadán in relation to social welfare.  He showed how little he knows about that system. For many years, as the Minister said, increases were not paid until the beginning of the year following the budget and in some years no increases were granted. Deputy McCartan when referring to the general increases suggested that they should be brought forward from July.  It should be borne in mind that in future years it may happen that increases will not be granted in social welfare.  That will happen unless we refine the social welfare system and redirect the resources.  I have searched in vain through the amendments for any reforming proposals from The Workers' Party so that we might give earlier and greater increases to those in need.  I am not surprised at the attitude of Deputy McCartan.  I suspect that he got his knowledge of the social welfare system as he browsed through the Bill on the deck of his yacht as it slunk out of Dún Laoghaire Harbour from the marina at the Royal St. George Yacht Club of which he is a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very pertinent to Deputy McCartan's understanding of the social welfare system and to where his knowledge comes from.  He attacked the performance of the Coalition Government, and this Government, on social welfare but the fact is that in the last four and a half years social welfare benefits were increased substantially in real terms.  I will not have Deputy McCartan, or any other member of the Royal St. George Yacht Club distorting the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> The Bill before us is the annual attempt to amend the social welfare regime. Members have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of that code in this debate and they are afforded another opportunity in the debate on the Estimate for the Department, something which Deputy McCartan seemed to overlook in his submission. With the sincerity that becomes a member of the Royal St. George Yacht Club he said that we would not have an opportunity to debate the social welfare code if a Bill like this was not introduced annually.  He seemed to think that giving us an opportunity to debate social welfare would solve all the problems.  I challenge Deputy McCartan, and the party of which he is a member, who call themselves The Workers' Party, to spell out whether they agree with percentage increases across the board which give the highest increases to those with most and the least increases to those with less. Annually they support across the board bonuses at Christmas time so that those with three or four pensions get the same bonus as those on supplementary welfare or in receipt of unemployment assistance. That is what we have done and what we continue to do.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the decision of the Minister to bring forward the increases last year to July, which I accept, but we did not hear that he chopped the special increase for those on unemployment assistance living alone.  I accept that the Minister has reintroduced that allowance this year and expanded the scheme.  I congratulate him on doing that.  If we are to address the question of poverty we need a workers' party who are more representative of the workers and their needs than those we have heard from the benches on my right today.</P>

Many of them sink themselves in debt at this time of the year.  Health boards should be <Col N="621" /> trying to help those families.  There is a need for liaison between the Ministers for Social Welfare and Health to try to alleviate the problems that many poor families face.</P>

I ask Deputy Mitchell to accept <Col N="622" /> that, the word &ldquo;untruths&rdquo;, has come to be acceptable here.  The three letter word is the one which we do not accept and that has not been used.  Perhaps Deputy McCartan, having made his point, would come to the requirements of the debate on section 3?</P>

      <P>As I say, this is something to which I have been subjected on many occasions by Deputy Mitchell.  I expect it again and for that reason I do not make a protest but just make the point.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question that the Deputy puts in relation to the position of The Workers' Party on social welfare, my party have very clearly put their position on the record of this House and elsewhere. In short, it is to accept and adopt the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare which his Government established and so quickly ignored after that establishment.  It is a somewhat vacant plea on the part of Deputy Mitchell and anybody in the Fine Gael Party to raise a concerned voice for those on the lower end of the scale.  We have time and again indicated to anybody who is prepared to listen our views with regard to the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a statement which is significant in the context of dates and increases, that there was pressure for reductions in social welfare benefits at this time.  This is a worrying aspect if that is the case.  The Minister suggested that what had been achieved in the context of a 3 per cent across-the-board increase was significant in these troubled times. That position has been presented to us time and time again but, in addition, he spoke of pressures that existed for actual reductions in the level of payments. These might well be achieved, and I concede that, on the basis of maintaining without any improvement, the level of increase which, in real terms, would have amounted to a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister explain to the House the type of pressures imposed upon him in reaching his decision with regard to the level of payments and the <Col N="623" /> dates upon which they would be introduced? Were they merely fiscal, Government indicated figures &mdash; for example, the departmental circular issued by the Taoiseach last June saying that each Department must introduce cutbacks? Was it intended, envisaged, or suggested that his Department should achieve these savings in expenditure by denying any real increase to those who are looking to him and his Department for preservation of their standard of living, however low?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware from his reading, which I am sure is quite extensive, that many economists and advocates of fiscal rectitude were proposing that we cut back on social welfare, as is happening across the water and in the Northern Six Counties.  Of course, in these times there is pressure for reductions in expenditure.  The Department of Social Welfare are spending £7 million a day, or £2,600 million a year.  The social insurance fund must receive a subsidy from the general taxpayer of approximately £401 million in the year, or approximately a 30 per cent contribution towards the cost of operating the fund, while the employers and employees make up the balance.  As the Deputy will be aware, none of these people, in the current circumstances, has more money readily to contribute, consequently there are and have been various kinds of pressures. Notwithstanding that general economic climate and those circumstances, this Government have maintained the basic position of those on social welfare with the objective of, at least, maintaining their <i>status quo</i> and targeting any additional resources that can be got towards those in greatest need.  This is the right policy for the present time and it received a good deal of support in the House.  I have pointed out that the 3 per cent, with the rate of inflation at 2.5 per cent, slightly more than does what we have spoken about.  It is true that over the last number of years the previous Government also tried, at least, to maintain the value against the rate of inflation over the general range of increases.  I am <Col N="624" /> sure that social welfare recipients will be very glad to know that there is support in the House on all sides for that policy, although in present circumstances this is a costly operation particularly when there is so much unemployment.  This naturally reduces the numbers contributing and increases the number of beneficiaries. This section of the Bill deals with the social insurance side and the new rates. People will say that it is only an extra £3 for two people or £1.80 and I accept Deputy McCartan's point about the cost of travel to collect unemployment benefit. I shall be giving my consideration to that cost and trying to reduce it.  In circumstances where all the social insurance schemes are being maintained &mdash; and slightly more than maintained in effect &mdash; old age pensioners, widows, those on invalidity pensions and those who are dependent on the social insurance fund for benefits will be happy that the position is solidly held.  The fund has the objective of maintaining its solvency, and the Government must maintain their solvency.  To do that means the taxpayer putting up £401 million.</P>
      <P>When we come to the next section which deals with assistance schemes, it will become very clear that we have done a great deal of targeting at considerable extra expense in the current year, even in the present economic climate.  Notwithstanding the various economic and financial pressures and difficulties of the present time, we have maintained the position of those who are dependent on the social insurance fund.  Of course, many would like to do more and I will be keeping my eye on the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I will be attempting to achieve any of the targets possible in that area.  Indeed, if anyone objectively examines the progress made to date, they will recognise that we are making considerable progress in relation to the targets set.  We have taken quite a number of steps to improve the circumstances of those who depend on social welfare as set out in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the law in regard to the consumption and sale of alcoholic drinks by and to persons under the age of 18 years.  It is now 64 years since the law relating to the availability of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 was amended. In that time there has been a vast increase in the consumption of alcohol generally but especially among young people in their teens.</P>
      <P>There are three main aspects to the Bill, first, the sale of alcoholic drinks to persons under the age of 18 years, secondly, the purchasing of alcoholic drinks by or on behalf of persons under the age of 18 and, thirdly, the Bill gives new powers to a member of the Garda Síochána to seize bottles or other containers, which he has reasonable cause to think contain intoxicating liquor, from persons under the age of 18 where the garda concerned suspects that an offence under sections 5, 6 or 7 of the Bill has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Members of the House will agree that the increase in the consumption of alcohol has had devastating consequences for a considerable percentage of the population, particularly among young people.  Let me give some examples.  In Britain every year ten times as many young people die from alcohol abuse as from the illicit use of drugs.  In one youth custody centre in England, they discovered that more than half of the yearly in take of inmates had drink as <Col N="626" /> a factor in their crimes.  We have no reason to think that the situation disclosed by these facts would be any different in this country.</P>
    <P>I urge that more resources be made available to enable better research to be carried out in relation to this serious problem.  It is right and proper, therefore, that the law in this area should be amended to deal with the realities of the eighties as they apply to young people drinking.  Under existing law, it is an offence to sell or supply intoxicating liquor to young persons under the age of 18 years.  However, the reality is that in practice it is impossible to enforce this law because of the requirement contained in the 1924 Act whereby the person selling or supplying the alcoholic drink did so knowing that the person to whom he was supplying it was under the age of 18.  As the House will readily agree, this in practice makes it almost impossible to prove that the drink was sold knowing that the person was under 18.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes it an offence to sell or supply intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 unless the person selling or supplying the alcohol has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom he sold or supplied the alcoholic drink was over the age of 18 years.  I appreciate that this will perhaps impose an extra strain on publicans but we are dealing with a serious problem and it is only right and proper that those who sell alcohol should have a responsibility towards young people and make every effort to ensure that those under 18 years are not sold alcoholic liquor.  A publican's defence will now be that he had reasonable grounds to assume that the person to whom he sold alcohol was over 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Times have changed since the 1924 Act in so far as the pattern of social behaviour among young people is entirely different. Pressures on them have greatly increased and young people have much more money to spend on alcohol.  They are also much less closely supervised by their parents and all these factors influence drinking practices and patterns among <Col N="627" /> the young.  In many cases, sadly, they lead to crime and vandalism, low performance at school and other social problems all leading, ultimately, to a deterioration in the health of the nation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will have come across, in their own constituencies, the problems resulting from so-called drink parties which are often held on open spaces, and the results arising from them.  The parties go on late at night and into the next morning and members of the Garda Síochána who have been called to many of these parties told me that they can involve children as young as ten years of age.  Apart altogether from the obvious consequences to the children themselves arising from these parties, the community at large, especially elderly people, feel very threatened and complain bitterly that nothing is being done to address the problem.  I have tried to remedy this in the Bill and I will explain those provisions later.  The regular spate of car thefts and joy riding episodes show in many cases that those involved had been engaged earlier in heavy drinking.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I was at a public meeting in my own constituency and it was one of the largest meetings I had attended for a long time.  The hall was packed with parents who were extremely concerned about the incidence of what they described as cider parties but which I call drink parties because, in fairness, from the statistics I have seen, the consumption of beer and spirits among young people is higher than cider.  It is incorrect to imply that only cider is drunk and that, therefore, it is more appropriate to call them drink parties.  It was frustrating, as a public representative, to listen to groups of parents expressing grave concern about the fact that these parties were being held and that when gardaí arrived very little could be done.  The consequences of these parties, from the stories residents told us, are vandalism and people in fear in their homes.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute published a paper in 1986 which contained some alarming statistics in relation to under-age drinking.  I should <Col N="628" /> like to give some examples.  From those surveyed, nearly 18 per cent of 13 year olds or younger regarded themselves as regular drinkers and nearly 44 per cent of 15 year olds regarded themselves likewise. Today, these frightening figures have not improved, I suggest they have got worse.  I received a small document from the Irish National Council on Alcohol which discloses some other alarming facts.  A survey was carried out in Galway in 1987 among 262 young people aged 14 to 17 and some interesting comparisons were revealed; 13.2 years was the average age at which the first alcoholic drink was taken with 82.2 per cent consuming their first drink before 15 years and 9.2 per cent of ten year olds were doing likewise; 91.5 per cent of under age drinkers bought alcohol themselves without any form of false identification; 28.8 per cent took alcohol from home without their parents' knowledge and 23.7 per cent obtained drink from friends.  Surely there is a need to remove the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; when one can see from a survey of 262 young people in Galway&mdash;this is not just a Dublin problem &mdash; that 91.5 per cent of under-age drinkers bought alcohol themselves without any form of false identification.  Those facts and figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and with some justification in certain areas, that young people have very few places to go except into pubs, in other words, that there is nothing for them to do.  Unfortunately, there is a limited number of very unscrupulous publicans who are prepared to sell as much drink as they can to young people without worrying about the consequences of their actions.  In tightening up the laws relating to under-age drinking we should also face up to our responsibility in seeing to it that facilities are provided for young people to make it less attractive for them to find their way into the pubs.  In saying this I appeal to school authorities to reappraise the policy of the use of school facilities after school hours so that whatever sporting facilities there are in such buildings can be used to the full.  I would hope also that the schools would have a realistic programme of <Col N="629" /> teaching young people how to handle alcohol and to point out the consequences of excessive drinking at an early age.  A lot could be done also in relation to sports clubs and here the national lottery can play a very important part.  To established sports clubs and youth clubs in parishes and communities throughout the country, moneys should be allocated to improve facilities and to make it more attractive for young people to join these clubs and associations and to avail of the healthy activities provided by them.</P>
    <P>I received a very charming letter from six young children from St. Joseph's primary school, Tivoli Road, Dún Laoghaire, wishing me every success with this Bill.  They also sent me a copy of The Universe dated 4 March 1988 which contained a very worth-while suggestion. These young people asked me if I would be so kind as to raise this matter to see if something could be done in regard to it. It is a fact whether we like to believe it or not that the atmosphere of pubs is very attractive to young people and why should we be surprised that they enjoy going to them?  The suggestion, which could be taken up by the drinks industry, especially the soft drinks industry, is that there should be developed the concept of non-alcoholic pubs for teenagers.  This idea could be taken up, too, by youth clubs etc. across the land.  In other words, there is no reason the drinks companies could not try to create a pub atmosphere where people could go to listen to disco music, sit about and have a chat, the only difference being that they would be taking non-alcoholic drinks as distinct from alcoholic drinks.  I think that is something we should consider.  I appeal, therefore, to the drinks industry and to sporting clubs to think along these lines in future.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the solution to under-age drinking is not just changing the law but facing up to our responsibilities in providing proper alternative means of recreation for young people, and we have very few excuses for not doing this now that the national lottery is in place.  After all, the original concept <Col N="630" /> of the national lottery was to provide moneys for sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will see that this Bill refers only to drinking by under-age persons in licensed premises and in public places.  It does not in any way impose on the privacy of the home where it should be the responsibility of the parents to supervise the drinking habits of their children and to educate them in the proper use of alcoholic drink.</P>
    <P>Since I announced the provisions contained in this Bill over a week ago there has been some discussion in the media with regard to the use of ID cards.  I want to make it quite clear that there is no provision in this Bill for the use of ID cards.  However, I feel that this is a broader issue worth closer examination and exploration.  There is a lot to be said for the use of such identity cards but I would hope that the discussion would continue and that the debate will be a rational and reasonable one, not one which plays on people's fears and phobias. There is nothing inherently sinister about identity cards, they are in common use every day of the week, for example, student cards, cheque-bank cards, credit cards, security cards issued in public buildings, library cards, etc.</P>

      <P>There is one, Minister. We all have PRSI numbers.  We have a PAYE number and we have a number on our passports.  What is the mystery about having a number that identifies a card.  I have heard long discussions about identity cards for young people to deal with the problem of under age drinking.  My response to the journalist who asked me whether I was making provision for identity cards in this legislation was that you cannot put in a provision for identity cards without deciding who issues them and how <Col N="631" /> that is to be supervised.  Why should you ask somebody from nought to 18 years of age to carry an identity card and when they reach 18 to throw it away?  That is the greatest insult to young people that I can imagine.  If you want identity cards you must think the matter through.  Let us think about it in a rational and reasonable way, let us not play on people's fears and phobias, let us not suggest that I and others are thinking about a police State. I have no desire whatever to impose on people's privacy.  If you have identity cards or identity numbers it is up to us as legislators to make certain that the State will not impose on our privacy or start gathering information that could be used for all other purposes.  I do not think there is anything wrong in having a proper constructive debate on this issue without playing on people's fears and phobias.</P>
      <P>The experience of many western countries has shown that the use of identity cards can be extremely beneficial in terms of convenience to the citizen and in various commercial and business transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to outline to the House the main provisions of the Bill. I will deal with the principal sections. Section 3 deals with the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of 18.  Subsection (1) of this section states that the holder of any licence shall not sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18; shall not sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption on his licensed premises by a person under the age of 18; shall not permit a person under the age of 18 to consume intoxicating liquor on his licensed premises or permit any person to supply a person under the age of 18 with intoxicating liquor on his licensed premises.  Subsection (2) obliges the holder of a licence of any licensed premises not to sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to any person for consumption off his licensed premises by a person under the age of 18 in any place other than a private residence, and subsection (3) outlines the penalties that apply if a <Col N="632" /> holder of a licence contravenes subsections (1) or (2).  Subsection (4) is important, as there is a major change here from what was previously in the 1924 Act.  In this subsection it is stated that in any proceedings against a person for a contravention of subsections (1) or (2) of this section, it shall be a defence for such person to prove that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person in respect of whom he is alleged to have committed the offence was over the age * of 18.  The main difference here is that I have removed the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; which is in the 1924 Act, thus transferring the burden of proof.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the provision of intoxicating liquor for persons under the age of 18.  Under this section it will be an offence to purchase intoxicating liquor for delivery to or consumption by a person under the age of 18 in any place other than a private residence, or to deliver intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 in any place other than a private residence, or to send a person under the age of 18 to any place where intoxicating liquor is sold, delivered or distributed for the purpose of obtaining intoxicating liquor.  Subsection (2) of this section outlines the penalties to be imposed on conviction.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes it an offence for any person under the age of 18 to purchase intoxicating liquor or to consume intoxicating liquor in any place other than a private residence.  It will also be an offence for any person to represent himself, for the purpose of obtaining or being permitted to consume intoxicating liquor, to be over the age of 18.</P>
    <P>Section 8 makes it an offence for a licence holder to allow a child under 15 years to be in the bar of his licensed premises.  It will not be an offence to permit a child under 15 to be there between 10.30 a.m. and 8 p.m. provided the child is accompanied by his parent or guardian.  I think this is a reasonable exception, especially in the summer months when people on holiday may want to drop into a pub for a drink or some food.  For the children it takes away any mystery about what is inside the <Col N="633" /> doors of a pub.  Exceptions are provided for children of the licence holder and for children who are resident in the licensed premises, or simply passing through the bar.</P>
    <P>Section 9 imposes restrictions on persons under the age of 18 being on licensed premises during extended hours.  It will be an offence for a person under the age of 18 years to be on a licensed premises at any time during the period in respect of which an exemption order was granted.</P>
    <P>Section 10 imposes restrictions on persons under the age of 18 being on premises used for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption off the premises.  It will not be an offence for that person to be on the licensed premises if he is accompanied by his parent or guardian.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is important.  It deals primarily with the powers of a member of the Garda Síochána in relation to certain offences.  It gives him the power to confiscate any bottle or container which he has reasonable cause to believe contains intoxicating liquor from persons under the age of 18 and which is in their possession in a public place.  I referred to this problem earlier in the context of the so-called drink parties.  If a garda is called to one of these parties and he suspects a person under the age of 18 to be in possession of alcoholic drink, he will be enabled to seize the container or bottle from that person.  That is one way of dealing with the problem caused by these activities.</P>
    <P>Section 12 prohibits the employment of persons under the age of 18 years on any licensed premises except those who are directly related to the holder of a licence, in which case the minimum age is 16 years.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states that in relation to the proof of age of an under-age person in a prosecution under this Bill where such a person appears to the court to have been under the age of 18 years, or 15 years as the case may be, at the date of the commission of the offence, such person will be presumed to have been under that age at that date, unless the contrary is proved.  This is an important change.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 4 of the <Col N="634" /> Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904.  The main provision under this section prohibits the sale or supply of alcoholic drinks in club premises to any person under the age of 18 years.  It also prohibits any person under the age of 18 being admitted as a member of a club unless the club is one primarily devoted to sporting purposes</P>
    <P>I ask all parties to support this Bill.  I would be pleased to listen to constructive suggestions which could improve it.  With due respect to the Minister, it is a good idea to have separate legislation dealing with the problem of under-age drinking. Combining new provisions in an overall intoxicating liquor Bill which would deal with other issues such as licensing laws would take away from the seriousness of this problem.  This is not a matter on which we wish to score political points. Legislation in relation to under-age drinking should be looked at from time to time, updated and changed if necessary to meet the circumstances.  I ask Members to consider having separate legislation to cover this issue.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Barrett for his initiative in bringing forward this Bill and thank him for allowing me some of his time.  I sympathise with the Minister for Justice in that this is a very difficult area in which to legislate effectively. There is a minefield of anomalies when one considers the extent and range of our licensing laws.  This Bill should be seen not only as being relevant to the problem of under-age drinking but also as part of the process which is necessary in the codification and updating of the liquor licensing laws.  These laws date back several hundred years and very little has been done in the past 50 years because of the difficulties encountered legislatively and the vested interests on either side of the divide in the drink business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is quite serious and has grown in extent in the past few years because of the changing social scene and the liberalisation of attitudes to alcohol, <Col N="635" /> influenced not only by the media, particularly television, but also by peer pressure. I have spoken to juvenile liaison officers, young people, teachers and parents and one of the principal points with which young people fail to deal and which their elders fail to grasp properly is the extent of peer pressure.  If one talks to them in their classrooms they are all right individually, but when they are brought in numbers to areas where drink is involved it is incredibly difficult for them individually to refuse to join the pack.  They fall victim to peer pressure.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that our image abroad is associated with drink and derogatory remarks have been made about us over the years in this respect.  I have worked in England and have been in the various taverns in Cricklewood and Camden Town on Friday and Saturday nights when friends, neighbours and emigrants gather there.  I also have to say that I found myself outside the Crown on Monday mornings, when the head may not have been so good, and suddenly realising the consequences of peer pressure.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a Government to legislate effectively in an area such as this.  We have a tendency to legislate for everything, but to legislate effectively requires a different approach.  For instance, marijuana, cocaine and heroin are banned, yet in some areas it appears that they can be more easily obtained than chocolates.  Banning the sale of drink from particular outlets is one approach; whether it can be effectively implemented or not is another matter.  In commending Deputy Barrett for drawing up this Bill, I would like to say he has tackled the kernel of the problem in relation to under-age drinking by removing the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from the relevent section.  Obviously, this word has caused a great number of difficulties in cases where young people have been served drink.  I commend him for his courage in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to identity cards and in that respect the Minister may be aware of a scheme which was operated <Col N="636" /> in County Mayo by the Vocational Education Committee.  They provided identity cards for young people and I have to say that these were effective where the scheme was properly supervised and implemented.  The scheme however did not take into account those who arrived in County Mayo from outside the jurisdiction for festive occasions or those who travelled to County Mayo from other counties.  This Bill places a responsibility on the publican to find out whether the person concerned is under or over 18 years of age.  At discos or festive occasions everybody is over 18 years of age, or so they say.  I have spoken to publicans who implemented this scheme rigorously under proper supervision and who tried to implement it in the best way possible but there are always cases where commonsense must prevail.  In cases where five or six people over the age of 18 years drive over 40 miles to a festive occasion bringing one person under 18 years of age with them, a publican out of a sense of courtesy and trust might let that person into some social occasion and yet might find himself being fined for doing so.  In relation to identity cards all that I can say is that in the area which I represent this scheme was a success and is well worth looking at.</P>
    <P>There is a distinct difference between urban and rural areas in so far as drink, public houses and social occasions are concerned.  One can picture a husband and wife arriving in a town on a Saturday morning to do their week's shopping, bringing three or four children with them. The husband goes off to buy his shoes and the wife goes to do her shopping with very often the children being left in a public house under the supervision of a friend or an acquaintance.  Given the individual cases which arise in rural Ireland every day of the week it is very difficult to legislate effectively for this kind of occasion.  There are then weddings, football matches and social occasions of all descriptions.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Barrett had said, there is a clear need for an education programme in our schools.  Obviously, moderation and discipline are necessary.  Teachers in <Col N="637" /> a civics programme or in the general area of education should see to it that their students are given the facts on alcohol in this regard.  As I have said, peer pressure is the main reason why young people start drinking.  Some parents, a minority admittedly, have shown an appalling lack of responsibility in not wanting to find out in what activities, and with whom, their children are engaged.  A great number of the young people who take alcoholic drink do so without their parents knowing.  This is something to be deplored.  In the context of Deputy Barrett's call for an expansion of the soft drinks business, the no name clubs which were operated as an experiment around the country were quite successful and this is something which should be considered.</P>
    <P>Once again, I commend Deputy Barrett for his initiative in bringing this Bill before the House.  This matter is a source of serious concern in terms of the personal development of young people.  Our image abroad has not risen greatly recently but at least in this area we can attempt to remedy the problems by legislating effectively.</P>

      <P>I wish to commend Deputy Barrett for the contribution he has made here this evening and for the manner in which he made that contribution, and Deputy Kenny for the manner in which he assisted Deputy Barrett.  I would like to say I welcome the points which were made by them.</P>
      <P>It is generally acknowledged that under-age drinking is a serious problem in this country and, therefore, any constructive efforts to deal with it must be welcomed.  For some time now, I have been concerned to establish how best to tackle this problem, so far as this can be done by amending legislation.  From the examination which I have made, I am of the opinion that amending legislation can contribute to the fight against under-age drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that Deputy Barrett's Bill follows the lines of Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1986, which lapsed with the dissolution of the 24th Dáil.  I have carried out an extensive review of <Col N="638" /> that Bill and a limited number of other relevant aspects of the intoxicating liquor legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been my intention, as soon as my consultations with a wide range of groups interested in the Licensing Acts were completed, to seek Government approval to present my own Intoxicating Liquor Bill to the Dáil.  The House will be pleased to know that the heads of this Bill, which will be known as the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988, have already been approved by the Government.  The Bill is now being drafted and it is my intention to have it ready for presentation to the Dail soon after Easter.  For obvious reasons I cannot divulge the precise nature of the changes to be proposed in advance of publication of the Bill but I can say, however, that the Government's Bill will include provisions aimed at curbing under-age drinking, as well as provisions to deal with a range of other important aspects of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>Since tonight's debate is concerned only with under-age drinking, I will restrict the remainder of my comments to that important subject.  First of all, I would like to say that, while I consider that a more general approach to the amendment of the licensing laws is appropriate, there is little in the particular provisions of Deputy Barrett's Bill with which I could not agree.  Any differences I would have would be on matters of detail.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is clear that we have an under-age drinking problem in this country.  I also have no doubt that legislation will improve matters.  However, I would remind Deputies of the old saying that one cannot legislate for virtue.  What legislation can do is to make it more difficult for under-age persons to obtain drink directly &mdash; whether from pubs, clubs, discos, off-licensed premises or wherever else it can be obtained.  Legislation can also make it more difficult for young persons to obtain alcohol through third parties.  Enforcement can be made easier by removing obstacles which would hinder the Garda in their difficult task of detecting and prosecuting breaches of the law.  Legislation can also provide a <Col N="639" /> realistic range of penalties where persons have been convicted of breaking the law.</P>
    <P>In other words, legislation can provide a framework with which society can identify and within which it knows it has the support and backing of the entire State apparatus.  Of course, the law must be fair to all, and it must be enforceable, or else it quickly falls into disrepute. There is a tendency in some instances to put all the blame for under-age drinking on licensees, whether publicans, off-licence owners or the owners of licensed hotels or restaurants, and to demand punitive legislation against such people.</P>
    <P>In fact, I am happy that most of those involved in the liquor business are responsible people, but there are some &mdash; a small minority &mdash; who in their anxiety to make money have no scruples as to the age or condition of people to whom they sell drink.  Even a tiny minority of such people can cause enormous damage because it quickly becomes known to under-age people in the area that there are premises where they can get drink with little difficulty.  We have to stop those practices without at the same time penalising the law-abiding licensees who, as I have said, form the great majority in the drinks trade.  We have to be mindful also that drinking moderately is a normal social activity and we must be careful that, while recognising its potential for harm, we do not marginalise it or turn it into some type of quasi-legal practice. The problem is the abuse of alcohol and not alcohol itself.</P>
    <P>We can, therefore, as legislators, do a certain amount to curb under-age drinking. But legislation alone will never solve the problem.  The only way to do that is through a concerted effort at every level in society to confront the problems caused by alcohol abuse.  One will not solve the problem of under-age drinking while there is large-scale alcohol abuse by adults.  However, conversely, if we can curb abuses of alcohol by persons who are under 18 this will help to mitigate excessive drinking by older age-groups and especially by young adults.  Bad habits learnt young can last a lifetime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> On the other hand, responsible attitudes acquired at a young age can also be lasting.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, in this country, we have tended to extend a good deal of tolerance towards people who over-indulge in alcohol. While attitudes are changing, it may be that we are still, as a society, too lenient in our attitudes to drink abuse.  I suppose much of this tolerance has to do with our Christian traditions and sympathetic attitudes towards persons experiencing problems in their personal lives.  But that sympathy is misplaced where it helps to shield those who drink to excess from the awful consequences of such abuse.</P>
    <P>Thus, a too lenient approach to drink abuse by workmates who fill in for those who are constantly absent from work because of it, ultimately does no favours to the victim himself.  We do no favours to persons who drive cars while under the influence of drink, or to their victims, by our tolerance for such anti-social behaviour. We certainly do no favours to families affected by alcoholism or the hospitals and health services which have to cope with its manifestations.  As a society, we should do everything we can to discourage attitudes which help to give rise to such problems and actively encourage the people affected to seek assistance. Of course, we should do everything possible to meet the problem by amending legislation in so far as that can help.</P>
    <P>I could speak at great length about the problem of drink abuse generally but I am only mentioning it tonight to set in context the influences which prompt young people to start experimenting with alcohol.  Many of those who over-indulge in alcohol, or simply accord it a disproportionately important place in their lives by, for example, spending long hours in licensed premises every night of the week, are themselves parents.  Perhaps they should ask themselves more frequently how their behaviour influences their childrens' lives as they grow up.  It is no use for parents to complain about their adolescent childrens' drinking, <Col N="641" /> while blaming it on lack of adequate legislation or lack of non-alcoholic social outlets for young people, if they themselves are actively giving bad example through their own drinking habits.  It is even worse for parents not to confront their childrens' drinking where they know or suspect it is going on.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, therefore, under-age drinking has to be tackled by parents through good example in the home and elsewhere.  Parents can also do a great deal by helping their children to become involved in activities and entertainments in which alcohol plays no part.  In the home and in the community, the good example and responsible life-styles of the parents are of paramount importance. Parents and the community generally should, of course educate children to the dangers of alcohol abuse.  However, the primary and continuing responsibility must remain with parents.  If responsible attitudes are inculcated in the home, we can hope to deal successfully with the problem of under-age drinking.  If that is not done, legislation can only be of limited assistance.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I cannot reveal at this stage the details of the impending Government legislation to amend the licensing laws but in general principle, I find little to disagree with in the provisions of the Bill before us tonight.  As was the case with the lapsed 1986 Bill, Deputy Barrett's Bill provides for the deletion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from sections 10 and 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924.  It also bans the sale of alcohol from off-licences to persons under the age of 18.  New offences created would outlaw the purchase of alcohol by persons under 18 and its consumption by those persons in a public place.  For some time now, these aspects have been the main targets of campaigners for reform of the law on under-age drinking and anyone preparing a Bill to tackle the problem in a serious way would have to deal with those matters as a starting point.</P>
    <P>In view of the impending Government legislation I will be listening with interest to all the comments and suggestions <Col N="642" /> made in this debate.  The Bill now before the House will, I trust, serve a useful purpose in eliciting the views of Deputies as to what can be done by way of legislation to deal with the serious problem of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>In reply to one point raised by Deputy Kenny, I appreciate the consideration for what I am trying to do in bringing legislation before the House.  I thought it would have been an easier task than it is, after a number of months trying to get legislation to where it is at the present time, and I hope to have it ready in a matter of days in the new term.  There are many and varying interests involved in this area and one has to be like Solomon in one's approach to ensure that effective legislative proposals can be brought before the House, proposals which will be seen to be fair and which will cater for the good of the community. That is my only purpose in delay, to date.</P>
    <P>I say that with the greatest sincerity.  I am not saying it by way of reply to criticisms levelled at me yesterday by people involved in one of the groups.  No group in the liquor trade can take it upon themselves to think they have a right to draft the legislation.  The legislative proposals that come to this House will be here for the type of debate we are having here tonight.  Everybody in this House will be as well informed as I am on the problems we have to deal with.  We are all very familiar with this area and if amendments are put forward by any Member of this House that can be shown as better than what is in the Bill or can improve what is in the Bill I will welcome them.  If the combined wisdom of all the Members of this House can give us effective legislation to deal with the problems we all know exist, legislation that is enforceable &mdash; and that is an important aspect of it &mdash; I will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I take the point Deputy Barrett made here tonight on the question of criticisms that have been levelled at him unfairly to date in regard to identification cards.  If matters have to be discussed we can do it here and I welcome any matter Deputy Barrett will put forward for discussion in <Col N="643" /> that and any other areas.  I am as conscious as any other Member of this House of a feeling, real or imaginary, that big brother is watching if we have indentification cards and I would resent being watched by big brother as much as would anybody else in this House.  We might get over that difficulty by perhaps not having an identification card but something like voluntary age of majority card.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that as long as the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is in that legislation as it is to date we cannot hope to enforce legislation effectively to help to curb under-age drinking.  I hope that during the course of this debate we will have the views of everybody and anybody and that practically every Member of this House will contribute because we all are or should be concerned about this matter. The Bill affects all sections of our community right across the board.</P>
    <P>Again I thank Deputy Barrett for giving us this opportunity.  I find no area where I am in any disagreement with him except perhaps on small detail.  I look forward to a worth-while debate on Deputy Barrett's proposals within a week or two of the start of the new term when I hope to come before the House with the Government's proposals covering the area.  I would welcome help and support from all sides of the House in getting worth-while legislation on the Statute Book updating legislation which is 40 or 50 years old. That is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the thanks of the House are due to Deputy Seán Barrett for introducing this Bill and I welcome the very balanced response and assessment the Minister has given in his comments on the Bill.  He has given a very good analysis of the situation as we have to face it.  I do not envy him his task in piloting through a comprehensive measure encompassing the whole field of intoxicating liquor law.  That is a minefield and contains legislation going back to the time of Charles II or even earlier perhaps.  In the last Dáil I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation who were conducting an <Col N="644" /> inquiry for quite some time.  Many Members here were members of that committee.  We had quite a number of oral hearings and took evidence from all sorts of interested parties including the Mayo group referred to by Deputy Kenny.  Even though I practise law, that brought home to me what a minefield the whole area is.  The legislation is a major matter and will be a major undertaking both for the parliamentary draftsman to prepare it and the Minister to pilot the comprehensive measure through the House.  I assure him of the full support of the Labour Party in bringing forward meaningful, enforceable legislation in that respect and I look forward to seeing the Bill when it appears.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill is much more limited in its extent.  It seeks just to deal with under-age drinking.  Perhaps we should at least proceed with Deputy Barrett's Bill and process it through as many Stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas as may be appropriate until it might be overtaken by a more comprehensive measure of the Minister's.  It may well be that the Minister's measure will be deferred or delayed by pressures of Dáil time or whatever and I would like to see at least under-age drinking tackled even only as an interim basis perhaps to be superseded in a year or so by the Minister's measure. The Minister indicated that his Bill will include the whole spectrum of the law in this regard and it might take a considerable time to process that through both Houses.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of what the Minister said.  There is no good in bringing in a law unless it can be enforced.  We have laws, particularly in the under-age drinking field and theoretically it ought to be possible for the Garda to deal with that situation superficially.  The reality is different and it brings the whole of the law into disrepute when publicans and others can disregard the main thrust of intent of the law there, which is to curb under-age presence in pubs and the ready availability of alcohol to young people under age in both licensed and off-licence premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett's Bill in effect appears <Col N="645" /> to place the onus of proof on the publican. It provides that it is an offence if he supplies drink to a person who turns out to be under the age of 18.  That is a reversal of the normal procedures in the criminal law under which the intent has to be there on the part of the person accused, but there are special cases where that normal situation has to be reversed. It is not unusual so far as offences under the Children Acts are concerned.  Other offences already exist under the Children Acts where the presumption is that the person is under the age of 18 unless the contrary is proved.  The same is sought to be done here.  It is a fair and balanced way of tackling the problem and is reasonable enough.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about identity cards, although we heard representations from the Mayo group in oral evidence before the Oireachtas committee and I was very impressed at the way those people were tackling the situation in Mayo, which gave me considerable food for thought.  It would be a nice idea if we could bring that in in some acceptable way countrywide, but I have some reservations about it.  However, those people are doing a great job on that issue in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The Bill strikes the right balance.  We have to tackle the problem.  We cannot let it soldier on as it has been going on. I cannot and do not purport to speak for the rural areas referred to by Deputy Kenny but I understand the situations he described in rural towns.  I do not know whether it will be possible to work into the legislation some way to cope with that but it should not be beyond the bounds of drafting ingenuity to do so.  In the general Dublin area certain public house establishments hold themselves out as and are known to be places where young people will go who are under age and well under age and there is no problem and that is recognised and accepted.  That is totally unacceptable and must be tackled and dealt with.  The Garda have done their best but they are in a hopeless situation as the law stands at present.  We have to give them the means to tackle <Col N="646" /> this.  As the Minister said, the drinking habits formed by many in their younger years lead them to become hardened drinkers later, leading to all sorts of appalling problems in adult drinking with broken homes, beatings, wife beating, and all these things leading on to crime and so on.</P>
    <P>I am often amazed at the ambivalent attitude we have here to alcohol.  We tend to draw a distinction between alcohol on the one hand and drugs on the other.  The reality is that there is no difference. Alcohol is a drug and there is no question about it.  I have discussed the matter with many medical people and many regard alcohol as more of a drug problem than marijuana or pot and possibly even than heroin.  I would posit the position to the House that more misery, more crime, more upset and more physical abuse leading to illness and death from alcohol related diseases is caused by alcohol abuse than is caused by drug abuse.  Yet we have been traditionally ambivalent about it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is not enough to come in here and say we must bring the hammer down on this situation where young people are concerned.  We have to do more than that.  We have not adequately lived up to our responsibilities over the years.  We have a responsibility in the education field, through the schools, that we have never met.  The Minister is right in saying that the primary responsibility lies with parents.  I can say, as a parent, that it is not an easy responsibility to meet.  Deputy Kenny was absolutely right when he talked about peer pressure.  I know from personal experience that it is a very real and difficult thing to cope with.  That is not to decry the element of parental responsibility.  It is there and it is very important.  But we have not made available in the schools sufficient in the way of a health education programme, either in the primary schools or, more particularly, in the post-primary schools.  The Minister should have a number of serious discussions with the other Departments concerned in this, such as the Department of Education, <Col N="647" /> leading to the provision of a proper health education programme in all schools, not just in some.  I know it is provided in some schools and a fine job is being done. But this programme should be broadly based in all the primary and post-primary schools.  Resources should be made available through the Department of Education to have courses, talks and seminars given to the children to explain the situation and what it means in relation to their health as young people and later on as adults.  We have failed badly in that regard.  Yet this is a very important part of the battle against under-age drinking. It is a tough battle, and even with the legislation behind us it will still be a tough battle to fight.  That is one aspect of what we have to do.</P>
    <P>No less important is ensuring that the State makes available the necessary alternatives to the social pull of the teenage drinking establishments centred on the relatively low number of pubs that are the centres for this activity.  A number of community halls and community centres, not enough, have been provided in some areas.  But they do not meet what is needed so far as teenage drinking is concerned. Those community halls, many built with the excellent help provided through AnCO and through grants from local authorities and, to some extent, from central funds, tend to be sport orientated; they tend to be bare halls &mdash; and I do not decry their importance &mdash; for sporting purposes.  But they are not the alternative that is necessary to the social cosy atmosphere that is presented in the pubs where young people congregate.  A different kind of set-up is required with smaller rooms, carpeted and comfortable, where billiards or cards could be played and films seen, in a comfortable social setting, in a comfortable social centre.  That kind of setting has to be provided where there are concentrations of youth.  This may sound a bit airy fairy in times of financial constraint but if we want to tackle this problem this is one way to do it.  It is a very serious problem and a growing one.  The incidence of adult alcoholism is, unfortunately, on the <Col N="648" /> increase as is juvenile drinking.  It is taking a serious toll on our young people and on the adult population.  The numbers disclosed in the reports are quite frightening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny touched on the rural situation.  One survey tested out the situation regarding the availability of drink to young people.  He organised a group of 14 and 15 year olds and sent them watched, unknown to the publicans concerned, around the various drinking establishments in a number of rural towns.  They were refused drink in a few of the establishments but in most of them they had no problem in getting all the drink they wanted served to them.</P>
    <P>If we want to tackle the overall problem of alcoholism we have to tackle it at the earlier stages of under-age drinking. It is a fact that alcoholism rarely develops overnight.  In the case of many young people who drink in their teens alcoholism is not diagnosed until they are in their early twenties when they come to seek treatment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of incidental provisions that we will have to look at on Committee Stage.  We need to make sure that the licence holder in each case is the person who carries the responsibility here.  Very often a manager is left in charge and the licence holder then seeks to escape responsibility for what goes on in his premises when the manager is there. That should not happen.  If we mean business on this issue &mdash; and if we do not we should not do it &mdash; then the licence holder must know that he carries the can if the law is not observed when passed.  We should consider writing into the Bill &mdash; and this can be teased out more on Committee Stage &mdash; that if a licence holder tends to ignore the law and two or three convictions are recorded against him the question of closing down his establishment for a month or two as a lesson to him will arise.  This would be an indication that we mean business on this.  The important thing is that there should be a strict liability, that the responsibility is on the licence holder.  It is up to him to make sure that he is dealing with adults and not with young people as defined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The situation in regard to the off-licences is a matter of serious concern. What worries me is the way in which drink is on display mixed with cornflakes and groceries.  There is no separate section provided for drink in the off-licence premises and that is serious.  In licensed premises the area in which the drink may be sold is very clearly defined with maps and so on when the application is made and the licensee cannot sell the drink one inch beyond the boundary. That is not so with the off-licence.  In that premises the drink is displayed side by side with the groceries and everybody, including children, has access to it.  Provision ought to be made in the legislation that in the off-licences there must be a completely cordoned off, separated section where the alcoholic liquor is stored and sold.  It should not be allowed to be mixed with groceries on the shelves.</P>
    <P>The legislation should provide that suitable notices are displayed in unlicensed premises and in off-licence premises setting out what the new law is, what the age directives are and what the implications are for young people breaking the law in this regard and also for the licensee.  It should be obligatory to have these notices on display at all appropriate outlets.</P>
    <P>While it is not directly the subject matter of the Bill, the question of the number of exemptions and extensions being granted in this day and age will have to be considered.  They are increasing out of all proportion and the situation is getting completely out of hand.  I imagine this may be one of the items the Minister will be looking at in his measure.  He is nodding and I am pleased because that is a very important matter and I look forward to seeing some measure of control there.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the measure is coming before the House and that we will quickly see some improvement in this area.  Many publicans have offended against the existing legislation by allowing juveniles onto their premises and by setting up attractions in their premises such as pool tables, slot machines, musical groups and so on, specifically directed <Col N="650" /> towards attracting young people.  Unfortunately, the Garda have not been able to implement the law.  We cannot, as a society, free ourselves from responsibility in this area.  We have responsibilities and we have not met them.  As part and parcel of bringing in new legislation to control this situation we too must meet our side of the bargain and our responsibilities on the issue by making sure that health education is stepped up on a broad basis in the schools and that we channel increased funds into providing alternative social centres where young people can meet.</P>
    <P>In that way they will not be in the position, as many of them are at present, where if they want to socialise and get together with their peers, the only place available for them to do so is in the pub where drink is the order of the day.  Many young people do not want that.  They would be happy if they had a comparable, cosy place to go and meet their peers. We have a responsibility not just to bring in these extensions to the criminal law, which is what it is, but to look to the social side as part and parcel of that objective.  I assure the mover, and the Minister when he brings in his Bill, of the full support of the Labour Party in bringing in much needed, up-dated legislation and improvements in this complex branch of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for bringing forward this Bill which deals directly with under-age drinking.  I welcome what the Minister has said in relation to the intoxicating liquor Bill which he will bring forward in 1988.  I have one great phrase and that is &ldquo;the quality of life&rdquo;&mdash; I am thinking about the quality of life for people living in areas where young people congregate and drink and abuse alcohol.  There are two things to be done in relation to this matter, one involving the carrot and the other the stick.  The law will have to be changed, as has been suggested.  Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs available and yet young people of 12 and 13 years of age can partake of this drug with the greatest of ease.  As has been <Col N="651" /> mentioned earlier, parents have a great responsibility in this regard and very often do not realise the dangers of leaving this dangerous drug in presses in the home when they go out at night.  They then wonder what is the reason for their children abusing alcohol at such a young age.</P>
      <P>In the inner city which I represent certain people will do anything for money and encourage people to come to their premises.  As the Minister mentioned earlier, you can have any law you like but someone will break it.  Young people know where alcohol can be obtained and they travel eight or ten miles for it every night.  In one part of my constituency large numbers of young people, up to ten or 15 in a group, go to premises to see if they will be served.  Everyone knows they are under age but the Garda can do nothing about this because there is no law to prevent those young people from going into the streets or to a park to drink alcohol.  The law should be changed in this regard.  It should be illegal for people to consume alcohol on an open thorough-fare. This would create a problem when people attend a function in a public park and wish to have an alcoholic drink but there is no doubt that something must be done about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of identification cards has been mentioned, but who should have these cards?  Naturally these people would have to be over 18 years of age. At what age would people not need identification cards?  Would it be at 24 or 26 years of age or would it be 60 years of age?  That is a problem.  Who would administer the cards and state that such a person is John Smith who lives in such and such a house?  Would it be his brother or his cousin?  Some people are not keen on the whole idea of identification cards. When we speak about big brother we often wonder if he is the cause of the problem of young people drinking.  Very often young people go drinking with their big brother or big sister.  They may go with them to an off-licence or a disco and purchase this very dangerous drug. Statistics on AIDS show that, uniquely <Col N="652" /> worldwide, something like 60 per cent of AIDS carriers here contracted the disease through the intravenous usage of drugs.  The whole concept of young people subjecting themselves to the possible contraction of this disease in that way worries me enormously.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently to a parent whose young son of 13½ years had travelled to Wales to play a football match there.  The father had warned him to keep well away from alcohol while on board ship. However, when he spoke to his son afterwards he discovered that not alone were he and his companions of similar age drinking beer but they had actually purchased vodka on board.  I was horrified to hear of this incident.  When one speaks to voluntary alcohol counsellors, working in the different alcohol-related organisations throughout the city, they will tell one that young people in schools do not realise the potential dangers to which they are subjecting themselves.  For example, if they begin drinking alcohol at 12 and 13 years of age their liver will have been damaged, in extreme cases, by the time they will have reached 18 and, before reaching the age of 21, they will have developed into full-blown alcoholics.</P>
    <P>It is timely that we should be discussing the provisions of this Bill.  It is also timely that the Minister should be examining the introduction of an intoxicating liquor Bill to cater for the problems of this modern age.  Unless something positive is done very soon we shall have to cope with a horrendous problem within the next ten years because I have no doubt but that it will worsen as time progresses.</P>
    <P>On St. Patrick's Day a huge number of people attended the parade in this city. A handful headed to one part of the city. At 3 o'clock on that afternoon I saw young people with containers, wrapped in brown paper parcels, heading up O'Connell Street.  Therefore, it did not surprise me to read the following morning that there had been some serious incidents perpetrated by a very small number of people.  I am sure that, if asked the following day, they would say they had not the faintest idea what they were <Col N="653" /> doing, that their minds had become totally blank through the abuse of alcohol. Indeed in most such cases it is cider young people drink.  I have often thought that the sale of cider to young people should be prohibited, especially when one sees young people carrying two litre containers. They can purchase one of these large containers, spend the night in a park, derelict site or wherever, putting themselves beyond the bounds of any sense of reality through the drinking of excessive quantities of cider.  In this respect the Minister might consider insisting on cider being sold in smaller quantities, the normal, smaller bottle and also the more easily identifiable.  I know that suggestion has been put forward already.  In my constituency, the local residents association has objected to certain licensees selling alcohol to children below the permitted age.  In one such case a justice said it was up to the politicians to do something about the law in this respect.  But it must be remembered that one cannot legislate to cover every eventuality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the problem arises of who will say that such and such a child was 16 years of age when they bought the cider.  Members of residents associations will endeavour to prove it and the Garda work in close liaison with them.  It is then very difficult for a justice to reach a decision.  What is he to do?  Does he withdraw the licensee's licence?  Does he decide that the relevant licensee cannot sell cider and, in one case, a justice decided that cider could not be on display in one premises.  I believe that decision has been appealed.  I am not sure what is the present position in relation to it.  Does a justice say, in another case; there is a problem in this area; are the opening <Col N="654" /> hours to be curtailed; must we ensure that a particular off-licence premises closes at 6.30 p.m. in order to prevent people coming in at, say, 8 o'clock?  Is that to be regarded as one solution?  Sometimes, in a rather strange way, one can feel sorry for a licensee or supplier because after all, he has a business to run, but it is difficult to feel sorry for him when one knows that some young people will have travelled long distances to purchase alcohol on his premises.  It never ceases to amaze me that young people travel such distances when other suppliers will not sell to them, why it is they must travel to one district to purchase alcohol.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the rural scene, very different from the city one in that people are more easily recognised whereas, in the city, young people can move almost from one street to another and not be recognised.  In this way it may be possible for a parent in Deputy Kenny's constituency to ask a local supplier not to sell alcohol to his son or daughter.</P>

      <P>It is quite possible they manufacture their own.  It surprises me that young people do not normally drink spirits, usually it is cider and the cheaper wines.  There is one wine they purchase to which they will add an ale or lager, giving it that extra strength or boost.  All of these practices must be covered by the law.  However, it must be remembered that the law can be effective to a certain degree only.  Parents need to do much more by way of educating their young children to the dangers of the usage or abuse of alcohol.  I have already tabled a question to the Minister for Education in relation to that aspect which I hope will be answered on another occasion.</P>
      <P>I heartily welcome the introduction of this Bill and the Minister's intention of introducing a Bill as soon as possible in the next parliamentary session.  I also welcome the Minister's remarks that he will welcome deliberations on the part of all Members of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the amendments mentioned by you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are out of order but I should like to address myself for a few moments to the principle underlining these amendments. We all welcome the fact that there is a family income supplement because of the direct contribution it makes to those people who are living on the lowest levels of income and also because we are interested in increasing the attraction of employment to the furthest possible extent.  When we talk about people who have very low incomes and whose very budget barely stretches over the week, we should also take into consideration that nothing should add to that burden or poverty.  To that extent it is important <Col N="657" /> that we should consider the deletion of the words &ldquo;up to and including the fifth child&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister and his officials within the Department of Social Welfare are aware that this would be very desirable.  I should like the Minister to think seriously about that and agree to it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the family income supplement the Minister should, in the context of social welfare, see it and judge it on net income and, in particular, he should disregard as income any amounts deducted for income tax and social insurance contributions.  The purpose of these amendments is to remove so far as possible the poverty traps and to encourage people who have an opportunity to do so to work so that they will have a higher level of income and a higher level of satisfaction both financially and psychologically than if they were to depend on social welfare as their means of support. We must provide more financial help and more psychological and practical support for people who are working but on low incomes &mdash; and God knows there are many of them in this country &mdash; so that they will be motivated to work and end up living more comfortably, if I can use that word in the circumstances.  Anything in this Bill and in the amendments which we have put down which can be used in that direction and which will raise the income of families on low incomes has got to be welcomed and worked at.  We know from the people who are in receipt of long term social welfare that it leads to a lowering of self esteem, a lack of confidence, a sense of dependency and an erosion of energy and it becomes almost impossible for them to get back into the mainstream.  Above all, the margin of life they find themselves living on &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to interrupt you Deputy Barnes in your eloquence but I thought that perhaps you were treating section 5, which deals specifically with family income supplement, as section 4 which, <i>inter alia,</i> refers to supplementary welfare allowance. Section 5 refers specifically to the family income supplement.  I say this only <Col N="658" /> to discover whether or not you are dealing with section 5 or section 4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 provides for the increases in the social assistance schemes. It specifically provides the increases for those who are on social assistance.  In section 4 we are providing an 11 per cent increase in the personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance and a 6 per cent increase in the rates for the dependent children of these recipients.  The rate of single woman's allowance is being increased by 4.2 per cent which again is above the 3 per cent which applies generally.  The idea here is to bring it into line with the long term urban rate of unemployment assistance.  The single woman's allowance &mdash; and I am sure Deputy Barnes will be glad to note this fact &mdash; is being increased above the norm to bring it into line with the personal rate for the long duration unemployment assistance of £42 per week.  The other rates, of course, have been increased by 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is being taken in the context of higher increases being granted to unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance recipients to eliminate the different rate for single persons who have children but do not have adult dependants.  The new rates are set out in the Schedule.  The increases are in line with the Government's commitment to maintaining the overall level of social welfare benefits and, within the resources available, to provide greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases mean, in effect, that the long duration personal rate for urban unemployment assistance increases from <Col N="659" /> £37.80 to £42, an increase of £4.20 so that the payment to a person with an adult dependant will increase by £5 from £65 to £70.  This increase is in line with the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare to bring up the personal rates which were at the lowest levels.  The personal rates at the lowest levels were for unemployment assistance and for supplementary welfare.  That is what we have done in the measures we are taking here.</P>
    <P>The cost of these measures in a full year is £53 million.  If we had increased the rates of payment by 3 per cent, this would have cost £23 million but to pay increases in the way we have done &mdash; allocating more resources to those at the lowest level &mdash; costs an additional £30 million per annum, bringing the total to £53 million.  In effect, it is a transfer of an additional £30 million to this area, and that is what it adds up to at the end of the day.  Of course it has an effect on the rates for families because we have also in this category increased the child dependant rates &mdash; the allowances for children &mdash; out of line with the 3 per cent.  Consequently, the family will gain more substantially because of the combination of the unemployment assistance personal rate plus the extra increases given in the case of children.  For example, a family with three children in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £6.70, bringing their rate up to £98.80 per week from July next.  A widow with three children would receive an increase of £2.80 per week bringing her rate to £93.30, a widow on unemployment assistance would not be in the lowest categories and, therefore, would not benefit from the 11 per cent increase but would simply benefit from the 3 per cent across-the-board increase.</P>
    <P>We have taken the opportunity also to streamline the child dependant allowances. In general, there are at present four different rates for each social welfare scheme which are being reduced to two rates in the current Bill.  The rate for the first and second child is being averaged and the rate for the sixth and subsequent <Col N="660" /> children will be the same as that payable for the third to fifth child.  This is a streamlining measure and there has been a cost involved because we ensured that nobody would lose and everybody would get the increases that were being applied, and in addition we averaged some of them up to the same level.  In that way, we were able to have the number of dependant allowances.  That is an important step in that direction and I hope it will be possible to do more along those lines in future.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of this section.  The Schedule gives all the effects in all the different areas.  Of course you have to combine the different rates to see the effect on families, and obviously the effect on a larger family is considerably greater.  In the examples I have used I have shown the effect on a three child family but the effect on larger families will be even greater.  That is the main purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>An estimated weekly average of 335,000 recipients and their 301,000 dependants will gain from the social assistance measures, a total of some 636,590 people altogether.  Together with the insurance benefit increases, a total of 737,000 recipients on average each week and their 571,000 dependants will gain from the measures, an estimated total of 1.3 million people.  Those who benefit under section 4 are all on assistance and are, therefore, on means-tested schemes. I have outlined the main features.  The effective dates are similar to those in section 3, with unemployment assistance increases starting from 20 July 1988.</P>

      <P>The amendments put down in The Workers' Party name have been ruled out of order but nevertheless the points made already in relation to section 3 stand with regard to this section.  Although it would be churlish of anyone in this House not to welcome the increases which the Minister has given, particularly the 11 per cent increase for the long-term unemployed &mdash; which I think will be generally welcomed by the poorest sections in our <Col N="661" /> society &mdash; nevertheless, it has to be said that it is a long way from the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which in today's terms would be in the region of £60 to £65 per week for the single person on unemployment assistance.  I think it is important to bear in mind that the principle should not be to increase the levels of allowance and assistance simply in line with inflation, but to increase the real level of income for people in this situation.  For that reason I welcome the increases provided for in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, I complimented the Minister and the Cabinet for bringing forward increases in the social welfare system.  Section 4 is probably one of the best sections in the Bill as it increases the long-term rate of unemployment assistance by 11 per cent.  As Deputy De Rossa has said, this is some way from the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare which have to be acknowledged, but given the financial state of the country at present it is difficult to increase it any more.  It is a substantial increase and I am glad to see the House generally welcomed it.  I am sure if the Minister had the money he would increase it further.  I think he has done an excellent job providing more for those in the lower income group.  Given the cutbacks which have had to be made because of the economic situation, social welfare is probably one of the areas which has been least affected.  That is a compliment to the Minister who has fought his corner to ensure that the lower income groups were given substantial increases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell spoke about targeting various areas.  It is acknowledged that by bringing forward these increases, the Minister is targeting the areas which need to be looked at because the amount paid to a person on long term unemployment benefit is fairly small, but this allowance has been increased substantially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that the single woman's allowance has been increased by 4.2 per cent to bring it in line with the urban rate of long term unemployment assistance.  This is to be welcomed <Col N="662" /> because it is bringing a little equality into the system.  It is astounding that these increases will affect so many people.  The 11 per cent increase in unemployment assistance will affect a substantial number of people, at a cost of £53 million in one year.  The Minister mentioned that our social welfare benefits cost somewhere in the region of £7 million a day.  That is nothing to be sneezed at.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare produced an excellent report and made some laudable suggestions.  The Minister has given a commitment that he hopes to implement some of those recommendations, and I am sure it will be the wish of this House that whatever money is available will be channelled towards the people on the lower rung of the ladder.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the alleviating measure.  The Minister is to be congratulated for this move.  It was very worrying that this £10 per week would be taken from 22,000 households, but the Minister has given an assurance that this money will continue until the end of the year, costing £22 million.  That, too, is to be welcomed.  I know a number of my constituents were very worried that this money might be taken from them.</P>
    <P>The streamlining of the child dependant rates is to be welcomed because this scheme contains a myriad of rates.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that this system should be streamlined and the Minister is going down part of that road.  Supplementary welfare allowances were also mentioned. This is something I am sure every public representative knows about.  I note that this scheme is being continued.  In the Six Counties they are scrapping a similar scheme and bringing in a scheme of loans. That may have a good effect on the economy but it could have a very detrimental effect on the people in my constituency if they were to take out loans rather than grants.  Maybe this scheme is designed to prevent loan sharks from operating in these areas.  I hear of such loan sharks in my constituency although I understand the problem is much more serious in Dublin.  I would be worried if there was a move towards the loan system in the <Col N="663" /> Twenty-Six Counties.  The supplementary welfare scheme, as operated at present, works reasonably well.  Any increases which can be given in this area as well as the unemployment assistance would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>The House has to acknowledge that these increases are quite substantial given the economic problems facing the country. Not too many people get an increase of 11 per cent in their wages nowadays, and this 11 per cent increase is much higher than the rate of inflation given the fact that it starts from a very low base, and these people are on the lower end of the income scale.  Any money we have to provide increases should be given to these people rather than any others.</P>
    <P>The old age pension is being increased substantially, although it is not as large an increase.  It is to be welcomed that we can give an increase in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself at variance with my colleague, Deputy Ahern, in respect of the supplementary welfare allowances not so much on the basis of the payments but on the administration.  As I said on Second Stage, it is time the Minister looked at this scheme because I do not believe it is administered fairly.  In my view, it would be nearly impossible to administer this scheme fairly and equitably. It varies not only from county to county but from community welfare officer to community welfare officer.  It is virtually impossible to police this scheme. Very often the community welfare officer has to depend entirely on the information provided by the applicant, and that is not always accurate.  The community welfare officer has to interview the applicants, check the facts and so on.  I would prefer to see this come under social welfare benefits.  It would be better if we did not have this scheme and if the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare were implemented.  I believe that very often the wrong people get these benefits.  The interpretation of the regulations governing this scheme seems to be variable, to say the least of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tend to consider discrimination <Col N="664" /> against women &mdash; and there is a great deal of discrimination in the social welfare code &mdash; but we forget about deserted husbands.  That may not have been a very big problem some years ago but it is a very big problem now.  The fact is that a husband deserted by his wife and who may have to cater for three or four, or even ten children &mdash; there are many deserted husbands in my constituency &mdash; is paid substantially less than a deserted wife.  I do not know how the Minister can justify that.  A deserted husband will have to stay at home and take care of the children just as a deserted wife has. Under those circumstances it is most unjust to pay a deserted husband less.</P>
    <P>I would much prefer to have a woman looking after children; I may be a bit oldfashioned in that view but I believe a woman is better qualified, and I know that from experience.  It may not be possible to rectify the discrepancy in the allowances this year but the Minister should bear it in mind when preparing the Social Welfare Bill next year.  He should eliminate that discrimination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience as chairman of the Southern Health Board I disagree with the suggestion to transfer supplementary benefits to the Department of Social Welfare.  I accept that it would reduce administrative costs and that it was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  However, I have to bear in mind that, for example, in 1976 in the Southern Health Board area 54 per cent of all supplementary benefits, amounting to more than £1 million, were paid by that board because of delays in dealing with claims which were eventually approved.  There is no doubt that the delays were caused by the Department of Social Welfare although I accept that since the introduction of computerisation the position has improved tremendously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to see a more humane approach adopted and to have the superintendent, the social welfare officer or the welfare officer involved.  I am worried about the proposed change because the officials who decide on the claim might be <Col N="665" /> involved in policing the scheme.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for the work he has done in the Department.  He has done a lot to eliminate delays.  Before he took office the position in Cork was chaotic.  Certificates travelled back and forth to Dublin about six times before a decision was made.  Thankfully, by use of the computer a claim can be dealt with very speedily.  Details of the claim are transmitted to Dublin and a decision entered on the computer within a matter of minutes.  Had such a scheme been in operation in Cork and Kerry in 1986 more than 50 per cent of the delays would have been eliminated.  I disagree with the decision to transfer supplementary benefits to the Department but I must commend the Minister on his moves to eliminate delays.</P>

      <P>The benefit to families on long-term unemployment assistance and those on supplementary welfare will be very considerable.  A family of six children in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £9.70 per week bringing the rate to £124.  Deputy De Rossa, acknowledging that there have been improvements in the system, mentioned the desirability of moving as quickly as possible along the lines recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The commission, at the time they issued their report, recommended £45 as a minimum, which is equivalent to a current rate of £48.30.  They recommended that we should reach that level as a matter of urgency and that we should, ultimately, try to reach a figure between £50 and £55 per week.  That figure would be greater now in real terms.  In my view we have gone a good distance along that road although I accept that a lot more needs to be done.  I should like to tell Deputies De Rossa and Bell that the cost of granting a minimum payment of £55 across the board in a full year would be an additional £315 million.  The House will realise the extent of the problem I am faced with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Bell and Dennehy dealt with supplementary welfare benefits and were <Col N="666" /> concerned about delays.  I should like to tell the Deputies that it is my intention to try to reduce the need for such benefits. We have introduced interim means tests on a pilot basis for unemployment assistance and they are going very well.  It is our intention to extend them.  We are having across-the-desk assessments followed up by checks.  We are also introducing other systems to reduce the delays.  In our one-stop-shop concept we are bringing the officials together to try to get early decisions on claims.  We want to reduce delays and the need for supplementary welfare benefits.  Deputy Bell will recognise that at the end of the day we must have a system which provides discretionary income in certain circumstances but we can do a lot more to reduce delays and the need for supplementary welfare benefits.  Deputy Bell raised a question about deserted husbands but, as Deputy Mitchell has an amendment about that matter, I will deal with it when we reach that amendment.</P>

      <P>The commission, when recommending a minimum basic level of social welfare, also recommended various ways of raising additional income such as lifting the ceilings on PRSI which would mean that the net cost would be a lot less than the figure of £300 million mentioned by the Minister.  However, I do not propose to dwell on that.  As we are dealing with the question of assistance, deserted wife's allowance, single mother's allowance and so on I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the 14,000 men and women who are signing on for unemployment assistance but are not getting any money. Presumably they are not getting any money because they are living with their parents or with a spouse who is working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that there is a need in equity to ensure that people who are unemployed, regardless of the circumstances in the home, regardless of the circumstances of the parents or the spouse, get a minimum amount of money which they can call their own.  If the individuals concerned left home, deserted their wife or husband or left the parental <Col N="667" /> home, they would then qualify for unemployment assistance.  In those circumstances we are indirectly discriminating against persons who choose not to leave their homes.  Given the great commitment of this House to the family over a long number of years, it appears we are contradicting ourselves in allowing 14,000 people to sign for unemployment assistance and not receive any money at all.  There must be tens of thousands of others who are merely receiving a few pounds a week.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned here before a man in his forties, living with his parents, who is in receipt of £12 a week.  That was all that he was allowed following a means test of his parents' income, although his parents were elderly and were not by any means well off.  Such individuals live in poverty regardless of the home circumstances. They are unemployed, available and fit for work, but are not receiving any assistance. Because they are not in receipt of unemployment assistance, they are automatically disqualified from participating in social employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The other element of that discrimination is that of those over 25 years of age some 9,000 of the 14,000 are women.  Again, there is a clear imbalance there.  Because of the nature of employment in our society and of the social mores, it is far more difficult for women to qualify for unemployment benefit, to acquire the number of contributions needed to get benefit.  The Minister should clearly look at this matter.</P>
    <P>We put down an amendment today which comes under section 5 but which should be more correctly under section 4.  This sought to amend the main Act which would have excluded any benefit deemed to arise from residing at home with the family.  It is amendment No. 11, if the Minister wishes to refer to it.  It has been ruled out of order and thus cannot be moved here.  It involves something to which many Deputies have referred in the House, certainly during the few years since I came into it.  There would not be great cost involved in ensuring that the 14,000 people to whom I have referred <Col N="668" /> would get some minimum amount of money, having paid their bus fares to get to the labour exchange and get home. There are many people in my constituency who walk from Finglas to Gardiner Street and home again simply because they have not the bus fare.  There is a need to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which I would draw the Minister's attention.  It concerns the unmarried mother's allowance or single parent's allowance. Despite what Deputy Bell says about the mother being the best person to rear the children, there are men who very courageously are trying to rear children on their own.  I know of one such person who was married in England, whose wife wanted to abort their child but was prevailed upon by him not to do so.  The father got custody of the child in England, got a divorce, came home to Ireland and is now living in my constituency.  He is not entitled to a single parent's allowance. He is unemployed and is rearing the child alone.  He is entitled to unemployment assistance for as long as he can &ldquo;prove&rdquo; the fiction that he is available for work, but as soon as the labour exchange decides that because he is caring for his child he is not available for work he will lose that money also.  In terms of the small numbers involved there would not be great cost to the State in ensuring that where men fulfil the same conditions as women they should also get the single parent's allowance.  I would urge the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <P>I want to make one more point in relation to the supplementary allowance scheme also covered in this section by way of increases.  I would be reluctant to see the scheme being transferred from the health board to the Department of Social Welfare.  Apart from that, there is a need to look at the way in which the scheme is administered.  By and large, it is necessary to retain the flexibility which community welfare officers have in dealing with individual cases.  If your purse or wallet has been stolen or you have been robbed and you are on unemployment assistance or deserted wife's allowance <Col N="669" /> or whatever and are absolutely panic-stricken, it is important to be able to go to a community welfare officer who will listen sympathetically to your case and be able to give you some money to help you to survive over the weekend.  That situation happens quite often.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Bell that there are people who are getting supplementary welfare benefits who are not entitled to them and who do not deserve them.  I have not come across that.  I know that the community welfare officers operate in a very humane way and obviously within guidelines provided by their supervisors.  In some cases the guidelines may be a little too strict because of various requirements for tightening up on payments.  There may be the odd person who has fallen through the net and is not getting help which is absolutely needed. Rather than a tightening up of the system, I would like to see a loosening.  I would rather see one or two people getting assistance who may not need it as badly as they claim than even one or two people not getting it when they absolutely need it.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider the points I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the Minister too long.  I do not know if he would have information available to deal with the queries raised by Deputy De Rossa. I agree wholeheartedly with that Deputy with regard to holding the family together and not allowing discrimination which can force people to move out from under the family roof.  I am sure other Deputies are aware of cases of married women not receiving allowances for which they are completely eligible.  If they have had a baby recently they seem to be discriminated against by the supervisors of some of these exchanges.  Women have had to resort to an appeals tribunal to get what is theirs by right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister would like to think that because of the European Directive on Equal Treatment in Social Security we no longer have biased or discriminatory interviewing of married women, particularly under the availability for work <Col N="670" /> clause.  However, from what I hear of the practical experience of women &mdash; particularly married women &mdash; there is still biased interviewing and discrimination, sometimes to the extent of depriving them of their own contributions.  I wonder if the Minister, in monitoring this, might have to issue a more strict directive to ensure that all personnel working in employment exchanges are aware that it is no longer not just unacceptable but illegal to treat married women in this way.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy De Rossa said in regard to the single parent's allowance in so far as the equality of justice for men and women is concerned. I positively encourage the parenting role of the father &mdash; the husband, if he is married &mdash; but he is the father even if he is unmarried.  As Deputy De Rossa said, the numbers may not be that large but I know of men in relationships with women who bore children outside marriage and where the men took full responsibility for parenting.  Apart from not having full acceptance of that role from the community such a man is not given the single parent's allowance.  The Minister should transfer the unmarried mother's allowance to a single parent's allowance and base it on the eligibility and responsibility taken by whichever parent takes on the role of caring for the child which is of the greatest importance and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has any information in regard to continuing biased, discriminatory treatment of married women to hand or how it can be completely eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>But they would not have been previously insured.  Some of the <Col N="671" /> people signing on have retired from work and are doing so to keep their pension rights.  Some are married women who are not working for the time being but intend to work at a future date.  Theoretically, they are supposed to be available for and actively seeking work but that is not pressed too hard.  They are just keeping their record alive, this also applies to maternity cases and these groups keep their records open for treatment benefits.</P>
      <P>It will be interesting to see what happens now that the spouse can have treatment benefits, which may have some influence on the numbers signing for credit.  We do not know exactly why people sign but we know these categories are involved.  The question of unmarried mothers, deserted husbands and single parents is a problem that will have to be addressed.  Obviously, this has very wide financial implications because widowers and deserted husbands are involved.  We will certainly have to address this matter in future and one of the major problems is the question of cost and specifying the arrangements to be made so as they are not open-ended or unduly subject to abuse.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes raised the question of discrimination against married women with children and seeking unemployment assistance.  She complained that they were asked about arrangements for minding the children and that the same should apply to men in general.  In some areas the old attitudes still prevail. However, I sent out a repeat of an earlier circular, with some modifications, a few weeks ago emphasising the fact that married women with children are to be treated in the same way as anybody else. Computerisation will help to some extent because it will be easy to see whether the man's wife is working and, if so, he will have to give a satisfactory answer regarding the minding of their children, I sent that circular to ensure that this would happen.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour the point but in relation to the 14,000 people who are signing for credits, <Col N="672" /> the answer I received in answer to a parliamentary question was that 9,100 women over 25 were signing for credits and were not in receipt of any assistance; 3,500 men in the same category, over 25 years of age, were signing for credits and were not in receipt of assistance.  I understand that 1,110 men and women under 25 years of age are in the same circumstances. While accepting that there may be elements in those figures of people who are signing on simply to maintain their record contribution, the Minister must be aware that since the introduction of equality legislation there are men signing on for credits who are not in receipt of unemployment assistance. Previously it did not matter whether the wife was working because she was automatically regarded as an adult dependant and the husband, in those circumstances, was not only entitled to his own unemployment assistance but was entitled to an allowance for his &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; even though she may have been working. The reverse is now the case.  The wife is working and the husband is claiming unemployment assistance and not getting it because his means are assessed on her income.  Women suffered that discrimination for many years.</P>

      <P>Equal discrimination. The Minister must also be aware that there are a considerable number of people living at home with parents who are means tested on their parents' income and are not in receipt of money.  The Minister should ensure that people in those circumstances get a basic minimum amount of money each week in their own name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the single parent's allowance for men, I am quite certain that there are possibly only a handful who would fall into that category.  If the Minister thinks about it and if the conditions were to be the same as for women then no two people &mdash; the mother and father <Col N="673" />&mdash; could claim for the same child.  The vast majority of women at present claiming unmarried mother's allowance are claiming for a single child.  There are a number who are claiming for more than one child, so the cost would be minimal. I would urge the Minister not to push it away into the future.  I know of one person in my own constituency who, at this moment, could do with the income with which the single parent's allowance would provide him and this would mean the difference between sitting in a bare flat with no furniture and possibly having some small comforts for himself and his child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a statutory provision governing the assessment of means for unemployment assistance and that is contained in section 146 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981, and was amended by section 13 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.  One of the items taken into account in the means test is the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by the claimant.  The relevant provision says: &ldquo;the yearly value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by him or by his spouse, including the estimated value to the household in the succeeding year deriving from all income earned by his spouse in respect of current personal employment under a contract of service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The benefit and privilege concept covers a range of situations but in practice it generally is taken to mean the value of board and lodgings to an applicant for unemployment assistance residing in the home of his parents or with a relative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If benefit and privilege were not covered in the Act the situation would arise that single persons living with parents in affluent circumstances could qualify for unemployment assistance on exactly the same basis as persons living with poor parents or whose parents had to provide for their keep out of their unemployment assistance payments.  The purpose of the assessment of benefit or privilege is, therefore, to achieve a degree of equity between applicants <Col N="674" /> living in relatively better off circumstances and those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    <P>The legislation also covers the situation where a person derives benefit from the earnings of a wife or partner.  Where the head of the family is a wage earner the method of calculation is to deduct from the net parental income &mdash; that is the gross income less tax and PRSI contributions &mdash; an amount to cover such outgoings as rent or mortgage repayments. In addition a parental allowance is deducted.  At present this allowance is £105 per week for a married couple and £90 for a single parent.  They are intended to cover the personal expenses necessarily incurred by the applicants' parents in a week and the remainder of net parental income is then divided among the non-earning members of the household including the applicant.  The figure arrived at is taken as the value of board and lodgings to the applicant.  That is the legislative basis on which the calculations are made at present.</P>
    <P>Where the earnings are of a wife or partner an allowance of £45 is made for personal expenses and travelling expenses.  Income above that figure is treated as income benefiting the applicant and is assessed as means.  That did not change with equal treatment.  That provision is there a long time and has been applied in those cases.  The difference now is that more wives are working and it is affecting more men, whereas in the past it was principally women who were affected.  That is the system as it operates.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggests that there may be marginal people and that is something that can be looked at.  Basically the purpose of the measure is to ensure that those who are on the lowest income get the benefits which are available.  The Deputy will be aware that when you come to spreading around the available money you have to be careful about where it goes and consequently that measure ensures that it goes to families who are on the lowest incomes.</P>

      <P>The provision for an increase in family income supplement rates is to be welcomed.  This scheme has done an enormous amount of good work in helping people to remain at work where the attraction would have been to leave the employment and claim unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and all the other benefits that are part of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to ask his colleague in the Department of Health to ask the chief executive officers of the eight regional health boards to ensure that as a result of any increase in the family income supplement people will not lose their entitlement to medical cards.  I have had cases &mdash; and I am sure other Deputies had the same experience &mdash; in my clinics where people have been put outside the income limit by some small payment under the family income supplement and the decision of some of the regional health boards in relation to medical cards seems to be counter-productive. On the one hand, the Minister is going to certain lengths to encourage people to stay at work and to make it as attractive as possible for them but on the other hand the Department of Health is withdrawing medical cards, free footwear and other entitlements which is very annoying to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the income received by way of family income supplement will not be taken into account in the assessment criteria laid down for medical cards and so on.  It should be disregarded.  It is ludicrous that one Minister is doing his best to alleviate <Col N="676" /> hardship in homes while his colleague, the Minister for Health, is withdrawing help from those who are genuinely entitled to supplementary income.  The family income supplement was a tremendous step forward in that it was an incentive to people to remain at work. Unfortunately health boards throughout the country are availing of this opportunity to remove other assistance such as medical cards, free footwear and so on. I know that the Minister is sincere in his desire to alleviate hardship and I would ask him to request the Minister for Health to issue a directive to all health boards that supplementary income should not be taken into account when assessments are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support what Deputy Wyse has said since I have come across a number of similar cases.  The giving of supplementary income to a family should not result in something being taken from them.  While I appreciate that there must be an income limit at some stage, it seems unjust that people who are on the borderline lose the benefit of the medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jibe is often made by people that they would be better off on the dole rather than working because their neighbours who are on the dole are getting everything while they are getting nothing.  However, there is never a situation where someone who is unemployed is getting more than someone who is employed.  When anyone came to me saying that he was worse off in his employment than a neighbour who was in receipt of the dole, I suggested applying for family income supplement. People have come back and said that it is not relevant and does not help because it amounts to only £1 or £2.  I note the Minister's statement on Second Stage that he is undertaking a review of the family income supplement.  I welcome this development because simply increasing the income ceiling every year is not the answer.  More people on the lower end of the scale should be covered by the scheme.  It should be spread out over a wider base.  Perhaps it should be publicised <Col N="677" /> more in order to allow for a bigger take-up.  The income limit should allow that to happen.  I understand that only 5,300 people are availing of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I note from the report of the Commission on Social Welfare that the Coalition Government recommended in 1984 that the family income supplement should be abolished and replaced by some form of revamped child benefit scheme.  However, the commission recommended that it should be retained in the short term because it had some benefit but that ultimately it could be phased out if the child dependant allowance was rationalised.  The Minister said earlier that this is what he is trying to do. People would not then be worse off.</P>
    <P>Soldiers from the barracks in Dundalk often come to me and say that somebody down the street is better off than they are.  There is some justification for this claim because some of these other people benefit from medical cards and free travel.  At the end of the day, however, nobody can say with his hand on his heart that financially people who are unemployed or on pension are better off than those in employment.  I would ask the Minister to bring forward this review of the family income supplement.  I welcome the increase in the ceilings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point in relation to the amendment.  I cannot get a logical explanation as to why the scheme should stop at five children.  Large families are in the minority nowadays because it is difficult to afford a large number of children.  It seems rather peculiar that a man and wife with ten children should be dealt with in exactly the same way as a family half the size.  It does not seem logical.  I do not know what the cost would be of extending the scheme to cover large families, who are certainly a minority.  Perhaps there should be no limit on the number of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mindful of the fact that the greater part of my earlier contribution was made erroneously under section 4.  I will not take up the time of the House by repeating it.  I welcome the fact that the family income supplement <Col N="678" /> enables people to continue working but the fact that we have a supplement for very low income families is an indictment of our failure to establish a minimum basic wage.  We will continue to lobby other Ministers in that regard so that it will not be necessary to give people a subsidy to bring them above the poverty line.  The family income supplement has acted as a cushion which has enabled people to stay in low paid employment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bell's point that it is extraordinary to have a cut-off point above a certain number of children.  I notice that in his amendment Deputy Bell suggests that it should apply to each child up and including the tenth child.  I would hesitate in putting any upward number on it.  I would like to think that the parents, particularly the mother, could do that.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the best way of dealing with this would be to delete the words &ldquo;up to and including the fifth child&rdquo;.  Apart from the fact that such a subsidy is needed, as the Minister and his officials are aware this again reminds us how easy it is to slip into the poverty trap. As Deputy Wyse has said, receiving help in one way could result in a person finding himself losing entitlement to a medical card or other subsidies.  Our amendments are geared to achieving as much flexibility as possible.  All of us know of people who are so frightened of losing something which they have, small and all that it is, that they are afraid to seek information about other benefits for which they may be eligible.  I agree with Deputy Ahern when he says that more information should be made available in regard to eligibility for the family income supplement. We all know of people who are in need of it but because they are afraid of losing benefits in another area they will not make a claim.  These are the most vulnerable people in our society.  Even if these amendments cannot be accepted <Col N="679" /> because of financial constraints, I hope the direction the Department will take will not alone eliminate the fear which exists but also the traps.</P>

      <P>Basically, I want to raise a hardy annual which I have raised with this Minister, previous Ministers and Ministers for Finance, namely, the question of how we target the people who might be entitled to family income supplement but who are not aware or applying for it.  Since the scheme was introduced I have suggested that the Revenue Commissioners should be used to distribute information on it.  Obviously, these people are employed and whether paying PAYE or not they must still receive a tax-free allowance certificate each year.  It seems it would be a relatively simple matter in terms of the computerisation of tax-free allowance certificates for the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare to inform PAYE workers within a certain income band that the family income supplement exists, that they should apply for it and where they can get further information on it.</P>
      <P>I have been told on numerous occasions that there are technical difficulties involved in this but no matter what we try to do there will always be technical difficulties involved.  It is important to reach as many people as possible and evidence has shown that if you can reach the individual concerned directly through the mail you are doing a far better job than spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on television and newspaper advertising which may or may not be seen.  It seems to me the only effective way of advertising anything these days is to get a mention on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  That seems to spark everybody in terms of what they want and what they do not want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners should see, even on an <Col N="680" /> experimental basis, whether or not that would get people to apply.  There must be people who are afraid to apply for the family income supplement on the basis that they may lose some other benefit, be it a medical card or otherwise.  That is a matter to which the Minister should also address himself.  It is not right that people who are living on the borderline of poverty and who could be helped, because they may have been misinformed or misunderstand how the system works, are fearful of applying in case they may lose some other benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the hardy annual as referred to by Deputy De Rossa there is a difficulty, as he probably knows, in that the Revenue Commissioners do not have information on those who do and do not have children but it is possible that something may be done on a trial basis.  We will discuss this further with the Revenue Commissioners.  Basically, their position is that they do not have information on family sizes and, therefore, are not in a position to make distinctions between people in that way.</P>
      <P>Various amendments which were put down on the section were ruled out of order.  The section provides for increases in the income limits up to which family income supplement is payable.  One of the reasons underlying the introduction of the family income supplement scheme was to deal with the situation where persons on low earnings might have a net income only marginally better than what they would receive if they were on social welfare benefit.  The scheme is confined to families with children where one or both parents is in the active labour force. The level of income up to which a supplement is payable at present is £104 for a one child family increasing by £22 per week for each additional child up to a maximum of £192 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income level at which the maximum supplement is payable is £72 per week for a one child family increasing by £8 for each additional child up to a maximum of £104.  The amount of family income supplement payable is half the difference between the weekly family <Col N="681" /> income and the upper limit, subject to a maximum payment for each family size. The maximum weekly supplement is £16 for a one child family increasing by £7 for each additional child up to £44 per week.</P>
    <P>Subsections 1 (a) and 1 (b) provide for increases in the prescribed income limits up to which family income supplement is payable.  The upper limit of the weekly income up to which the supplement will be payable is being increased from £104 to £108 for a one child family and will rise by £23 per week, instead of the present £22 for each additional child, up to £192 per week.  There is no change in the rate of maximum weekly supplement. The level of family income supplement below which the maximum supplement is payable is set by reference to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance grossed up.  The rationale for this is that the scheme should not be subsidising wages below the level of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>The fact that the upper family income limit does not increase for families with more than five children is not a desire not to help large families; the upper limit proposed, £200, is related to a desire not to supplement earnings above average industrial earnings which for transportable goods industries for all employees was £199 per week in June 1987.  Deputy Bell raised that question, in talking about the need for a review. Deputy Bell talked about including all children and Deputy Mitchell in his amendment said much the same thing. Deputy Barnes said she could not understand why the upper limit was applied. The previous Government set that limit when the whole scheme was set up.</P>

      <P>That was the basis on which this was done.  To extend the scheme to families of up to ten children would result in subsidies up to the level of £16,000 per annum.  I am naturally concerned about the scheme and, as I <Col N="682" /> said on Second Stage, one of the commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was a detailed study of the working of the family income supplement in order to identify adjustments that might be necessary.  This review is being undertaken by an independent consultant and the results will be available reasonably soon.  It is therefore considered that for major change it would be best to wait until the review is available to us.  I recognise the interest of Deputies generally in this scheme and I will have a further look at it on Report Stage to see if further interim adjustments can be made to meet the points raised by Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputies will realise that we want to bring as many people as possible into the scheme but that will cost more money. We need to look at how we will spend the money we will have in that area.  In relation to the major change it would be wiser to have the results of the study which has been going on for some time. This scheme is experimental in many ways.  The previous Government introduced it originally at a quarter of the difference and then went to a third of the difference and last year we brought it to half the difference which was a very substantial increase in the amounts of money people were getting.  Most Deputies would like to see more people benefiting from it.  I have listened to what has been said and we will certainly review the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse raised the question relating to the medical card and so on.  This problem also bothers me as Minister, as I have to seek these millions of pounds to improve the position of people and I do not like to find that it brings their level of income to a point where their rents are affected or their medical card eligibility is affected.  This is something that should be looked at further but it is difficult to see a simple way to overcome that problem.  I recognise the point made by several Deputies and this difficulty was also raised on Second Stage.  As Minister for Social Welfare I would like to see people benefiting as much as possible from any increases we can give.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's point but I totally disagree that the consequences are not the Minister's.  The Minister is part of the Government and he is trying to do something good.  Consultation should take place between the Minister and the Minister for Health so as to ensure that the Minister for Health will not take something from people as a result of this scheme.  The Minister said, and I agree, that we should try to bring more people into the scheme but that it would cost more money.  It will not cost more money if on the other hand people are losing the medical card, free fuel and things of that kind.  There is a need for co-ordination between the Minister and the Minister for Health because health and social welfare go together on a number of aspects of the services.  I strongly recommend consultation with the Minister for Health in this area.</P>

      <P>I thought I said earlier that I would have discussions about it.  It is not only the Minister for Health but the Minister for the Environment who are involved.  I do not see how one readily gets over the problem of equal treatment for other people once the incomes are raised.  In my role as Minister for Social Welfare getting increases for people on social welfare, I want their position to be improved as much as possible.  I will certainly discuss that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say he will have discussions. Equity is obviously one of the problems created by schedules and cut off levels. Deputy Wyse or his party suggested, in relation to childrens' allowances, that they should apply at a certain level and then they should be cut off.  This creates an anomaly.  We have this all along the line in relation to pensions and so on.  If a person has £1 or £2 over the limit they are cut off from benefit.  At least in the medical card system there is a hardship clause which can be applied but in the other cases there is a cut-off point.  I would argue against cut-off points in this area and in relation to education grants where, for instance, people earning £100 <Col N="684" /> more than a certain amount are having to pay fees and expenses costing £6,000 or £7,000 a year.</P>
      <P>I am sure it was not intentional, but Deputy Wyse said that the health boards were availing of the benefit to remove medical cards from people.  In the Southern Health Board at least where I was a member and a former chairman I do not believe that anybody is waiting to avail of the opportunity to reduce benefits. They have to apply guidelines but in fairness, nobody is waiting to reduce benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the term the Deputy used.  The Deputy said they were availing of the opportunity to reduce the benefit.  The Southern Health Board at least have a very sympathetic approach to people who are marginally over the limit.  The guidelines are laid down after discussion with the CEOs.  There are tremendous problems in this area and I agree with the Minister that there is no point in his increasing benefits from his budget and the corporation or county council taking them back by way of increased rents or the health board by way of cutting somebody from the benefit of the medical card.  There is not an easy answer to this and this is where schedules, cut-off points and means testing comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally I welcome the Minister's intention to review the situation to see how the figure of 5,300 families can be increased.  The commission strongly pointed out that the sole object of this payment was to ensure that the low income family was not discriminated against on their income, relative to those on social welfare when social welfare was improved.  We do not want people to give up work in order to go on social welfare, so this is a move in the right direction. The commission recommended also either increasing the gross wages figure as the Minister is doing or taking net income into consideration.  I am glad we are moving along the right road.  I hope the Minister will consult on this, but I see <Col N="685" /> no easy answer to the question raised by Deputy Wyse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the attention the Minister has given to the FIS.  When it was first implemented it was a total disaster because it had not been thought out and many problems arose with its implementation.  We have improved it and even though now only about 5,000 people are availing of the FIS we are going in the right direction.  I am aware of many families who have availed of it and benefited thereby and it has taken them off the poverty line.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse referred to people losing out either in rented corporation houses or by losing their medical card.  I concur with the previous speaker that this is a problem, but equally problems face people who are not entitled to the FIS, who are working and are just over the limit and at a cut-off point.  Unfortunately, cut-off points have created problems right across the spectrum whether people are applying for a house, the FIS, or whatever and there is no easy solution.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the report on the review the Minister has under way.  This is a vital scheme.  As I have said, the numbers availing of it are small but they have increased and many people out in the community would avail of this scheme if they were aware of it.  The health authorities have a role to play here; it is not just social welfare.  People should be aware of such schemes which cushion the hardship many people experience at present.  I compliment the Minister on giving this area the attention it deserves.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 1 to 10, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;(1) Section 10 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1) of the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(b) Subject to paragraph (d) of this subsection, to subsection (7) and to regulations under section 7, where in any contribution year a payment is made to or for the benefit of an employed contributor in respect of reckonable earnings of that employed contributor, there shall be payable an employment contribution comprising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  by an employed contributor, a contribution at a rate (to be specified in regulations) of reckonable earnings, the upper limit (if any) of which shall be specified in regulations.</P>
      <P>(ii)  by an employer, a contribution at a rate (to be specified in regulations) of that employee's reckonable earnings, the upper limit (if any) of which shall be specified in regulations and which may be the same or different to any upper limit specified under subparagraph (i).</P>
      <P>(c) (i)  The regulations referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (b) may exempt a portion of income under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (b) or both, or either make no exemption or different exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  Any regulations made under <Col N="687" /> this section (including this subsection) may be amended or revoked.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where regulations under this subsection are proposed to be made, a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and no such regulation shall be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The three amendments are intended to ensure every possible support and encouragement for job creation and to keep our industries labour intensive rather than using other means such as machinery etc., to avoid taking on extra workers because of the expense of the employers' contribution.  The amendments would give power to the Minister for Social Welfare, by regulation and with the prior approval of the House, to make certain changes and bring about flexibility without having to put amendment upon amendment and patching year by year on to the 1981 Act.  In many of the amendments put down here and in the discussion on them the 1981 Act as amended is referred to.  If the flexibility to bring about changes annually could be brought in by regulation, we might avoid constant amendment to legislation.</P>
    <P>The OECD have stated that part of the difficulties Ireland suffers with regard to unemployment and job creation is that the combination of our systems here sometimes seems to militate against job creation and employment rather than the other way round.  Amendment No. 16 would give the Minister power by regulation to vary the contribution of the reckonable earnings.  The amendment provides: &ldquo;...where in any contribution year a payment is made to or for the benefit of an employed contributor in respect of reckonable earnings of that employed contributor, there shall be payable an employment contribution comprising (i) by an employed contributor, a contribution at a rate (to be specified in regulations) of reckonable earnings, the upper limit (if any) of which shall be <Col N="688" /> specified in regulations&rdquo;.  That would be the employed contributor having the flexibility to appeal the upper limit of such employee's contribution.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) (ii) of the amendment provides for an employment contribution comprising a contribution by an employer at a rate of that employee's reckonable earnings the upper limit of which shall be specified in regulations.  For instance, where there is a choice between an employer being able to vary the employment contribution and an employee being able to be reckoned at a lower limit by regulation, the combination of those two should lead to a decision by the employer to take on extra workers rather than either allow present workers to work overtime or, as happens so often now, introduce machines to enable the work to be done with fewer workers.  The whole direction of our social security contributions would be to enable the Minister to have such flexibility as to build in a pro-employment attitude rather than an anti-employment attitude as sometimes happens at the moment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 which, as has been pointed out by the Chair, is a continuation of amendment No. 16 provides that as an alternative to all or part of the total sum payable as employers' contributions in any contributory year, the Minister may, by regulation, require the payment by companies of a levy based on a turnover of the company rather than on the number of workers employed.  When making regulations under this section the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, shall define, <i>inter alia</i>, the amount of the percentage, the manner of the computation of turnover and the dates and payments of the levy.  Any regulations made under this section, including this subsection, may be revoked or amended.  Again, this all points to flexibility and the fact that it could be changed by regulation.  Where regulations under this subsection are proposed to be made, a draft of the proposed regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and no such regulation shall be made until a resolution approving the draft has been <Col N="689" /> passed by each House.  Again, what is being attempted here is to give the Minister the flexibility to introduce it without interfering too strongly with or amending the Bill and to ensure, of course, that the approval of both Houses would be needed to bring it about.</P>
    <P>In amendment No.  17, part of all of the total sum payable by employers would be based on a percentage of turnover of the company.  This might be more accurate and remove a certain amount of difficulty that is being experienced at the moment with regard to profits and turnover of companies.  For instances, the employers' contribution brings in about £600 million per annum, and this is raised by levying 12½ per cent of all they pay up to £16,200. Income above £16,200 is not reckonable either for the employer or the employee contributions.  Therefore, the employers' contribution is a direct tax on employment. There can and must be a more constructive and positive way of dealing with that.  The Commission on Taxation proposed a social security tax without actually defining what it might be, but stated that it could be all or part of the employers' contribution instead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked the Minister to consider providing that this part or total sum would be payable on a percentage of turnover because if it were imposed on the profits alone as they are perceived and interpreted at the moment it could require a very heavy increase in existing profits tax or it could be a further encouragement to companies, if they thought they could get away with it, to understate their amount of profit.  It might also be in breach of the Irish commitment to retain the 10 per cent manufacturing profits tax until the year 2000.  The Minister for Finance, in a Dáil reply to Deputy Mitchell some time ago did say that turnover tax would, in fact, be £6,000 million. Therefore, we can compute that a 2½ per cent turnover tax would raise £150 million and could reduce the employers' contribution by 25 per cent.  A 5 per cent turnover tax would raise £300 million and, therefore, would reduce employers' contributions by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>That would give a sense of equality <Col N="690" /> regarding industries at the moment and remove what can be almost a financial discrimination between industries with more employees and industries that can manage to have a very high turnover because they choose not to take on extra staff and either through overtime or the use of machinery increase their productivity and turnover rather than doing so by labour-intensive industries.  It could go as far as actually working against labour-intensive industry.  If all or part of that contribution were based on other reckonings rather than on the number of employees, not alone could it bring about a flexibility which would be a more equitable way of collecting a contribution from industries based on their turnover and encouraging them to be labour intensive, it could introduce a flexibility with regard to the employees in that low income and other circumstances could be taken into consideration as well.  The Minister by regulation could be flexible with regard to the contribution of the employees by way of perhaps a sliding scale.</P>
    <P>What these two amendments are about is to derive another method of having a more equitable and constructive way of encouraging and rewarding employers for taking on and paying contributions for workers based on a system other than the number of workers.  Aligned with that the Minister would have flexibility with regard to the workers or employees concerned so that employees' income could be taken into consideration in computing their contribution and thus there would be a more equitable distribution.  Instead of the trend we are increasingly seeing, with employers deciding not to take on workers because of the disincentive of the employers' contribution, every encouragement should be given to them to take on more workers because they would be paying on their turnover rather than on the number of workers they employ.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the direction the Deputy is taking with these amendments. As they are constructed they <Col N="691" /> would cause a lot of problems.  Amendment No.  16 would involve deleting subsection (1) which would have immediate effects financially on the arrangements to come into effect on 6 April.  We would have to look further at the construction of the amendment which is here.</P>
      <P>What is proposed in amendment No. 17 is a turnover tax to bring in income and thereby provide a means of reducing some of the other costs or broadening the base for bringing income into the whole system.  We will have to go into it in more detail tomorrow.  It is a very major proposal.  In amendment No. 16 the Deputy is proposing that there would be a lower limit of exemption.  If there was a £2,000 exemption limit the amount of money waived would be £237 million. The Deputy will realise that there are very big costs in that area.  Nevertheless, I recognise that in putting down the amendment Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Barnes are concerned to give the Minister power by way of regulation to do something in relation to these different areas that are mentioned.  I have very little time left to go into this matter in detail because there are a couple of major proposals.</P>

      <P>An t-aitheasc a thug an tAire Airgeadais ar an gcáinaisnéis an 27 Eanáir sa Dáil, nuair a dúirt sé go mbeadh sé riachtanach do gach uile dhuine a bhí ag fáil deontais ón Stát uimhir chánach a <Col N="692" /> lua agus a chruthú go bhfuil a chúrsaí cánach in eagar, is as an aitheasc sin a thagann an fhadhb seo.  Dúirt sé go mbeadh sé socraithe go luath agus go mbeadh eolas tugtha do na húdaráis i gceist faoi.  Ach de réir cheist Dála a chuir mé féin síos chuig an Taoiseach tamall beag ina dhiaidh sin thug an tAire Stáit atá anseo againn anocht le fios dúinn nach raibh i gceist anseo ach uimhir thagartha chánach a lua.  Agus freisin nach mbeadh cáin ar bith le híoc ar dheontas a bheadh le fáil ag duine a bheadh níos lú ná £500.</P>
      <P>Níl mé ag easaontú ar chor a bith leis an mbunphrionsabal go mbíonn ar dhaoine cáin a íoc ar ioncam, ach sílim gur eisceachtúil an fhadhb atá againn anseo.  Leis na blianta anuas, ar fud na tíre agus ag na cruinnithe poiblí, bhí sé le rá ag páirtí Fhianna Fáil gurb iad páirtí na Gaeilge agus go raibh agus go mbeadh sé mar phríomh-aidhm acu an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a neartú.  Aontaím go hiomlán leis an airgead a chuir an Rialtas ar fáil le déanai ón gcrannchur náisiúnta i leith fhorbairt na Gaeilge.  Ach sílim, ó thaobh na gcoláistí samhraidh de, go bhfuil cinneadh uafásach déanta anseo.  Cuirfear deireadh leo, agus is mór, go deimhin, an drochthoradh a thiocfaidh as seo ó thaobh chaomhnú agus forbairt na Gaeilge de.  Sílim gur fíor a rá, ag éirí as na cruinnithe poiblí a bhí ar siúl ar fud na nGaeltachtaí, go bhfuil imní an-mór tagtha ar mhná tí na Gaeltacha ina leith seo.  Leis an bhfírinne a rá is é an rud atá i gceist acu ná go bhfuil an-fhaitíos orthu agus ar na fir chéile go mbeidh an dole atá siad ag fáil ón Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh bainte díobh nó gearrtha siar.  Tá aithne agam féin ar gach uile dhuine a chaill an dole ar feadh tamaill bhig as ucht iniúchtha a rinne an Roinn Leasa Shóisialaigh ag éirí as na mná tí ag coinneáil scoláirí i rith an tsamhraidh, agus leis an bhfírinne a rá tá faitíos an-mhór orthu ina leith sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is áiteanna iargúlta iad na Gaeltachtaí, atá bánaithe leis na blianta anuas, agus is cúis bhróin agus imní, mar a dúirt mé, ar na mná tí é seo.  Ní leanann na cúrsaí seo ar aghaidh ach ar feadh tamaill ghairid agus ní mór an brabús a bhaineann na mná tí as seo, agus tá rialacha an-diana <Col N="693" /> leagtha síos faoin scéim.  Caithfidh siad, mar a déarfá, áit na dtuismitheoirí a thógáil, trí bhéile sa lá a chur ar fáil do na scoláirí de réir bhia an chláir atá leagtha síos, agus go ginearálta bíonn orthu cúram a thabhairt dóibh.  Oibríonn siad go han-dian, agus ag deireadh na gcúrsaí is beag airgead a bhíonn acu as.</P>
    <P>Is ar mhaithe na Gaeilge, ar mhaithe na scoláirí agus ar mhaithe chultúr na tíre ar fad a dhéanann siad an obair seo.  Tá a fhios ag gach uile dhuine go bhfuil 85 coláistí samhraidh ann, agus anuraidh, de réir cheist Dála a thug an tAire Oideachais dom ar 3 Nollaig 1987, tá a fhios againn gur íocadh níos mó ná £347,000 leis na coláistí samhraidh anuraidh, agus is mór an t-airgead é sin agus tá an-ghá leis sna Gaeltachtaí.  Tugann an scéim seo airgead atá an-tábhachtach sna háiteanna iargúlta seo, agus mar a dúirt mé, áiteanna atá bánaithe leis na blianta anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá an-imní ar na daoine atá ina gcónaí ansin faoi céard atá i ndán dóibh faoin scéim seo, faoi céard atá i ndán do na coláistí samhraidh agus mar sin de.  Tá sé ráite, ag éirí as na cruinnithe poiblí atá ar siúl ar fud na tíre, go gcuirfear deireadh leis na coláistí samhraidh ar fad agus nach líonfaidh na mná tí isteach na foirmeacha atá curtha amach ón Roinn.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire Stáit go bhfuil coláistí samhraidh inár nDáilcheantair féin, ceann acu thíos in Eachléim, agus cuireadh isteach tuairim is £7,000 ansin anuraidh do na mná tí.  Ach ag deireadh an tsamhraidh, de réir tuismitheoirí ag teacht agus ag caint leis na scoláirí, agus mar sin de, is fiú £100,000 don áit sin scéim na gcoláistí samhraidh, agus bheadh an-bhrón ormsa agus sílim go mbeadh sé tubaisteach ar fad dá mba rud é go gcuirfí deireadh leis na coláistí seo.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, iarraim ar an Rialtas breathnú go géar air seo le go ndéanfaidh siad eisceacht, mar a rinne an Taoiseach féin cúpla bliain ó shin nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Airgeadais, i leith na scríbhneoirí de.  An nglacfaidh sé leis go bhfuil obair an-tábhachtach i leith chultúr na teanga ar siúl ag na mná tí seo agus an ndéanfaidh sé eisceacht de, mar sin, ó thaobh an Achta atá leagtha síos?  Freisin, bhí mé ag léamh an leathanaigh ar an bpáipéar sin <i>Anois</i><Col N="694" /> faoin socrú a luaitear atá déanta ag an Roinn Airgeadais agus ag Roinn na Gaeltachta leis, le Coiste na gColáistí Samhraidh.

Freisin, iad siúd a bhfuil ioncam inchánaithe acu ní ghearrfar cáin ach ar 10% den mhór theacht isteach (deontas Roinn na Gaeltachta móide íocaíochtaí ón gcoláiste).

    <P>Ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfadh an tAire Stáit soiléiriú dúinn faoi seo.  Iarraim, ar mhaithe na Gaeilge de, go gcuirfí deireadh leis seo, nó mura ndéantar é sin cuirfear deireadh leis na coláistí samhradh agus tabharfar buille marfach don Ghaeilge bheo mar theanga bheo bhríomhar.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a thabhairt don Teachta Kenny as a chuid ama a roinnt liom agus deis a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar an-tábhachtach seo chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis na Gaeltachtaí ar fud na tíre agus go speisialta le mná tí na nGaeltachtaí agus leis an Ghaeilge i saol na tíre, mar sílim gur sin an rud atá i gceist.  Agus caithfidh mé a rá, éinne againn a bhfuil cónaí orainn sa Ghaeltacht nó in aon Dáilcheantar a bhfuil Gaeltacht ann, go bhfuil imní agus éadóchas mór ar na mná tí i láthair na huaire <Col N="695" /> faoi na rialacha úra atáthar á gcur i bhfeidhm i mbliana maidir leis na coláisti Gaeilge.  Sílim go bhfuil dhá chuid sna rialacha chomh fada is a bhaineann siad le cáin ioncaim: (1) Go gcaithfidh gach bean tí uimhir chánach a chur ar fáil don Roinn roimh dheireadh na míosa seo sula mbeidh cead aici aon dalta a choinneáil i rith an tsamhraidh agus (2) &mdash; agus tá sé seo thar a bheith tábhachtach freisin &mdash; go bhfuil teorainn i mbliana, den chéad uair ó bunaíodh an Stát, den chéad uair ó cuireadh na coláistí Gaeilge ar bun, leis an uimhir daltaí ar féidir leo freastal ar na coláistí sin, is é sin, nach féidir aon duine breise a chur go dtí na coláistí i mbliana thar mar a cuireadh anuraidh.</P>
      <P>Anois, ba mhaith liom tagairt don phointe sin ar dtús, mar sílim gur céim ar gcúl mhór ó thaobh pholasaí athbheochan na Gaeilge é, go gcuirfí srian agus teorainn leis na daltaí, na buachaillí agus na cailíní a bhfuil fonn orthu dul chun na Gaeltachta agus an teanga a fhoghlaim. Is é an cuspóir agus an aidhm agus an rún atá ag gach páirtí sa Teach seo ná athbheochan na Gaeilge, agus tá fhios agaibh uilig gurb í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil de réir an Bhunreachta agus tá polasaí athbheochana againn ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Sílim go mbeadh sé an-deacair a mhíniú agus níos deacra fós a thuiscint cén fáth a bhfuilimid ag cur teorann le daoine a bhfuil fonn orthu dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus aithne agus eolas a chur ar an teanga agus ar mhodh labhartha na teanga.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt speisialta a dhéanamh do dhá choláiste i mo chontae féin, Coláiste Theileann agus Coláiste Uladh Ghort an Choirce, ceann de na coláistí is sine sa tír, a cuireadh ar bun fiú sular cuireadh an Stát ar bun, coláiste ar thug Pádraig Mac Piarais agus Ruairí Mac Easmainn agus laochra móra eile na tíre cuairt air, agus de thairbhe deacrachtaí a bhí acu anuraidh bhí na figiúiri aníseal. Bhí 76 acu.  Tharla an rud céanna i dTeileann.  Ní raibh acu ach 100.  Is é an moladh ba mhaith liom a dhéanamh maidir leis an dá choláiste sin ná go ndéanfaí eisceacht ann agus go dtabharfaí an mheánuimhir dóibh a bhí acu lena trí <Col N="696" /> nó ceathair de bhlianta agus ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire Stáit &mdash; agus tá mé ag déanamh go bhfuil sé i láthair anseo &mdash; agus an tAire Stáit sa Roinn Airgeadais, a bhfuil baint mhór aige leis an gceist seo, go ndéanfadh siad scrúdú agus machnamh ar an mholadh sin.  Sílim go mbeidh deacrachtaí móra ar an dá choláiste sin mura dtugtar cead dóibh na huimhracha a ardú thar mar a bhí anuraidh.</P>
    <P>Is é an pointe a bhfuil an chaint uilig ina thaobh ná an cheist chánach.  Sílim gur seo droch-am amach is amach le cáin a chur ar mhná tí a bhíonn ag coinneáil scoláirí Gaeilge.  Mar le cúpla bliain anuas níor tugadh aon ardú do na mná tí agus ní shílim go dtuigeann gach éinne sa Teach nach bhfuil na mná tí ag fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta ach trí phunt agus deich bpingne sa lá as coimeád gach dalta dá bhfuil acu.  Faoi choinne an airgid sin agus an méid a fhaigheann siad ó údarás an choláiste, is é sin £6 sa lá, tá siad ag iarraidh ar na mná tí ceithre bhéile sa lá agus leaba don oíche a chur ar fáil.  Anois, níl a fhios agam cén aít eile a mbeifeá ag súil le béile amháin air sin, ní áirím ceithre bhéile agus leaba.  Ní bhfuair siad aon ardú le cúpla bliain; tá an costas maireachtála ag dul suas, tá an t-airgead mar an gcéanna agus, fiú amháin, ní fhéadfadh scéim dá leithéid a thabhairt isteach ag aon am ba mheasa ná i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>Tá eolas agam agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil eolas ag an Aire Stáit é féin, mar go bhfuil coláiste Gaeilge ina Dháilcheantar féin &mdash; ar an obair an-tábhachtach a dhéanann na mná tí.  Ní amháin go gcuireann siad tithe agus leaba ar fáil do na daltaí seo ach bíonn siad mar mháthair acu.  Bíonn siad ansin le comhairle a thabhairt dóibh, bíonn said ansin le comhrá leo, bíonn siad ansin le iad a chur ina luí agus iad a chur ina suí ar maidin.  Tá siad cosúil le máthair ag na daltaí seo, agus is céim ar gcúl é a leithéid de mholadh a thabhairt isteach ag an bpointe seo. Anois, de réir mar a thuigimid &mdash; agus níl againn go fóill ach na tuairimi atá ag na páipéir ag an deireadh seachtaine &mdash; tá socrú de chineál éigin idir na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim agus na Ranna maidir leis an <Col N="697" /> cháin, agus deirtear nach mbeidh ach 10 faoin gcéad den airgead a fhaigheann na mná tí i mbliana inchánaithe; b'fhéidir 20 faoin gcéad an bhliain seo chugainn, agus cén áit a bhfuil sé chun stad?</P>
    <P>Rud eile, ní shílim, sna comhráite seo a bhí ag dul idir Comhchoiste na gColáistí Samhraidh agus na Ranna, gur míníodh an scéal sin i gceart do na mná tí.  Bhí mé féin agus an tAire Stáit, An Teachta Pádraig Ó Gallchóir, ag cruinniú de mhná tí i dTír Chonaill Dé Domhnaigh seo caite, agus tá siad sa dorchadas ar fad. Níl a fhios acu cad é atá ag dul ar aghaidh. Níl a fhios acu cé bheidh ag tabhairt cuairt orthu, níl a fhios acu cad é an cur isteach a dhéanfaidh sé seo ar liúntas leasa shóisialaigh nó aon liúntas eile atá á fháil acu. Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an chomhchoiste, dúirt siad go mbeidh 10 faoin gcéad inchánaithe.  Má tá an fear ag obair, an gcaithfidh an bhean cáin a íoc ar an iomlán?  Má tá an fear ag fáil liúntas leasa shóisialaigh, an gcaithfear an 10 faoin gcéad a chur san áireamh mar ioncam agus an gcaillfidh siad dá réir? Agus sílim gur uafásach an rud é sin, mar a dúirt me.  Níl na mná seo ag coinneáil na ndaltaí ar mhaithe le hairgead.  Dá mbeadh siad á dhéanamh ar mhaithe le hairgead ní dhíolfadh sé iad ar £6 sa lá. Anois tá traidisiúin fada sa tír.  Téann na coláisti Gaeilge siar sular bunaíodh an Stát agus an t-airgead a chaitheann Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Agus dúirt an Teachta Kenny anseo £347,000.  Sílimse gurb é sin an t-airgead is fearr a chaitheann an Roinn ná aon airgead a chaitheann siad ar scéim eile, gurb é an t-airgead is mó a bhfuil toradh air.  Mar níl aon rud go bráth agus níl aon rud a thugann níos mó sásaimh do éinne a bhfuil suim aige sa Ghaeilge nó cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ná na mílte de dhaoine óga as Baile Atha Cliath agus cathracha eile na tíre a fheiceáil ag rith ar fud na Gaeltachta i rith an tsamhraidh agus an Ghaeilge ar a dteanga acu.  Agus is iomaí duine a casadh orm féin, agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil sé mar a gcéanna leis an Aire Stáit, a chuimhníonn ar na laethanta brátha a chaith siad sa Ghaeltacht agus na cúpla focal a d'fhoghlaim siad agus an fonn a bhíonn orthu a dhul ar arís agus arís eile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Sílim má théann muid ar aghaidh leis an scéim seo go bhféadfadh sé deireadh a chur leis na coláistí Gaeilge.  Mar tá na mná tí i láthair na huaire ag seasamh le chéile agus níl fonn orthu agus ní shílim go líonfaidh siad na formeacha seo.  Mar sílfidh siad go bhfuil sibh ag teacht anuas orthu i bhfad ró-láidir.  Anois, tá scéimeanna sa tír seo &mdash; cuir i gcás an deontas £10 a gheibh na páistí scoile.  Chomh fada agus is eol dom ní áirítear é sin mar theacht isteach faoi choinne cúrsaí cánach agus mar sin de.</P>

D'iarrfainn oraibh an ciorclán a tharraingt siar agus ligean do na coláistí Gaeilge a dhul ar aghaidh leis an obair bhreá atá á déanamh acu ó bunaíodh iad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Airgeadais (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé buíoch an deis seo d'fháil le mí-thuiscint a bhaineann le h-íocaíochta i gcás iarrataisí ó mná tí i gcomhthéacs na rialacha atá anois leagtha síos maidir le deontaisí ón Stát agus dheontaisí ó eagraisí poiblí a réiteach. Tugadh isteach an scéim, i ndiaidh gealluínt sa cháin aisnéis i 1987 agus 1988 agus sa chlár <i>Athslánaithe Eacnamaíochta an Náisiúin</i> go mbeadh ceangal idir íocaíocht deontaisí d'iarrathóirí ar dheontaisí ón Stát agus eagraisí poiblí.  Bhí na moltaí céanna sa cháinfhaisnéis a bhí dhá mholadh ag an Rialtas deiridh ar 20 Eanáir 1987.  Séard atá deánta ag mo Roinnse ná ciorclán a chur chuig gach Roinn den Rialtas agus gach eagras Stait leis na moltaí a chur i bhfeidhm ar 1 Márta 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl i gceist sa scéim taobh amuigh d'eisceachtaí áirithe, ach go mbeadh uimhir cánach ag iarratasóiri le haghaidh deontaisí agus íocaíochtaí eile os cionn £500 agus faoi £10,000, lena chinntiú go bhfuil a gcuid cúrsaí cánach in ord mar ba cheart.  Is leor uimhir cánach céile an <Col N="699" /> iarratasóra, más rud é nach bhfuil uimhir cánach aige nó aici fein.  Baineann an chuid is mó de na heisceachtaí le híocaíochtaí a bhaineann le cúrsaí leasa shóisialagh nó le híocaíochtaí a thagann faoi rialacha nó treoracha ó Chomhphobail na hEorpa.</P>
    <P>Sé an fath nár cuireadh deontaisí ó Chomhphobail na hEorpa san áireamh go fóill na go bhfuil gá le tuilleadh scrúdaithe a dhéanamh maidir leis an scéim a chur i bhfeidhm ó thaobh cearta an té atá i dteideal deontaisí a fháil ó scéimeanna atá dhá reachtáil ag Comhphobail na hEorpa.  Tá an scrúdú seo a dhéanamh agus táimid ag súil go mbeidh na deontaisí seo dhá gcur san áireamh feasta.</P>
    <P>Beidh ar iarratasóirí a mbeidh íocaíocht thar £10,000 ag dul dóibh, teastas glan a chur ar fáil do na Coimisinéiri Ioncaim.  Ba mhaith liom a chur ina luí ar an bpobal gurb é an rud atá sa scéim ná deis le teastas glan cáin ioncaim a chruthú agus nach bhfuil aon bhaint aige le cáin ioncaim breise a ghearrú ar dhaoine atá istigh ar dheontaisí.</P>
    <P>Faigheann mná tí Gaeltachta deontaisí do chúrsaí samhraidh i nGaeilge ó Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tuigim gur deontas £3.10 sa lá do gach páiste atá i gceist agus go mbeadh an méid a bheadh le n-íoc le mná tí ó na mic léinn agus Roinn na Gaeltachta idir £500 agus £10,000.  Dá bhrí sin, tagann na híocaíochtaí ó Roinn na Gaeltachta taobh istigh do théarmaí an chiorcláin agus tá na mná tí curtha ar an eolas maidir leis seo.</P>
    <P>Ó tharla go mbeadh tús dá chur le nós nua a bhunú, maidir leis an gcaoi a dhéanfaí íocaíocht ar dheontaisí i rannóga eile agus do dhaoine aonaracha, níl mé sásta eisceacht a dhéanamh i gcás na mná tí.  Chuirfeadh géilleadh den chineál seo isteach ar an iarracht atá dhá dhéanamh le cinntiú go bhfuil cúrsaí cánach gach duine atá ag fáil deontaisí ón Stát in eagar cheart.  Mar atá ráite agam cheana ghlac an Rialtas deiridh, sé sin an Comhrialtas Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre leis an bprionsabal seo.</P>
    <P>Tuigim gur bhuail ionadaithe ó Chomhchoiste na gColáistí Samhraidh, a bhí <Col N="700" /> ag feidhmiú thar ceann na mná tí leis na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim, agus gur cuireadh in iúl dóibh de réir na scéime go mbeadh gá le huimhreacha tagartha cánacha. Shocraigh an dá dhream, le teacht i gcabhair ar na mná tí, go mbeadh réiteach mar seo a leanas i gcás daoine a bheadh i dteideal uimhir cánach a bheith acu ach nach mbeadh i dteideal cáin ar bith a íoc: (1)  Má tá a fear céile ag obair nó má tá uimhir cánach aige cheana, gur leor sin; i gcás na mná tí a bhfuil a gcuid fear ag fáil íocaíocht leasa shóisialaigh agus go bhfuil an t-iomlán a fhaigheann siad in íocaíocht deontaisí do na mic léinn £7,000 nó níos lú, tá sé socraíthe go gcuirfeadh na coláistí Gaeilge liosta na n-ainmneacha ar aghaidh chuig na cigirí cánach áitiúla le huimhreacha a dáileadh.  Ní bheadh aon ghá le foirmeacha i gcomhar cáin ioncaim a líonadh sna cásaanna sin; agus (3) i ngach cás eile, caithfidh na mná tí nó a gcuid fear iarratas a líonadh le huimhir canách a fháil.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a dhearbhú arís nach bhfuil sé i gceist sna rialacha seo cáin a ghearrú ar dhuine ar bith.  Séard atá i gceist ná a chinntiú nach mbeidh daoine ag fáil deontaisí on Stát agus san am céanna nach raibh siad ag íoc cánach a raibh sé de cheart acu bheith íoctha acu.</P>
    <P>Dá réir sin, caithfidh na mna tí glacadh leis na téarmaí atá leagtha amach i gciorclán mo Roinne.  San am gcéanna, tá réiteach sásúil déanta i gcás mná tí na Gaeltachta.  Tuigim go n-aontaíonn Comhchoiste na gColáistí Samhraidh leis an leagan amach seo.</P>
    <P>Tá sé an-éasca dearmad a dhéanamh ar shocruithe Rialtas Fhine Gael nó ar shocruithe an Chomhrialtais.  Ní féidir an dá thrá a fhreastal.  Agus de réir an Rialtais seo tá sé comhairithe go han-mhaith roimhe seo gur cuireadh £4 mhilliún ar fáil ar son na teanga náisiúnta.  Tá Teachtaí Fhine Gael ag iarraidh dallamullóg a chur ar dhaoine agus réabhlóid a chur ar bun sna Gaeltachtaí.  Níl sé sin ceart agus níl sé sin ag déanamh faic ar son na teanga ná aon mhaitheas ar chor ar bith do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 133 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget available for student grants is, in accordance with the Erasmus decision, divided between the member states on the basis of the number of third-level students modulated by the number of 18 to 25 year olds in each member state.  This system provides funding which is in general terms proportional to the number of third-level students in each member state and should secure a balanced participation in student exchange across the member states which is one of the objectives of the programme.  In 1987-88 distance and relative cost of living were also taken into account.  On the criteria applied, Ireland would have been entitled to just under 1 per cent of the budget for student grants, but, in fact got 1.29 per cent this year.  The total amount of money available for student mobility grants will increase substantially over the next two years of the programme. Given the terms of the decision <Col N="496" /> it is not possible to change the system for allocating the budget for student mobility grants.  However, if there is an opportunity for marginal adjustments over the coming two years of the programme I can assure the Deputies that our representatives on the Erasmus Advisory Committee will do everything possible to secure additional funding for this country.</P>
    <P>The educational benefits deriving from the Erasmus programme are the establishment of links and closer co-operation between third-level educational institutions across the European Community as well as the availability of financial assistance to help students spend a fully recognised period of study in another member state.</P>

    <P>(1) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally.  The figure shown is an estimate of the tax paid by full time farmers together with tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>In 1988, it is estimated that farmers will directly contribute a sum of £22 million, arising from the disease levy, in appropriations-in-aid to the Vote for Agriculture and Food.  An additional £0.3 million is estimated in receipts from farm visits by staff in connection with the farm improvement programme.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of flat-rate VAT addition to farm prices from 1.7 to 1.4 per cent will yield extra estimated revenue of £7 million in 1988.  The 1988 figures for health contributions and levy payments do not take account of arrears to be collected as a result of this flat-rate reduction, in the circumstances set out in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that receipts of £1.8 million will arise directly from farmers from licence, certification and permit fees, and fees for miscellaneous services rendered.</P>

      <P>Loughan House was acquired in 1972, at a cost of £63,000, for development as a place of open custody and has been used for custodial purposes since that time. Between 1972 and 1977 it was used for about 40 male offenders in the 16 to 23 age group.  During that period there was an approximate outlay of £19,000 on essential adaptations.  Between 1978 and 1983, pending construction of Trinity House in Lusk by the Department of Education, it was used temporarily as a special school for about 25 very unruly male offenders in the 12 to 16 age group. Since 1983 it is in use for about 115 male offenders of 18 years and upwards.  Capital outlay since 1978 totals £4.01 million. This was in respect of major adaptation of the original house acquired, additional buildings needed, staff accommodation, services, sewage treatment and access roadways.</P>

      <P>I understand that the ban on the use of growth promoters in beef production is being applied in all member states.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the ban on hormones in Ireland clearly enhances Ireland's image as a producer of good quality residue free food and also ensures continued access to all Community countries.  It dispenses with the need for separate certification in relation to hormones and affords highest recognition to our produce in the European Community market.</P>

      <P>Current Irish MCAs are as follows: milk and milk products, 3.5 per cent; beef, 2 per cent; cereals, 3.6 per cent.  The abolition of these MCAs through green rate devaluations would lead to equivalent increases in prices in the sectors concerned.  While the Commission's proposals for 1988-89 prices have not yet been announced, I will be pressing strongly for the abolition of existing MCAs in the forthcoming round of discussions.</P>

      <P>The reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty was introduced by the Minister for Agriculture on 1 April, 1982 and the conditions of the scheme were drawn up at that time.  There is no &ldquo;latest decision&rdquo; as the Deputy's question implies.

    <P>The claim by the lending institutions for payment of the Exchequer contribution towards the cost of the subsidies <Col N="523" /> given are, of course, subject to audit by my Department.

    <P>If these claims were to be accepted contrary to the original conditions it would cost the Exchequer approximately £1.4 million.

      <P>In any case where, following a medical referee examination, it is decided that a claimant is no longer entitled to benefit, the person concerned is advised of the right of appeal.  Should the claimant wish to exercise that right then a further examination by a different medical referee is arranged.  If, following this examination, the opinion of the second medical referee agrees with the first one then the claimant is invited to complete a statement of appeal.  The appeal is then submitted for consideration by an appeals officer who may decide if he considers it necessary to hold an oral hearing of the appeal. Appeals officers are statutorily appointed and are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions.</P>
      <P>The Department are not aware of any significant problem in obtaining medical reports in appeal cases.  Some 70 per cent of such cases are covered by medical reports received from the certifiers who will refer to any consultant examinations carried out.  If at the appeal stage the appeals officer considers it necessary, he may decide to request a consultant's report which will also be brought to the appellant's notice when obtained.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is concerned about any specific case, I will be happy to have the case examined if he forwards the particulars.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement scheme provides for the payment of a weekly cash allowance to help families on low incomes and a widower in employment can qualify for this supplement if his income is below the income limit specified for his family size.</P>
      <P>There are no other provisions in the social welfare code whereby payments can be made to persons at work in respect of home help.  Where a person is out of work and in receipt of a social welfare payment an adult dependant allowance is payable in respect of a person other than a spouse, having the care of the person's children.</P>
      <P>The question of future social welfare arrangements for widowers and other persons in similar situations will have to be considered in the light of proposals being drawn up at EC level on the application of equal treatment to men and women in areas of social security not covered by the previous directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1979.</P>

      <P>Following reinvestigation of the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned, he was assessed with means of £5.80 weekly derived from the profit from his holding and from self employment.  He is, accordingly, in receipt of £30.80 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £36.60 less means of £5.80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He appealed against the assessment on 11 January 1988 and, arising from <Col N="530" /> contentions raised by him in support of his appeal, his papers were referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries.  These inquiries were completed recently and his case has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination as soon as possible.  The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question relates to a survey of bathing waters conducted by the European Organisation of Consumers' Associations which was the subject of a statement issued last week by the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  I issued a comprehensive response to this statement yesterday.  The following is the text of my statement:</P>
      <P>Quality of Bathing Waters</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement issued by the Consumers' Association of Ireland (CAI) last week about the quality of Irish bathing waters was said today (21st) by <Col N="537" /> Padraig Flynn T.D., Minister for the Environment to be misleading, potentially damaging to Irish tourism and likely to cause unwarranted concern about health effects among Irish bathers.</P>
    <P>The CAI appears to have completely misinterpreted and misrepresented both the provisions of the EC Bathing Water Directive and a survey carried out for the EC Commission.  This study, according to the CAI statement, was designed &ldquo;to establish the extent to which the quality of the seawater at a selection of Irish beaches, 15 in all, complied with the EC Directive on the Quality of Bathing Water&rdquo;.  The fact is that, by reference to the mandatory standards of the Directive, a proper assessment of the results shows that all 15 areas surveyed have bathing water of very high quality.  There is no evidence, in the results presented, of any breach of the Directive.</P>
    <P>The CAI statement on the results points out that mandatory and guideline values are set by the Directive. However, its assessment of the results ignores this fact.  It is the mandatory values which must be met but the CAI assesses water quality only on the basis of the guideline values.  These latter are up to 20 times as strict as the mandatory values and are only in the nature of targets which EC countries should aspire to achieve.  They are not, in any country, the standard by which compliance with the Directive is assessed.  Failure to reach the guideline values does not mean that sewage pollution is in excess of EC standards or that there is any health risk to bathers.</P>
    <P>The survey on which the CAI statement appears to be based establishes its own classification system for the quality of waters, from &ldquo;very good&rdquo; to &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo;. This system does not conform to either the mandatory standards or the guidelines values in the Directive and no other basis for it is suggested either by the CAI or the authors of the survey.  The Minister has today raised this matter directly with the EC Commissioner concerned, Mr. Stanley Clinton <Col N="538" /> Davis, and has expressed his concern that criteria which have no standing in EC terms should have been used to judge compliance with established EC standards.  The Commissioner has undertaken to examine the matter.</P>
    <P>If standards other than the mandatory EC standards are to be used to judge the quality of bathing waters, the appropriate ones are the national standards laid down by the Member State in compliance with the EC Directive.  These national standards are required to be at least as stringent as the EC mandatory standards.  In Ireland, the national standards laid down in 1979 are <i>twice as stringent</i> as the mandatory standards for total coliforms and faecal coliforms &mdash; the parameters which are mainly used to detect the presence of sewage in waters. These strict Irish standards are almost universally met at Irish beaches and are completely ignored in the CAI statement. The CAI statement is particularly misleading in its comments on particular beaches.  For instance, at Duncannon, Co. Waterford (sic), Laytown, Co. Meath and Clogher Head, Co. Louth, levels of sewage pollution were said to be particularly high but the survey results do not substantiate this.  At Clogher Head, for example, the highest result obtained for total coliforms is almost 20 times better than the mandatory EC standard and 10 times better than the Irish standard.  Monitoring by Meath County Council and Wexford County Council at Laytown and Duncannon last summer confirmed the excellent quality of bathing water at these locations.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to heavy metals, the CAI comments are totally misleading. There is no EC standard for the levels of heavy metals in bathing water but the levels found in Irish waters were low to moderate by any standards.  In fact, the highest Irish value for mercury was the lowest maximum for any country except Portugal where the maximum was roughly the same.</P>
    <P>Last April, the Minister requested local authorities to increase significantly the number of bathing areas where <Col N="539" /> water quality is monitored.  Local authorities have responded positively and it is the Minister's intention to make regulations shortly giving full statutory effect to the Directive on the Quality of Bathing Waters at an increased number of bathing areas.  At present, the Directive applies only to Portmarnock, Dollymount, Courtown, Tramore, Fountainstown, Kilrush and Salthill. The mandatory standards have been met by all of these areas with the exception of Dollymount in 1986 and 1987 when the level of compliance with the standards for total coliforms and faecal coliforms was just below that required by the Directive.  However, the small margins by which these standards were exceeded at Dollymount do not represent a health risk for bathers.  It remains the Minister's objective to reduce further the level of pollution in our coastal waters.  Local authorities have invested over £200 million since 1983 in sewage schemes providing new and improved systems for the disposal of treated effluents and the abatement of pollution.  Much of this investment has directly benefited coastal waters. Investment in sewage treatment works will continue to have a high priority in the sanitary services capital programme.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister notes that the CAI plan to publish the results of the beach pollution study in the May issue of their magazine.  &ldquo;I hope that, before doing so, the Association will take steps to inform themselves of the basic facts and will not repeat the misleading and ill-informed comments included in their recent statement,&rdquo; concluded the Minister.</P>

    <P>It is not possible at this stage to say what the waiting list will be over the next five years.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the current planning guidelines in my Department the projected requirement for long stay nursing and welfare type accommodation in County Louth is about 300 beds. However, current policy is to strengthen and develop community based and other services for the elderly such as assessment and rehabilitation services with the result that the demand for long stay nursing and welfare type accommodation should fall significantly in the future.  Accordingly, any projected estimate of need in this area can be regarded as a tentative figure only which will be refined in the light of developments.</P>

      <P>When I launched the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment some months ago I identified two areas in particular which I wished the council to address as a matter of urgency. These were the role of modern continental languages and the role of technology in the curriculum.  I have recently arranged for two symposia to be held by the council on these issues.  The symposium on modern continental languages involved approximately 100 people including language teachers, school managers, representatives from CII, CTT, EC, the embassies and the cultural <Col N="560" /> institutes.  The symposium which considered the development of technology was also attended by a wide range of interests from within the education sector and from bodies such as the CII, ICTU, FÁS, CERT, EOLAS and other agencies.</P>
      <P>I am now awaiting a report from the council on their findings in relation to these issues.  In the interim I am having a circular letter sent to all post primary schools in order to ascertain the extent to which expertise in the teaching of German, Spanish or Italian may be under utilised in our schools.</P>

      <P>The building project for the <Col N="565" /> proposed new national school at Shercock, County Cavan, is ready for the invitation of tenders.  However, because of the pressure on the capital available to my Department for the national schools building programme, I am not in a position to indicate when it will be possible to authorise the project to proceed.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department will consider any reasonable request from the school authorities for grant-aid towards the cost of essential improvements to the school's existing accommodation.</P>
