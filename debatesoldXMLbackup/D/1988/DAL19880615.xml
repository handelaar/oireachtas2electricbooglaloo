      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 13, 14, 15 and 16.  It is also proposed that the Dáil shall sit later than 9 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted at 11 p.m.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 15 shall commence not later than 12.30 p.m. and shall be brought to a conclusion, if not previously concluded, at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.  It is further proposed that the proceedings on the Committee and remaining Stages of No. 16 shall be brought to a conclusion, if not previously concluded, at 11 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Health and the order shall not resume thereafter. Private Members' Business shall be No. 27.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the item that <Col N="306" /> you have just referred to, I would ask the Government and the Taoiseach in particular, to reconsider the question of concluding all Stages of the Housing Bill at 7 p.m.  I do so because a large number of amendments have been put down &mdash; approximately 60 at this stage &mdash; and indeed the Minister may wish to add additional ones but that is not clear at this stage.  I do not want to be argumentative about this but we do have the time.  Only four and a half hours have been allocated for this matter and I would request that the Government would reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the same matter, because it is proposed to take all Stages before 7 p.m. it makes it very difficult for Members to propose amendments for Report Stage, amendments which may arise as a result of the debate on Committee Stage.  I would ask, therefore, that Report Stage be at least deferred to a later time tonight or indeed tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I understand the Order of Business was probably agreed between the Whips, at that time we would have expected a smaller number of amendments.  It is not unreasonable that there would be a reconsideration of this matter, particularly with regard to the deferment of Report Stage.  It is common, as we all know, for Ministers to afford some consideration to be given to amendments between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  When over 60 amendments are to be taken in four hours, and also Report Stage, it makes the position on what is a very important Bill a little farcical.  I support the general thrust of my colleagues' request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These arrangements have been agreed between the Whips. It would become impossible to carry on business if arrangements made by the Whips are going to be challenged by individual Members in this way.  The arrangements were regarded as satisfactory by <Col N="307" /> the Whips and I do not propose to change them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that.  I would gladly propose it if the Taoiseach would second it.  We could agree on that now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach make time available this week so that the Government could discuss the situation that has arisen in the price negotiations in the Agriculture Council of Ministers of the European Communities in relation to the green £ and if we might use that opportunity to discuss the problem that appears to have emerged in relation to the application of the increase in structural funds for this country?  These two issues are of very central importance to agriculture and the whole process of development here.  It would be useful if before the end of this week the House could give the Government the benefit of its advice since the Government appear to have let these two issues slip through their fingers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing the query but I am not so sure it refers to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These negotiations are very ongoing at the moment.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food does not expect that there will be anything near conclusion in the agricultural price negotiations this week.  The other issue of the structural fund regulations is also very much at the debate and discussion stage. I do not want to rule out any suggestion of a debate on these issues, but I am not sure that this week would be appropriate. However, I will consider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that, in relation to the structural fund, it is expected a decision should be arrived at <Col N="309" /> by the end of this week and, I gather, by a written decision of procedures in the Council.  It would be important that the House would have the opportunity before the end of this week to express the view in support of what the Government should be trying to do.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has now defined a new kind of negotiation.  We are used to negotiations being in course and negotiations being ongoing, but now we have negotiations being very ongoing.  I am not sure what that means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the green £, it would be useful if the Government could show they have the unanimous support of this House for the stance they are taking on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 9 March this House agreed a Fine Gael motion calling on the central review committee to deal with the problem arising in vocational, community and comprehensive education. Unfortunately, the terms of that motion have resulted in a situation where the Government talks in the central review committee have broken down with one of the partners.  I would like to ask the Minister for Education if, following talks which I understand were held yesterday, there is a mechanism by which the Dáil will be informed about a report which was the result of a Dáil motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should find another way to raise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask by way of guidance what mechanism exists if the Dáil agrees a motion, and a report might be expected following that motion, to get that report through the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the <Col N="310" /> Deputy put down an appropriate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters I wish to raise.  The first arises from a review the Minister for Labour conducted of three items of legislation, one dealing with equality, one with unfair dismissals and the other with the manner of payment of wages.  When might legislation be expected under any of those headings?  Secondly, arising from discussions yesterday on the McVeigh case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please Deputy. We cannot go back to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to legislation coming before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter was decided yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say specifically relates to legislation coming before the House.  A suggestion was put that legislation was required to amend the Extradition Act in order that hearings would take place in future other than in the District Court.  May I ask the Taoiseach whether any consideration has been given to that in Government and if we can expect legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure any legislation was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No legislation was promised in regard to the last matter.  The legislation mentioned by the Minister for Labour will not be before the Dáil this session, but I will let the Deputy know in due course when we can expect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I note time has been allocated for the discussion of the Estimates of all Government Departments other than the Department of the Gaeltacht.  Might I ask the Taoiseach if it is the intention to provide the usual time for discussion of the Estimate for the Department of the Gaeltacht?  Would he not agree that, if it is to be simply buried in the debate on the Department of the Taoiseach, this House will not have an opportunity of debating either the Gaeltacht or the Irish language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate will be taken with the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.  Like any other Estimate, time will be available to Deputies to discuss the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not repetition. The amount of time available to Members to debate Estimates is extremely limited.  As I know from my limited experience in relation to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach, there will be a constraint on time.  I am specifically asking whether consideration will be given to allow a debate on the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What it means is that the combination of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of the Gaeltacht has been a disaster for the <Col N="312" /> Gaeltacht and the Irish language, as I predicted.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach tell us if any new legislation to deal with water pollution might be expected arising from the speech by the Minister for the Environment, who indicated that such legislation might be forthcoming, particularly in view of the destruction of yet another river over the last day or two?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

He has asked if the Government intend to bring forward rules and regulations, that is, subsidiary legislation, following an Act passed by this House.  I submit it is not appropriate to suggest to Deputy Shatter that he should put down a question on the matter because the normal response to a question is that the Government do not disclose their legislative intentions in response to questions.

    <Title>Child Care Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was coming to the conclusion of my comments but I should like to summarise very briefly my attitude and that of the Labour Party to this most important Bill.  The Labour Party broadly welcome this long overdue Bill but we express surprise that the Bill which has emerged has had such a long gestation period.  Two similar Bills have been published in the past three years, the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985 published by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond and the Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1987 published by the Labour Party.  This Bill is a watered-down version of the earlier <Col N="316" /> Bills, but I hope it can be improved in the course of passage through these Houses.</P>
      <P>The crucial question which every section boils down to is whether the Oireachtas and the Department of Health will provide adequate moneys to allow the far-reaching measures contained in this Bill to be implemented. It is all very well to provide powers to monitor, regulate and control but all these powers and regulations are useless if we have inadequate resources and staff to carry out the work being devolved to health authorities.  The health boards cannot function as now constituted with the inadequate legislative powers they have.  They have neither the money nor the personnel to support families, to assist children at risk and to monitor cases brought to their attention.  I and other Deputies have personal and direct knowledge of cases where exasperated health board officials have indicated that it is simply not possible for them to provide the type of help and support that vulnerable families need or require.  I have referred to the Wexford Family Centre, a pilot concept of total family support. This concept is well known throughout the United Kingdom but very rare here because the resources have never been provided for that type of family support. If we are simply to pay lip service to the desirability of supporting the child in the home setting then we need not put any resources into it, but if we are serious about allowing a family to nurture their children in the home background, then the type of back-up support which exists in other developed and civilised countries has to be provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another crucial matter which caused me great concern was the involvement of the District Court.  I said last night I would not be disparaging in my comments on the District Court, unlike a previous speaker.  However, the task force report on child care in 1981 and the Kennedy report of 1970 called for the establishment of specialist family courts. That request, lying on the shelves for more than a decade, has yet to be acted upon.  Although the legislative provision is not included in this Bill, we had hoped <Col N="317" /> the Minister would at least indicate that some other Bill would be brought before us to establish the family courts which everyone involved in the welfare and protection of children has called for.  We have yet to hear the Minister's view on this matter and I hope he will indicate when replying whether it is proposed to establish a family court.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill which make the court setting less formal, which allow decisions to be made without hauling a child through the court and enable matters to be discussed in private, but they are not far-reaching enough. Fundamentally, what is required is for judges to have specialised training and knowledge in the area of children's welfare. This is not the case now.  Justices of the District Court do not have that training and cannot be expected to make that sort of decision.  It is clear that we are not going to enact this legislation in this session.  I would hope the Minister would use the time during the summer recess to rethink this and to focus on the needs of family courts to see if provision could be made for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell underlined last night the urgency of this Bill.  He rang a few alarm bells when he indicated that some judges of the High Court had at least an attitude which would deny the legislative rights of health boards to take action under current statutes.  What that does is to underline for us the urgency of the legislation before us.  We have a difficult and contradictory demand on us to make good legislation but also to proceed with some haste.  We have not legislated in this area in any comprehensive way for 80 years.  So it is very important that decisions we make now are carefully thought out and carefully enacted.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister instanced the alarming increases in reported cases of child sexual abuse.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights I have seen reports from our various health boards of alarming increases in the sexual abuse of children.  I instanced a report from one community care area in the Eastern Health Board <Col N="318" /> region where reported cases of sexual abuse of children have risen from seven in 1982 to an alarming 79 in 1987.  One reason for this dramatic increase is the simple fact that people feel freer to make these reports; there is less secrecy and less terror of making reports to State agencies.  Even putting that aside, the sheer volume of reported cases now must underline for us the urgency of the type of legislation we are considering today.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent guidelines from the Department of Health on the identification, investigation and management of child abuse cases.  Very clear and cogent guidelines have been put down and are being acted upon and that is a very proper and welcome development. The Minister also indicated that he was authorising the extension of services and providing the resources to extend services at Temple Street and Crumlin children's hospitals to monitor child sexual abuse and to treat children who have been sexually abused.  I also welcome the allocation of £450,000 from the national lottery proceeds to health boards outside the Dublin area to tackle the area of child sexual abuse.  All those measures are welcome and this Bill provides the legislative framework to intervene in cases of emergency.  The Garda, in the first instance, can act immediately and incisively to protect vulnerable children who are at risk, and then the more measured procedures through the courts for the more long term solutions for children who are at risk are available.</P>
    <P>One of the issues I raised last night, and which I would again ask the Minister to focus his attention on, is the failure to establish a national children's council, something that has been requested again and again by all the caring agencies and by many people involved in the provision of children's care.  I honestly do not see any cogent or logical reason for not establishing a national children's council.  I welcome the monitoring committees at local health board level; but surely a national children's council, even on a fixed term basis, could be established to set out parameters, a basic bill of rights for children, to provide an overall picture <Col N="319" /> of our provision or lack of it for children and to protect children and strengthen the mechanism on the grounds for the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>I have asked also for the strengthening of family support services and I welcome section 3 in Part II of the Bill where the health boards have been given responsibility to promote actively the welfare of children with emphasis on providing support and assistance so that children can remain at home.  Again, we can pay lip service here.  We can say the positive thing, but if we do not provide the staff and the resources it is only lip service without any determination to actually break the cycle of deprivation that we all too often witness where a child who is abused or is from a deprived background grows up and has children who in turn deprived or abused.</P>
    <P>It is a cycle that is familiar to us all and dealing with it must be a priority if we are to call ourselves civilised.  The only way we can break that cycle is by actually reaching out through family support services in a holistic way.  To put a sticking plaster on that major problem is not to address the problem.  It would cause difficulties forever in the future unless we are determined to provide whatever it takes to break the cycle of deprivation that seems to be ongoing and never ending.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the power in the Bill to set standards for and to monitor playschools. One provision that is sadly lacking here is adequate legislative provison for playschools or nursery education.  We have a very fine standard of national schools from compulsory age, but unlike most western European countries we have no provision for young children; we have a patchwork and a variety of standards in existence throughout the country ranging from the very good to the appallingly awful.  This provision in the Bill enables the physical framework to be monitored.  I would hope that in the fullness of time more comprehensive legislation would also set standards for <Col N="320" /> those who wish to engage in what is probably the most important task that anybody in society is given; the task of nurturing and developing very young children, who are so impressionable and vulnerable.  We have no legislation at all. One can set up a pre-school in a garage and charge fees, and one does not need to have any standards of hygiene or safety or standards of education for oneself. We yet have to tackle that problem.  The ultimate answer is obviously to have a proper State-funded, State-run pre-school system or a kindergarten system attached to the national school.</P>
    <P>Now we have a dwindling schoolgoing population and in a few years we will have more and more vacant classrooms in the primary schools.  Surely that is a golden opportunity to establish State-sponsored, pre-school, nursery or kindergarten education.  We will have the qualified teachers, as they are being trained, and reducing numbers in the classes will help.  The opportunity will be available in the future to provide on a State basis for all our children from their earliest age.  Otherwise we are leaving to chance and to the market provision for that earliest type of education.  The result of that is already evident, with children arriving into formal education some from economically deprived backgrounds and already doubly deprived, being backward linguistically and educationally and not having any experience at all of socialising. Other children coming from the better nursery schools have a tremendous advantage.  We have a responsibility and an obligation, if we are to cherish all the children of the nation equally, to make provision in this area.</P>
    <P>I spoke last night about solvent abuse. This is something that most of us find shocking but the problem has, at least, receded in recent times from the absolutely disgraceful levels of some years ago. However, the reality is that there are still many young children walking the streets of this city and other cities and towns breathing into plastic bags filled with glue and staggering around in an intoxicated state.  I have acknowledged that it is tremendously difficult adequately to cope <Col N="321" /> with that situation, but some responsibility must be placed on those very few irresponsible retailers who subordinate everything to profit and sell cans of glue, often in large quantities, to children. They must at least be suspicious that the objective is not wholesome activity but to intoxicate those children and their friends and damage their health.  I welcome unreservedly the new powers under this Bill to call such irresponsible retailers to account and impose upon them a fine of £1,000 and 12 months in prison.</P>
    <P>I dealt last night at some length with the detailed provisions of the Bill.  It is a major piece of legislation, the most comprehensive Bill introduced into this House for 80 years.  I shall end by making my most serious and damning comment on it.  It is that if we are serious about making provision for children who are vulnerable, if we are serious about protecting the most innocent in our community, then we must provide not only words in a Bill but resources for health boards to enable them actively to carry out the functions to be developed upon them.  I am afraid the record of this Administration to date is to run in the opposite direction.  I can only hope that when the Estimates are published at the end of this year we shall see that the goodwill and good intentions that are incorporated into this Bill are not merely lip service, but that the Government are determined to protect the vulnerable child.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity for a debate on the Child Care Bill, 1988.  The big difference between the present Government, Fianna Fáil, and all the Opposition parties is that we do not just talk about social legislation; we take positive action.  Since coming into office, allowing for the many and varied problems in the Department of Health in relation to the Estimates and to the general situation, my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, in particular, has been instrumental in bringing forward these two very important pieces of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal has been talked about <Col N="322" /> since 1970 and has been particularly active since 1980, being highlighted in the reports of the Task Force on Child Care. After just 15 months in office of this Administration, we are bringing forward this Bill, the Child Care Bill, 1988, which is required.  We are bringing forward the most comprehensive legislation dealing with child care for some time.</P>
    <P>Most of the Deputies who have contributed to this debate so far have concentrated not on what is in the Bill but on what is not in it and they claim should be in it.  I would like to bring the House back to the Bill we have before us and point out some of the important legislative provisions which it contains.  The purpose of this Bill is to update and strengthen the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who are being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk.</P>
    <P>The need for the Bill was graphically illustrated by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, in his opening speech.  While the vast majority of our children grow up in the love and affection of their parents, there are some who are not so fortunate.  At any time about 2,500 children are in the care of health boards, the majority because their parents are unable to look after them, whether due to physical or mental illness, alcoholism, marital breakdown or other family crises.  Other children enter care in much more dramatic circumstances. They are the victims of child abuse, whether it be physical, emotional or sexual.  In 1986, the total number of confirmed cases of all sorts of child abuse known to the health boards was 494, of which some 274 were victims of child sexual abuse.  Figures are still being collected from health boards in respect of 1987, but all the indications are that the total number of reported and confirmed cases in 1987 will be substantially higher than 1986.</P>
    <P>At present, a person over 15 years of age may not be placed in health board care regardless of how desirable this might be in his or her interests.</P>

      <P>During the debate on the 1985 Bill, a number of interested parties sought an increase in the age up to which children may be taken into care.  They pointed out that some older children would benefit from being in care but cannot be admitted under the present law.  We have accepted this and propose in section 2 to define &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill as a person under 18 years.  This will raise to 18 years the age up to which health boards will be responsible for children and the age up to which children may be admitted to care.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is one of the most important provisions of the Bill.  It imposes a duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children.  The boards will be required to provide child care and family support services such as social work support for families at risk, counselling services, pre-school services, home help services, child guidance, day fostering, family resource centres and out-reach projects for the young homeless.</P>
      <P>Section 4 extends the powers of health boards to receive children into care on a voluntary basis.  At present, about 80 per cent of the children in care are there on a voluntary basis.  In future, health boards will be able to receive into care, without reference to the courts, orphans and abandoned children and, with the consent of the parents, children whose parents are unable to care for them due, for example, to serious illness, sudden bereavement, marital breakdown or other family crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the establishment of one or more child care advisory committees in each health board area which will be composed of persons with a special interest or expertise in child <Col N="324" /> care, including representatives of voluntary bodies providing child care services.</P>

      <P>Part III (sections 10-13) deals with the protection of children in emergencies.  Section 10 provides that a garda would be empowered, without warrant, to remove to a safe place a child who had been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, where there is an immediate and serious risk to his health and well-being.</P>
      <P>Section II empowers the district justice to make an emergency care order.  This would authorise the removal of a child from his home and his placement in the care of a health board for up to eight days where there was an immediate and serious risk to his safety.  Part IV, sections 14 to 24, set out the circumstances in which the courts may place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk, in the care of or under the supervision of health boards.  Section 14 imposes a statutory duty on a health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order, as appropriate, whenever this appears necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present health boards are not under any obligation to take children into care although some doubts have been expressed about their legal authority to <Col N="325" /> do so.  Section 14 will eliminate any such doubts.  Section 15 provides for the making of a care order which will suspend the parents' rights to custody of the child and place him or her in the custody of the health board.  The grounds on which a care order could be made are that the child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or that the child's health, development or well-being has been or is being avoidably impaired or seriously neglected, or there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child's health, development or well-being is likely to be avoidably impaired or seriously neglected.  In addition, the court would have to be satisfied that the child required care or protection which he is unlikely to receive unless he was placed in the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>Unlike the present legislation, the focus here is on the needs of the child rather than on the wrongdoing of his parents.  This will ensure that the needs of the child are given full and careful consideration and we are satisfied that the proposals in the legislation are adequately covered in District Courts.  A supervision order &mdash; section 16 &mdash; would authorise the health board to have the child visited regularly at home to ensure that he was being properly cared for and to give his parents any necessary advice and assistance.  If the board were not satisfied they could ask the court to give directions to the parents as to the care of a child or, if necessary, apply for a care order.  A supervision order would apply for 12 months and would be renewable.</P>
    <P>Section 27 will enable the Minister to make regulations governing the placement of children in foster care and section 28 confers a similar power in relation to residential care.  Section 31 enables a health board to provide support and assistance for persons who were formerly in care.</P>
    <P>There are two areas covered by the Bill in which I have a particular interest, the provisions in relation to the supervision of pre-school services and the controls on the abuse of solvents.  Deputy Howlin wanted pre-schools to be organised and <Col N="326" /> run by the State but, in present economic circumstances, this is not possible.  Part VI provides for the introduction of a system of inspection of services for pre-schools children, for example, day nurseries, creches, playgroups and pre-schools.</P>
    <P>Section 58 proposes to make it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they will be abused.  Provision is made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  Both these provisions have been subjected to some criticism which is totally unjustified.  I wish to respond to some of the points that have been made and, no doubt, the Minister will elaborate on what I have to say. Solvents are a very difficult area to control. I am aware that there is widespread public concern about the dangers to children from the apparent growth in the incidence of solvent abuse.  Already this year there have been reports in the media of some six deaths of young people related to solvent abuse and this is, as far as is known, the highest number of deaths ever recorded from this cause.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the provision in section 58 in relation to solvent abuse does not go far enough and that there is a need for more stringent legal measures. Parents will have to be vigilant in relation to solvent abuse and ensure, where possible, that solvents are kept out of the reach of young children and are not available to them.  The Government carefully considered a number of possible measures which it has been suggested would help to combat solvent abuse but all of them had to be rejected for one reason or another.  I should like to mention a number of these and explain the difficulties involved with them.</P>
    <P>Firstly, there is the suggestion that there should be a complete prohibition on the sale or supply of solvents to children. The difficulty here lies in the wide range of ordinary household products which may be abused.  These include all forms of aerosols, adhesives, nail varnish remover, paint strippers and butane gas, to name just a few.  To impose a ban on the sale or supply of all these products <Col N="327" /> to children and young persons would be totally unrealistic and would be impossible to enforce.  It might be suggested that a ban need only extend to the most commonly abused solvents but the danger is that this could result in children switching to other more lethal solvents.  I understand that there is some evidence of this in the United States when a partial ban on sales of solvents was introduced.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion has been that the manufacturers of solvents should be required to include an additive which would give off an unpleasant odour.  The difficulty with this is that the odour would also affect ordinary members of the public using solvents for legitimate purposes and this idea had to be rejected on that ground.  Finally, there was a question of making possession of a solvent by a child an offence and giving the Garda power to confiscate solvents in the possession of children.  The Government and I are totally opposed to criminalising solvent abuse.  Those who engage in this behaviour tend to be young and must grow out of the habit very quickly.  It would be impossible to enforce such a law and nothing would be gained by making it an offence.  On the contrary, it might only send this form of abuse underground and make it more difficult to help the children involved.  Indeed, I am chairman of the National Drugs Advisory group and on numerous occasions we have discussed how to cope with the growing problem of solvent abuse.  Some of our members have advised shopkeepers in particular to ensure that these solvents are not sold to children, where there is any suspicion that they could or would be abused.  Solvents should also be kept at higher level in shops so that they are more inaccessible.</P>
    <P>In relation to cigarette lighters which are freely available and very cheap, shopkeepers should generally refuse to sell them to young people.  We must all take a responsible attitude to this problem because it has resulted in many deaths and other problems.  Many people are receiving treatment at present due to the abuse of solvents.  There is a further difficulty in allowing the Garda to confiscate <Col N="328" /> solvents from children.  As I indicated earlier, most of the products which contain solvents are perfectly harmless in their own right and it would not be proper that children who had these products for perfectly good reasons should be at risk of having them confiscated.  The most appropriate and effective response to solvent abuse is information and education. In that regard, there is always the danger that if you inform young people how solvents are abused it could give rise to them experimenting with these items because, fundamentally, they are household products. The most harmless product can be abused.  The abuse of butane gases and other forms of gas have given rise to the most serious problems.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that parents should be conscious of the use of these domestic products.  They should be stored in an appropriate way out of the reach of children. Items which are used in offices and by young children at school for corrections in copies are dangerous products and can be abused.  There is now a much greater awareness of the problem and a good deal of community concern about it. For example, many retailers have already taken steps on a voluntary basis to restrict the supply of solvents to young persons.  I must emphasise that shopkeepers should be vigilant and aware of how easy it is to have these products abused.  When they notice a trend developing of young people buying butane gaslighters, or other such items for which they would not have any particular usage, they should where possible make the parents aware of the fact and if necessary refuse to sell them.  However, I would accept that more needs to be done to bring home to young people the dangers inherent in solvent abuse.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, I have instructed the health promotion unit of my Department to take urgent action in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the scope of control on pre-school services, there has been some criticism of the scope of Part V of the Bill which deals with the inspection and supervision of services for pre-school children.  It has been suggested that these provisions do not go far enough and that <Col N="329" /> a much stricter registration system is required.  One Member this morning raised the question of State pre-schools. The House will realise that this would be a very elaborate and expensive provision. I have to say that I do not accept the view that the provisions of the Bill do not go far enough.  While I am anxious that children availing of the services at present should be properly cared for and protected from possible abuse, equally I am determined that the rights of parents to place children in the care of persons of their choosing should not be interfered with unnecessarily.  I might mention that the Task Force on Child Care Services for their part cautioned against the establishment of, and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;an elaborate supervisory system which could interfere with a great deal of ordinary neighbourly help at present being carried on.&rdquo;  Furthermore, a survey conducted by the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents found that over 60 per cent of infants and pre-school children of working mothers were being looked after by grandparents and other relatives, or by non-relatives who reside in the family home.</P>
    <P>The ISPCC are doing excellent work in this area, as are the Irish Pre-School Playgroup Association, an organisation which has many of the voluntary pre-school groups registered with them. Again, they laid down requirements in relation to facilities for pre-school groups.  The first question needing to be determined is: what services or arrangements in relation to pre-school children should be subjected to statutory control? I am firmly of the view that arrangements made by parents with relatives and friends for the care of their children should not be subject to State intervention. There are two main categories of services which will be subject to statutory control under the provisions of this Bill.  They are first, nurseries, creches and child-minding services operating on commercial lines and, second, community playgroups and other non-commercial services.</P>
    <P>All of these services will be required to comply with requirements which will <Col N="330" /> be set down in regulations which will be made following consultations with the Minister for Education.  Health boards will be required to have the services inspected from time to time and will be able to call on the assistance of inspectors of the Department of Education, particularly in the case of services with an educational dimension.  While it is my intention that any necessary improvements in the services would be brought about by way of advice and encouragement, health boards will be able to prosecute in the event of serious or persistent failure to adhere to the relevant regulations.  On conviction a court will be able to impose fines and, more significantly, order that a service be ceased, either temporarily while improvements are being effected or for a longer period. Generally speaking, these services being provided on a neighbourly basis are quite good.  But the fact that in most areas there will be a controlling factor on the part of health boards will ensure a general improvement in the services.  These provisions are more than adequate to deal with any abuses likely to arise in the area of pre-school services.  It is neither necessary nor desirable that a comprehensive registration process, with all its attendant bureaucracy, be introduced at this stage.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations such as the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, with many associates nationwide, are very much involved in this area.  Parents themselves are conscious of groups or facilities available where their children would be properly cared for and would have certain control over those services.</P>
    <P>It is important that the provisions of this Bill be implemented as quickly as possible because they have such vital implications for many young children who may be in danger at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important Bill on children's rights to be introduced in this House for many years.  However, I will not describe it as the most comprehensive. Already a number of speakers have pinpointed areas in which its provisions are inadequate.  Like others, <Col N="331" /> my biggest fear is that the provisions of the Bill will constitute just pie in the sky if the necessary resources to finance them are not made available.  For example, the £450,000 mentioned by the Minister in his remarks yesterday will go a small way only towards alleviating the many problems obtaining.</P>
      <P>We have awaited this Bill for many decades.  Since it was published two weeks ago many of us have not been afforded sufficient opportunity to consult or consider many of its important aspects. Therefore I welcome the lapse that will occur between the Second and Committee Stages.  We shall have the summer months to consider our position.  Likewise I hope the Minister will reconsider his position in relation to a number of issues raised.</P>
      <P>The major question marks hangs over how many of the provisions of the Bill can be implemented.  For example, how will the health boards carry out the duties and responsibilities assigned them under the provisions of the Bill when they are at present wallowing in a sea of debt, finding it almost impossible to fulfil their present statutory responsibilities?  Therefore one must ask how they will undertake to fulfil these additional responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a frightening statistic yesterday of the incidence of child abuse.  In Cork the social workers assigned to the child abuse clinic there have been taken off other duties in the Southern Health Board region.  If we are merely to rob Peter to pay Paul then the provisions of this Bill will be rendered meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that health boards are encountering serious problems at present, as are the health services overall.  Our major concern must be now how we will resource the provisions of the Bill.  Only in recent days has the lid been lifted off the can of worms obtaining in our health services by two very courageous consultants in the Meath Hospital.  It is my prediction that in the days and weeks ahead there will be more incidents of people involved in the health <Col N="332" /> services coming forward, ignoring the dangers of legal actions against them, people who will with courage outline the problems being encountered in the health services and the hardship and cruelty being experienced because of the effects of unplanned cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Bill itself, the underlying principle of any Children's Bill must be to provide a comprehensive and effective system to cater for every aspect of the problems that can affect a child in its formative years.  If we invest major resources in improving the health of children we will be assured of an overall standard of good adult health and a corresponding decrease in the dependency on health services.  At present we do not have a national, regional or local policy in relation to child care.  Resources for the disturbed and difficult 12 to 16 years old group are almost non-existent. Staffing levels, especially in the statutory agencies, are hopelessly inadequate to give in-depth family support when required initially.</P>
    <P>The publication of this Bill must be welcomed, as was the Bill published in 1985 by the previous administration, following on almost two decades of discussion about the reform of legislation and services for children.  The Tuairim Committee report of 1966 constituted the first stage in the development of the debate, followed shortly afterwards by the Kennedy report and, subsequently, by the Task Force report of 1980.</P>
    <P>There has been great demand for a major reform of our children legislation and, as a result, I know that this Bill will be warmly welcomed.  Many of the proposals in this Bill are long overdue but, unfortunately, it still fails to tackle some of the most central issues which many of the people working in the area of child care have been promoting for quite some time.  Our Constitution does no clearly define our childrens rights and, unfortunately, the present Bill does not totally establish the right of children and does not eliminate the many ambiguities.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell yesterday went on at length about the inadequacies of the District Court system in dealing with <Col N="333" /> family problems and children's problems. I am not an expert in that area but the views put forward yesterday by Deputy McDowell, sometimes colourfully, should be borne in mind by the Minister.  From my own limited experience of District Courts, they are totally unsuitable and inadequate for the hearing of children's cases, mainly because they are overcrowded and too busy and because the formal nature of the legal proceedings at those courts is totally unsuitable.  The absence of any reference to family courts is a major defect in this Bill and I would ask the Minister to reconsider that in conjunction with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Task Force report of 1981 recommend the setting up of children's courts, under the jurisdiction of district justices but these recommendations have not been incorporated into the existing Bill. One of the most central issues in any legislation is how the services can be delivered and I and my party feel that the present health board structure may not be the most efficient vehicle as it is inefficient and fragmented.</P>
    <P>The duties and responsibilities of the health boards are being strengthened considerably in the present Bill and yet there is nothing in the Bill which establishes child care authorities within the health structure, as recommended by the Task Force.  These authorities would provide a more efficient service for the children and for their families.  This Bill does not tackle the promotion of welfare and the development of support services at community level.</P>
    <P>The duty of the health boards is to promote the welfare of children and to develop services of a preventative nature &mdash; but these facts are not set out clearly in this Bill.  Will the Minister clarify this in more detail when he is responding to the Second Stage debate?  The Bill does no recognise the role of the local and voluntary organisations which are helping those in need, and which have been of paramount importance down through the years in terms of children's rights.</P>
    <P>The child care advisory committees within the present health board system are talking shops and are inadequate as <Col N="334" /> were the advisory health committees which were abandoned by the Minister in recent times.  They are abandoned illegally by the Minister because he has not brought in amending legislation to legalise the decision.  Will the Minister say today when this legislation will be produced?  From the proposals set out, it would appear that the child care programme will again be the Cinderella of the community care programme, which itself is the poor relation of all of the health care programmes, despite the lip service that has been so frequently applied to it.  In recent times the whole status of the community care programme in the health boards has been further downgraded by cutbacks, despite assurances by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy and the Task Force reports recommended the setting up of an independent national children's council, which would make recommendations on the development of child care programmes and which would foster co-operation between the numerous agencies involved in child care.  This would also promote research and inform the public of developments in child care services. The omission of the national children's council is a major defect of this Bill because such a body is necessary to ensure that we do not have to wait another 20 or 30 years before we have an updating and upgrading of the laws in relation to children.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the broadening of the definition of the child to cover the 16 to 18 year olds.  I hope this will bring about an improvement in the problem of youth homelessness by eliminating the confusion over the statutory responsibility for their care and protection.  Any new provisions must, of course, be accompanied by the development of the support systems for mothers, which, at the present time, are totally underdeveloped in this country.</P>
    <P>Because Ireland is unique amongst the countries of Europe in that our annual birthrate is nearly 50 per cent higher than the average, we must lay greater emphasis on the development of our child care <Col N="335" /> programmes.  One in three of our population is aged under 14 as compared with one in five in other European Community countries.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and poverty here have meant that nearly half a million Irish children come from families who are entirely dependent on social welfare payments to survive.  That is a frightening figure.  About one third of the child population are, therefore, living below the poverty line and many of these are suffering from malnutrition.</P>
    <P>It is very fashionable at the present time to talk about child abuse and neglect by parents but we tend to forget that the greatest child abuse and neglect has been by the State.  This is because the State has not recognised the plight of children in Irish society for many years.  The State's failure to bring about reform and improvement in child care facilities has meant that the State has been the greatest child abuser.</P>
    <P>The Task Force report identified the need for planning and providing services at different levels.  It recommended child care services required to meet the needs of deprived children, and family support vehicles, such as those required by some families, but especially by families under stress of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, resources for the disturbed and difficult 12 to 16 yer old groups are almost non-existent. Decisions about this age group tend to be made on the basis of resources available rather than need and this is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Task Force of 1980 recommended also, a reorganisation of the child care authorities and that the health boards should more adequately meet the needs of the 1980s and 1990s.  The Task Force also recommended reorganisation of the service provision of the personal social services and suggested the specific development of the preventative family support services, such as the day-care facilities pre-school and residential facilities, and the school psychological services.  Preventive services are more cost-effective in economic and therapeutic terms.  For <Col N="336" /> example, in Cork there has been very little in the way of effective development of family support services to meet the reality-based needs of families.  In the Cork area over the past two years more than 45 teenagers were left in high risk living situations because, primarily, there was no adequate residential facility, either short term or long term, to meet their needs.  This is unacceptable and it is a major scandal.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the authorities are aware of teenagers who have left home due to a breakdown in relationships and these teenagers were placed in bed and breakfast accommodation or in bedsitters, in contravention of the Department of Health boarding out regulations in placing children under 16 years in unapproved accommodation.  This was brought about because of a lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>Again, I have been informed by professionals working in the field from their broad based experience of case conference decisions, where the group decision arrived at was to receive children into care or to apply to the court for fit person orders, that, in fact, these decisions could not be acted upon because there was not a relevant or adequate residential facility available. Many teenagers are still living in damaging and unacceptable home environments.</P>
    <P>Mentally handicapped teenagers have been placed in adult psychiatric hospitals because of the lack of suitable residential resources.  This particular problem has come about because of the cutbacks and it is indeed a major problem at present.</P>
    <P>Disturbed children and teenagers with serious behavioural problems cannot be helped because there are no local or national resources to facilitate caring for such people.</P>
    <P>As has already been pointed out, glue sniffing is a major problem in our cities and has caused quite a number of deaths. It is tragic that teenagers with serious solvent abuse problems are involved in petty crime, such as joyriding.  Some of these teenagers are only 14 years of age and because they are 14, they are too old <Col N="337" /> for admission to any local or national residential facility and have graduated therefore, to more serious crimes resulting in court appearances and, in some cases, prison sentences.</P>
    <P>It is sad to think that many of these teenagers will be permanently dependent on State services for most of their lifetime because counselling or therapeutic services were not made available to them when they were most needed.  As a result, many of them will never have normal relationships and naturally, many will have failed marriages.  This situation is intolerable and must not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Children in the poverty trap have a constitutional right to be cherished as equal members of our society.  But instead they are rejected and neglected because the relevant statutory authorities do not have the resources to care for them.</P>
    <P>The organisations dealing with these types of problems badly need resources. The families and children throughout the country need supportive, preventive and residential facilities to offer a basic service.</P>
    <P>Properly staffed residential homes for teenage boys and girls are required and the motto which I am stealing from an organisation must be &ldquo;a resource in time saves crime&rdquo;.  Resources must be made available to support families when problems first start to appear.  We must not continue to offer a fire brigade service when the house has already burnt down. The reality is that our child care service is undergoing a major crisis.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was published first, I met with a number of people who work in the child care area and they painted a frightening picture for me.  They confirmed my own view that there is indeed a crisis in child care and that the recommendations of the task force have been largely ignored, that is the recommendations to modernise the law relating to child care and protection.</P>
    <P>Professionally trained staff are badly needed both in the voluntary and statutory agencies throughout the country even to adequately meet the referral rates coming in, in relation to teenage marital <Col N="338" /> violence, alcohol abuse, barring orders, marital breakdown, child abuse and child sexual abuse.  These problems are the daily diet of social workers throughout the country and these problems are increasing all the time.</P>
    <P>The lack of psychological services for primary school children presenting behavioural problems is hopelessly inadequate. I feel that primary school teachers are next in line to parents in creating trusting relationships with young children and are in a unique position to detect when a child might have emotional or educational difficulties.</P>
    <P>Primary schools provide the best focus for preventive programmes for children at risk, hence the management structures for neighbourhood youth projects for children and teenagers, projects pioneered by the Department of Health on the recommendation of the task force must be developed and broadened.  One such project has been operating successfully in the Cork area for many years now &mdash; the Mayfield Neighbourhood Youth Project.  That type of service must be extended to all areas where there is deprivation and a need for this type of service.</P>
    <P>Child guidance services may be needed for severely emotionally disturbed children when there is a complete breakdown of the school situation.  These children are usually seen at central clinics or at the child guidance centres.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a school psychological service to help teachers to cope better with classroom learning for emotionally deprived children.  The school is the best setting for a child to receive help with educationally related problems as he or she is in familiar surroundings. This would be more acceptable to parents as they may be unwilling or unable to attend clinics.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that in socially deprived areas of our larger cities, school psychological services are imperative.  I am very supportive of the pilot schemes which are working in certain areas at present.  These schemes are in areas where there are largely local authority developments with high unemployment <Col N="339" /> and widescale social deprivation.  An educational, psychological service to primary schools is, therefore, essential.  Ireland is the only country in western Europe at present that does not have this type of service.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I think that the development of neighbourhood youth projects, to which I have referred, in deprived areas, alongside a school psychological service would be the first step in helping those children and their families who are most in need.</P>
    <P>I must pay tribute to the neighbourhood youth projects throughout the country which have done a great job.  I would ask the Minister to extend this type of project to other areas.  These projects are an attempt to apply and practise all that we have learned about child rearing in the past 150 years.</P>
    <P>Until the middle of the last century, it was not generally agreed that society had a duty to protect children in need who were vulnerable.</P>
    <P>An increasing preoccupation, in the late 19th century, with the legal rights of children, was complemented by the work of Freud and the great educationalists who explored the world of the child and the importance of childhood to the kind of adults we became.  They established the link between a happy child and a responsible and mature adult and they developed the belief that happy children tended to have stable and supportive relationships later in life.</P>
    <P>Our child care services as they developed tended, however, to offer deprived children the wrong kind of care too late.  Typically, the child who was seen to have a problem or to be the problem, was plucked from his family and his environment and placed in a residential home.  By the time the State intervened, the appalling family situation was irreversible.  No matter how well run a residential home was, it could not compensate for the home environment.</P>
    <P>Fostering was also an option but the question that had to be asked was, why not help the family and child to overcome <Col N="340" /> the problems, while keeping them together?</P>
    <P>It was easy to identify children who had physical defects but very difficult at all times to identify children whose handicap was intense unhappiness.  The pendulum swung, therefore, away from intervention to a system based on prevention.</P>
    <P>The Government established the Task Force on Child Care Services in 1974 and that force was asked to recommend how services to deprived children and children at risk could be improved and to prepare new legislation to protect the child and to propose administrative reform.</P>
    <P>The task force, in an interim report, recommended the setting up of the youth projects I have referred to in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. The projects were to be located in deprived urban communities where children were at a considerable disadvantage by comparison with those in better off and more organised areas.  The projects were set up in order to provide vulnerable children with meaningful relationships with reliable adults outside their families, through which they could learn to value themselves and gain confidence and competence in their personal and social relationships and skills.</P>
    <P>The target group of children were to consist of those who lacked stable adult models with whom they could identify and establish relationships of trust; whose parents or parent substitutes have been inconsistent, rejecting or disturbed; whose parent or parents have become so dependent on their children, emotionally or otherwise, that they are inhibiting the natural process of growing; who, having severe family, educational or social problems needed outside help, and who, while not experiencing emotional problems or lacking in stable adult relationships, had established or were likely to establish patterns of persistent and serious delinquencies. While I am dealing at length with these types of projects, let me say there is a grave need to develop these projects in more detail and in a more-widespread manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> The project set out to combine under one roof, as it were, the insights and techniques of individual case work and group work with children and their families. Because no two children in the project would have the same need, the project had to tailor their activities to the needs of the child.</P>
    <P>After much discussion between the task force and the planning team set up by the Department of Health, the team recommended that each project would have a management committee who would be representative of the agencies providing services involving the neighbourhood, the community in which the projects were allocated and the parents of the children of whom the projects were aimed.</P>
    <P>The small number of these projects that exist have been a magnificent success. They have pioneered a new method of working with children in deprived urban areas.  The essence of the projects was to prevent children being damaged in any way and to mobilise the community in which they were located on behalf of the children in that community and so combine the voluntary organisations in the community and the statutory organisations. In fact, they represent a novel partnership in child care between statutory and community interests in order to enhance the welfare of children.  I believe the projects have been good in principle, practical and effective.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length with the issue of neighbourhood youth projects because I firmly believe there must be liaision between the statutory bodies and the voluntary organisations in the area of child care.  This type of initiative is essential in any future development of child care programmes.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue and I hope it will not be talked to death as many Bills have been in the past.  As I mentioned, I have reservations about the Bill.  It has raised major questions about the supply of resources in order to implement the provisions of the Bill.  There is no real planning for the child care service at present and the provisions of this Bill <Col N="342" /> when it becomes law will have to be operated by social workers.  I estimate that we need about three times the number of social workers we have at the moment to operate the provisions satisfactorily. Page 44 of the NESC report of 1987 indicates how this country is sadly lacking in social workers for the delivery of services in the field.</P>
    <P>The NESC report on community care services has indicated a major shortage of social workers in our health services. This Bill gives greater responsibility to health boards, but the Minister has not specified where the resources are to come from in order to enable the health boards to carry out the new responsibilities now being placed on them.  I believe the £450,000 referred to by the Minister yesterday goes no way to providing the facilities required.</P>
    <P>Another omission on which I ask the Minister to comment in his response is that the Bill does not mention the problems facing the children of the travelling people.  It does not set out what support systems might be put in operation for this very deprived sector of our society.  Many voluntary organisations are already catering for the needs of children of travelling people but these organisations have very little statutory support.  One of them is St. Catherine's School in Model Farm Road in Cork with which the occupant of the Chair is familiar.  The resources are greatly stretched and they are totally dependent on voluntary contributions to carry out their and society's duty to this sector of the community.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in his response to define the term &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; which is used in the Bill on a number of occasions.  My reading of the Bill does not reveal a definition of that term.</P>
    <P>Another of my reservations is that the family courts for child care cases have not been set up, and my party share that reservation.  At present the practice is that children's cases are squeezed in during the normal court day's business. If the Minister is not going to include children's courts in this Bill on Committee Stage, then at least a specific day <Col N="343" /> should be set aside to deal comprehensively and fully with child care cases.  As speakers said yesterday, a district justice handing out fines for illegal parking and other minor offences of a summary nature then sets his mind to dealing with cases that can affect the whole future of a child and the situation in which a child can find himself for maybe ten years.  That is unacceptable and must be changed, so I ask the Minister to have a rethink on this major omission from the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to the section dealing with residential care, I ask the Minister where the money is to come from to meet adequately the provisions set out in the Bill.  In the southern area, for example, there is not one place in north Cork to cater for children needing residential care in a home or foster home.  That is how bad the service is at present.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with supervision of pre-school services, an area about which I have some knowledge.  Like most Members I have read the many frightening stories about the standards of some pre-schools and I should like to refer to a case highlighted in a national newspaper. It was reported that some unscrupulous childminders in Dublin are caring for up to 50 children at a time with very little personal assistance.  It was also reported that those people charge as much as £40 per week for each child and that in some cases the premises used are not covered by insurance.  The report claimed that those people were breaking the law.</P>
    <P>The appalling situation outlined was described by the chief executive officer of the ISPCC as being a &ldquo;complete free for all&rdquo;.  He stated that the statutory and voluntary agencies were very aware of what was going on but that it was taking much longer than had been originally thought to bring in effective legislation and regulations to deal with that abuse. The reality is that until we pass the Bill before us there is no legislation governing the setting up of creches or pre-school play groups here.  It appears that anybody can carry on this type of operation in <Col N="344" /> their own homes, in converted garages or any other building, and that the only way the law can catch up with them is when they do not conform to fire regulations, if they have inadequate insurance cover or if the employees do not pay tax or PRSI.  It is surprising to see how many parents leave their children for the entire day with people they know little about. In many cases the conditions are totally unacceptable.  Many of those who run playschools may appear to be normal and caring individuals, but they could be mistreating children while in their care. There is a great need for new and tougher regulations and for that reason I welcome the provisions in the Bill.  The system that exists is totally unprofessional in dealing with the pre-school groups in existence.</P>
    <P>Having set out the frightening picture portrayed in a recent newspaper article, I should like to state that the majority of pre-school operations are good.  The people running them are caring and kind. The majority are registered with the Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association, which has been in existence for 19 years. Pre-schools, generally speaking, are staffed by conscientious and dedicated people.  My three children attended pre-schools in Cork in recent years and I was very impressed by the dedication and the hard work of the teachers.</P>
    <P>The Irish Pre-Schools Playgroup Association's role in the development of the pre-school sector should be recognised by the Minister in the Bill.  That association was established to support parents and playleaders, to help them to understand and provide for the needs of young children with emphasis on previous experience.  I hope the role of the association is recognised by the statutory bodies and the Minister because they have helped to raise the standards of playgroups by maintaining a specific code and by holding meetings, discussions, lectures and appropriate training courses in support of those objectives.  They have tried to raise the level of public awareness of the needs of pre-school children and the value of the playgroup.  They have published a number of well researched articles to achieve their objective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Section 6 sets out certain standards for playgroups but I should like to ask the Minister if, in implementing standards for pre-schools which are not funded by the State, he will be attempting to implement standards for this private sector activity that the Department of Education are not adhering to.  I am referring to the very bad condition of some of our primary schools.  I am all in favour of raising standards in the pre-school area in the private sector, but we should set the example.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain the role he intends for the Minister for Education in the supervision of pre-school services?  I should like to know if the reference to the Minister for Education in the Bill will mean that a change of policy is proposed. My impression is that the Department of Education up to now have not been interested in the development of pre-school groups.  Is the change coming about because of pressure from the teaching organisations?  The Minister should tread carefully in regard to this, and I hope that the playgroup and pre-school activities do not become too formalised and an extension of the primary school system.  I understand that about 20,000 children are being taught in our pre-schools. I welcome the standards announced by the Minister in regard to premises, adult/child ratio, safety of equipment and the proper provision of play material suitable for that age group.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an input by the Department of Education, but I hope the Minister can explain that Department's role in regard to playgroups and pre-school centres, I welcome the introduction of legislation which will ensure a code of standards for playgroups but I should like to suggest that the people who have pioneered this valuable service be recognised and their views taken into consideration.  The Minister should incorporate some recognition for the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with children's residential centres.  Most centres in existence will not take children over 12 years.  Now that we are extending the definition of <Col N="346" /> the child to 18, we are working in the abstract again and not dealing with the resource problem.  A code of standards is long overdue.  Section 44 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Any person inspecting a centre on behalf of the Minister under this section may make such examination into the state and management of the centre and the care of any children therein as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>My reaction to that provision is that I hope a specific body, or individual, will carry out this function.  The standards must be consistent at all times and they must not vary from area to area.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 46 I should like to ask the Minister the grade of the official who will be carrying out the function outlined.  In my view it will be necessary to engage the services of a senior social worker who has a depth of experience in regard to this matter.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 53 (5) deals with a charge which may be made by the health board. I should like to ask the Minister to elaborate on that provision.  I recognise that wealthy families can afford charges imposed on them but there are many families who will not be able to afford the charges that may be imposed.  Health boards should be flexible to this provision. The Departments of Health and Education were responsible for residential care of children.  The Department of Health had responsibility for certain children's homes while the Department of Education were responsible for reformatories and industrial schools.  At the same time the Department of Justice had responsibility for probation hostels. Almost all those services are provided by voluntary bodies through public funding.</P>
    <P>Until 1984 the two categories of centres were industrial schools under the Department of Education and homes under the Department of Health.  The schools changed their <i>modus operandi</i> in the seventies following the recommendation in the Kennedy report &mdash; a family group home approach instead of the traditional institutional approach.  I am pleased to be able to say that a lot of progress has <Col N="347" /> been made through the reconstruction and modification of existing homes and the construction of new units.</P>
    <P>At the same time there has been a reduction in the number of children in such homes, from 2,000 in 1969 to 755 in 1982.  By 1982, the majority of these places were occupied by children who were referred by health boards.  In the same year, there were 20 homes approved by the Department of Health catering for nearly 500 children, compared to 600 children in 1969.  The reduction in figures indicates the availability of community support and community-based services.  The task force report recommended that all residential services for children should be the responsibility of the Department of Health and the Child Care Authority in each region.  In 1982, the Government acted on this recommendation.</P>
    <P>If other recommendations of the task force are to be implemented, considerable changes in the present structure and range of services will be necessary.  I would like to refer to page 79 of the National Economic and Social Council report published in October of 1987.  This report says of the recommendations of the task force report that if these recommendations entail a range of residential services within or within easy access of each community care area they should be provided.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to refer to the substantial supplementary report published with the final report of the Task Force on Child Care Services.  That supplementary report argues that the objective of the report cannot be achieved within the present administrative structure. The supplementary report recommends that a fourth health board programme entitled Family and Child Care be set up and that within this programme, there would be two assistant programme managers with the responsibility for child care authority functions and one with responsibility for other welfare functions.</P>
    <P>It appears that, up to the present time, <Col N="348" /> there has not been any widespread discussion of this proposal and I would ask the Minister if, in the rearrangement of the health board programmes he announced recently, he is considering this option.  I would like him to give some response to that question.</P>
    <P>My party have put forward proposals this week in relation to the reorganisation of the health services.  We proposed the abolition of the health board structure. Under the community care programme proposals that we set out, there is a definite role for the child care programme. We set aside the position of project manager for the management of the child care services.</P>
    <P>This report has been lying around since 1982 and I would like to know what is happening with it.  Until such time as the present administrative issues are sorted out, the development of services may be hindered seriously.  The Bill, as I have said, without being comprehensive, is a major Bill and it is unfortunate that this whole area of child care has been neglected throughout the decades.  I hope there will be a full and realistic debate on Second Stage &mdash; I have gone on longer than I had intended &mdash; and that we will tackle Committee Stage early in the autumn session.  I would ask the Minister to conclude this Bill in early autumn.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through both Houses because we need to implement the proposals that are set out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I would repeat the reservations and fears that I have about this whole legislation that it might be just pie in the sky and that the health boards, because they are under-resourced, will again fail to carry out the statutory functions of this legislation, through no fault of their own but due to lack of finance from central Government.  The Minister has responsibility, while we are dealing with this Bill in a comprehensive way, to spell out how he proposes to resource the many recommendations of this Bill.  The speech by the Minister yesterday gave to no clue as to how the services can be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I join in the welcome for the Bill.  It has been long awaited.  Pressure for it has been growing in the last couple of decades, in proportion to the growth rate of psychologists and social workers in our community.  It would be interesting to see if there is a correlation between the two. It is good that that pressure was there and that the Bill has now emerged.</P>
      <P>The general feeling is that the services for children at risk were inadequate in terms of their spread and sophistication. The question of response in terms of speed is something that needed to be dealt with.  The Bill goes a long way towards meeting these problems and providing a satisfactory solution to them.  As other speakers have said, how satisfactory the response will be in practice will depend on how much resources can be allocated to it.  There is already a basis for a good service.  With organisational tightening and the legislative changes proposed here I would imagine that the existing service will be able to provide the remedies that the Bill envisages for the problems that are apparently on the increase.  They were always there but we are only now getting to know them.</P>
      <P>The Bill has to lay the framework for what is always a difficult problem &mdash; that is the conflicting rights of parents and children in cases where there are allegations of neglect and ill-treatment. Resolving that dilemma has caused difficulty in other jurisdictions.  We have to be careful that there is at all times a middle-of-the-road approach and that extremes and the views of extreme people do not become ascendant in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are examples from other jurisdictions of how concern with children and obsession with neglect can go off the rails and produce results that were obviously unthought of by the people who frame legislation.  One example was widely reported from Sweden about two years ago when a child was removed from the custody of its father because a social worker decided that the level of eye contact between the father and the son was not satisfactory.  He indicated that there <Col N="350" /> was probably neglect and that the child's development into a full personality would be inhibited.  That child was then taken into the care of the State.  That is an indication of the extreme lengths to which what is provided for in the Bill can go unless there is at all times commonsense monitoring from the top of the people involved.</P>
    <P>The other example, equally frightening, took place in the last 18 months in the north-east of England when apparently a huge number of cases of sexual abuse of children was found by two doctors.  As a result of their findings, a large number of children were taken from their parents and put into care, in spite of the protestations of the parents that no such abuse had taken place.  By the time the machinery to review what had happened was brought into play, immense &mdash; I hesitate to use the word psychological because it is used too much &mdash; harm had been done to the children and the parents concerned.  It was proved conclusively that the findings of the so-called medical experts had been erroneous.  People are very slow to challenge medical expertise.  It is an example of the danger of medical experts, or experts of any ilk, being given unfettered control and unfettered liberty to operate in their area of concern.  These are two graphic, real and recent examples of the very important need for the Department of Health, as the national monitoring agency, to ensure that in the application of the remedies provided for in this legislation extremes will be avoided.  That is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" />&ldquo;2.&mdash;A draft of every regulation proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to ensure that any regulations brought in or made by the Minister under this Bill would be made by way of a positive motion before the House.  It is quite common for legislation to enable the Minister to implement legislation by way of regulation, setting down certain conditions that must be complied with, etc.  Generally, the motions introducing these regulations are made by way of a negative motion, that is, a motion that the regulations will stand, unless a motion is carried by the Dáil annulling the regulations. But, because of the nature of Standing Orders, it is virtually impossible in practical terms for such a motion to be brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The Government will not allow Government time for any such motion, and in the nature of things those parties which have access to Private Members' Time are loth to use that time for the purpose of annulling regulations.  If you look through the records of the House you have to go back to 1963 or thereabouts before you find a motion to annul regulations being debated in this House.</P>
    <P>Many of the regulations the Minister will be making will be very important in regard to how the sections of this Bill will be implemented, the variety of obligations that will be placed on various local authorities.  It is important that those regulations be brought before the House by way of a positive motion and that they must be agreed by the House before becoming the law of the land. That is the reason I am proposing this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have generally adopted the position where we prefer positive amendments.  In many cases where we have brought forward these amendments the Minister concerned has <Col N="352" /> accepted them.  Now we are faced with this legislation which covers more than just the question of the homeless, but at the same time we feel it is sufficiently important to ensure that any regulations made by the Minister under the Bill will require the positive approval of the House before it becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a suggestion for the Minister's consideration on Report Stage in relation to this section and the proposed amendment. It is my view that the accommodation to be made available to the homeless &mdash; accommodation which would normally be available to those on the local authority housing waiting list &mdash; should be of a permanent and acceptable nature.  When people are under 18 years of age, and their best interests require that they be accommodated as homeless persons, consideration should be given to some form of sheltered or protected housing.  In all other cases the Minister should give some consideration to age. He might consider a proposal along the lines that a person must be at least 18 years old, and that his best interest required that he be housed by the housing authority, or that he be a married person. Otherwise a person aged 15, 16 or 17 years could come to a local authority seeking permanent housing.</P>

      <P>There will be a positive and constructive approach to these matters because I consider them to be of considerable importance.  I am glad to see Deputies are in such good form because it bodes well for the rest of the business of the day.</P>
      <P>In response to the point raised by Deputy De Rossa, every regulation under this Bill, in accordance with section 5 (2) of the Housing Act, 1966, is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House and passed within 21 sitting days. This procedure has applied to all regulations made under the housing code since 1966.  I do not accept that it is necessary to provide that housing regulations be laid before each House in draft form and then await formal approval.  I do not think that is a good way of proceeding. To do this would be wasteful of time, would lead to unnecessary delays and would be contrary to what is contemplated in the legislation and, I think, what is in the Deputy's mind as well.  For that reason I ask him to consider that laying regulations in draft form before the House would not be a means of speeding up action and would be contrary to what he would wish to see happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister does not appear prepared to accept the spirit of the amendment at least.  The point I made was that the negative motions which are normally allowed for in legislation are not always satisfactory. Generally, in practical terms it is not possible for Opposition Deputies to get time to have motions annulling regulations debated in this House.  There have been numerous examples of that in the past year alone.  There was some disruption in this House as a result of one incident where regulations were being made and it was not possible to have them annulled by the Opposition parties. As a general rule it is best that regulations of an important nature should be debated in this House and that Deputies should have an opportunity of expressing their views.  By sticking to the procedure whereby regulations have to be annulled <Col N="355" /> by a motion, the Minister is effectively preventing debate on the regulations.  For that reason I will be pressing the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not preventing anything but is trying to speed up the whole process.  If a draft regulation had to be brought into this House and discussed before it could be put into force it would be very wasteful of time.  The House might like to discuss regulations in due course but when we are doing something positive to deal with the matters in this Bill it would be very time consuming to bring draft regulations before the House for debate.  It might lead to the regulations not making the grade.  I cannot see why the Deputy is pursuing this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Regulations made under the Housing Acts are laid before the House anyway and an opportunity is given in due course for Deputies to discuss them and amend them if they so wish.  The system is already in place.  To discuss draft regulations would be time consuming and would not achieve the aims set out in the legislation.  I would ask the Deputy to reconsider his position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this question at length on a whole variety of Bills to which I have contributed. Other Ministers have taken the point on board.  This Minister says he is concerned about the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; in the amendment and I am quite happy to delete that word if he is prepared to accept the amendment on that basis.  In practical terms, because of the Standing Orders of this House and the way business is dealt with, negative motions with regard to regulations are rarely debated.  One has to go back more than 20 years to find an attempt by Opposition Deputies to annul regulations. Important regulations are proposed under this Bill and a means should be <Col N="356" /> found to have them brought to the floor of the House so that Deputies may have a chance to change them if the majority so decide.  I am prepared to delete the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; if the Minister feels it would delay the implementation of the regulations. It is quite common for regulations to be effective from the date they are made and any subsequent annulment does not interfere with decisions taken from the date they were made.  There is no problem in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sense of what we are trying to achieve here is obvious.  It permeates all the amendments on the Order Paper.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the amendment.  It is designed to deal with the difficulty which many of us feel will arise if the adjudication on a range of matters in the Bill falls upon the local authority.  The whole thrust of this Bill is to improve the situation for people who are within its ambit.  One of the problems is that the local authority are to be both judge and juror.  In principle, that conflict of interests is likely to result in some of the worthy objectives of the Bill not being achieved.  I have no personal preoccupation as to which of these amendments would be acceptable to the <Col N="358" /> Minister.  As far as I am concerned they all seek to achieve the same ends.  Indeed, if the Minister has a preferred form of words which he would like to offer, I would be agreeable, but the essence of it is that the local authority would not have the ultimate and absolute power of adjudication on the issues in that section. That is essentially what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>That is a matter to be discussed.  I would be quite happy that it should be somebody other than the local authority.  It could be a matter of regulation by the Minister or some other forum.  What is being proposed is what I find unacceptable.  If some alternative were proposed we would look at that.  I am not drafting this Bill; I am simply trying to amend it.  The essence of it is that at the moment if one allows the local authority to make the rules, to decide, for example, if people are to be housed under the section and what kind of regulations to introduce for their own operations, unquestionably by definition and by nature, as any of us would, they will draw them up to suit themselves, to ensure that they stay within the financial constraints they are under and that the pressures on the staff that they have will not be exacerbated more readily by accepting additional responsibilities. That is the problem.  This Bill is not essentially a financial Bill.  It is a Housing Bill. What all of us are concerned about is to ensure that the obligation to house is fully met and I feel that the inclusion of the power of adjudication by the local authority is in conflict with the spirit of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That sums it up.  It is a Housing Bill and because it is a housing Bill it is necessary to avoid ambiguity. That is specifically indicated in that section about who makes the decisions and about the responsibility of housing authorities for the homeless.  Let me sum <Col N="359" /> it up this way.  We have to say in law who is responsible for taking the decision and as far as I am concerned it is the housing authority.  For that reason if we delete that, it will make a nonsense of the whole legislation as framed.  I would ask that that be considered in the best light, that, the housing authority being the ones best qualified, the ones in place and the ones with the responsibility in law to deal with housing matters, this Housing Bill should be their responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a problem?  In relation to amendments No. 4 and 36, the purpose of our amendment was not in fact to take it out of the hands of the local authority because we assumed that the section itself was giving the power to the local authority to provide accommodation.  The purpose is to try to ensure that the decision made with regard to whether a person is homeless or not is based on information as far as can reasonably be ascertained.  It is for that reason we were seeking to delete &ldquo;in the opinion of the authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;as far as can be reasonably established&rdquo; because, as we know, the function in the local authority is not, in all cases, carried out by the manager who, in theory, is the person responsible, but is carried out by officials down the line and such officials may, for whatever reason, form an opinion about a particular applicant who is claiming to be homeless.  We are trying to ensure that it is possible for the person who is seeking accommodation to present evidence of homelessness or for others who are seeking to assist that person to get accommodation to do so, and that the official would therefore be obliged to take that information into account in establishing, as far as can be reasonably established, that the person is homeless.  The decision should be on the basis of the evidence presented and not simply based on the opinion of the authority or, indeed, as in practice would be the case, on the opinion of the official concerned.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in my mind <Col N="360" /> and there is nothing specifically stated in this legislation that would prevent a person or persons or an organisation on their behalf making any evidence whatsoever available to the housing authority adjudicating in their case.  In fact the whole thrust of this is to make it possible for individuals and organisations to have an input into it and that is covered in every single aspect of the legislation.  I cannot quite appreciate why the Deputy takes that point of view because there is nothing specifically stated in the legislation to give credence to what the Deputy is saying.  For that reason the principle has to be established as to who makes the decisions and the only authority available for making decisions that can work is the housing authority.  That is clearly enshrined in the legislation.  If the Deputy could accept that principle, then a lot of the other sections deal with what they must consider and from who.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Minister is making that there is nothing in the Bill which prevents evidence being presented.  What I am concerned about is the extent to which an official who will be acting on behalf of the manager of the local authority will be enabled to simply form his own opinion as to whether or not a person is homeless.  The amendment should read &ldquo;as far as can reasonably be established by the authority&rdquo; and that can be rectified if that is necessary.  I assumed that it was understood that it would be by the authority but in any event what I am trying to ensure is that decisions made by officials are based on evidence presented to them and not on the basis of the impression which the person creates on them and that therefore they form an opinion with regard to the person's entitlement to accommodation. That is the sole purpose of my amendment, that it is an opinion based on the position being reasonably established by evidence presented and not simply on an impression presented by the individual seeking accommodation.</P>

      <P>I see what the Deputy is <Col N="361" /> getting at.  Opinions expressed by individuals or groups representing them will not be frustrated by this legislation. Chaos would reign if a situation arose where the organisation putting forward a case was seeking to dictate as to who would be regarded as homeless and what action would be taken in their case.  There has to be an adjudication system somewhere and it rests with the housing authority. I would think that the best way is that the individuals and organisations would have available the means of putting forward the evidence that should be put forward on their behalf, and that then can be adjudicated on under certain guidelines set down in the legislation and the best decision taken.  The Deputy will find that the thrust of the legislation is in broad conformity with what the Deputy would like in this regard, and I would ask him to accept that.</P>

      <P>We want, if you like, belt and braces in relation to inclusion of the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;night shelter&rdquo;. I am speaking now exclusively in relation to amendment No. 5.  It mentions a person who is living in a hospital, county home, night shelter, or other such institution. That is as the Minister has drafted it.  We are asking him to consider the inclusion of the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;night shelter&rdquo; and before &ldquo;or other such institution&rdquo;.  It could be argued that the Minister's definition is adequate, but from people who are directly involved in this area of activity it <Col N="363" /> has been indicated to me &mdash; and I suspect to other Deputies &mdash; that they would like this additional inclusion.  It does not alter the sense, purpose, or intent of the subsection, but it does clarify it.  The Minister mentioned his desire that the law would be as unambiguous as possible and this would remove an area of potential ambiguity. That really is the essence of it.  It is an additional clarification rather than an attempt to change the thrust or direction of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  Let us discuss the matter a little.  The concern behind some of these amendments may be misplaced.  The term &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; was consciously omitted from the definition of a homeless person in this Bill and in the 1985 Bill for the reason that hostel accommodation incorporating both support services and decent standards of privacy is an appropriate and essential element in the range of accommodation necessary to meet the needs of homeless persons.  It is precisely for this reason that the 1985 Bill provided that local authority housing subsidies for the first time would be made available for the provision of local authority hostel accommodation. Since then, the present Government have revised the voluntary housing scheme to allow the provision of modern hostel accommodation for homeless persons to be effectively grant-aided up to 95 per cent by housing authorities, with the full cost of these grants being made available by the Department.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for the arrangement in that regard.</P>
      <P>It might be helpful to add that I regard the existing Simon hostels as coming within the definition of &ldquo;night shelter or similar institution&rdquo; and I shall make that point very clear in the guidelines that will be issued to local authorities on the implementation of sections 2 and 10.  I hope that is helpful if the Deputy was referring to Simon hostels and wished to have them included.  That is the case.</P>

      <P>The amendment would be harmful in its effect in that it could hinder the development of appropriate modern hostel accommodation for homeless persons as, legally, such accommodation could not be used by a housing authority to meet the housing needs of those homeless persons for whom it is most appropriate and suitable.  I see hostels as part of the solution to this problem.  A certain amount of privacy exists in the kind of hostels about which I am talking.  It might be summed up in the following way.  I would be particularly concerned about people who would be leaving institutions and entering hostels such as I have referred to and we could be doing something that would not help the situation in their circumstances.  I regard the Simon hostels as coming within the definition of &ldquo;night shelter&rdquo;.  Perhaps that might go a long way towards easing Deputy Quinn's mind in so far as my interpretation is concerned.  I give him the undertaking that if he accepts that, the guidelines will point that out quite clearly in so far as the operation of the housing authorities is concerned, subsequent to the guidelines being drawn up.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Minister's concern as I understand it, first the section has to be taken in its entirety for the purpose of law and paragraph (a), which precedes the one which we seek to amend, gives the housing authority the right to evaluate what is the available stock of potential accommodation.  Then it proceeds into paragraph (b).  I can see the concern of the Minister in one sense that all sorts of hostels, An Óige and the rest, would be involved because of the generic word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;.  My concern, as the Minister has accurately pointed out, is for Simon, or Legion of Mary, or voluntary organisations' accommodation to be catered for.  I would not wish to broaden the definition so that there would be a possibility of somebody who happened to be in a place called a &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; being at a disadvantage in regard to this section.  I am anxious to make progress.  The amendments are not down for any frivolous reason and if the <Col N="365" /> Minister will clearly make reference to this in the regulations, then I would be prepared to consider that.  The amendment, I must point out, is also in the names of other Deputies and it would be their choice and decision.  I understand the Minister's concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the difficulties and the fear the Minister has, but the problem should be dealt with by reference to having in the Bill a definition for the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; and its inclusion. It is one thing for us to talk about the matter here and set out certain factors in regulations, but I am looking at the day-to-day operations of the local authority about which I am most concerned.  I would prefer to have the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; in the Bill.  After all, particularly in view of the earlier discussion on the other section, it is not an absolute obligation on a local authority but an option which they have.  I want the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; to be available for consideration and not have some systematic exclusion of that word.  If the word is defined so as to exclude the kinds of areas mentioned by Deputy Quinn, as I tried to do in amendment No. 6, which I gather we are taking with amendment No. 5, we would be able <Col N="366" /> safely to include that word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; in a qualified way to include places such as an overnight shelter and refuge, which are legitimate areas from which people should be housed.  I do not see a problem if one is clear about what one means by &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;.  Why not define it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's apprehension in this matter is misplaced.  His concern is that if &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; is included in the Bill it would exclude modern accommodation which also provides social support services and accommodation for persons of a long term or virtually permanent nature.  If there is a problem in relation to institutions of that nature, the institutions are being misnamed as hostels. Consequently, that is not a valid excuse or reason for not including the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; in the Bill.  Various Deputies have tabled amendments seeking to define &ldquo;hostel&rdquo;.  In my amendment I sought to exclude hostels which were provided for the purposes of accommodation for students, persons in the course of training or employment or holiday or recreational need.  Indeed, I went further and suggested that a hostel for the purpose of the Bill would have to be registered with the local authority as operating in the local authority area.  Quite clearly, in relation to the category which the Minister mentioned, if, for some extraordinary reason, the operators of that accommodation want to continue to call it hostel &mdash; although I would have thought they would not want to do so &mdash; then that would not be regarded by the housing authority as suitable accommodation for the purposes of this Bill to be included in the register which the housing authority would be obliged to keep in operation under amendment No. 11.  I do not see the Minister's justification for refusing any or all these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister offered to clarify this point very specifically in terms of the regulations.  Obviously, he had time to consider these amendments and he is clearly unhappy with them.  In section 12 and others there are various definitions which pretty well run parallel <Col N="367" /> in what they are trying to do.  If the Minister indicated that he would use these wordings, or a formulation based on them, in the regulations, directions and guidelines he gives to local authorities, we will certainly be able to make progress. There are pros and cons for putting in the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; and having a definition. We could go on arguing about it but each side has valid points.  My concern &mdash; which is shared on all sides of the House &mdash; is that a person would not fail to be properly housed by a local authority if he or she happened to live in a hostel and the local authority considered such a person not to be homeless as a consequence. That is the fear and if the Minister can, by way of regulation, get over that I will be prepared to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can take that point on board and the guidelines could be so arranged to give that kind of indication to the housing authorities.  There is no difficulty in that regard.  However, the difficulty is that there are certain hostels in this city in which people have been living for many years.  They regard them as their home; they are looked after there and enjoy the facilities.  They are not really interested in being housed in any other way.  I do not want a situation to develop where some of these people might be thrown out, or in some way caught up in a system which might mean they would have to be dislodged.  Many Deputies were fearful because Simon hostels were concerned.  I will clear that once and for all and it will be in the guidelines to local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I only used the Simon hostels as an indication of the kind of thing we are talking abuot.  I see Simon and similar hostels being accommodated under the general term of night shelters or similar institutions.  It comes back to what Deputy Gay Mitchell said in regard to amendment No. 1 in relation <Col N="368" /> to certain types of hostels for young persons. There is a generosity on my part to try to understand Deputies' points of view but if they allow the word &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; to be left out it can be covered satisfactorily in the guidelines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the regulations governing the administration of the Bill and the directives to local authorities, the point made by Deputy Boland, implicit in these amendments, requires a local authority to compile a register to eliminate any possibility of doubt.  The regulations should require each housing authority to establish a register of recognised hostel accommodation for the purposes of definition so that people will know exactly where they stand in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point and I will consider it favourably.  I am worried that in framing the guidelines, particularly in relation to certain kinds of hostels, I might leave out an organisation which I had wanted to include.  For that reason, I ask Deputy Boland to concede the point. However, the guidelines will make it abundantly clear to the housing authority what is intended in so far as the interpetation of hostels is concerned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I would commend the content of my amendment to the Minister, I have some concerns about the inconsistencies between local authorities on the question of lack of <i>rationale</i> in the administration of some of their housing schemes.  Some local authorities have certain elements in those housing schemes which others do not.  It seems to me it is about time there was a mandatory obligation on local authorities &mdash; although many of them do at present &mdash; to publish a clear set of criteria which would be amenable to ministerial approval, that in extraordinary circumstances, if people felt themselves wronged by a decision, they would have some form of appeal available to them, provided they could produce tangible evidence that there was such a wrong done to them.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by the fact that over the years, particularly in the area of Dublin city and county &mdash; with which I am most familiar and where county boundaries have changed &mdash; this type of anomaly can crop up between a city and county housing authority.  It is about time there was some degree of consistency or cohesion introduced into the whole arrangement.  That is what the provisions of subparagraph (d) of my amendment are designed to do.</P>
    <P>The other points are self-explanatory. I formally commend that to the Minister for consideration and hope he will be sympathetic to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 deals with several items, one being the criteria and another appeals.  In so far as the criteria are concerned I cannot see the need to provide in the Bill that housing authorities should be obliged to publish sets of criteria on the judgments they will be required to make under the provisions of the Bill.  The preparation, publication and updating of such criteria by each housing authority and their submission for approval to the Minister would seriously divert resources away from the main activities of local authorities and would cause much of the disruption and delays we are endeavouring to overcome. <Col N="372" /> It would be unnecessarily restrictive.  For that reason I do not think the Deputy should pursue his amendment.</P>

      <P>I am thinking of an annual statement of the conditions on which they make these decisions, that is really all, something akin to the scheme of housing priorities that some local authorities publish at present, so that we would have some national order in this area.

      <P>The question of reports and so on, arises in another section and other amendments which we shall come to later.  That might be the appropriate time to take up the aspect about which Deputy Keating is talking.  I am talking about the strict element of criteria.  In so far as appeals are concerned, I should say there are literally thousands of decisions taken by housing authorities every year in regard to the allocation of individual dwellings, transfers from one dwelling to another, for which no appeal from the decision of an authority lies with the Minister at all.  I do not have any responsibility in that regard.  The housing authorities are the responsible authorities in regard to those kinds of decisions.  Of course, such decisions can be reviewed through the representations of elected members, organisations and others, and often are, as those Members who have been members of local authorities will have experienced over the years.  These appeals and reviews do take place under the existing system but it is not a matter for the Minister.  I do not consider it necessary or desirable that the Minister should be brought into the system of allocation of local authority housing.  That would be a retrograde step and would not be of any assistance to the homeless or any other category of person in need of housing.  I see the local and housing authorities as the responsible bodies for that kind of decision making.</P>
      <P>To sum it up, if I were to concede that amendment, then I would be the person who would be allocating houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is somewhat trite. All I am suggesting &mdash; I might put this caution on the record &mdash; is that there is a serious crisis in local authority housing finance, as the Minister knows, and in relation to housing authority staffing. When there is a locked-in system, whereby the only appeal available to one, and the only adjudication is made by those who are also, if you like, the victims &mdash; in perhaps understandable but nevertheless serious public expenditure constraints &mdash; the reality is that it is the people out there who will suffer ultimately. All I am saying is that I am not satisfied, in an arrangement where there is no other form of appeal at all, regardless of how extreme the circumstances may be, that justice will be done.  I do not have an easy answer.  Had I the resources available to the Minister I might be able to come up with one.  I am simply saying that that has been the experience on the ground, as somebody involved in a local authority can verify.  It is not that I want the Minister to be involved in looking through housing lists at all.  In other circumstances I might suggest that the Ombudsman might be the appropriate person to whom such people should go but I will not suggest that in this context.</P>

If there is any such implication I would reject it absolutely, in that large housing authorities do discharge their functions very fairly.  In addition, they do so in a reasonable manner.  It is my belief they will continue to do so.  To seek to super-impose some other system of appeal on one that has worked well in the way appeals have been heard to date would be superfluous.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) if the authority is satisfied that a person is in real and present danger of coming within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b) within 28 days.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in amendments Nos. 7 and 8 to insert two new parts to section 2, that is subsections (c) and (d).  Our purpose is to provide for two possible eventualities. <Col N="375" /> Subparagraph (c) seeks to ensure that an authority will treat a person as homeless if they are satisfied that that person is in real and present danger of coming within the meaning of paragraphs (a) and (b) within 28 days.  It is not unusual for people in private accommodation to receive eviction notices on account of inability to pay rent or because their landlord may want to dispose of the property. There are a variety of reasons, such as the building being unsafe when, at present, an authority would be obliged to make them some offer of alternative accommodation.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that people are not left to the last minute before being made an offer of alternative accommodation by a local authority and be accepted as homeless.</P>
    <P>I have a particular instance in mind, that of a constituent of mine living in a house which was owned by her parents who have since died.  The house was left to the family who have dispersed, who are now insisting that the property be sold in order to distribute whatever moneys may be gained from its sale. Effectively, when that property is sold, that woman and her children will be homeless.  At present the local authority are not prepared to accept that family onto their housing list.  They regard them as being adequately housed because, as far as they are concerned, they are not in need of accommodation and are unlikely to be in the foreseeable future.  However, they do say that, when the House is sold the tenant should come back to them, when they will ascertain what they can do for her.  It is those kinds of circumstances we should endeavour to avoid when much stress is caused to a tenant.  The local authority are quite within their rights in doing what they are doing, but we should endeavour to ensure, by way of the provisions in this Bill, that there are at least 28 days available within which there is the possibility of a person becoming homeless and a local authority being obliged to treat them as such.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with amendment <Col N="376" /> No. 8 where the intent is fairly clear, that a local authority will treat a person as homeless if it is probable that occupation of their existing dwelling will lead to their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If it is necessary, the accommodation can be provided.  It is important that apprentices are catered for within the training area because the normal daily routine of apprentices undergoing training starts at 7 a.m. and part of the training of apprentices provides for compulsory study on three nights of the week.  Of course, personnel are also required to undertake a certain amount of military duties. Another important consideration is the fact that apprentices may be as young as 16 years of age on enlistment and as they <Col N="378" /> come from different parts of the country they would not be able to return home at night.  For those reasons and many others it would be impractical to allow apprentices to live out.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The percentage of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces on 31 May 1988 was as follows: Officers &mdash; 1.83 per cent; Other Ranks &mdash; 0.3 per cent.  It is not intended to recruit female personnel in the intake of 500 which is due to begin shortly.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals to review the non-combatant status of female personnel in the Defence Forces or the definition of non-combatants.  The question of recruiting additional female personnel is reviewed periodically in the light of current strengths and commitments and in the context of prevailing financial constraints and the overall budgetary situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely surprised at the Minister's response because these figures, numerically, have been given to us before.  The percentage seems to highlight what must be, and I would ask the Minister if it is, a cause of major embarrassment and concern to him that the efforts of his Department to recruit into the armed forces a fair complement of females are completely inadequate. This amounts to tokenism of the highest order.  Would the Minister indicate whether at any time in the future his Department intend to address this major <Col N="382" /> problem and put right what is a glaring oversight and default on the part of the Department?</P>

I should like to say also that applications for enlistment from female personnel are not being accepted at present.  I have asked all the command manpower officers to maintain a record of such inquiries.  It is an ongoing review.  I am conscious of the situation and I hope towards the end of the year to have some decision made.</P>

      <P>The practice within the armed forces to date has been to place female recruits in clerical and menial work positions.  One of the major problems is the view of the Department that they can only be looked to for non-combatant duties.  Would the Minister be disposed to look at the Garda Síochána where there is no difficulty whatsoever in employing women in some of the most difficult, dangerous and onerous positions at all levels within that force?  Does the Minister not accept that this is something that will cause continuous embarrassment to him and to his Department, both at home and abroad, in view of the very low levels of recruitment of females and could he look at this particular aspect of it?</P>

Is the Minister aware that the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen have made a number of proposals in deputations to Deputies in regard to use of different premises in Dublin?  One might have been in Griffith Barracks but I cannot remember the locations.

For his information&mdash;I like to give him information &mdash; the average industrial wage including overtime and productivity payments is £199.41 per week.  I am very conscious indeed of the high incidence of duties of privates and NCOs.  That is why I am now recruiting and why I recruited 700 from 1 November last year.  Furthermore, we are looking at the promotional structure in the other ranks and my intention is in the very near future to reduce substantially the high incidence of duties which is causing the problems as outlined by the Deputy.</P>

At one stage the scheme was available to ranks higher than that of captain but in recent years it has been made available to officers up to the rank of captain.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> No, I am not alarmed because it has always been the practice that well-trained pilots from the Air Corps go into civilian employment and that is still the practice.  As I have said, I have allowed five airline pilots to go this year up to the present time.  It is only right that they should be allowed to do so.  The pilots who were allowed to go had between 22 and 27 years service.</P>

      <P>Surely if those numbers were to keep continually haemorrhaging out of the Air Corps the Minister would have great trouble with recruits at the other end, given the embargo on in-take, pay and so on.  Is the Minister not heading for great trouble in that sector?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> No.  The ultimate decision as to whether personnel will leave rests with the Minister and he has to consider the operational demands at any time.  When recruited, an airline pilot is not trained the following week or the following month; it takes a number of years.  In order to alleviate that problem I intend taking in an increased number of cadets to the Air Corps this year.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 49 together.  Revised weekly rates of pay will be applied to the intake of Army and Air Corps apprentices in 1988 and subsequent years.  The revised rates are as follows: 1st year, £68.76; 2nd year, <Col N="403" /> £95.75; 3rd year, £131.72; and 4th year, £158.70.</P>
      <P>The apprentices are recruited in the age bracket 16-18 years and will be given the same training as existing apprentices.  Apprentices are provided, at a moderate charge, with accommodation, food and clothing.  The revised rates of pay are considerably higher than those payable for civilian apprentices.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As I said, Army and Air Corps apprentices are recruited in the age bracket 16 to 18 years.  There are approximately 5,000 applications for between 50 and 100 apprenticeships in the Army and Air Corps each year.  In order to take account of the fact that military apprentices are liable for some military duties during their training, the revised rates have been fixed higher than the rate for apprentices in other State employment.  For example, the rates which apply to apprentices in local authorities, the Office of Public Works, the ESB and CIE are as follows: in the first year in a local authority it is £53.96, in the ESB it is £52.93, in CIE it is £50.28, as against £68.76 in the military establishments.  In the second year in the Office of Public Works and the local authorities it is £80.95, in the ESB it is £79.40, in CIE it is £75.42 and in the Air Corps it is £95.75, and so on.  As the Deputy can see, taking into account the duties involved and because of a certain amount of military training, the rates paid to Army and Air Corps Apprentices are considerably higher than those paid to apprentices in other State employment.</P>

If the example of the Minister or the Government is followed by other employers in the public or private sector it will cause havoc in industrial relations in future.  Does the Minister not agree that reducing wage rates by 50 per cent is an atrocious example to other employers in all sectors?

      <P>In amendment No. 7 we are seeking an additional subsection which would enable the local authority to consider a person homeless, or the case <Col N="433" /> of a person who is likely to become homeless within 28 days.  I gave the Minister an example of a case in Dublin North-West where such a situation is likely to arise in the not-too-distant future. Amendment No. 8, which I understand we are discussing in tandem with No. 7, also seeks to add an additional criterion which the local authority will take into account, and that is where violence may occur where a person is living with another person in a house or flat or otherwise. We are all aware of situations where people, particularly wives, are battered and have to leave their home and go to refuges of one kind or another because of violence in the home.  The local authority should be able to assist such people where this is likely to occur because of a history of that kind of violence or otherwise.  I would urge the Minister to take both of these amendments on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be some provision to allow for the situation where somebody cannot gain access to their home because of violence.  Perhaps this amendment is a little widely drawn.  If the Minister cannot accept it he should address the question on Report Stage, because there is a problem faced by a number of people, particularly wives, who have to leave the family home because of difficulties with a spouse.  It may also happen that a person has to leave the family home because of a falling out with parents etc.  There is just one exception, and we should at least address the question here.  In the case of local authority housing, if the wife has difficulty in gaining access to the house because of violence, she then goes to the local authority to seek rehousing for herself and the children only to find that the local authority cannot do that because her husband remains as tenant of a corporation property.</P>

    <P>In that situation it is the person perpetrating the violence who should be ejected from the home.  If it is not possible to put these powers into this Bill, some machinery should be made available to the local authority, without having to go through months of procedure <Col N="434" /> through the courts, to eject the violent spouse where the local authority are the owner of the home and where a local authority tenant is involved.  This problem does occur.  What happens then is that when the spouse who is the subject of the violence, let us say the wife, often accompanied by children, goes to the local authority seeking rehousing, the authority says that they cannot be rehoused because the wife is already the joint tenant, or the husband is the tenant of a property.  The Minister's statutory instrument should contain powers for dealing with the person perpetrating the violence where the local authority is the owner.</P>

      <P>I can see what the Deputies are getting at here.  I would like to think that it is very adequately covered in section 2 (a) under people who can &ldquo;reasonably occupy or remain in occupation.&rdquo; That is very wide.  We spent some time in trying to get that right so that it would not be in any way restrictive. It has been deliberately written in that fashion.  Further down, the phrase is mentioned &ldquo;unable to provide accommodation from his or her own resources.&rdquo; We think that that point is covered well there.  It can be summarised in this fashion.  It is not a requirement that you must be homeless in order to be housed by a housing authority, or local authority. People are often housed in circumstances where they are not homeless.  Section 10, in particular, deals with all those kinds of emergency.  One has to look at this section in conjunction with section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main objective of the provisions regarding homeless people is to provide new powers for local authorities for dealing with what, in effect, is a small number of persons who because of their acute needs may require urgent action outside the normal system of allocation for local authority housing.  It would most likely be a small number who may be threatened with homelessness and their needs would have to be attended to.  Persons in that situation may apply for and be offered local authority accommodation in the normal way without having to <Col N="435" /> become homeless in the process.  That is fundamental to my thinking on the matter.  The proposed amendments appear to ignore the fact that persons threatened with eviction or homelessness or for any other reason, are and have been for many years past housed by local authorities under existing housing legislation and under previous housing codes. Because we were aware that this type of amendment might come up, the wording is as in section 2 (a) where the final sentence is &ldquo;unable to provide accommodation from his or her own resources&rdquo;. That was included to get over the point, which is well made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental question here is whether we want to make this legislation explicit.  The Minister referred previously to the need to remove any ambiguity.  That could be converted into a positive argument for the need to state explicitly certain conditions and occasions when people's rights with regard to housing by a housing authority could be invoked.</P>
      <P>I shall not repeat what Deputy De Rossa has said on this amendment and broadly support everything he said in relation to the opening presentation of these two amendments.  The purpose of this amendment is to make explicit.  Local authority practice can vary from county to county, from authority to authority. If people want to be difficult about it, theoretically they could say that, even though persons are threatened with eviction and have a court order to show that they would have to be out within 28 days, or have a letter from their landlord stating that they were to go within 28 days, as of now they are not homeless and therefore cannot describe themselves as such.  One can read into subsection (a) that kind of definition if one wanted to.  That is why this explicit proposal is contained in subsection (c) and likewise in relation to the question of violence.  There has been much talk with regard to violence of one kind or other in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable and arguable for the Minister to say that the phrase in line 12 <Col N="436" /> of subsection (a) &ldquo;can reasonably occupy or remain in occupation&rdquo;, obviously and automatically makes reference to a person who is threatened by violence. However, our worry on this side of the House, as legislators, is that a particular official may not necessarily take it that way.  A particular reading of it may not necessarily agree with the prospect that a woman who is threatened with violence from her husband or a father who is threatened with violence by his son, or other kind of inter-family violence is covered in this subsection.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the Minister is prepared to accept these amendments. Again, we are adding to and reinforcing the thrust of the Bill, not trying to change its direction or to give additional rights. We are simply extending the explicit categorisation or qualification for the person to be regarded by a housing authority as being homeless.  It does not weaken, endanger, or add to the burden, but does make it explicit.  To the homeless and those who are working for them, it gives a certain degree of solace and comfort by making explicit something that the Minister and his officials may very well regard as implicit in subsection (a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what the Deputy is getting at here.  An important thing to be remembered, which is not always completely understood and perhaps may be misunderstood, is that if you are threatened with eviction right now it is possible, under existing housing legislation, to be housed.  I would also like the matter to be as explicit as possible.  It is for that reason that the phrasing is so wide, because of the danger that perhaps an officer in one authority might seek to use the meanings of words to suit a particular situation that he would like to create.  It was hoped that using the phraseology that we did &mdash;&ldquo;could reasonably occupy or remain in occupation&rdquo;&mdash; would get over that difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My advice is that the wording as suggested by Deputy Quinn and others &mdash; of &ldquo;in real and present danger&rdquo;&mdash; would have a limiting effect on the actual words that we have already put in, as distinct <Col N="437" /> from making the position more explicit. That would lead to the very situation which Deputy Quinn is seeking to avoid and which I accept is his whole grounds for making his point.  Once it becomes generally known that people who are threatened with eviction or homelessness in that way are covered, we will get the right result, in so far as it is sufficiently explicit.  For that reason I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>The point made by the Minister is well made.  However, I want to refer briefly to a point which Deputy Mitchell has made. This is where a tenant who is under threat of violence, or whatever, is a joint tenant with another person in a corporation or local authority house.  That other person in occupation should be ejected forthwith or with the minimum legal procedures.  I can foresee all sorts of difficulty involved there which would have wider implications for other tenants of local authorities. While I agree with the present procedure for rearranging the tenancies of joint tenants where there is marriage breakdown or violence, nevertheless we should be extremely careful about interfering with the rights of a person to maintain the tenancy.</P>

      <P>A person suffering violence or the threat of violence cannot reasonably be expected to remain in their accommodation.  I give an undertaking that I will make that point very clearly in the guidelines to the housing authorities when the Bill is passed.  I want to get an all-embracing set of terms which will cover all categories involved instead of including specific ones or excluding others which would limit the scope of the Bill and deny what we are all trying to achieve.  That is why the words were left as explicit as possible.</P>

      <P>I can see the point in Deputy De Rossa's comments, which are <Col N="438" /> not unreasonable.  However, it is extraordinary &mdash; and it happens quite regularly &mdash; that the wife, who is a joint tenant, and children can be expelled from the home by a violent husband and father and that the local authority will then refuse to give them the tenancy of another dwelling. They would have to go through a very lengthy court procedure to regain occupation of the house for the wife and children.  There should be some administrative process involving the local authorities which would regain access to the home for the wife and children who are usually offended against.  The offending violent father or husband should be turfed out and I make no bones about that.  I can see that there will be difficulties but they pale into insignificance compared to the difficulties created for &mdash; usually &mdash; wives and mothers with young children who find themselves in hostels or on the side of the street.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(g) such assistance shall only be rendered when the assisting authority has been provided with evidence that the required assistance could not otherwise be provided or raised.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point of this amendment is that where such assistance is being sought and given, it is not unreasonable for the authority making the assistance available to ask that reasonable efforts should have been undertaken to secure such assistance otherwise and that they had already been made.  Otherwise, there might be a very ready willingness to ask for such help and there should be encouragement to people to look to their resources or to raise the money by alternative means such as a loan, before appealing for help. It might be no harm to include a reference along those lines because there should be evidence that the person is making an honest effort to try to get the funds before automatically turning to the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We would regard that as a slightly retrograde step in our efforts to secure a greater role for voluntary organisations and housing agencies in meeting special social needs.  Housing authorities assist organisations only after taking due account of the organisation's finances and their capacity to raise funds. <Col N="441" /> It would be an entirely different matter to provide in legislation that a voluntary housing organisation would have to provide evidence that they could not obtain funding, including, presumably, charitable donations from any other source, before they could be assisted by a housing authority.  I am concerned that the Deputy's suggestion might be interpreted as trying to stop money going to voluntary housing bodies or telling them that they could only get it if they had a dozen good flag days.  That would be going in the wrong direction.  I know what the Deputy is trying to get at, that people should make a good effort themselves to raise money, but we should not put into legislation a way of preventing money going to voluntary organisations because &mdash; as Deputy Quinn said in relation to another matter &mdash; it might be used by a particular authority or agency to take a meaning out of it which would prevent the voluntary organisation being supported.  That would be contrary to my wishes in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, if it was brought to that extreme, it would be contrary to the wishes of most civilised people, including me.  However, it is not unreasonable to expect some organisations to help themselves because some of them have come to assume that an annual grant will be available whereas other organisations who have never been lucky enough to be grant-aided, do not get into the reckoning.  It is not unreasonable, in some way or other, to encourage long-established organisations to become somewhat self-reliant if that can be done. I would concur in the view that we should not write into legislation some system that would debar them from getting grant aid.  I am trying, if you like, to capture a small degree of the spirit of something here which would help to make more money available to a wider range of organisations by virtue of not locking in some organisations, year after year, who would then take it as their right to assume that they have an automatic grant annually. All of us in this House are in regular <Col N="442" /> receipt of appeals based on that assumption.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) For the purposes of this section `management' shall be taken to include, where appropriate, caretaking, maintenance, and suitable social support services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend or provide a partial definition of &ldquo;management&rdquo; in this section so as to make it clear to a housing authority, if and when they make assistance available to an organisation for the management of accommodation referred to in section 5 (1), the term &ldquo;management&rdquo; would be defined as sufficiently wide to include such facilities as caretaking, maintenance services and, most importantly, the social support services which are very often necessary and which were referred to in our earlier discussions today.  In some cases certain organisations will be providing not just housing or accommodation but will be aware also of the necessity to provide back-up social support services.  They are anxious to have it made clear that the enabling power given to housing authorities in section 5 is sufficiently wide to enable an authority to grant aid for such purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined this amendment and do not regard it as absolutely necessary.  The concept of what was involved in the housing management is constantly developing as the Deputy himself has recognised on a number of occasions.  It would be desirable that legislation should allow this to happen without attempting definitions of what it should mean.  The management of housing and the expression used in this section always has been interpreted and seen in the broadest possible terms.  Certainly it has been taken to include caretaking, maintenance and all other necessary support services, including social ones.  That is its widest interpretation even now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that section 58 of the 1966 <Col N="444" /> Housing Act, under which local authorities look after all aspects of the operations of their housing estates, uses the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; to embrace the various items mentioned in Deputy Boland's amendment, including, for example, warden support for elderly persons.  Similarly, section 13 of this Bill speaks of the management of residential caravan sites for travellers.  The power given there is designed to include such facilities as caretaking, maintenance and other support services, including social workers whose salaries are recouped under the provisions of section 6.</P>
    <P>To sum up, exactly what Deputy Boland wanted to have included is already contained in two sections of previous Acts and anything done otherwise would be restrictive rather than being seen in the broadest possible sense.  That is the advice I have been given on the matter of management under the existing laws on housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment does not constitute a restrictive definition.  I referred to it as a partial definition.  I deliberately wrote the amendment in such a way as to suggest that &ldquo;management&rdquo; would be taken to include, &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo;, rather than that &ldquo;management&rdquo; would be confined to the three areas of caretaking, maintenance, and suitable social support services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually I would not, because section 58 refers only to management. If the Minister is telling the House that the operation of section 58 has been interpreted to include those services, then I would accept it but, on a quick perusal of section 58 of the 1966 Act, it does not appear to me that that section makes any attempt to set out the <Col N="445" /> parameters as to what &ldquo;management&rdquo; entails.

      <P>&ldquo;(3) A decision to provide assistance under this section shall be a reserved function.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to repeal sections 12 and 42 of the 1966 Act. One of those sections provided that the taking of decisions in those matters ought be a reserved function.  This section is identical to section 5 of the 1985 Act except that, for some strange reason, sub-section (3) of section 5 of the 1985 Act &mdash; which contained the same working as my amendment, providing that a decision to provide assistance under this section would be a reserved function &mdash; has been removed from the present Bill.  I cannot see the reason for its removal.  I contend it would be as well that we return to the original intention of 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past the provision in section 12 of the 1966 Act, that assistance to voluntary housing organisations was a reserved function, led to delays in the approval of projects.  Such delays could <Col N="446" /> have a critical impact on the tight financial budgeting of a voluntary housing organisation undertaking a given building project.  In addition, the Department meet the full cost of assistance given by housing authorities to voluntary housing organisations under the voluntary housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Therefore, on balance, I consider that the amendment cannot appropriately be accepted for the reason that I consider it would cause delays and, in effect, because of the new funding arrangements to voluntary housing arrangements, the Minister is responsible for the overall funding anyway.  It could cause delays and it might not be wise to pursue it for that reason.  That is the only reason I ask the Deputy to reconsider his position.</P>

      <P>The point at issue is that there are very few functions reserved to the elected members of local authorities.

Is the Minister saying that he has decided that the elected members are not to be trusted in this matter?  The excuse that this function retained as a reserved function would lead to unnecessary delays does not wash and the likelihood is that elected members of the local authorities would make a decision far earlier than would the Custom House.  That is apparent to anybody who has been a member of a local authority and it should be doubly apparent to anybody who has served in both places.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is saying that he does not trust the councillors generally, bearing in mind that the bulk of the local authorities are controlled by the Minister's party, and that that is why he is withdrawing subsection (3) from the 1985 Bill, let him say so.</P>

      <P>The contrary is the position. I am a great defender of the right of members of local authorities to be involved in all matters concerning local authorities.  Before this Bill is completed today, Deputies will see what I mean. Under the new funding arrangements for <Col N="447" /> assisting voluntary organisations engaged in projects like this, they will be funded virtually 100 per cent by the Minister.  If a voluntary body get agreement in relation to funding and subsequently go to the Minister to be backed up, I am happy about that.  All I am worried about is to get the thing done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>This is a function at present reserved to the elected members. The intention of the last Government was that the elected members would continue to have that function and for reasons which the Minister has not clarified to the House, he is removing one of the few reserved functions from the elected members.  It is not right and I do not accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I recommended that to the Deputy was to avoid a possible delay in voluntary organisations being funded, when eventually the local authority would recoup the money from the Minister and the Department.  If the Deputy, having considered everything, sees his way as being a better way, I will concede the point to him.  My suggestion was in an effort to hurry up the process as distinct from anything else, but I will concede the point to the Deputy if he presses it.  I am not advised to do that but if the Deputy feels that somehow I am leaving out the elected members, then I will concede the point, but the voluntary organisations have to get funding as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the smallest local authority meet once a month.  Most of the larger housing authorities would meet more frequently.  The maximum delay would only arise if the officials of the authority, in an absolute stroke of brilliance, came to a conclusion to make a recommendation for funds to be made available on the day on which the authority met, so that they were unable to put it on the agenda for another full month. However, it is much more likely that a recommendation would be made which <Col N="448" /> could be considered at a meeting of the authority within the next week or ten days.</P>
      <P>The elected representatives are correctly jealous of guarding the reserved functions they have.  I suspect that the Minister is conscious of that concern of theirs.  I would not be properly representing the interests of the legally elected members whom I represent in this House were I not to press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy puts it in those terms I will concede the point although I think there could be some months delays in getting a matter cleared for the voluntary organisation, and I hope my acceptance of this point does not come back on us.  If the Deputy wants to press the matter I will concede it unless some other Deputies consider that my point of view is stronger than that of Deputy Boland.  In that case I would ask the Deputy to reconsider the point.  As far as the reserved functions of elected members are concerned, they are paramount. I am not trying to diminish them. I am only trying to speed up the situation whereby we can address the giving of money to voluntary organisations as quickly as possible.  If there is a danger that that could be delayed by a couple of months by a chain of circumstances somewhat like those suggested by the Deputy, then we might be doing a disservice to the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the two amendments as being unnecessary.  Section 5 applies in very broad terms to anybody approved by the Minister for the purpose of the section.  While all of the organisations already approved under section 12 of the 1966 Act would arguably come within the broad descriptions contained in the amendments, I do not consider it desirable to move from a general provision towards providing in the Act descriptions of bodies which may be approved.  This type of description is much more appropriate to circular letters and guidelines and that is the way it should be done.  It may have a limiting effect in the broadest sense in years to come.  It is for that reason I am asking that this amendment be not pressed.  It would run contrary to some of the things we have already been talking about in relation to having this as broadly based as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of voluntary housing associations and housing co-operatives in this country, by comparison with those in other European countries, is not very good.  There is a great deal of ambivalence in the attitudes of different local authorities to the activities of such <Col N="450" /> bodies.  While the climate has considerably improved in recent years there is a residual ambivalance.  The reason for my amendment, couched in terms similar to those of Deputy Boland, is to try to remove any ambivalence.</P>
      <P>In relation to the financing of some associations and their access to corporate funds from lending institutions, their rights are much better ensured and specified in the form of enacted legislation than in the form of a circular which can always be withdrawn or modified and which does not have the force of law.  I would ask the Minister to take this on board because not only is it making explicit law and reinforcing, something that is already there, but from a political point of view we are sending out a political signal in relation to the area of voluntary and co-operative housing and the Second Stage contribution from the Minister of State clearly made substantial reference to this area.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.  Perhaps he would come back on Report Stage with a slightly altered wording, if he has a problem with the specific wording.  He has two choices between Deputy Boland's proposal and my own.  The net effect is to call for the explicit inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not trying to be awkward but we are afraid that the amendments will try to qualify line 36 on page 6 and I do not want to do that now. I can see what Deputy Quinn is getting at so far as he would like things to be absolutely explicit in print but is it not more appropriate that this matter could be changed in the guideline?  I know it can be changed but it can also be added to.  One of the beauties about the guideline in the circular is that it can be added to and subtracted from whereas if it gets into the Bill and it is subsequently discovered that it is limiting in any way then we are back to amending legislation.  I would much prefer to amend guidelines which can always be brought to the notice of the Minister, either by Dáil action, representation or whatever.  In a situation such as this where we would be at one so far as the thinking is concerned, it would <Col N="451" /> not cause a hassle by doing it that way. If something is put in now that might seek to replace section 12 of the 1966 Act in many ways, rather than leave it substantially whole, we might not be doing what we intend to do.  For that reason I do not think Deputy Quinn would want to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>How can wording which states that a body shall include non-profit making or voluntary housing organisations in any way limit the definition? If that is so, why does section 5 (1), when referring to other housing authorities, choose to put in brackets the words, &ldquo;including the commissioners of the town&rdquo;?  We all know that town commissioners are very rarely &mdash; I do not think they are in any case &mdash; housing authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest commissioners of a town have old housing stock and where there might be a need for the substantial housing authority in the area to give them grant-aid in order to maintain that housing stock, the clause &ldquo;including the commissioners of the town&rdquo; is included in section 5 (1), as it was in the 1985 measure. In the same way the reference to &ldquo;body&rdquo; if it was to have been included in the Bill that a body included non-profit making or voluntary housing organisations would not limit the definition of &ldquo;body&rdquo;; in fact, it widens it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Boland has made the point and I do not really want to add to it.  I think the Minister should take this point on board.  I know the permanent Government of this land &mdash; like the permanent government of other lands &mdash; hate to see Acts changed after they have spent years at getting it right, or so they think.  We are dangerously on the edge of Sir Humphrey territory here.  The Minister has put forward the argument which was given to him and he has added to it.  With all due respects, I do not think <Col N="452" /> it stands up.  Deputy Boland has made the net point that if it specifically includes a particular body it does not, by logic, exclude every other body and that is the net point being argued by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to consider one further point that occurs here. All bodies seeking recognition have to be approved by the Minister.  The Minister examines the credentials of each body which applies to be approved for the purpose of this section before he can approve them.  Once they are approved their bona fides are established.  Consequently, it is not a question of my trying to delimit those organisations that would be recognised in that way; they have already sought approval, have been examined and have been granted it.  They would have been covered and that was the intention, as I understand it, under section 12 of the 1966 Act.  I can well understand that people do not like changing something which has stood the test of time for so long and so well.  I would have to be convinced that what was intended in the list of bodies, under section 12, had in some way been faulty or had failed to satisfy the requirement.  It would be then wise to make a further addition to the list as concluded in section 12 of the 1966 Act.  Failing that, I would not see any good reason for it.  Why seek to alter it for the sake of getting more explicit when the explicitness of the Act already stands up to scrutiny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point is that we want to make explicit in the law that a bona fide voluntary housing association has in the written law of the land the right to be included and considered as qualifying and benefiting from the provisions of section 5 and the rest of the housing legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's position is that their entitlement would rest exclusively with their being approved by the Minister and in that sense by the permanent secretariat within the Department which would put up a recommendation.  What we are seeking is the right in their own right for a voluntary housing association to be included.  If a particular association which was clearly a voluntary housing association &mdash; and it would have to seek approval from the Minister to qualify for other provisions &mdash; for some reason or another was not in good standing or about which the Minister had reservations, he would then have the power in law not to approve it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but his reasons for not approving it would have to be made explicit.  We are giving rights in law to voluntary housing associations and I suspect this is the reason there is a reticence to accept the amendment.  This is a political amendment put in to send a political signal to the voluntary housing associations that if they are properly incorporated and set up in a bona fide manner then they are entitled to participate in the provisions of section 5.  If for whatever reason the Minister, or his successor, saw fit to refuse to approve such a body, they would at least be able to argue that they were unfairly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is concerned about is that if the approval is not forthcoming for whatever reason they would have stated explicitly the reason they were not regarded as bona fide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would the Deputy require that to be enshrined in legislation? Anybody who seeks the Minister's approval to be included as a <Col N="454" /> voluntary housing organisation would in normal circumstances, and natural justice would require that at least you would respond and tell them where they had failed so that they would have an opportunity of correcting it and thereby gain their bona fide status.  I do not think that should be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the time constraints; we are on amendments Nos. 18 and 21 and we have approximately 73 left.  First and foremost, this is a political declaration being written into law that voluntary housing organisations specifically are included in this section.  It is a political message.  Successive Ministers for the Environment and Ministers of State, including the Minister and his colleague, would be able to state at various conferences that specific provision is now being made in law for direct assistance to be given to voluntary bodies, more so than was the case previously.  It gives them autonomy and rights which they would not otherwise have.  Retaining exclusively the right of approval to the Minister is a limitation which I do not think is necessary.  That is the point I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the descriptions contained in the amendments are already covered in existing legislation.  Will the Department accept that from one, through the Chair?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore why define them to any broader sense if they are already included in existing categories as outlined in existing legislation?  That is my difficulty. If there was a good reason over and above that, I would be prepared to say that I would be prepared to think about it between here and the Seanad or something to that effect.  I will if that is requested but I can see no good argument being pursued to a conclusion that suggests that these organisations are not there in the broadest sense as outlined in the definition of &ldquo;organisation&rdquo; in the 1966 Act.  For that reason it seems <Col N="455" /> superfluous.  The question about giving them a decent reply if they are refused approval is an administrative matter which could be pursued at any level other than by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn's ready acceptance of the Minister's suggestion that voluntary and non-profit making organisations are already defined in law under the generic term of &ldquo;body&rdquo; baffles me.  I am equally baffled that the Minister will suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;body&rdquo; in any legislation has already been interpreted to include voluntary or non-profit making housing organisations. If the Minister is to continue to refer to Section 12 of the 1966 Act he would be well advised to get himself a copy of it. Section 12 of the 1966 Act makes some attempt to define &ldquo;bodies&rdquo;.  It provides:</P>
      <P>(2) This section applies to the following bodies:</P>
      <P>(a) a body whose objects include at least one of the following:</P>
      <P>(i)  the provision of dwellings for elderly persons,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the provision of dwellings which will help to secure one or more of the primary objectives to which a housing authority are required by sub-section (3) of section 60 of this Act to have regard.</P>
      <P>(iii)  the advance of money for the provision (including reconstruction or purchase) of dwellings,</P>
      <P>(iv)  the conduct in relation to housing of research or the provision of training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That section which the Minister hopes the House will agree to rescind, to repeal, in the Schedule to this Bill, section 12, itself made an attempt to define the qualifications necessary for a body which was to be grant-aided.  It seems eminently reasonable that, rather than use this term &ldquo;body&rdquo;, which various Ministers might interpret as they saw fit, there ought to be included a specific reference to the <Col N="456" /> main bodies, which we all assume is the main purpose of the use of the word &ldquo;body&rdquo;.  I dislike having to say this, but the voluntary bodies have said to me that they accept the bona fides of the present Minister in his attitude towards it but they were concerned that if no attempt is made in this section to include them specifically, successors to the Minister might not have the same benign attitude towards the bodies and might choose to interpret the non-expanded term &ldquo;bodies&rdquo; in section 5 (1) as not being intended to include the voluntary or non-profit making housing organisations.  For that reason alone, the bodies are anxious and are putting forward what I think is a very reasonable case, that they ought to be included as a part definition of &ldquo;body&rdquo; without in any way limiting what &ldquo;body&rdquo; might be taken to mean but widening what &ldquo;body&rdquo; is to mean if the amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>I am reinforced in my view that that has not been the case.  No political message is being given in so far as this is concerned, I say to Deputy Quinn. Over 100 bodies have already obtained approval through various Ministers.  The innate fear in bodies as suggested by Deputy Boland that they might somehow be sidestepped does not bear scrutiny and no good argument has been made for me to alter my opinion in this regard.  If there were specific cases, or if such a limited number of bodies were already approved as to suggest that somebody was deliberately limiting the exercise of the widest interpretation of this arrangement heretofore, I would have to go down the road with the Deputy, but if more than 100 bodies already have been approved, and they generally include all the bodies that might have a usefulness in this type of arrangement, I do not see the case. However, so that we can get on with the <Col N="457" /> business, I will think about it a little more before we talk about it in another form.</P>

Section 5 (4) provides that if a housing authority have assisted another housing authority or body subject to a condition of providing such assistance and part of that condition has been that the money should be repaid and it has been so repaid; I feel the facilities should be there not just to recoup the amount but to recoup the interest on the amount.

Only in very rare circumstances would the housing authority have to seek recoupment of assistance given to either a voluntary housing organisation or a housing authority, and it is most unlikely that only partial recoupment of assistance given would be appropriate because the services will have been provided for some time.  The overall thrust of section 5 is to encourage voluntary housing organisations and not put in place severe penalties for non-performance.  I would be very upset about anybody trying to pursue these amendments.  We do not want fines and penalties imposed on voluntary housing organisations trying to do their best.</P>

Somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 units of accommodation built by and under the management of Dublin Corporation are in the administrative area of Dublin County Council.  The people who live in those houses and flats have nobody to complain to about their rent, repairs, or any difficulties they might have with estate management.  They elect county councillors who have no say whatsoever in the administration of the housing estates in which they live, particularly in places like Tallaght and Clondalkin which have enormous social problems.</P>
      <P>It seems absurd that I, as a councillor for the Crumlin district of Dublin Corporation, should have a say in the administration of such an enormous housing stock in Dublin county, particularly in the Clondalkin and Tallaght areas where there are huge problems and the elected representatives for that area have no say whatever.  Where a local authority build in the administrative area of another authority there should be some provision in the housing legislation for the handing over of that housing stock to the other local authority.  In this case, provision should be made for Dublin Corporation to hand over the housing stock to Dublin County Council whose elected representatives and management would be responsible for the management of that housing stock.  The present position is an absurdity.  It should not be allowed to continue or happen again.  There should be a provision to hand over the housing stock to the authority in whose administrative area they are sited.</P>

      <P>We must also bear in mind that there is the whole question of other services, apart from housing, provided by Dublin Corporation in county council areas.  We need to look at the system under which the greater Dublin area is divided into at least three local authorities.  Indeed, there are parts of other counties involved, such as Kildare and Wicklow.  They have taken the overflow of population from the <Col N="460" /> Dublin city area.  If the Minister is to give serious consideration to the question of how overflows are to be dealt with he must also look at the structure of local government.</P>

      <P>Co-operation on the housing needs of local authorities should not require legislation.  The Bill represents the first serious attempt for fresh thinking on co-operation between local authorities and housing authorities.  The need for co-operation and consultation runs through the Bill but I must stress that it should not require legislation.  Certainly, legislation should not be required as far as housing the homeless is concerned.</P>

Is the Minister aware that councillors on Dublin County Council for the Tallaght district do not have any status in City Hall or in the civic offices where the administrative decisions regarding the maintenance, rents and so on of houses in their area are made?  Is the Minister aware that between 10,000 and 20,000 units of housing are dealt with?  We should not allow this absurdity to continue.  It is creating terrible problems and the people elected to represent Tallaght do not have any say in regard to the massive problems that face the people they serve.</P>

      <P>We now move to amendment No. 23 in the name of Deputy Keating.  I am suggesting to the Deputy that amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 26 are alternatives, that amendment No. 32 is related, and that, for the purposes of discussion, we should take amendments Nos. 23, 24, 25, 26 and 32 together.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> In page 8, subsection (1), lines 26 and 27 to delete &ldquo;may, at any time that appears to them expedient, and shall, as may, from time to time, be&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall make an annual assessment, or on such other occasions as they may be&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to deal with a fairly fundamental point.  I will be brief because time is against us.  The essence of what is contained in the amendments listed by the Chair is the relative vagueness with which section 8, as initiated, facilitates a housing authority making the assessment referred to in the section.  It would appear that section 8 allows a housing authority to make the estimate of housing requirements whenever they like, having regard to certain criteria.  From the point of view of some form of national consistency, that is undesirable because we will get varying degrees of attention and efficiency in that respect.  Therefore, there will be varying degrees of speed with regard to housing people.</P>
    <P>In principle, it is unfair to the housing authorities to allow that vagueness to arise.  It is not unreasonable to be more specific bearing in mind that we are talking about an exercise which at its heart will be a fundamental barometer of how well the legislation works.  In theory, I could be five or six years down the road before we get any return.  Indeed, in theory it could be much longer than that before we will get what I would call an integrated pattern arising out of the assessments by housing authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>From every point of view I am concerned to ensure that there is a time limit within which housing authorities have to make such assessments.  I am suggesting in my amendment that there should be an annual assessment but I will be happy to accept some other time-frame if the Minister considers one appropriate, provided there is that kind of regulation.  I do not want to hear in three or four years time of councillors, or officials of the Minister's Department, asking local authorities if they had carried out a housing assessment.  Such authorities would <Col N="463" /> be able to blithely reply, &ldquo;That is under review, but there is no obligation on us to carry out such an assessment within a set time-frame&rdquo;.  That is a weakness in the Bill and it would help the Minister, those who want the Bill to succeed and local authorities, if we were more specific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, and the following one, essentially replace sections 53, 54 and 55 of the 1966 Act.  Frankly, it is an unnecessary division to have a possible requirement that there should be an estimate of housing requirements and to have, separately, housing assessments. In my view it would have been better if the intention of sections 8 and 9 had been rolled into one because is is somewhat difficult to distinguish between an estimate of housing requirements and an estimate of housing needs.  Section 53 of the 1966 Act, in relation to inspection and assessment of adequacy of supply and condition of housing, required the authority to carry out a review at least once every five years.  It seems to be a retrograde step to remove a specific requirement that the authority would have to carry out reviews after a maximum period.  Certain authorities may decide, for whatever reason, that they do not want to carry out either an estimate of housing requirements under section 8 or an assessment of housing needs under section 9.  I will have more to say about section 9, and similar amendments which I have down to that section, when we come to it.  My amendments would have the effect of requiring the authority to carry out an estimate of housing requirements within a year of the section coming into effect and thereafter not less often than every three years.  It is reasonable that that ought to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if you want to take amendment No. 27 in conjunction with these amendments we could do so because it is related.  If the authority was required to carry out the review within a year of the section coming into effect and then every three years <Col N="464" /> thereafter, the items set out in amendment No. 27 would also have to be addressed by the Authority at least every three years.  That was part of the intention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 is modelled on section 54 of the Housing Act, 1966, which the Minister also proposes to repeal.  It seems it would be a very good discipline on housing authorities to require them when doing their estimate of housing requirements to also set out the cost of the management and maintenance of their current housing stock, the income from their current housing stock and the anticipated cost of the building programme which they would set out as being necessary, having completed their estimate of requirements. It would concentrate the minds of the members of the housing authority, the Minister and presumably the Members of this House as well as the general public on the mammoth cost of the provision, maintenance and management of housing.  Indeed, most effectively of all, it would have the effect of concentrating the minds of the officials of the housing authority on to the expense of the operation in which they are engaging. From that point of view it would be retrograde if section 54 of the 1966 Act was to be repealed by this Bill and not replaced in some form.  The form I had suggested was to change the five yearly provision in section 53 to a three yearly provision.  I am not particularly hung up on whether it is three or five years but there should be a requirement that the estimate be carried out within set time frames.  Within those time frames it would be well worth while that the housing authority would turn their minds to the cost of their operations and of what they are proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are seeking is to have written into law the requirement that on a regular basis the local authority, <Col N="465" /> as the housing authority for the area, would be obliged to prepare an estimate and to have it published or made available. The wording at the beginning is extraordinarily weak and is a haven for somebody to hide behind &mdash; lack of staff, resources or even management commitment. What concerns me is that while some local authorities may proceed to provide for themselves an estimate of housing requirements, other local authorities will not and we will then be prevented from getting an overall national picture &mdash; an integrated pattern was the phrase used by Deputy Keating.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) states: &ldquo;A housing authority may, at any time that appears to them expedient, and shall, as may, from time to time, be directed by the Minister, make as respects their functional area...&rdquo;.  Either they have total control and are told they will have to carry out a review on a regular basis or the Minister gives a direction.  His response to this may very well be that he has the power anyway under that section to give a direction.  He may even go further, because he has been very accommodating verbally so far, and say that he is prepared to give a direction for annual review, but that is not law.  The Minister will probably be in the Department of Finance by the end of the year, anyway.</P>

      <P>While the Minister's assurances are in no way doubted they are no substitute for the making of a specific and exact provision in law and I think he will accept that.  That is the net point.  The points Deputy Boland added by way of amendment No. 27 are well made and <Col N="466" /> will fall into place along with it.  I would go so far as to say that if there is a reluctance in the Department to take on board this amendment because of resource implications, the preparation of the first report, properly stored on a personal computer and capable of being updated and upgraded, would considerably minimise much of the dogsbody work that would have to go with this.  The logistics involved in such a task are not as daunting in modern times with the new technology that is available to local authorities, as was the case in the past.  I urge the Minister to accept this.  It is a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The earlier amendments, Nos. 23, 24 and 26, are broadly similar in their intent in that an effort is being made to require local authorities to make an annual assessment of housing requirements.  As I understand it, the purpose of section 8 is to ensure an assessment of housing requirements generally and section 9 is an assessment of the requirement which will be on the local authorities to provide housing.  Clearly they are two distinct functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have two amendments down to section 8, amendment No. 26 which seeks to put a requirement on the local authority to have a yearly assessment of requirements and amendment No. 32 which seeks to ensure that there is at least a five yearly assessment of the condition of the housing stock in the State.  It seems it would be almost impossible to plan for the development of our housing stock, the modernisation of it and the provision of sufficient units of accommodation for the population at large unless we know the condition of the present housing stock, the major repairs that are required to it, its age, when it is likely to become obsolescent or what parts of it are going to become obsolescent, as well as the actual numbers of dwellings available.  As I understand it, between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of our current housing stock is pre-1940 and about a quarter of it is pre-1900.  In addition, the core of many of our cities and towns has housing which pre-dates the twenties: between 40 per <Col N="467" /> cent and 60 per cent pre-dates the twenties. It appears that major work will have to be done in modernising that housing stock and ensuring that it is maintained in proper condition.  There is no way we can ensure that unless a regular survey of the condition of the national housing stock is carried out.</P>
    <P>When deciding on the requirements for housing, the question of overcrowding should be taken into account.  There has been considerable debate about the definition of overcrowding.  The local authorities currently use definitions of overcrowding which do not match the recommendations made by the NESC. There are other definitions of overcrowding used in other jurisdictions which are not applied here and which would give a far different picture of our housing problems.  I would like the Minister to address himself to the following questions.  When local authorities are talking about overcrowding, what definition do they use?  What definition does the Minister use?  Will all local authorities use the same definition?  Does the Minister intend to take on board the NESC report in this regard, and so on?</P>
    <P>The importance of a regular condition of our housing stock cannot be overestimated. There has to be an obligation on local authorities to carry out such a survey; otherwise it will not happen.  In recent years the Department of the Environment appear to have given local authorities a derogation from section 53 because, to my knowledge, no housing condition surveys have taken place in recent years.  I would ask the Minister to address himself to that particular point.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the question of housing conditions and how a local authority assess the requirements of housing is the furnished private rented sector.  While there may well be X number of units available in the private rented sector, to what extent will local authorities be obliged to take into account the sanitation provided in these units?  To what extent will they be required to take into account the fire precautions in these <Col N="468" /> units?  In other words, will local authorities be obliged to ignore accommodation, or close accommodation, which does not meet with specific sanitation and fire precaution requirements? That will have a major impact on the outcome of any assessment for housing requirements around the country.  This is not just a Dublin problem.  The private rented sector problem is widespread in the major towns.</P>
    <P>I am arguing in favour of amendments Nos. 26 and 32 because I feel strongly there must be an obligation on local authorities to carry out regular assessments and a housing condition survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I want to make on the contributions made. It appears some Deputies do not fully appreciate what might be involved under section 8.  What is involved is a major assessment of housing requirements, both local authority and private, one every five years under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966.  Even this five-year timetable was not strictly adhered to. Deputy De Rossa was quite right when he said that for various reasons, mainly because of the sheer scale of the undertaking. It is essential that all housing authorities carry out their estimates of assessments at the same time using, as far as possible, and this is very important, consistent assumptions so that there would not be any disparities between the various authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of these local authority estimates provide the key element in estimating national housing requirements. However, the demographic, economic and housing stock data underlining the calculations of housing requirements do not change significantly from year to year and an annual estimate of overall housing requirements would, in present circumstances, be wasteful and unnecessary, and might even be unnecessary once every three years. There is not much point putting into legislation that something must be done every year when the requirement under the 1966 Act for a five-year assessment has <Col N="469" /> not been complied with.  Let us not perpetuate a requirement which has not been complied with.  This is an enormous task. It is not just a matter of counting empty houses.  The assessment we are talking about is a very detailed process, a huge undertaking and the scale has intimidated some local authorities in the past.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 deals with the proper procedure for the consideration of maintenance and management of local authority houses.  That matter is scrutinished at estimates time in the local authorities.  I want to tell Deputy Quinn that it is not my assurances that matter one whit.  That is the reason for including the words that from time to time, as directed by the Minister, certain things can happen.  That is a very important element of this legislation because any Minister at any time can say to a local authority under this section &mdash; and this applies probably more importantly to other sections &mdash; that they must do certain things.  Including that element in the section must put housing authorities on notice that from now on they can be directed to do a particular thing to satisfy a requirement so far as housing is concerned. This is a fundamental issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is reasonable to expect that once this major new legislation is in place we should set the base line.  I recommend that we should consider an amendment that would say &ldquo;within one year of the commencement of this legislation we will carry out a major assessment of housing requirements, local authority and private&rdquo;.

      <P>I welcome the Minister's willingness to take on board amendment No. 24, but the section is still weak in so far as the local authority will be required to carry out an estimate of housing requirements.  Under section 8 (2) (a) the information on which it will be based will be derived from any survey of all or a sample of the housing in the area, or otherwise as the Authority see fit.  This will not give the baseline we are talking about.  It will give us a rough guide as to what is going on with regard to our housing stock, but it will not deal with the high proportion of the housing stock which is obsolescent or almost so.  It will not give the local authority or the Department of the Environment the necessary information to enable them to decide how best to assist with the maintenance of dwellings which are obsolescent or nearly obsolescent.  The steps the Minister has taken in the past year with regard to remedial works schemes indicate his anxiety to ensure that the existing housing stock is maintained and upgraded.  How is this to be done unless we know specifically what needs to be maintained and upgraded?  That is why I am suggesting in amendment No. 32 an obligation on the local authority to carry out a housing conditions survey rather than an estimate of housing requirements, so that we can <Col N="472" /> plan not only for the building of new houses but for the maintenance and upgrading of existing houses.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Minister's response to amendment No. 32.  There appears to be an attempt to escape from what we are supposed to be doing with regard to the housing stock. I and other Deputies argued on Second Stage that there was a need for a White Paper on housing to give us some idea of the direction of housing policy.  Even with the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 24, we are only tipping the edges of the problem.  While I acknowledge that the formulation of amendment No. 32 is not as precise as it should be, I wish to press it.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy would not press that amendment because there is no merit in it.  It proposes an estimate of housing requirements which would be separate from and require much less comprehensive information than the overall estimate which we agree shall be carried out within a year from the commencement of this legislation.  It makes no sense.  The Deputy is asking for less than we have agreed to in the compromise. I do not think it should be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not factual. Section 8 (2) leaves it open to each local authority to pursue their own means of estimating housing requirements.  We could get a totally disparate set of results which would not be comparable or scientific. It would be better to have one thorough and comprehensive evaluation of housing stock than to have a number of <Col N="473" /> sample surveys carried out on a different basis by individual local authorities. Deputy De Rossa's point has strength.  It is wrong to suggest that what he is asking for in his amendment is less than what is provided?  The provisions of subsection (2) may or may not be satisfactory.  If local authorities have the option, they will opt for sample survey areas.  Are the criteria set out?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(b) the extent to which there is unused residential accommodation above commercial and/or retail space in buildings,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again this is self-evident.  I would like the Minister to take it on board.  It extends the point I was making on Second Stage.  There is a a lot of residential <Col N="477" /> accommodation on the first, second and third floors of buildings in the cores of towns around this country that is underutilised or unused and was formerly available for residential use.  In an effective assessment of accommodation this should be specifically included.  The reason I specifically wrote it in is that it could in many cases be considered not as residential accommodation but as commercial property if there was nobody living in it at the time.  If there had been nobody living in the accommodation it might not be included by the local authority and that is the reason I have proposed it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is wider than the amendment proposed by Deputy Quinn and The Workers' Party Deputies.  It would have the effect of obliging the Authority, in carrying out the review to identify to what extent there was private rented accommodation available in their area and what the likely demand for that accommodation might be.  It is one of the strange phenomena in housing in Ireland over the last 50 years that in the twenties and early thirties the bulk of private housing was private rented accommodation. The trend moved very sharply away from private rented accommodation to home ownership with the result that, as we have discussed here in the House on another occasion, we have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world.  It is suggested by many people that there will be a return to private rented accommodation and in any estimate of housing requirements, and especially in an estimate which the Minister has now agreed will have to be carried out by all housing authorities within a year of the passing of this Act, it would be germane to that estimate that they establish the extent of private rented accommodation within their functional area.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made by the two Deputies that unused residential <Col N="478" /> accommodation is potentially an important factor in the calculation of the housing requirements.  However, the type of accommodation specifically referred to by Deputy Quinn is only one example of vacant and unused accommodation. Indeed the type of accommodation the Deputy is talking about is peculiar to urban areas.  Under subsection 2 (a) housing authorities are required to have regard to information on the housing conditions of the area which obviously would include the amount of vacant accommodation both in the housing authority's stock and in the private housing stock. Subsection (2) (f) provides that the housing authority should have regard to such other matters as the Minister may from time to time direct and this provision can of course be used to draw the specific attention of housing authorities to the need to have regard to vacant housing accommodation in the estimates of their housing requirements and I propose to tell them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting that under the provisions of section 8 (2) (f) he would direct authorities to take into account of the extent of vacant accommodation that might be available for letting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of my amendment is wider than that.  It would suggest that the Authority would need to assess the total extent of rented accommodation within its functional area whether let or available for letting and that is something that would be appropriate in a survey of the type which has been discussed here. That ought to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is in section 8 is related to overall requirements.  That is the important issue here.  It also relates to how the requirements should be met, whether through local authority house building or private housing for owner occupation, voluntary housing or private rented accommodation.  That is a separate matter entirely.  We are talking <Col N="479" /> about the overall position.  I suggest that the Deputy's amendment is inappropriate and that in those circumstances it should not be pursued.  We are talking about a requirement which is covered perfectly in section 8, with the rider that I would make it known through regulation or guideline&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) A housing authority shall make <Col N="480" /> an annual assessment of the need for the provision by the authority of adequate and suitable accommodation for persons&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This an echo of what we are talking about a little earlier.  Basically its source is to try to put some degree of order on the housing assessments which housing authorities should carry out.  Section 9 as it stands suggests that the housing authority, within one year of the commencement of the section and thereafter as the Minister may from time to time direct shall make in accordance with the section an an assessment of the need for the provision by the Authority.  It would be preferable if the occasions thereafter on which such assessments were to be carried out were more specifically delineated. I am sure the Minister will point out that there is a great deal of work involved in assessments but if a good baseline job is done initially such assessments need not be as extensive or as fundamental thereafter, except at perhaps irregular intervals.  Then they would have to be made as on the first occasion. In principle, I take the view that if you are going to allow an arbitrary decision by local authorities to make such assessments, on balance the outcome will be unsatisfactory generally speaking, because of the pressure of other business and so on.</P>
    <P>The assessment which is implicit in section 9 as it stands is mandatory only once and thereafter it is purely at the discretion of the Minister.  I am not too happy about that because it is not the kind of structured arrangement which should exist in a Bill such as this.  Regular assessment should be the norm and it should be incumbent therein upon the housing authority not just to do such assessment but to take into account and have consultations with the agencies and bodies that have expertise in the area.  Accordingly, I move that there be included in the section a reference to some form of annual assessment, although I would accept that it need not be quite as fundamental as the first one which the Minister has opposed in the section.</P>
    <Col N="481" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the merits of the Minister's argument in relation to the similar amendments that the task of carrying out an overall assessment on housing needs, public and private, in the functional area of the Authority was a major one and would demand much of the resources of the Authority &mdash; some of these arguments being well taken by the House &mdash; it does not hold water in relation to an authority estimating &mdash; or assessing is the word used &mdash; the extent of housing which they feel they would need to provide for people who cannot house themselves. They have that basic information on their housing application lists.  They need to assess how many of the people on those lists are in real need of housing and also to assess how many other people in their functional area there may be who have not yet applied for housing but who are likely to apply.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to reflect that this provision was contained in a similar section in the 1985 Bill.  It was set out at section 9 (1) of the 1985 Bill.  This read &ldquo;...the housing authority shall make an annual assessment of the need...&rdquo; etc., and went on identically as in this Bill.  I have heard of cutbacks but this is ridiculous. The marginal note to the 1985 Bill, section 9, mentioned an annual housing assessment.  For some reason or other, this Administration have changed section 9 (1) to remove the word &ldquo;annual&rdquo; out of the section but apparently &mdash; I presume in some effort to save money &mdash; have used the same piece of typescript in the marginal note.  Therefore, the marginal note still reads: &ldquo;Annual housing assessment&rdquo;. The section is wrong, the margin note is wrong, or the Minister is wrong. I suspect it is the latter.</P>

      <P>I have never walked away from my responsibility, even if it meant holding the line for the parliamentary draftsman.  Amendment No. 34 proposes to reinstate the specific provisions which were in the 1985 Bill.  Amendment No. 35 is basically to the same effect.  The 1985 Bill was unduly restrictive in this regard.  Under the provisions of that Bill referred to by Deputy Boland, local authorities could face legal challenge in regard to the letting of dwelling if an assessment had not been carried out on the anniversary of the previous assessment.  The proposals in this section are a major advance as local authorities have never previously been required to review their waiting list on a regular basis.  The intention is that these assessments would be carried out on a regular basis and as far as possible on an annual basis, but it is desirable that some small discretion be retained in the timing of the assessments. It would be wrong to provide in law for a situation whereby the allocation of local authority housing would be challenged if the assessment were late; in other words, that it had not been done on the anniversary, to the dead day, of the date on which the original assessment had taken place.  I do not think that is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as we have probably noticed earlier in the day, has been inclined to give definitions to certain things which are not, in fact, intended by them.  That is the definition he has now given to these amendments.  The House has been very reasonable with the Minister when he has been reasonable, forthcoming and honest with the House, but that explanation just is not correct and is not a fair one to expect the House to accept.  I dislike saying this, but it is especially not a fair one to put to the House which contains two members of the previous Government who were involved in discussions before the 1985 Bill was adopted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but the point made and that which I wanted to concede was that in relation to young people, because there had been some reference to them earlier by Deputy Gay Mitchell as well. I think I should like to have that included as a specific stipulation in this section. Otherwise, it could be passed over and not given the same relevance as other aspects.  Therefore, I am prepared to accept amendment No. 37.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2), between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) are single,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now talking about assessment, not necessarily the housing of people.  In the assessement of housing needs by a local authority at present, I should say that the local authority of which I was a former member, Dublin Corporation &mdash; whose functional area is located in my constituency &mdash; do not consider single <Col N="490" /> people under the age of 50, formerly under the age of 60 but now effectively under the age of 50, as being eligible for housing.  In some cases I contend they should be considered because of the changing nature of housing demand. Whether or not they are able to house them, they should certainly be included in their assessment figures.  That is my point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I might reinforce what I said earlier.  Certainly the question of single people being housed needs to be addressed.  Some lower age limit needs to be examined in the case of individuals seeking permanent accommodation normally let or rented by a local authority. For example, some people of 15 or 16 years of age coming out of care simply may not be able to cope if they are housed in that type of accommodation.  While I agree with the argument that single people be considered for housing, some lower age limit should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to Deputy Quinn that persons who are in need of housing and unable to provide it from their own resources, are eligible for inclusion in an assessment under the provisions of section 9 whatever may be their marital status.  It is important that that be understood. It might be wrong to identify single persons as a particular category of housing need over and above the consideration of whether they are homeless, living in overcrowded accommodation or otherwise in need of housing.  Simply put, &ldquo;single&rdquo; means that one is not married but it does not mean that one is homeless. I was rather taken by the fact that Deputy Quinn, of all people, would be promoting that kind of categorisation.  It did not seem to me that it was appropriate to introduce something appertaining to marital status in legislation.  I would be opposed to that in principle.  Consequently, I would hope that the Deputy would not press his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not necessarily press it.  However, I might tell the Minister that, in my dealings with the housing <Col N="491" /> section of Dublin Corporation on numerous occassions I have had requests for housing from people who simply cannot afford to house themselves, who have had the misfortune to be above the age of 18 and under the age of 60.  They have been excluded from even being considered by the local authority because of the fact that they are single.  I am not going to make a great point about it.  But there are single people who should be assessed in the assessment process and deemed to be homeless, whether or not the local authority house them.  They are specifically excluded at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are eligible for inclusion in the assessment about which we spoke earlier &mdash; that is important &mdash; because it covers the point being made by Deputy Quinn.  They are eligible at least to be included in the assessment whether or not they get in on the act afterwards but, once in on the assessment, they are a category, but not distinctly so on account of their marital status.  That is the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying and, obviously, that was not my intent.  I am not sure that I necessarily agree with him; perhaps we can revert to it later.  My understanding is that a person who is single in Dublin Corporation's functional area, from the point of view of that local authority, will not be eligible for inclusion on their housing list, and will not form part of their assessment of people in need of housing by a local authority, unless they are over the age of 50 and have some medical problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is partly right and partly wrong.  I do not have the relevant booklet with me but my understanding is that marital status does not enter into the consideration at <Col N="492" /> all.  Rather it is a question of whether it is an individual, single person rather than a person who is single.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the local authority, in this case, Dublin Corporation, obviously is to use all available accommodation to best advantage.  In other words if they have a three-bedroomed house available they will not necessarily put a person on their own into that house.  If they have a one-bedroomed maisonette, flat or whatever available, with no applicant family, whether it be a marital or non-marital family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point that this amendment is different from amendment No. 37 in that it attempts to deal with the position of people who are likely to leave hospital or other similar institutional care without having suitable alternative accommodation available to them irrespective of their age.  The Minister was disposed to accept amendment No. 37 because it specifically related to young people but amendment No. 41 is different in that it envisages local authorities endeavouring to assess the extent to <Col N="494" /> which they are likely to have people, of whatever age, leaving hospitals or similar institutional care and who would not have accommodation in the outside world to go to.  I was interested to note the reason the Minister was not prepared to accept what appeared to me to be an eminently reasonable category.</P>

    <P>The housing authority is obliged under subsection (4) to give one month's notice of its intention to make an assessment to various organisations, other housing authorities, the relevant health board and such bodies as the authority sees fit whose purposes include the provision of accommodation, shelter or welfare.

    <P>&ldquo;(7) Each housing authority shall furnish to the Minister an annual report on its activities under this Act giving details of its existing housing requirements, its prospective housing requirements, the number of persons provided with housing in the course of the year, the number of applicants refused, the number of persons provided with housing who did not formally make an application, information available in relation to housing conditions in its area, the number of houses unfit or unsuitable for human habitation, overcrowded, shared involuntarily, or which are expected to be lost; information on the numbers of people homeless or living in temporary or moveable accommodation; expected changes in the size and structure of the <Col N="497" /> population in the area; the number of people edlerly, disabled or handicapped, who are not reasonably able to meet their accommodation needs themselves, and any other information which the housing authority thinks fit to include.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister shall present to each House of the Oireachtas an annual report compiled from and containing all the material contained in the reports furnished to him by housing authorities and any other information he thinks fit to include.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 71 in my names states:</P>
      <P>In page 20, before section 30, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>30.&mdash;(1)  Each housing authority shall furnish to the Minister an annual report on its activities under this Act giving details of the number of persons provided with housing in the course of the year, the number of applicants, the number accepted for housing, the number refused, the number of persons provided with housing who did not formally make an application, and any other information which the housing authority thinks fit to include.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall present to each House of the Oireachtas an annual report compiled from and containing all the material contained in the reports furnished to him by housing authorities and any other information he thinks fit to include.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not get involved in the discussion on annual assessments by local authorities because I am more concerned about annual reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas as referred to in this section. Housing should be the subject of annual reports to the Houses.  For instance, when does the House get an opportunity to highlight facts in relation to housing? In this year of Dublin's millennium there <Col N="498" /> is in the housing stock of Dublin Corporation 1,200 homes which do not have bathrooms.  That was never reported to the House but it is the type of matter that should be monitored here annually.  Of the 16,000 local authority flats which are the responsibility of Dublin Corporation, about 1,000 are lived in by senior citizens and are in good order but of the remaining 15,000 about two-thirds are, in my view, unfit for human habitation.  No Member would like to live in them.  They are dark, dank places, often smelling of urine from cider parties and are strewn with discarded needles from drug abuse. When did we debate the condition of such accommodation?  We should be debating it regularly.</P>
    <P>The long waiting lists are under control although they may get out of control very soon because of the fact that the Government are not building houses but we have not dealt with the deplorable quality of housing stock in the ownership of Dublin Corporation.  If the Minister, or his Minister of State, were from the Dublin region they would appreciate what I am talking about.  I suggest to them, if they can find a moment to listen to me, that they should take a tour of St. Teresa's Gardens, Bridgefoot Street Flats, Oliver Bond Flats, Dolphin House Flats or Marrowbone Lane Flats &mdash; they are all within one square mile of each other &mdash; to get a picture of the problem.  The condition of such accommodation should be the subject of annual reviews in the House.</P>
    <P>We do not know the figures in regard to homeless.  An assessment was made by voluntary bodies but I understand that they are not sure if those figures are correct because there has been a big movement of people to the UK where they sleep under bridges.  They are now homeless in the UK.  I had a meeting with the director of the Irish Centre in Camden Town earlier this year and he advised me that the problem was pathetic, that there are huge numbers of people from this country homeless in London.  Those problems should be the subject of annual reports to the Houses of the Oireachtas so that they can be examined.  I should <Col N="499" /> like to ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Information on the operation of the provision of this measure, or the rest of the housing code, may be obtained through housing authorities without recourse to a statutory provision such as that proposed.  The amendments are unnecessary.  They could, in fact, be harmful to the extent that they could weaken the Minister's position in obtaining information which was not specifically referred to in the subsection or which, for example, the housing authority did not see fit to include in its annual report to the Minister.  If they decide to dodge me I am stymied and for that reason I do not wish the Deputies to pursue these amendments.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the bulk of the information sought by the Department from housing authorities is got on a quarterly basis and not on an annual basis.  A substantial amount of that information on the programmes and activities of housing authorities is already published in the quarterly and the annual bulletin of housing statistics and in my Department's annual report which is quite a voluminous document.  The publication of additional information on particular aspects of local authority housing programmes could be considered as necessary or appropriate but I have to conclude that it would not be appropriate to accept the amendments for that reason and I am expecting that they will not be pursued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to disappoint the Minister but it seems to me that any Minister worth his salt would not accept that this section would restrict any local authority from supplying information reasonably requested by the Minister or his Department.  This is a parliamentary democracy that we live in. That parliamentary democracy requires the Executive, by Constitution, to answer to this House for its actions.  The whole area of housing, and particularly the examples I have given of 1,200 local authority tenants of Dublin Corporation <Col N="500" /> being without bathrooms, and 10,000 flats offering sub-human accommotion and the position of the homeless, which I have outlined, should be reported to this House annually and should be reviewed annually.  The second part of amendment No. 71, in my name, is perfectly reasonable. It is something which the House should have no difficulty whatsoever in accepting.  I hope the Minister will rethink and will accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>But those statistics, and all the relevant statistics, concerning housing and everything in the public domain are reported on.  I get those reports on a quarterly basis.  I do not think we want elaborate and restrictive reporting arrangements.  We have enough information and it comes already by way of arrangements between the Department, the local authorities and the housing authorities.  We publish the statistics on a regular basis, much more frequently than an annual basis.  I am not particularly anxious to allow a local authority to decide on what they will report and what they will not report.  They report to me and to the Department everything that is required so far as the statistics are concerned and we do not want any restriction put on them in that way.  For that reason I recommend to the House that we do not accept these amendments.</P>

I do not think the House should allow the Minister to tell us what he will or will not report.  He should be required to make <Col N="501" /> this annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is a perfectly reasonable suggestion.  The Government, and Government agencies over the years, have got too used to not reporting to Parliament and it is time we said no.

      <P>It is not clear what these amendments seek to achieve.  If it is to impose a statutory obligation to house homeless persons, I have already indicated that an approach which puts an obligation on the local authorities to house one category of persons over all others, no matter how pressing that category's needs may be, is not a sound one. The Government's approach is a combination of providing extra resources to voluntary bodies and new powers to local authorities as provided for in section 10 of the Bill.  These powers provide local authorities with a range of alternatives to deal with individual cases of homelessness. They are, of course, additional to the use by the authority of their own housing accommodation to meet the needs of individual homeless persons.  As has been mentioned in the debate, local authorities, particularly the large urban ones, have quite an amount of accommodation becoming vacant which is available for homeless persons and emergency cases.  I foresee also that local authorities would enter into arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide accommodation on a regular basis for homeless persons, and this is precisely why the Government are assisting the development of voluntary housing accommodation with grants of up to 95 per cent of costs.</P>
      <P>To summarise, local authorities have always their first power, the power to provide a house.</P>

      <P>I can summarise what I want to say about this if it would settle things, as distinct from giving a long treatise on it.  My personal opinion is there is no shortage of standards for private rented accommodation.  That about sums it up.  I do not see it necessary to proceed with that amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If this provision operates there is a danger we will see here what we read about in England from time to time of homeless people being put up in very substandard, inferior bed and breakfast type of accommodation of the worst possible sort and very often being forced to sleep in overcrowded accommodation. Whilst that was an attempt in Britain to represent a temporary solution for that category of people, it has become a scandal in its own way.  The purpose of the amendment was to endeavour to ensure <Col N="507" /> that if there was a tendency towards that the Minister could by regulation set out minimum standards of accommodation which would have to be subscribed to. Perhaps the Minister would bear those points in mind in any regulations or guidelines he migh afterwards issue when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps to settle the matter, let me say by way of clarification that the Department have issued standards for the provision of voluntary housing accommodation, including hostel type accommodation, under the voluntary housing scheme.  Housing authorities should have regard to these standards when arranging accommodation for homeless persons.  The provision of accommodation in a night shelter or similar institution would not be a permissible response to the needs of a homeless person under section 2.  With regard to private rented accommodation, virtually all relevant housing authorities have made by-laws relating to minimum standards under section 70 of the 1966 Act.  In addition regulations have been made under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, governing the standards of formerly rent controlled dwellings. I think that was what Deputy Boland was anxious would be controlled.</P>

      <P>The Minister makes the point that there is adequate Statute governing private rented accommodation. Whether that is true or not, would he agree that whatever Statute is there, local authorities are extremely reluctant to pursue landlords of private rented accommodation and in many cases the conditions under which elderly people and sick people who are being taken out of our institutions and euphemistically cared for in the community are living in accommodation which is far below the standards we would expect for ourselves?  If we are going to enable local <Col N="508" /> authorities to rent accommodation as we enable the Eastern Health Board and other health boards to rent accomodation, we must insist that the accommodation renting is of a proper and adequate standard.</P>

      <P>No.  Our amendment, which was in the names of a number of Deputies, proposed to make this a statutory duty.  I am not going to query or argue with your ruling, Sir, that it imposes a charge.  It seems to me to be in conflict with a previous ruling elsewhere. Be that as it may, since we cannot formally move the amendment, I, on behalf of the Labour Party, am opposed to the section as it stands because I do not think it meets the fundamental objective of providing people with the right to shelter.  This has had a substantial debate on Second Stage and I do not propose to go over the ground again having regard to the time.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, the provision was in the 1985 Bill.  It was a good provision.  It recognised all the constraints that were there.  It has been taken out; it has been unnecessarily removed.  Since we were unable to debate that net point in relation to amendment No. 45 I am opposed to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I have to adopt a broadly similar approach.  Naturally, one has to respect the ruling of the Chair but I found it difficult to understand why the amendments which sought to place some degree of obligation on the housing authority were deemed out of order on the grounds that they involve potential charges on the Revenue.  We <Col N="509" /> took other amendments today which expressly did so and we debated them. However, the essential issue is that the section as proposed provided that &ldquo;a housing authority may, subject to such regulations,...&rdquo; etc.  Our contention is that this Bill is one of the very rare occasions on which we get an opportunity to address the problems of homeless people.  The view of very many public representatives and of all of the voluntary organisations in this area is that that section as proposed is not nearly sufficiently strong.  That is my view.  If the section allows the local authority any option that option will be availed of and, unfortunately, people who might get accommodation will not so be offered. Some of the reasons of that evasion will be good reasons; financial constraints, lack of staffing and all the other things that time does not allow us to go into now.  We wished to see put into that section &mdash; and I still wish to see it &mdash; an obligation of some kind on a housing authority along the lines that the housing authority shall take these things into account and shall make arrangements.  I accept that nobody here would wish to place an absolute obligation of an unqualified nature on a housing authority to take up anyone who came to the door. I am not suggesting that.  I suggest that subject to the reservations made by the Minister and subject to other constraints in the priority and letting systems operated by the local authorities as set out by the section, and applying to the categories listed in the Bill, the housing authority would be obliged to do their best to deal with homeless people.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this as probably the last chance this House will get during the life of the current Dáil to deal with the problem of homelessness and possibly it is the last chance the Minister will get as Minister and the last chance we might get as Opposition spokespersons.  Will the Minister consider bringing to bear some form of obligation on those local authorities so that they cannot simply say that all that the Bill asks of them is that they may take this issue into account and that therefore they can choose not to for <Col N="510" /> reasons which they can justify?  That is a fundamental weakness in the Bill and I appeal to the Minister to redress that problem in whatever way he sees fit and which is acceptable to the House.  This should be done urgently in the interests of people for whom this Bill should be a major watershed but which unless this problem is addressed will become just another missed opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the position taken by the previous two speakers in this section.  The debate of recent years on the question of homelessness has hinged around this question of an obligation on some authority to provide accommodation for people who find themselves homeless.  As the wording of section 10 stands it seems that a housing authority may, subject to regulations that may be made by the Minister, provide accommodation, assistance and so on. This is not strong enough and I would urge the Minister to take on board the amendments proposed although ruled out of order, or some variation of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had nothing to do with the ruling out of order of the amendment which was ruled out of order because of the potential charge on the Exchequer inherent in it.  I know that is no comfort to the people who wished to move the amendments.  In any event the amendments were both defective in their intention and in their meaning and would have made nonsense of what they were seeking to achieve.  I will not waste the time of the House in giving the details as to how that transpires.  No doubt I will privately tell the Deputies that this could not have been done even if the amendments had been allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want Members to minimise what has been done in this Housing Bill. This is a big advance.  It has been recognised inside the House and outside the House that it is a big advance.  I have taken a number of soundings from people who on a daily basis are operating in the housing area in the provision of housing and the consensus advice to me is that I <Col N="511" /> should proceed in this way, as it is the best way in the long term.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides very considerable additional powers to housing authorities to secure accommodation for homeless people.  These powers are additional to the basic response of housing authorities to the problems of homelessness which is and will remain the direct responsibility of local authority housing.  It the amendments were accepted a housing authority would be obliged to secure accommodation for a homeless person through a voluntary organisation, provide financial assistance to that person or arrange private rented accommodation for him. The basic response of providing a local authority house would be ruled out in the case of homeless persons and the Deputies would have defeated their purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not agree with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, it is not for discussion here because it has been ruled out of order.  If the provision of a local authority house was included in section 10 as one of the alternatives, the proposed amendment would still be defective in the light of the 1985 Bill which was presented by the previous Government. The first difficulty with this type of statutory obligation is the necessary provision against abuse.  Section 2 (2) of the 1985 <Col N="512" /> Bill had such a provision which was seriously criticised by various organisations campaigning on behalf of the homeless.  The second fundamental difficulty was that some homeless persons might primarily require medical or nursing care up to and including hospitalisation. This was specifically recognised by the committee on homelessness which reported to the Minister for Health in December 1984 and which identified a category of homeless persons who were primarily the responsibility of the health boards.  The distinction would be important in providing a proper response to the individual needs of the homeless person and it is a distinction which is ignored in the proposed amendment. The enabling provision in section 10 will provide the necessary flexibility for housing authorities to determine the most appropriate response in individual cases.  I would also envisage that housing authorities should work closely with health boards in this regard.  Section 10 gives additional powers to housing authorities to deal with the whole question of homelessness and I would recommend it strongly to the House.  My soundings with all those who have been very closely associated with housing of all categories of people, and not just the homeless, was that this is the best way to proceed and it gives the best chance of dealing effectively in our circumstances at this time with the needs of the homeless and all the other deserving categories as well.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and I hope by the time the debate is concluded this evening we will have a composite motion agreed by all parties.  So far this House has spoken as one voice so far as these cases are concerned.  I gather from Deputy Kennedy that towards the end of the debate there will be a composite motion presented which we will all be able to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to explain why I had some problems with the Labour Party motion and felt is was desirable that these three cases should be looked at separately.  They are all at different stages of the legal process in another jurisdiction.  I will deal very briefly with the Annie Maguire case because it is simplest.  She is out of prison, although she, her husband and son and three other people spent a number of years in prison convicted of a crime on <Col N="516" /> flimsy evidence &mdash; on the test of a glove she owned which she may or may not have used or which may have been used by other people.  Even understanding the very tense atmosphere there was in Britain at that time as a result of a number of bombings, that seems to have been quite flimsy evidence on which to convict her.  She has served her prison term and is now free.</P>
    <P>I have met Mrs. Maguire on a number of occasions.  The most striking thing about her and the other members of the family is that they understand how they were caught up in a system which convicted them of a crime they did not commit.  All they want now is to have their names cleared so that they will not go through the remainder of their lives with this tag of having been found guilty of a very horrible crime hanging around their necks.</P>
    <P>The Guildford Four is in a different category from the Annie Maguire case or the Birmingham Six case, and this is where the problem arises for me with the Labour Party motion.  They were condemned to life imprisonment for the Guildford and Woolwich bombings. They were extremely unlikely bombers or terrorists because some of them were living on the fringe of society in London, and an English girl was included in this group.  That is as may be, but they were found guilty and imprisoned.  As a result of the Balcombe Street siege some time later, other men tried for that crime admitted they had been involved in the Guildford and Woolwich bombings. Despite this fact, the court did not order a retrial or say that the Guildford Four were innocent of the crime but rather that they were jointly responsible for the crime with those involved in the Balcombe Street siege.  There was no question, nor was it ever suggested, that the Balcombe Street people volunteered that they were involved in this crime because they wanted to get their pals released. Their very detailed knowledge of what had happened in Guildford and Woolwich left no doubt in anybody's mind that they were guilty.  Probably most people would accept that they were the sole <Col N="517" /> authors of those crimes, apart from the godfathers who directed them from another place.  However, the Guildford Four were not released.  An effort was made, but not a satisfactory one, to have them released on a retrial basis.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months further evidence has become available from a Miss Yvonne Fox that she was in the presence that night of Paul Hill.  She thereby gave him an alibi.  This new statement, together with other evidence, was submitted last year to the Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, by Cardinal Hume, among others.  Anybody who has been involved in making representations on behalf of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four or the Maguire family will recognise how slowly the British legal system works, particularly when there appears to be criticism of an arm of their administration.</P>
    <P>The people who are seeking justice in all three cases include many who are not Irish.  A large body of respected establishment figures in Britain feel strongly about this matter.  The list of 200 people from the House of Commons and the House of Lords who signed the motion on behalf of the Guildford Four includes some who would be by no means sympathetic to Ireland or to Irish nationalism. In other spheres they have been quite anti-Irish.  Nevertheless they have signed petitions in favour of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family.</P>
    <P>As a result of the representation by Cardinal Hume and others, the Home Secretary agreed to have an investigation conducted into this new evidence.  A number of Deputies from this House visited Mr. Hurd last autumn and he gave them to understand that he hoped to be in a position to review the report of this investigation around Christmas or the New Year.  I wrote to him in February reminding him of this and he replied in March saying he had not yet received the result of the investigation.  He emphasised it was his personal responsibility to have a look at the investigation and to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.  I understand he received the results of the <Col N="518" /> investigation in the middle or towards the end of April but he still has not made a decision regarding referral to the Court of Appeal.  I hope the motion agreed tonight will ask him to expedite the referral of the case to the Court of Appeal. The Guildford Four should go through the full process of the law before we ask for clemency.</P>
    <P>As regards the Birmingham Six, I have been involved in their case for a number of years.  I have written to successive Home Secretaries and have also met with them.  I am convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that these people are not guilty.  I sat in on the trial for a number of days, including the day when the decision was announced by the three judges.  It was the most depressing and disappointing day of my life because I was quite convinced of the weight of the evidence put forward on their behalf, particularly the change of evidence by police officer Clarke and the change of evidence during the hearing itself by Joyce Lynass. This struck me as being a very significant factor which should have influenced the three judges.  Doctor Skuse was a most unsatisfactory witness who was entirely confused and his evidence was not beneficial to the prosecution case.  Nevertheless, I had to accept the fact that the appeal was turned down.</P>
    <P>I join Members of this House in asking the Home Secretary to exercise his right of clemency, a right which is exercised in cases across the world.  In the past few months Private Thaine was released having been convicted of murder and having served only two and a half years of a much longer sentence.</P>
    <P>A composite motion has just been handed to me which I can accept and we should join in adopting the course of action I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I welcome the efforts being made to find a composite motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government share the anxiety which has been expressed on all sides of the House that a miscarrage of justice may have occurred in these cases.  As has <Col N="519" /> been very evident throughout the discussion of the motion, this is one area where there is broad consensus between the main political parties in Ireland.  The debate has been characterised by a very high level of contribution from all sides of the House.  I would like on behalf of the Minister to express appreciation for the complimentary remarks made in the House in regard to his and the Government's handling of this sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>I would also wish at the outset of my reply to place on record the Government's appreciation of the efforts of the all-party delegation who travelled to Britain to meet with the Home Secretary in order to convey to him clear and united view of the Oireachtas on this issue.</P>
    <P>I know that the concerns which have been voiced in this debate are widely felt by people throughout Ireland.  It is important to bear in mind also that there are many in Britain who normally have no association with what might be regarded as Irish causes who are equally concerned about these cases.  The support given to the campaigns of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family by many distinguished figures in Britain has added great authority to the campaigns on behalf of those who are imprisoned.</P>
    <P>We should also in this debate acknowledge the particular concern of the Irish community in Britain about these cases. The representative Irish associations and societies have repeatedly expressed their disquiet at developments in relation to the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire cases.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is vital that the broadly based interest in and support for these cases should be maintained.  However, we must at all times avoid the trap of ever allowing the campaign to degenerate in any way into anti-British sentiment.  The real test of a legal system is not whether miscarriages of justice can ever occur but whether &mdash; when they have occurred &mdash; there is a possibility for remedying them, a point made very strongly by Deputy Spring.</P>
    <P>There is one extremely important point <Col N="520" /> which must be underlined at this stage. While concerns at any possible miscarriage of justice involved in these three cases is fully justified, we should never allow ourselves for one moment to forget the horror of the Birmingham, Guildford and Woolwich bombings.  I know that I speak for all of us when I say that we unreservedly condemn the activities of those who engaged in that horrific campaign of bombing, which brought death and grevious suffering to very many innocent people.  I should like also to thank Deputies Spring and Birmingham for their support in this condemnation.</P>
    <P>I would like now to look at the cases individually because as Deputy Barry has rightly said, the cases are complex and they are at very different stages of the legal process.  Let me start with the Birmingham Six.  As the House is aware, the British Home Secretary referred this case to the court of appeal on 20 January last year.  After a hearing which lasted seven weeks and received unprecedented media coverage in this country, the Court of Appeal, in a written judgment delivered on 28 January 1988, rejected the appellants' case.  The Government subsequently issued a statement expressing regret at the decision to maintain the convictions and sentences of the Six.  The statement also mentioned that this concern was shared right across the political and legal spectrum in both Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The Government raised the case of the Birmingham Six at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference meetings in Belfast on 2 and 10 February.  The Tánaiste issued a further statement on 14 April after the House of Lords refused the appellants' request to hear their case. On that occasion the Tánaiste stated that the Government were deeply perturbed that, despite widespread and continuing concern, there may have been a miscarriage of justice in these cases, the avenues of legal appeal seem to have been exhausted and the Six remained imprisoned.  He pointed out that the Birmingham Six have now spent over 13 years in jail.  He said that in the circumstances the Government considered <Col N="521" /> that there were compelling humanitarian arguments for the Home Secretary to consider using the wide-ranging powers available to him in such cases.  The Tánaiste further stated that urgent contact would be made with the Home Secretary to discuss the Birmingham Six case, as well as other cases which continue to give rise to concern.</P>
    <P>I would like to place on record our appreciation of the recent decision to allow Richard McIlkenny compassionate parole to attend the funeral of his brother. I know that this gesture was greatly appreciated by the relatives and friends of the Birmingham Six.  I would commend the authorities for their humanitarian decision, which was widely welcomed throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Guildford Four, Deputies will be aware that the Home Secretary in August last year ordered an inquiry by the Avon and Somerset police into new evidence on the conviction of Paul Hill, Gerard Conlon, Paddy Armstong and Carole Richardson for the Guildford and Woolwich bombings, as has been stated by very many Deputies who have spoken here, a most unlikely group to be involved in conspiracy and bombing.  The police inquiry is complete and a report of the investigations was handed over to the Home Secretary on 13 April.  The Home Secretary will examine the report and other relevant information before deciding whether to refer the case to the Court of Appeal.  The Government would support such a referral.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach met with Paul Hill's wife in New York in April during his visit to the United States and I subsequently met his mother, Mrs. Lily Hill, in Dublin to discuss Mr. Hill's welfare.  Our Embassy in London has made a number of consular visits to members of the Guildford Four in prison, including to Gerard Conlon whose particular problems in Full Sutton prison have been referred to by a number of Deputies and in particular by Deputy Roche.  As and when necessary we will continue to make representations on welfare grounds on behalf of the Guildford Four to the British authorities. <Col N="522" /> In regard to the case of the Maguire family, there are no significant developments to report in this case.  However, as Deputies will be aware, the convictions of the Maguire family are closely related to those of the Guildford Four and any developments in the latter case might be expected to have implications for the Maguire family.  The Government would welcome a full review of the convictions of the Maguire family.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have provided here tonight a clear and somewhat detailed description of the current position in relation to these three cases.  The Government will continue to work hard to ensure that all possible avenues are explored on behalf of the prisoners.  As recently as this week, the Irish Ambassador in London met the Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, and discussed these cases with him.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt &mdash; and this was referred to by nearly all speakers &mdash; but that the campaign on behalf of the Birmingham Six, Guildford Four and the Maguire family will continue.  The unease about the verdicts is persistent and widely felt.  If a miscarriage of justice has, indeed, occurred, the task for all involved is not to attribute blame but to do whatever we can to see that the situation is remedied.  The Government's approach is a constructive, humanitarian one and we are encouraged to have the support of all Members of the Oireachtas in its pursuit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Among those of us who have been involved in the ongoing cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven, there has been an all-party approach.  I would be very concerned lest at the end of this debate that line would be broken.  The strength of our campaign as democratically elected politicians has lain in the all-party approach.  I would like to pay tribute to people who have been with me in this campaign since the beginning. It has been a campaign that has been going on now for a number of years.  We have gone to London on a number of occasions and we will continue to go to <Col N="523" /> London, either to meet the prisoners on the one hand, or the officers of Government in power for the time being on the other hand.</P>
      <P>On 21 November 1972, 21 people were murdered and 60 people were seriously injured in two pubs in Birmingham &mdash; the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town.  Immediately after that particular act of savagery, five individuals were picked up in transit from Birmingham New Street Station to the port that leads to Belfast.  They were picked up as they were about to board a vessel to attend a funeral of a proven IRA man.  In addition, a sixth individual was brought into custody that same evening.  These individuals were Robert Hunter, Patrick Hill, William Power, Hugh Callaghan, John Walker &mdash; the only man not from Ardoyne, being from Derry &mdash; and the sixth individual, Richard McIlkenny. These individuals received 21 separate life sentences each and they continue to serve those sentences.  The case itself is Byzantine in the sense that it is extremely intricate and complex.  There have been a number of appeals, the most recent being at the end of seven weeks where we heard their Lordships of Appeal find nothing whatsoever in favour of the Birmingham Six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 October 1974, at Guildford, five people were killed and 50 people injured. On 7 November 1974, two people died and 27 were injured at Woolwich.  Paul Hill of Belfast, Patrick Armstrong of London, Gerard Conlon of Belfast and Carole Richardson of London are now serving life terms for their alleged part in those particular acts of brutality.  As a direct consequence of the Guildford and Woolwich bombings, seven individuals were subsequently brought into custody as being the bomb makers in those acts of atrocity.  That was Annie Maguire and her husband Paddy Maguire, her two sons, Giuseppi Conlon who subsequently died in prison, Sean Smyth, a lodger in the Harlesden home of the Maguires and Patrick O'Neill, a neighbour.  The two junior Maguires, aged 16 and 13 at the <Col N="524" /> time, were sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from four to five years. Of all the cases &mdash; and unfortunately these individuals have served their terms of imprisonment &mdash; on fair observation by the lawyers, by the lay people and by the scribes, the Maguire case is the unfairest, in the context of a miscarriage of justice, of all of these three cases.  I would like to pay tribute to Annie Maguire for the manner of her carriage and her demeanour subsequent to her release.  She has been calm on her own behalf and on behalf of those other five surviving victims of this miscarriage of justice and she has approached the case with great integrity, not forgetting her obligation to the still incarcerated Birmingham Six and Guildford Four.  At all times she has been extremely fair and extremely balanced in indicating her concern not only for herself and her family and for her neighbours but also for the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.</P>
    <P>On 14/15 July 1986 there was an Oireachtas all-party visit to London to pursue these cases with the various authorities and at that time the all-party Oireachtas group split up and we conducted various prison visits.  On 16 October 1986 there were again prison visits and a visit to the British Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd.  I must say that he received us with great courtesy and is undoubtedly a gentleman in the best British tradition.  Having listened to us he gave us soothing undertakings to look into the cases.  In fairness to him he did honour what he said and undertook to have a look at the possibility of reopening the Birmingham Six case.  He did exercise his prerogative under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1968, section 16 of which allows him to refer cases of this nature to the Court of Appeal.  Subsequently the case went to their Lordships of Appeal and their lordships, in their wisdom or unwisdom, could find nothing good to say for the Birmingham Six and their case was kicked unceremoniously out of the British legal system.  They now remain incarcerated on the periphery of that system in various prisons throughout the so-called home counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> The only way that any help can be given to these Six is for the British Home Secretary to exercise his power of clemency under section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1968.  Nothing else remains.  As we know, there was an examination of the prospect of appeal from the Court of Appeal decision through to the House of Lords, but a committee of appeal of the House of Lords rejected their right to appeal to the House of Lords sitting as the highest court in the land.  Therefore the legal procedures, as far as the Birmingham Six are concerned, are now exhausted and the only thing that remains is for the Home Secretary to do the decent thing, to go up to the prison gates and turn the key and let these individuals out.  There is no other recourse.</P>
    <P>In that regard, under the aegis of our interparliamentary union on 7 and 9 April 1987 last, we visited Westminster where again we met a very large number of all-party Members of Parliament who attended those meetings on the cases of the Maguires, the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.  The case of the Guildford Four is now in the hands of the British Home Secretary.  He is considering a report which he has received from the Avon and Somerset police and that report has been on his desk since 13 April last.  That is a long time and it is about time the Home Secretary &mdash; with the greatest respect to the gentleman, and gentleman and reasonable man he is &mdash; made a decision whether this matter should go to the Court of Appeal or not. Being of a relatively pessimistic nature I have very little hope that, even if he does refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, their Lordships of Appeal will find anything to support the possibility of their being released.</P>
    <P>I see a cul-de-sac situation so far as the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four are concerned.  If the appeal of the Guildford Four is not allowed, then it falls back into section 17 of the 1968 Act where the Home Secretary would have to exercise clemency.  There is a cul-de-sac in relation to the Birmingham Six and a prospective cul-de-sac in relation to the <Col N="526" /> Guildford Four.  The only humanitarian thing for the British Home Secretary to do now is to exercise clemency under this legal mechanism.  There is no other route for those two cases.</P>
    <P>If the Guildford Four case succeeds through the Court of Appeal or by way of the British Home Secretary exercising clemency, then automatically the Maguire case falls because that is so tightly interlinked with the Guildford Four case.  The home of Annie Maguire was described by the British gutter press as a bomb making factory.  That was a grossly unfair, wrong and inaccurate charge against a woman who had yet to face the courts and who then had to serve quite an extensive period of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am calling now on the British Home Secretary to exercise his powers under this 1968 Act, to exercise clemency on behalf of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and organise a pardon for the Maguire Seven.  From time to time we are critical of the British establishment and what it represents in Irish terms but there has been much support for these cases throughout the British establishment, including the churches and all political parties.  I think that the letter from Lord Devlin entitled &ldquo;Case for the Royal Prerogative&rdquo; in <i>The Times</i> of 15 April 1986, Cardinal Hume's letter and the leader in <i>The Times</i> which accompanies it are of clarion quality. Lord Devlin said:</P>
    <P>I have seen only a little of the material of the Maguire and Guildford cases in which convictions were obtained for revolting acts of terrorism but enough to make me doubt whether the right men were caught.  In the Guildford case the IRA gang subsequently claimed sole responsibility for the crime, that was the Balcombe Street Four.  Their evidence was heard by the Court of Appeal which had the power either to reject it out of hand as beyond belief or to order a new trial by jury of the whole cases.  Instead of this they treated it as an issue which <Col N="527" /> they had power to determine themselves and which they decided against the accused.  Thus, what was truly an indivisible case was tried in two parts, one by a jury and the other by judges.</P>
    <P>Lord Devlin continues:</P>
    <P>So I welcome the Cardinal's request that these cases should be referred back to the Court of Appeal, but there is more to it than this.</P>
    <P>and he concludes:</P>
    <P>Protestations of innocence by prisoners are common enough.  Support of them by distinguished persons is not unknown but the total effect must be mountainous before it can command attention.  Here in these cases it is as high as ever, it has been continuous for years.  It has been tested by a number of others besides the Cardinal himself. It is strengthened by all the other considerations mentioned in your Leader. It confronts what, on paper, looks to be a weak case.  None of this can be admitted and weighed by a court of law but to do justice in every individual case is sometimes beyond the reach of the law.  It is the very thing that, in the last resort, the royal prerogative was fashioned to attain.</P>
    <P>We are calling on the Government to persuade the British Government to instruct the Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, to exercise his power under the 1968 Act.  That is not too much to ask for in these cases.</P>
    <P>I will return briefly to the Birmingham Six case to give an example of the perverseness and the attitude which prefailed throughout the Court of Appeal hearing.  An allegation was made by Mr. Chris Mullins, who wrote a definitive book on the subject, that during the hearing Chief Superintendent Reid, a star witness, and Dr. Frank Skuse, another star witness for the prosecution, contacted one another while under oath. There is irrefutable evidence that these two individuals communicated with one another during the currency of that trial <Col N="528" /> and, in view of people more learned in the law than I am, that there was a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.  I now charge both those individuals that, during the course of their evidence, they twisted and turned and that Dr. Skuse was less than honest in his approach to the forensic evidence.  I was at the Court of Appeal hearing in the Old Bailey and I was sitting beside a prominent legal luminary who was embarassed by the evidence given by Dr. Skuse under oath.  I have the gravest doubts &mdash; even to this day &mdash; as to how their Lordships could, in their wisdom and experience, accept that individual's evidence.  There was not one scintilla of doubt in the minds of their Lordships at the conclusion of his evidence.  It left me positively horrified.</P>
    <P>I do not consider myself to be objective in regard to these cases, I am on the side of the individuals concerned and against a regime which allows this situation to continue.  I am grateful to the Minister, the Minister of State, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry, for the manner of their approach to the whole situation and to these cases.  Chief Superintendent Reid and Dr. Frank Skuse are indicative of the type of trickery that went on during the course of the Birmingham Six case.</P>
    <P>The allegations of Mr. Chris Mullins were correct but although they were examined by &mdash; I presume the DPP &mdash; they were rejected.  He had irrefutable evidence that these two individuals conspired to pervert the court of justice but they got off scot free without any criticism. It is that sort of atmosphere which has begun to infect the Birmingham Six case.  One of the six was released for the death of a relative, which was a humanitarian act, but he was accompanied by a heavy guard of police and prison officers.</P>
    <P>Anybody who meets these individuals in Longlartin &mdash; where we saw them&mdash; in Gartree or Wormwood Scrubs knows, having spoken to the individual warders, that the warders have said that these individuals could not, in conscience, have committed the crimes with which they were charged.  In one of these prisons, a <Col N="529" /> very prominent and decent deputy governor &mdash; I will not name him or the prison &mdash; was quite satisfied that having been in charge of these individuals for a period of time, having regard to their general conduct, attitude and co-operation that they could not be guilty of the crimes with which they were charged.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State to keep up the pressure and to request the Government to continue apace because the backbenchers on all sides of the House will continue to push for justice for these individuals, the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven &mdash; now six.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the officers in the Irish Embassy in London who have given of their own time on a number of occasions to bring us from London to Longlartin where we spent a long weekend.  The recent visit by the Irish Ambassador to the British Home Secretary was worthwhile because it keeps up the campaign.  I should also like to pay tribute to the Irish societies who have done so much to highlight &mdash; and continue to do so &mdash; these cases of miscarriages of justice.</P>

      <P>If the last two days cross-Channel exchanges on extradition clearly demonstrate anything it is that judges can get things wrong.  They can get things wrong as much in Ireland as they have in Britain.</P>
      <P>We all appear to agree in this House that there is a difference between the law and justice.  This has been clearly illustrated in the McVeigh extradition case in the last couple of days.  It is also demonstrated in the case of Callaghan, McIlkenny, Hill, Power, Hunter and Walker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments of the Labour Party motion.  I would like to see the release of the Birmingham Six, the Guilford Four and a pardon for the <Col N="530" /> Maguire Seven but I do not believe that the debate and passage of such a motion by Dáil Éireann will have any effect whatsoever on the British authorities.  In the wake of the McVeigh debacle, quite the contrary is probably the case.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that the Progressive Democrats' parliamentary party have tabled an amendment to the Labour motion asking Dáil Éireann to call on the British Home Secretary to reconsider his decision not to grant clemency to the Birmingham Six in the light of the reasonable doubt cast on the evidence of the Crown's chief technical expert, Dr. Skuse, and to expedite the referral of the Guilford Four and associated Maguire case to the Court of Appeal.  We firmly believe that most people &mdash; indeed, the Birmingham Six's lawyers included &mdash; would see our course of action as being more realistic, more practical and far more likely to be put into effect than the blanket Labour motion.  Quite simply, it is not asking the British authorities to set aside or overrule the decisions of their courts.</P>
    <P>It is proper to call for political intervention in the British justice system at this stage &mdash; just as the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, criticised the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, acting on behalf of the State, for failing to intervene, at two points, in the McVeigh court case in Portlaoise on Monday.</P>
    <P>It is in this spirit that we state that the British justice system is now exhausted for the Birmingham Six and that that system has failed to reach a satisfactory resolution of their case.</P>
    <P>I want to place particular emphasis on the Birmingham Six case in this debate because the Birmingham Six have reached the end of the legal line.  Their case is setting a precedent for the Guilford Four to follow.</P>
    <P>I understand that two options, with little chance of success, are now being pursued on behalf of the Birmingham Six since the Court of Appeal upheld the original convictions at the end of January. The lawyers for the Birmingham Six are preparing a petition to the European <Col N="531" /> Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg making the case that the men did not get a fair trial under one of the Articles of the Convention on Human Rights. They are claiming that half of the Birmingham Six case was heard by a jury; the other half was heard by the Court of Appeal judges 13 year later.  They also claim that this required the defendants to prove their innocence beyond reasonable doubt rather than the other way round.</P>
    <P>The second option is being pursued by Sir John Farr, the Conservative MP in the Gartree prison area, in the House of Commons in the next couple of days.  He is seeking an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill in Britain which would allow for a review tribunal to be set up to examine all controversial cases, including the Birmingham Six.  There is little chance, according to the Six men's lawyers, that either course of action will materially affect their position.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the substance of concern in this country about the case of the Birmingham Six.  By common consent, the first trial took place while Britain was gripped, understandably, by anti-IRA/anti-Irish hysteria in the wake of the horrific bombs tragedy in two Birmingham pubs which killed 21 people and injured 162 in November 1974.  Subsequent appeals in the case have been seen as putting not the six individuals, but rather the integrity of the British justice system, on trial.</P>
    <P>This was illustrated most graphically in Lord Denning's notorious and, in my view, disgraceful pronouncement in the Court of Appeal in 1980 when he said that the alternative, that there had been an all-embracing conspiracy of perjury on the part of a substantial number of very high-ranking policemen, was &ldquo;too appalling a vista to be contemplated and therefore should not be contemplated&rdquo;. That so eminent a judge as Lord Denning, albeit now retired, should say as he did a few months ago on a BBC television programme that it were better for innocent people to be imprisoned than the justice system be discredited, makes one <Col N="532" /> very uneasy about either conscious or unconscious bias.</P>
    <P>The two pillars of evidence on which the convictions rest are the confessions and the forensic evidence of Dr. Frank Skuse.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Six were savagely beaten while in custody.  The conflict is on whether they were beaten on arrival at Winson Green prison or earlier while in police cells.  Apart from the prisoners themselves, several witnesses gave evidence to the Court of Appeal of mistreatment of prisoners. They were disbelieved.  What motive, for example, did Joyce Lynass have for perjury? The law requires confessions to be voluntary.  Is it reasonable to doubt whether the four confessions, in this case, were voluntary?</P>
    <P>Dr. Skuse, in the course of three-and-a-half days' evidence in the Court of Appeal, was exposed as a most unreliable witness.  The uncertainties surrounding the precise procedure followed by Dr. Skuse and the discrepancies between his written and oral evidence are such that even the Court of Appeal found the contradictions impossible to gloss over.  Did he, or did he not, use ethanol?  Was the caustic soda solution 1.0 per cent or 0.1 per cent in strength in carrying out the Greiss test?</P>
    <P>Dr. Skuse, at the end of the trial, used the phrase &ldquo;ninety-nine per cent certain&rdquo; that he had swabbed nitro-glycerine from the hands of Power and Hill.  This must have influenced the jury on the day.  At the appeal it was accepted that nitrocellulose is used in lacquers and varnishes for treating bar counters and even the surface of playing cards.</P>
    <P>Like some other TDs I attended the Court of Appeal of the Birmingham Six on a few occasions in London last year. I was there on the day judgment was delivered.  Unlike a great number of Irish people who believe that since the verdict is British, it must automatically be wrong, I cannot cross my heart and say with the certainty of Dr. Skuse whether the Birmingham Six are innocent or guilty.  I am satisfied, however, that there is a reasonable doubt about their guilt and <Col N="533" /> that the case against them has not been proven.  For this reason, clemency should be shown towards these men who are in their 14th year in prison.</P>
    <P>In this light, the Progressive Democrats are calling on the British Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, to reconsider his decision not to grant clemency to the Birmingham Six in the light of the reasonable doubt cast on the evidence of the State's chief technical expert, Dr. Skuse. If the Home Secretary does not find it politically expedient to do this at the present time, we appeal to him to facilitate the setting up of an independent review tribunal to re-examine all the evidence in the case.</P>
    <P>There are two precedents for this in Britain.  The first is the Confait case where three mentally disturbed men made full confessions which were subsequently, after such a review, found to be false.  The second precedent is the Timothy Evans case where a man was hanged for a murder that his landlord subsequently was found guilty of committing.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Guildford Four case, it is now nearly a year since the police inquiry into the new evidence commenced. I would appeal to the British Home Secretary to expedite his consideration of this case and to refer it to the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>I understood that the Maguire case will fall automatically should the Guildford Four case succeed.  I believe the Maguire family have been subjected to the greatest miscarriage of justice in recent British legal history.  They have served their full time but are still left in a legal limbo.</P>
    <P>I commend the wording of the Progressive Democrats' amendment to the House as the most practical way that we, in Dáil Éireann, can assist the Birmingham Six and, in turn, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family.  I would appeal particularly for the support of the Labour Party and of The Workers' Party for the substance and sentiments contained in our amendment.</P>
    <P>In my view it would be a great tragedy if Dáil Éireann, having been granted the time by the Labour Party to have this <Col N="534" /> worthwhile debate on the injustices in these cases, could not agree to reach a conclusion.  It would be a tragedy if this House was to so divide that the cross-party consensus on these cases could not be put to the British Government.  I firmly believe that a wording along the lines I have suggested covers that consensus and constitutes a more practical step forward than the original Labour motion.  For that reason I am very pleased that the Leader of the Labour Party is proposing to put forward a composite motion along those lines in his final contribution to this debate.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Geraldine Kennedy for having given me the opportunity of sharing her time and being able to contribute to this important debate.</P>
      <P>Earlier in this session I had circulated all of the party leaders and Whips, and movers of motions then on the Order Paper, by letter, asking that time be allowed between the parties, to discuss the issue of these outstanding cases. Therefore, I viewed with particular pleasure that time was found, by way of Private Members' time, for discussion of these cases.</P>
      <P>It is particularly significant that we conclude this evening in one voice on an agreed view, that all parties in this House should join, under the terms of a common motion, to plead once again to the British authorities to act to put right that which we believe to have been fundamentally wrong from the beginning.  The Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire defendants must all be released and/or pardoned of the convictions wrongly visited on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that this debate here this evening would impact little, if not adversely, on the authorities in Britain.  If that is so, it is regrettable. It was incumbent on us all in this House <Col N="535" />&mdash; who have expressed in a consistent, continuous way our support for the cause of these people &mdash; to avail of an opportunity before the end of this session to once again make a clarion call for their release, for clemency, for justice.  For that reason if for no other reason it is important that we have this debate tonight.  I have no doubt that what has been said here tonight, reflecting yet again continued and sustained support, will have a good and positive effect upon all involved on this issue be they in authority here or abroad.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the motion is of concern to me as a lawyer, as someone who has been involved directly with these cases over the years and as a person who attended in the Court of Appeal from 28 January this year &mdash; one of the saddest days in my brief legal practising experience &mdash; when the judgment was handed down in the Birmingham Six hearing. The motion highlights a very fundamental belief that I and members of The Workers' Party hold, which is that we must always recognise that within the legal process errors can be made, have been made and will be made, errors of such magnitude that the courts themselves will not be able to put things right. That is particularly so with cases like the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven.</P>
    <P>The lapse of time from the date of conviction until things are uncovered to put matters back before the authorities for a review is something that will never be adequately addressed in a court hearing or review.  The written record is the basis on which a review takes place and it is difficult to infuse into it the different phenomena that existed when the case was originally heard.  It is impossible, for example to write into the transcript the hysteria of the time, the animosity and the public sense of guilt that existed around the times of the trial, so shortly after the events.  It is impossible to reproduce these things at a subsequent hearing so long after.  The fact that fresh evidence is not evaluated by a jury and the fact that Joyce Lynass was not heard by a jury <Col N="536" /> points to the difficulties of satisfactorily reviewing cases within the mechanisms available.  All of that is recognised in legislation in Britain and here.  There is reserved in both series of legislation the authority and right of the executive powers to intervene by way of royal or executive prerogative over and above court decisions, intervene in a recognised fashion that is not seen to be an incursion or an interference, or a reflection on the due process of justice heretofore in any particular case.</P>
    <P>I said that 28 January of this year was one of the bleakest days in the history of cases I have attended in the courts.  One other was a case in this jurisdiction, that of Eamonn Noel Kelly, the fourth appeal hearing for the 1976 Sallin train robbers. The court of appeal and the trial court succeeded in exonerating three of the four.  Kelly was the last to attend an appeal and, unbelievably, on similar evidence his conviction was upheld by a court, independent and different from that of the earlier hearings.  This went to the Supreme Court and the conviction stood.  The executive authorities in this jurisdiction subsequently acted in what everyone in this House agrees now and then was correct, to see clemency done in this case and to release Mr. Kelly early from the sentence imposed on him.  None of us here suggests that that was an unwarranted interference in the administration of justice in this jurisdiction or that that was a reflection on the courts and the way they operate.  It was a clear recognition that because of the way things work in our court systems there can arise a case where the courts with their authority and powers find it impossible to put right a wrong in the cold light of subsequent review and exposure.</P>
    <P>We are calling here tonight on the authorities in Britain telling them that we have undivided feelings in these cases that these things are not right or satisfactory and that the Government must act because the courts are inadequate to put matters right.  We say that without criticism of the wheels of justice as they operate, but merely recognising what the <Col N="537" /> existing legislation in that country reflects.</P>
    <P>These cases will not go away.  They will continue to bedevil the authorities in Britain.  They will continue to hang as a very dark cloud over us.  The multitude of organisations in Britain and in Ireland who have worked tirelessly will continue to work endlessly on behalf of these people and will ensure that these cases will not be forgotten &mdash; groups like the Irish in Britain Representation Group, the Irish Prisoners' Support Group and the various support groups for each of the cases and so on.  Also involved, as Deputy Andrews said, are both the Department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in London, which has done very good work in these areas.  All of these resources of organisation and people and all of the views of Deputies in this House and of representatives in the other House will see to it that the defendants in each of these cases will not be forgotten, that their cause will not be abandoned and that the cases will continue to bedevil relationships between Ireland and Britain and worry the administrators and the judicial systems in Britain until matters are put right.  We call from this House at the close of these sessions to all concerned, and in particular to the Home Secretary, to exercise their authority under section 17 of the relevant legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.  Our voice goes from this House and I am happy that we have achieved a unified position and that tonight all of us here are redoubling our commitment to see justice ultimately done for all concerned.</P>

      <P>In speaking on what is now a composite agreed motion of this House it is extremely gratifying to see that there remains in this House the unanimity and force which has been behind the case which we have been making as a nation on behalf of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family.  I congratulate the Minister and the Government, the Embassy personnel and all others who have been fighting in the cause of justice in these cases.  There are various views as to what the outcome should be in relation to the Birmingham Six.  There are some who will state bluntly that the decision can only be one of innocence for the Birmingham Six.  Others will qualify that and say that the decision of the court should be to state technically and in legal terms that the Birmingham Six are not guilty.  The tragedy is that all legal redress is gone for the Birmingham Six and we are now left in the position where we must join with the Birmingham Six in pleading for the granting of mercy through a royal prerogative and Government action in ensuring that.</P>
      <P>The cases involved in this debate might be summed up to the extent that the evil and the trouble which beset them arose not from any initial deficiencies in the appeal procedure but rather from the inability of the trial judges to decide there and then and to exercise their lawful function to take the case away from the jury and direct a dismissal on inadequacy of evidence or on the basis that the evidence was so inconsistent and prejudicial in some way that it would be dangerous to allow it to a jury.  A conventional wisdom has grown up over the years that the jury is the protection of the liberty of the system.  Behind this conventional wisdom the Judiciary in Britain, and sometimes in our jurisdiction, have forgotten the fact that they are also, in their function as trial judge, a bulwark against the abuse or the loss of liberty of the citizen and especially of the accused person before the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that in this debate, <Col N="539" /> when we are looking for specific redress by way of re-examination by way of appeal or by the granting of mercy through a government prerogative, that it would go out to our societies, both in Ireland and in Britain, that we look to our Judiciary to continue to be a protection against the citizen so far as they have the power to take an active part in a criminal trial and ensure that a jury is not put in the position where it allows the judge to wash his hands of the rsponsibility for conviction.  It is very difficult, as Deputy McCartan said, once a trial and a conviction by a jury is over to rescind the proceedings and by the appeal to have a replay as if it was a drawn game.  That does not happen.  It is possible for the appeal process, both in this jurisdiction and that of Britain, to somehow redress the most outrageous and grievous wrongs that might have happened to an accused person in a criminal trial.  It is not possible for the appeal procedure, as designed in the jurisdictions concerned, to do any more than that.</P>
    <P>We may have expected more than was possible from the appeal in the Birmingham Six case because the appeal procedure is deficient in that way.  I and many other speakers and observers would feel that the decision of the appeal judges in the recent Birmingham Six appeal was a tragedy and that it did not reflect the requirement of proof that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I also feel that the wrong intellectual machinery was brought into play.  Certainly, the intellectual appeal machinery of the appeal judges was directed in the wrong way, not to find a reasonable doubt but rather to find mere possibilities for giving a reasonable explanation for prosecution evidence which had fallen asunder and which was in tatters and a shambles.  That is possibly a feature of appeal courts throughout all jurisdictions. They are coming in after the event in ease of all appeal courts.</P>
    <P>Our deliberations, both now and last evening, have been carried out in a manner and with a temperament and demeanour which indicates that we are <Col N="540" /> not attempting to undermine the British system of justice.  We are not attempting to cast fundamental slurs on the British system of justice.  We are merely trying to redress a situation which has arisen through the possibility of trial judges falling into lazy ways, as they can fall into lazy ways in this jurisdiction, and to look to the future.  We can say to the British Government and to the Home Secretary that it would help enormously the attainment of peace and stability in Ireland, and, indeed, in Britain, if these cases and the case put forward through the motion now before the House is heard sympathetically by the Home Secretary and the British Government.</P>
    <P>Through our debate today and yesterday, while we recognise that the Judiciary in both jurisdictions are independent, we would establish and affect the culture in which the Judiciary operate in both jurisdictions.  Through our debate we would, while not having any effect of directing the Judiciary in any particular case, bring about an awareness by the Judiciary in the two jurisdictions that they have a fundamental role to play, while acting as trial judges, to ensure that cases with the dubious and ambivalent evidence are not let go to juries where the public are obviously affected and incensed.  This applies not only to the particular outrageous offences in respect of which the Birmingham Six were charged but it also applies to many other offences in respect of which an accused person would be charged.  We are dealing in a society now where the average citizen is frightened of violence, is frightened of acting as a jury person without actually convicting the accused.  We are dealing in changing circumstances.  Gone are the times when the jury person could stand aloof and view in a very dispassionate manner, in an almost academic manner, as I recollect jury persons doing 15 years ago when I commenced a practice in the courts.  I find that juries in Ireland, and no doubt in Britain as well, have become impatient and worried about not convicting people.  This places and even heavier onus on the Judiciary.  I hope that the debate, and the manner in which it <Col N="541" /> has gone out from all speakers, would help to create a new climate in both jurisdictions whereby an accused person would again have the protection that the courts traditionally were held to afford them.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the rules of the House I give notice that I formally withdraw the motion on the Order Paper and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the British Home Secretary to grant clemency to the Birmingham Six, to expedite the appeal of the Guildford Four, and to seek an urgent resolution of the Maguire case.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, I believe we have had a very valuable opportunity presented to us to discuss and to voice our concerns in relation to these three cases which have troubled many people both in this island and in Britain for many years.  I thank all those speakers, both from the Government side and from the Opposition parties, who have contributed to the debate.  Last night I said that I valued the arrival at consensus in relation to this discussion very highly.  I said last night, and I repeat, that the seeking of consensus in relation to the collective voice of this House is far more important, and remains far more important, than any particular political gain here on the domestic scene.  I believe, as we are coming to a conclusion, that we have had a very worthwhile debate.  We have had a balanced considered debate and the manner of the debate can only be of assistance to those whom we are trying to help, people who time and time again if not on a constant basis, feel there is no further help to be given to them. However, I believe that in the past two days we have made a small gesture to give these people some hope that somebody out there is trying to do something for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews contributed something of great importance in saying that perhaps at times we may all fall into the trap of lacking objectivity in these matters.  That is understandable, given <Col N="542" /> the make-up of this House, the background to these cases and the historical context in which they have to be seen. Notwithstanding that, there has been a great deal of honesty in the contributions. It has been quite obvious that all those who have spoken in this House have familiarised themselves with the cases in question.  Many have been at the court hearings in Britain.  Obviously, all have given a great deal of time to looking at the injustices which have been committed.</P>
    <P>The question arises at this stage, what happens now?  It will trouble me and, I am sure, all the people who have contributed to this debate.  Needless to say, the worry will continue; perhaps for those in prison in Britain the gloom, the hopelessness and despair may be lifted somewhat but will continue.  We have seen in the past 15 years and perhaps previously the intransigence of the British system, both the establishment and the Judiciary. Nothing that has happened in this House in the past 24 hours will change that.  We have seen the failure on the part of the British system to admit errors or that mistakes can be made and, indeed, in these cases mistakes have been made. Surely they must realise that Governments make mistakes, judges make mistakes, the establishment can be as human as the rest of us and make mistakes. They must accept that this is a possibility, indeed a high probability, in these cases.</P>
    <P>I recall the atmosphere in London in 1974 in the aftermath of the Birmingham bombings.  I arrived in London on the train from Holyhead the very morning after the bombs had gone off and I recall distinctly that London was in a state of shock.  I imagine that Birmingham, if it can be put in this manner, must have been ten times more outraged than London.  We must try to familiarise ourselves with the background of these cases in the interest of honesty and showing a better understanding of the atmosphere that prevailed in Britain at the time. Somebody some years ago posed the question to me, &ldquo;Who is policing the police?&rdquo;  That question has been in the back of my mind ever since then in relation to the conduct of the police in <Col N="543" /> the run-up to the trial of the Birmingham Six.  No atmosphere, no outrage, no sense of despair in a community can ever excuse the conduct of the police in the pre-trial events leading to the Birmingham Six trial and conviction.</P>
    <P>There is often a dilemma in this country in speaking out to defend those who are brought before the system in Britain, perhaps because of the association in many cases with violence and the conduct of violent acts in Britain, but I believe for a number or years we in public life, in representative politics and constitutional politics, have managed to make very clear our abhorrence of violence and all acts of violence carried out sometimes under the pseudonym of the Republican cause and Irish nationalism.  All these acts are a disgrace to anything to do with Irish nationalism or the Republican cause.  However, I believe we have succeeded in making that distinction very clear.  In doing so we have the right to speak for those people, to ensure they are given a fair trial and are entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the doubt exists.  Throughout all the contributions made last night and this evening the expression &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; keeps recurring.  In the minds of very fairminded people in this House and not only on this island, but people of substance and character, lawyers, professionals and laymen in Britain, these cases have not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  As I said last night, the law has been framed to ensure that where reasonable doubt exists, where the prosecution of any offence cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused, they must be acquitted.  One of the basic tenets of our legal system and of that in Britain is that it is better for 99 guilty people to go free than for one innocent person to be convicted.  The distinction has been made very clearly in relation to the three separate cases.</P>
    <P>The Birmingham Six are now firmly in the hands of their political masters.  I would like to feel that it is not too late for the Home Secretary to use the powers available to him.  As has been said in <Col N="544" /> contributions here, even those in charge of the custody of these people are convinced they did not commit the crimes that they were found guilty of.  It has been established that other people have admitted committing these crimes.  We in this House are sending a very clear signal which I would like to feel the British establishment will take note of in the reasoned manner in which it has been presented, and all we can do is urge that the Home Secretary would, at the end of the day, first convince himself that justice can be done at this late stage, and second, convince his Cabinet colleagues &mdash; which, we should not understate as an easy task.  The British Government saw fit to release Private Thain after three years in jail.  We view that with disdain. They claim they had their reasons.  Private Thain was the first soldier in Northern Ireland to be convicted of murdering a private citizen.  Surely they could look at that precedent.  If they could justify that decision surely they can now look, even though in different circumstances, at what has happened to the Birmingham Six and exercise clemency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Guildford Four, still further processes of law can be undergone. Having studied very carefully the appeal process in relation to the Birmingham Six, I say sadly to this House that I do not hold out much hope for that process answering our deep feelings in relation to the Guildford Four.  Perhaps it is better than nothing.  It has some possibilities.  However, given the reaction, response and experience of the lawyers involved in the appeal of the Birmingham Six and given the intransigence in the course of the seven weeks of the presentation of evidence, there was not at any single moment a glimmer of hope, a glimmer of expectation, that the judges were in the position that they were going to give the balance of doubt to the appellants.  I had that confirmed to me by the Queen's Counsel involved.  Never at any time in the course of the seven weeks did they feel they were going to break through the stark granite wall of the three judges sitting on that appeal.  No weight was attributed to the evidence given on <Col N="545" /> behalf of the appellants.  Inconsistencies, collusion and evidence that did not stand up was accepted by the judges in relation to the appeal by the Birmingham Six. That is why I remain doubtful in relation to what possibilities will come out of the further court process.</P>
    <P>In relation to Annie Maguire and her family, at this stage, given the humiliations they have suffered down the years, it should not be beyond the British system to admit that mistakes had been made.  It should not be beyond the British system at this stage to show an act of clemency. I have one grave worry in relation to these matters.  I recall some 15 or 20 years ago, in the course of studying law, being very impressed by the then Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, a man who had made an enormous contribution to the development of English law.  Perhaps in one's younger years one is more impressionable but I felt he had made an enormous contribution, that he was one of the wisest lawyers in the land. However, having listened to his recent statements in relation to the possiblities for overturning the decisions in the Birmingham Six case, and his phrase that if this was done it would open up the appalling vista of a conspiracy by the Establishment, I have a serious doubt that when somebody so well established in the British system is of that conviction &mdash; obviously he has a major influence on the policy making and decision making process of British Governments &mdash; and makes such a statement that the system is big enough to overcome that type of conviction.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if nothing else in relation to our contributions in the House, it is not too late for somebody who obviously was a very wise and learned man in his younger years, to look again at his attitude and the views he has expressed openly in relation to these cases.  At the end of the day if there is to be justice, and that is what this is all about, even 15 years later is not too late for a display of it.  At this late stage something could be saved. There could be a small gesture towards <Col N="546" /> these people.  In the course of the difficulties between these two islands a gesture of compassion and generosity by the British Government would, obviously, be a healing step of enormous proportions. Otherwise, sadly, I believe that the names of the Birmingham Six &mdash; Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power and Johnny Walker &mdash; and the names of the Guildford Four &mdash; Gerard Conlon, Paul Hill, Carole Richardson and Paddy Armstrong &mdash; and Annie Maguire and her family will haunt the British system of justice or any claims that there is a system of justice of substance on that island. That will be the position unless at this late stage a gesture is made by the Establishment in Britain.  In conclusion, I should like to thank Members for their contributions and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (a), line 5 to delete &ldquo;if the health board considers it proper to do so&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;if the health board considers it in the best interests of the child to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section sets out the procedure whereby a person in whose favour the Adoption Board have made a declaration under section 2, which we have accepted, can request a health board to make application to the High Court, in effect, for an order freeing a child for adoption.  The <Col N="547" /> position under the Bill will be that prior to a couple being in a position to make such an application they will normally have acted for a minimum of 12 months, and possibly for a good deal longer, as foster parents to that child.  They will then have had to make application to the Adoption Board for the board to make a determination that they regard it as proper and in the interests of the child that an adoption order be made.</P>
    <P>Before the Adoption Board can make such an adoption order and because of the constitutional position, it will be necessary for the High Court to make a determination on the basis of the criteria laid down in section 3 as to whether a child can be freed for adoption.  Section 3 states that either a health board can make that application or it can be made by the foster parents.  The intent of the Bill, as the Minister described it on Second Stage, is designed to ensure that in the majority of instances such applications be made by health boards. Despite the Adoption Board making a decision as to the appropriateness of a child being adopted, the health board will not be under a duty to make an application in respect of a child to the High Court to free that child for adoption. The health board will have a discretion which they can exercise in determining whether to make such an application.  Under subsection (1) (a) a health board can make such an application if they consider it proper to do so. No other criteria are laid down that the health board must comply with.</P>
    <P>I submit that where it is in the best interests of a child that the health board make such an application they should do so.  There should be no ambiguity as to the basis on which a health board should exercise their powers or functions under the Bill.  Accordingly, I am proposing that subsection (1) (a) be amended and that the words, &ldquo;if the health board considers it proper to do so&rdquo;, be deleted and substituted by the words, &ldquo;if the health board considers it in the best interests of the child to do so&rdquo;.  I should like to ask the House to support that amendment.  I <Col N="548" /> submit that in determining whether an application should be made a health board must have some guidance.  I do not know what is meant by the phrase, &ldquo;if the health board considers it proper to do so&rdquo;.  The Minister might explain in what circumstances a health board might consider it improper in regard to a child whose adoption the Adoption Board have already considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is not the health board who will make the decision as to whether a child should or should not be adopted.  Ultimately, it will be the High Court who will determine whether the child should be freed for adoption.  The health board should afford the High Court an opportunity of making the appropriate determination, bearing in mind the constitutional rights of the child and of the natural parents and taking into account the reality of the child's family circumstances where a child has been in foster care for a lengthy period of time and where the adoption board have already, in a sense, acted as a filter to determine whether a child should be considered for adoption.  To impose a duty on the health board, where they consider it in the best interests of the child to do so, to make such application would be to do something that this Bill is designed to do which is not only to balance the rights of parents and ensure they are properly protected but also to ensure that the welfare and the better interests of the children are protected.  That would be the criteria to which the health board would have regard.</P>
    <P>The health board, of course, are not compelled by paragraph (a) to make an application in any case.  They have a discretion as to whether they should be so or not.  The discretion should be exercised on the basis of the best interests of the child and not on whether the health board consider it proper to make such application. If the health board decide not to pursue the matter, the section allows the foster parents to initiate court proceedings. Problems arise with that and we can deal with some of them when discussing the substantive section.  Problems could arise in the context of the risk the foster parents might place themselves <Col N="549" /> in with regard to incurring legal costs for such court proceedings.</P>
    <P>I ask for support for this amendment. In doing so I draw to the attention of the House that if this Bill is truly concerned with ensuring that children who have been in long-term foster care have the possibility of being adopted, the criteria the Bill lays down as to the basis upon which the health boards should make decisions are far too broad.  For example, the health board consider it not proper to make such application because they have their own financial difficulties.  They might regard themselves as being deprived by central Government of the necessary funding to carry out their functions. This Bill confers a power on the health board to make such applications but does not, in the context of the health board doing so, expressly provide any additional financial allocation to health boards with regard to the legal costs they will incur in processing High Court and, in some circumstances, Supreme Court cases.</P>
    <P>It seems there are a variety of extraneous criteria the health board could have regard to such as I suggested on Second Stage.  It would be possible for the health board, as a matter of policy, to decide, because they did not like the idea of abandoned foster children who were born to a married couple being adopted, that they will never make such applications.  By ensuring that the health board operate on the basis of the best interests of the child rather than simply making decisions on the basis that they consider it proper to do so, it would ensure that that sort of eventuality could not take place and that the intent of the Oireachtas in this measure could not be frustrated by a recalcitrant health board who are unwilling to use this measure to protect the welfare of children or who wish to engage in some sort of political ball play with the incumbent Minister for Health in trying to embarrass him or her into providing additional funding for a health board who felt they had not got adequate funding to enable them to carry out their statutory obligations.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment. In deciding whether or not to apply to the High Court for an order authorising the adoption of a child, the health board will have to take all the circumstances of the case into account. While the health board will clearly give first consideration to what is in the best interest of the child, the board will also have to have regard to the rights and interests of the natural parents of the child unless, of course, they have died or their whereabouts is not known.  The board may be aware of the personal circumstances of the parents.  They may know, for example, that the parents have suffered a spell of serious physical or mental illness but are now recovered sufficiently to be able to resume care of the child.  The board may feel that in the circumstances it would not be proper to proceed with the adoption.</P>
      <P>In effect, the health board will have to decide whether it would be proper, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to apply for an order authorising the child's adoption.  I feel, therefore, that the existing phrase more accurately reflects the decision which must be taken by the health board than that proposed in Deputy Shatter's amendment.  There is a danger that if the amendment is accepted health boards would feel that they need only have regard to the interests of the child and this could result in grave injustice being done to the natural parents involved.</P>

Could the Minister indicate how he would deal with that eventuality if this Bill is passed unamended in the context of this subsection? Could he indicate whether he would agree that it would be possible for a health board to consider it not proper to make such applications because they suffered some degree of financial difficulties and because they felt that they <Col N="551" /> should not waste health board's funds on incurring legal expense in processing adoption applications?

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the wording of section 3 (1) which refers to persons in whose favour the board has made a declaration under the relevant subsection.  If the board, having considered the matter, decided that it was in order for them to make the declaration, in what circumstances could the Minister see the board refusing to make the application to the courts?  If they had arrived at the decision in favour of the persons who had requested them to consider the matter and had decided to make the declaration, in those circumstances, why would the health board refuse to proceed with the application to the court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that is not correct. If one takes the proposed section 3 (1) (a) with section 2 (1) one will see the interaction that arises there.  Section 2 (1) (c) states that the Adoption Board &ldquo;having heard the health board in whose functional area the applicants ordinarily reside, any persons specified in paragraphs (a) to (h) of section 16 (1) (as adopted by this Act) of the Principal Act <Col N="552" /> and any other person whom the board, in its discretion, decides to hear is satisfied that, if an order were made it would be proper, having regard to the Acts and this Act, to make the adoption order&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Two preliminary decisions must be made here.  The foster parents have to get over two hurdles.  The first hurdle is to satisfy the Adoption Board that it is appropriate that the child be adopted. The Adoption Board, in determining whether it is appropriate that an adoption order be made, must hear what the health board have to say.  Presumably the health board social welfare personnel who will be largely involved in this decision-making process and whose approach to this will influence the CEO in determining the health board's attitude on the basis of what the Minister is saying, will raise whatever objections they have with the Adoption Board, which in a sense will be independent of the foster parents and of the health board.  The Adoption Board are required to have regard to all aspects of the Adoption Acts, which presumably include having regard to the different manner in which children born inside or outside marriage are treated under the Adoption Acts.  In other words, the Adoption board will consider all this and, because they are a statutory body, they are required to have regard to the constitutional rights of parents and children. Obviously, they will have to have regard to the position of the natural parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that under this provision the Adoption Board could hear the natural parents.  It would be possible for the Adoption Board, having heard all these people, to make a decision that it is appropriate that a child be adopted if the High Court make an order.  The health board may raise objections and veto the processing of the application by deciding it was not proper that an application be made.  In other words, even having had the health board's objections dismissed by the Adoption Board, who would be clearly independent of natural parents, foster parents and health board, the health board in effect exercise a veto. The Minister will tell me that the foster <Col N="553" /> parents can make the application, but in doing that they will put themselves at severe risk of incurring substantial legal expenses which this provision, I assume, is designed to ensure they will not incur. This provision is designed to ensure that legal expenses will be borne by the health board.</P>
    <P>I have some difficulty in understanding the Minister's response to Deputy Molloy, who raised a very valid point. All these differing and conflicting rights, duties, obligations and constitutional as well as statutory protections will be considered by the Adoption Board at a preliminary stage.  The health board should only, for a reason relating to the best interests of the child, have a discretion to exercise in this area.</P>
    <P>It appears that if the CEO of the health board or a group of social workers in the health board do not like the idea of children abandoned within marriage being adopted it would be possible, as a policy decision handed down by the CEO or a senior social worker within a health board area, that a health board would not make such applications despite the Adoption Board determining that it be appropriate that they be made.</P>

I ask the Minister to recall that it is he who is proposing these new procedures and this is the only opportunity we have to question him on why he has chosen the particular formula of procedures and structures he is proposing in the Bill.  As I understand it, applicants may apply to the Adoption Board and the Adoption Board may hear the applicants and others, including the health board.  If the Adoption Board recommend adoption and an order be made, why should the health board re-enter with a discretionary judicial function in deciding whether they would refer the case to the High Court? Why does the Minister not make it mandatory on them to refer the case to the court for decision?  It does not seem to make much sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is what the courts will do.  The court will look at the position of the natural parent, the child and the prospective adopters or foster parents.  In the Adoption Bill I introduced, the Adoption Board and the health board would not have been playing conflicting roles.  In effect, the foster parents would have had it open to them to make application in appropriate circumstances without the layer of bureaucracy introduced here in the context of the health board exercising a further function. The Adoption Board assess whether it would be suitable for a child to be adopted.  They hear the objections of the health board, the social workers, and the natural parents.  Then they can decide, if the High Court is willing to free a child for adoption, that it is appropriate that the child be adopted.  But if the Adoption Board decide it is not appropriate that the child be adopted, that is the end of the matter.  If the Adoption Board decide it is appropriate, the body under this measure that should be weighing the rights, and the conflicting rights of the parents, the foster parents and more particularly the child, is the High Court, not the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we compare the position in this Bill with the approach in the Child Care Bill, in which an obligation is imposed on health boards to protect the welfare of children, it would seem to be consistent where the Adoption Board authorise that it is appropriate for an application to be made to the High Court and for the health board, on the basis of the best interests of the child, to make that application. There is no purpose in the Adoption Board first adjudicating on the matter, then the health board and then the High Court.  It adds a layer of bureaucracy and difficulty that foster parents must surmount, which could in effect result <Col N="556" /> in this Bill in theory, providing for the adoption of children who are abandoned within marriage but which in practice will not work.</P>
    <P>By having this broad criteria, if the health board consider it proper to do so rather than basing it on the best interests of the child, this Bill provides such a wide discretion to a health board as to give no one any guidance in what circumstances any particular health board will ever make an application.  It also seems to set at nought the authority of the Adoption Board, which can be undermined by a health board who consistently refuse to make applications with regard to children the Adoption Board deem should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that the Adoption Board consider what the health board have to say and also the position of the parents, but at the end of the day it is the job of the High Court to balance the conflicting rights of everyone. I would like the Minister to explain, in the context of the High Court protecting the constitutional position of natural parents, why it is necessary for the health board to exercise a similar function?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the health board are involved is because the health board will have placed most of these children in foster care and will be in ongoing contact with the families where the child is placed and therefore are in the best position to go to the High Court for the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the health board are playing the role that the Minister is giving them.  They are in the middle ground and they can assist both the Adoption Board in making their initial decision by giving whatever information is available to them and can facilitate the High Court by giving whatever information is available to them.  It does not mean that the health board should be in a position where they adjudicate on the basis of what is proper and what is not proper.  Let me suggest that if the health <Col N="557" /> board are given that broad discretion rather than being required to exercise discretion on the basis of the best interests of the child, the health board are setting themselves up in conflict with the people that they may be working with.  A health board working with inadequate parents and providing them with social supports and using particular foster parents to care for a child can find themselves caught in the middle of a battle between natural parents and foster parents with no guiding criteria on which they should make their decisions.  As a result, the capacity of the health board to fulfil their supportive functions for inadequate parents and their protective functions for children, can be undermined and some health boards, as a result of being locked into this situation without being required by statute to make the decision on the basis of the best interests of the child, will be locked into a state of paralysis because there will be health board social workers who will take the view that they cannot make these decisions because they are working as social workers with individual parents and they also have contact with foster parents.  By giving the health board such a broad discretion the Minister is creating a situation in which, in effect, the health board may not be able to exercise the functions that the Minister is assigning to them.  If the criteria were based on the best interests of the child, the health board would have clear criteria upon which they would make their decision and, presumably, in 99 per cent of cases where the Adoption Board have assessed the position, unless something exceptional arose, a health board would at least allow court proceedings to be initiated so that the courts would make the decision based on the best interests of the child. However, if the health board act as a block in this situation it really impedes the possibility of everyone's rights being assessed and ultimately the child's position being protected by the courts.</P>

      <P>The point that has been <Col N="558" /> made has special significance as I understand from Deputy Shatter that a subsequent amendment of his has been disallowed on the grounds that it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  That amendment would have provided that the costs for applicants who made direct application to the High Court would have been met.  If that amendment is not allowed we are not in a position here to alter those terms of the Bill.  Therefore, the opportunity to change this would meet the point that he was making in that amendment.  If this section were altered to make it mandatory on health boards to make application to the High Court and to allow the High Court to make the decision if the Adoption Board had made recommendation or a declaration, as it is called in the Bill, then all applicants to the High Court would have their costs met and that certainly would be the wish of the Opposition parties.  We were hoping to hear the Minister's views on that when Deputy Shatter's amendment was to be put before the House but if that amendment is disallowed I am raising that point now.  If the Minister withdrew the discretion that the health boards have and made it obligatory on them to refer to the High Court any case that the Adoption Board made a declaration on and if the Bill was so amended to provide that in all such cases the costs of the applicants would be met, it would meet other points that we wanted to raise during the course of this debate.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that.  I would like to know if there will be an opportunity for amendments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>To deal with Deputy Shatter's point, the health boards will <Col N="559" /> have to exercise discretion given to them in a reasonable and responsible manner and I have every confidence in the ability of health boards to balance all the interests of the child, of the natural parents and of the foster parents.  Deputy Shatter seems to be assuming that the health boards will not be co-operative.  I believe that it is essential that there should be a balance in this legislation between the rights of the child and the rights of the natural parents.  As I said earlier, I feel that the existing phrase in the Bill rather than that in Deputy Shatter's amendment, more accurately reflects the decision that the health board will have to take.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that if the amendment were accepted health boards would feel that they only had to take into account the interests of the child and this could result in grave injustice to the natural parents.  Indeed, earlier today we heard Deputy Cooney from that side of the House speaking on the Child Care Bill and making a point which is pertinent here about what happened in Sweden where a social worker made a decision which would not stand up in the normal course of events.  It is important that we get balance into this Bill.  Certainly the interests of the child are of fundamental importance and it is important to protect the interests of the natural parents as well.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Molloy in relation to costs, the position is that the foster parents or the adoptive parents may go to the High Court.  If the health board decide that they are not prepared to make an application to the High Court on behalf of the adoptive parents the adoptive parents may go themselves.  In the event of the case being successful the costs will be met by the health board.  In the event of the case being unsuccessful then they will be responsible for their own costs.</P>

      <P>Because I do not think it is appropriate that the State should <Col N="560" /> provide the costs for every person who takes a case.

      <P>The Minister is not showing very great confidence in the opinion of the Adoption Board who, bear in mind, have already made a declaration that they favour the adoption in the particular case. So if the Adoption Board have made a recommendation that an adoption order be made why should the parents who subsequently might have to make an application to the High Court themselves have to pay their own costs if their case fails, whereas if the case had been brought by the health board and had failed in the High Court the health board would have paid the cost?  I cannot understand why that distinction is being made because it clearly emphasises the Minister's lack of confidence in the opinion of the Adoption Board.  The Minister seems to be putting much greater faith in the decision of the health board which, of course, is not the health board as we know it, which comprises representatives of local authorities, the medical profession and others, but in fact is the chief executive, a single individual.</P>

      <P>I have every confidence in the Adoption Board and I think everybody in this House who has been looking at the work they have been doing would agree with that statement.  It is important in the context of this legislation that the Adoption Board are not required to consider the position of the natural parents. They look only at the suitability of the applicants.  The health board will in most cases have placed the child in foster care and will be in constant contact with the family.  They will have a major input when an application is made to the court and the court decides whether the child should be placed for adoption or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that if a couple go to court and lose their case they should not have their costs met. These would be foster parents who had already made application to the Adoption Board and been approved by them, in circumstances where the Adoption Board would have reviewed the entire history of the child residing with them and the child's family history.  No foster parents who surmount the hurdle of the Adoption Board could be regarded as people making a vexatious court application. They would presumably be acting in the best interest of the child.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that if foster parents bring an application where the health board do not, and lose the case, they should not have their costs met by the State.  The Bill as drafted provides that the health board in all circumstances will meet the costs of the natural parents. Adoption applicants may get over the hurdle of the Adoption Board and health board and win their case in the High Court.  Then the natural parents may appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court in circumstances where they have very little chance of succeeding. Then there may be an entire Supreme Court case which the natural parents lose.  The natural parents will then have lost in two courts and put the adopters at risk of substantial legal expense in two court cases, but they will have their costs met by the State.  These natural parents may be entirely unmeritorious parents who may have violently beaten a child, abandoned the child permanently and shown no interest in the child for five or ten years, yet if they decide to oppose a High Court application to free their child for adoption they can be funded by the State to process and defend High Court and Supreme Court applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> Deputy Molloy is asking why adopters should be put at risk in circumstances where natural parents are not put at risk. The adopters also have to surmount a hurdle which the natural parents do not. The adopters must first have their application processed by the Adoption Board. This is of relevance largely to the cost issues, but Deputy Molloy is right in saying that if the discretion of the health board were more curtailed in the context of prospective adopters having been approved by the Adoption Board, there would be very little doubt that most applications would be made by the health board and adopters would be protected against the risks they would be facing with regard to costs.  I do not understand why the State should foot the Bill for unmeritorious parents, who might have battered their children and then totally abandoned them for years, and allow them to litigate through the High Court and the Supreme Court, while the State is unwilling to foot the bill for apparently meritorious foster parents who are approved by the Adoption Board and who bring an application to the High Court but do not succeed in having an order made freeing their child for adoption.</P>
    <P>The High Court or the Supreme Court could refuse such order, not through any fault of the adopters or anything to do with the circumstances of the natural parents but for some obscure constitutional or technical legal reason which none of us may address this evening.  Yet in those circumstances the foster parents who sought in good faith to provide security for the child placed with them would be left at a financial risk.  If the Minister is unwilling to accept amendments with regard to ensuring financial protection for the adopters, there is a need to ensure that there is some curtailment of the extent to which a health board can exercise a discretion not to make an application to the courts once adopters have been approved by the Adoption Board. The amendment I have tabled would come three-quarters of the way to meeting that concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened long and carefully to the views of both the Minister and the proposer of the amendment. The wording proposed in the amendment reflects the basic law with regard to the custody and care of children. It reflects the principle on which we would expect the legislation to be founded, that is, that the interest of the child has primacy.  The Minister has responded by suggesting that there is a need for balance.  Clearly the legislation does not attack the balance which exists due to constitutional guarantees.  The legislation is very narrow in its address and is designed to deal with exceptional cases.  I would posit a situation where the interests of the child might require a case to be taken but the board for some peculiar reasons might decide not to proceed. We should seek not to allow such a situation under this Bill.  All other criteria being met, if the interests of the child require it the process should proceed and adoption should be allowed.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the discretion given to the health boards is too wide and I commend to the Minister the proposal in the amendment.  The Minister may prefer the wording in the Bill to stand but I would refer him to Deputy Molloy's argument relating to unsuccessful applications taken by prospective adoptive parents to the court.  The Minister should use the same standards and apply the same tests.  Where prospective adoptive parents acting in good faith think it proper to make an application to the court they should not run the risk of penalty.  I would urge the Minister to look again at that difficulty.  This is considered a charge and consequently something that cannot be addressed by an amendment from the Opposition, but it is clearly within the Minister's authority and remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent upon us at this stage to impress on the Minister the unfairness of the situation.  We all have been advised, and no doubt the Minister's Department officials have been, of the cases that arise constantly in court where adoptive or prospective adoptive parents come to court with on the face of it eminently <Col N="564" /> sensible and desirable applications to be made in the best interests of the child and which the parents consider proper, but with all the quirks and rules of law they are ultimately ruled against.  Because this is a recurring phenomenon the Minister should in all fairness allow for an amendment on Report Stage later this evening before we conclude our deliberations and the Bill passes into law.  Could he give us some indication that he would look at the matter and consider an appropriate decision?  On Deputy Shatter's amendment as it stands the wording is, because it reflects a fundamental law, a preferable one since it directs the mind of the authority, the board, to the fundamental proposition: the interests of the child as a primacy.  I would be afraid that we would be allowing too wide a discretion on this issue and allowing matters not necessarily needed in the circumstances to be drawn in at this stage in the cause of balance, whereas this legislation does not in any way attack the balance which is very heavily weighted in favour of the constitutional family as it stands.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier in reply to Deputy Shatter when he spoke originally on his amendment, the health board have to take all the circumstances into account and not just the interests of the child.  The health board will clearly give first consideration to what is in the best interests of the child&mdash;I am satisfied about that.  The board also must have regard to the rights and interests of the natural parents of the child.  The board may be aware of the personal circumstances of the parents.  They may know, for example, that the parents have suffered a spell of serious physical illness or of mental illness, but are now recovered sufficiently to be able to resume the care of their child.  The board may feel that in the circumstances it would not be proper to proceed with the adoption. In effect, the health board will have to decide whether it would be proper, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to apply for an order authorising the child's adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am satisfied that the <Col N="565" /> health boards would act in a reasonable and responsible manner.  However, if the boards were not to do so and were to refuse to make an application, that refusal would be challenged by the foster parents through the courts by way of a judicial review.  I am satisfied that the means and costs that are being provided in these cases are reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister possibly be satisfied?  The Minister is giving a judicial role to the executive of the health board, when the proposal that we are making would allow these matters to be considered in the proper place, which is the court.  The Minister and all the other parties here are already on record as preferring family courts for this type of case, but recognising that these are not yet in existence the High Court is the appropriate place for these cases to be considered.  The rights and interests of the natural parents can best be considered, surely, by a judge in the High Court where there would be proper training and understanding of the law rather than, as the Minister is suggesting, that the decision be made by the chief executive of the health board.</P>
      <P>It does not make much sense and I am coming to the conclusion, due to the lack of arguments in support of the Minister's opposition to what we are suggesting, that much thought was not given previously to this matter.  Would the Minister consider, as has been suggested by Deputy McCartan, bringing forward a Government amendment on Report Stage?  We could get to that stage if we had an indication in advance.  This amendment would provide that all cases where the adoption board had made a declaration for an adoption order would be brought by the health board before the High Court for decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise something with you, a Cheann Comhairle, which relates both to this section and to an amendment of mine that has apparently been ruled out of order.  Section 3 (3) makes provision that where someone is added into court proceedings the courts can make various types of orders with regard to costs.  I tabled an amendment to that provision which, in effect, would not provide for any additional charge on the State.  As that provision was contained in the Bill originally it stipulates that if legal aid is not provided by the State &mdash; which means that the State would be paying for it &mdash; particular types of orders can be made which would result in the State equally, through a health board, footing the bill.  Yet that amendment was ruled out of order.  I was wondering could it have been ruled out of order out of a misunderstanding of the impact of what is contained in the original measure.  In effect, it does not add to the apparent cost to the State.  It simply redirects the way the matter is dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (3) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>(3)  The Court may, of its own motion or on application to it in that behalf, make an order adding such other persons as it thinks fit as parties to proceedings under subsection (1), and may, in the case of a person added as a party to any such proceedings under this section, make such order as it considers just in respect of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the payment of any costs in relation to the proceedings that are incurred by the person and are not paid by another party to the proceedings if legal aid in respect of them under any scheme operated by or on behalf of the State for the provision of legal aid has been refused, or</P>
      <P>Let us assume for a moment that a health board does bring proceedings having been requested to do so by adopters and that the natural parents contest those proceedings.  Let us assume, from there, that the adopters are then added to the proceedings as notice parties by the court.  Clearly, under this provision it seems that in those circumstances the health board, as one of the parties to the proceedings, could be required by the court ultimately to foot the bill for the legal expenses incurred by the prospective adopters but it appears the health board can be required so to do only if the adopters have applied for legal aid and it has been refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify this. First, if prospective adopters are added to the proceedings, they themselves may know that their income is such they do not qualify for legal aid on a means-tested basis.  Nevertheless, their financial position may be such that they certainly <Col N="571" /> cannot bear the brunt of High Court proceedings and the legal costs they would incur.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister suggesting that, in order to allow the courts to require the health boards to meet those adopters' costs they must go through the sort of useless formula of applying to a law centre, already overworked, for legal aid, to await the law centre refusing to grant it, thereby holding up the court proceedings possibly for weeks or months so as to become entitled to recoupment of their legal costs?  It seems to me this is a very peculiar provision to be inserted in the Bill.  It could mean that when adoption proceedings are under way in the courts&mdash; it is in the interests of a child that they be processed rapidly &mdash; a court could take the view that it is essential that the prospective adopters be a party to the proceedings but if the adopters want to seek a protection against incurring legal costs, even in circumstances in which they know their finances do not qualify them for legal aid &mdash; through a Government law centre &mdash; they will have to make an application and have it refused.</P>
    <P>In a world in which law centres were operating efficiently because they had adequate resources that would not be a particularly large problem.  It would give rise to a fairly useless administrative exercise but within a matter of days that problem would be resolved.  However, in the most recent report published by the Legal Aid Board the position as stated by them is that they do not provide a comprehensive system of legal aid, that many of the part-time centres they previously ran have ceased to function and that some of the full time centres they run frequently close.  In dealing with the Dublin area the report says:</P>
    <P>Worse still, even in Dublin, where there are four law centres, the need for services so outstrips resources that applicants for legal aid may have to wait for weeks, or even months, for an appointment with a solicitor.  The well known adage is that justice delayed is justice denied.  I can only <Col N="572" /> regret that justice has to be denied in so many cases.</P>
    <P>What are adopters who live in Dublin to do if they want to make an application to a law center in the middle of court proceedings having been initiated by a health board?  Will they have access to law centres that have closed down temporarily? What happens if the law centre cannot process the application even to the extent of refusing to grant it?  Why should there be imposed on the staff of law centres, who are already overburdened, a necessity to process applications for legal aid from people who know that their means are such as to disqualify them from it, even though they cannot afford to bear the brunt of High Court costs in the context of what funds are available to them?  This is a very peculiar procedure and it is even more peculiar because of the circumstances under which the law centres operate.  I would like the Minister to clarify for me the reason for this procedure, how he envisages it working in practice and how he anticipates that the law centres will deal with these applications, in particular in the context of the law centres in Dublin and elsewhere that regularly shut their doors to new clients for periods of weeks or months, as the chairman of the Legal Aid Board admits?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is proposed in section 3 (3) is quite reasonable and satisfactory. The Deputy suggests that we delete the reference to the civil legal aid scheme and the effect of this would be that, for example, where the High Court decided on the application of a health board to add the foster parents as parties to the proceedings, the court would be able to order that the health board meet the costs incurred by the foster parents regardless of whether or not they were entitled to avail of the free legal aid scheme.  This has imposed an additional charge on the health boards, and through them on the Exchequer, and I am not prepared to accept it.  What is proposed in the Bill is satisfactory.  What the Bill proposes is that where the persons added <Col N="573" /> as a party are entitled to civil legal aid, they should avail of it.  Where they are not entitled to civil legal aid the court would be able to order the health board to meet their costs.  Deputy Shatter would have the health board meet their costs in all cases.  This would not necessarily result in any better legal service being provided for the foster parents.  The only result would be an additional cost to be met by the State.</P>

      <P>The question I asked was what would happen in circumstances where health boards are not even open to take applications?  The Minister talked about additional charges on the State. Either the law centre or the health board in effect will pay the legal costs, so there is the same charge on the State.  That is not an issue which we can now debate.  I will not raise it as it is an irrelevancy.  Will the Minister say how he envisages this working in the context of law centres which frequently close and which lack the capacity to cope with the clients they have?  Will the Minister accept that we are now asking the law centres, so that these sort of orders can be made against health boards, to process meaningless applications for legal aid, so that someone has a letter which says his application for legal aid has been refused?  Will there be any special arrangements made with the Legal Aid Board to ensure that, if such an application is made by a foster parent who wishes to process an adoption application, within a matter of three or four days or within some specified agreed <Col N="574" /> time his application will be granted or refused so that he is not put in a position of having to wait for many months simply to make an application and then have to wait for it to be determined?</P>
      <P>The question of making an application does not just involve the law centre or the Legal Aid Board assessing the financial position of the couple.  It can result in the Legal Aid Board trying to get some initial legal opinion as to the possibility of a case succeeding.  It can take months for these applications to be processed before a law centre will decide whether or not it will grant legal aid.  In the context of the State bearing the bill for this either way, this is adding to the expense.  We have the Adoption Board making a preliminary decision, the health board making a preliminary decision, the Legal Aid Board making a preliminary decision, and then one might get into the High Court.  This is bureaucracy gone mad and a waste of the State's recources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is not coming back to Deputy Shatter on that, I wish to raise with him an aspect of section 3.  Before we move on from section 3, will the Minister assure the House that the health boards throughout the country will be adequately funded to deal with the requirements laid upon them under section 3(1) so that within three months they should respond to a request to them from the board that an application be made on behalf of prospective adoptive parents?  Because of the rulings of the Chair, which, I fully accept, our amendments cannot be proceeded with as they are considered to involve a potential charge on the Exchequer; but consequently the regime as drafted by the Minister and incorporated in the section will stand.  It is essential therefore that the health boards should proceed under the section to ensure that the onus does not by default fall onto the shoulders of the prospective adoptive parents.  Section 3 (1) (b) is drafted to allow for a situation, even though the board may otherwise think it appropriate to bring an application but because of a lapse of time did not do so, where it falls on the shoulders <Col N="575" /> of the prospective adoptive parents to do so.  The time period is very short.  It is essential that in cases where the board should do so the proceedings should proceed in the name of the board.</P>
      <P>It has been drawn to my attention that prospective adoptive parents will have the children in their care and custody for upwards of 12 months, with all the costs that that draws on them, without any expense or support from the State and that they will have passed the scrutiny of the Adoption Board.  Those two major factors obviously suggest to prospective adoptive parents that they are in good standing, but there are other legalistic factors that can come to bear on an application that might well make it unsuccessful. A recent application of this sort was drawn to my attention.  It involved a couple who as foster parents had custody of a child of seven years, who proceeded to court but the natural mother was not prepared to relinquish rights and the court upheld her position, leaving the foster and prospective adoptive parents to carry the cost, of the order of £15,000. That type of situation presents an inordinate and unbelievable burden of responsibility on the shoulders of prospective parents.  The natural mother was not prepared to relinquish rights at that stage and the court upheld her position, leaving the foster and prospective parents to carry costs of the order of £15,000. That type of situation which occurs presents an inordinate and unbelieveable burden of responsibility on the shoulders of prospective parents in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to assure the House, before we move on from this section, that firstly, he would ensure that the legislation can be fully operated and that the health boards will not be hampered in any way in the carrying out of their duties and functions under this section by reason of non-availability of staff, funds or otherwise and that the section will be given full effect to and receive full support from the Minister's Department.  Secondly, he should ensure &mdash;I know that a further amendment on the <Col N="576" /> Order Paper is seeking to address this matter &mdash; that no narrow-minded approach, or definition, can be developed by any individual board or chief executive in the operation of the definition of what is proper to this legislation.  Bearing in mind what has been said in the House by various Deputies, the Minister should retain a certain amount of supervision or review powers &mdash; I appreciate non-intervention would be too strong a word in this context&mdash;but should keep a ministerial and an administrative eye on what is going on to ensure that the full legislative intent of the House is not frustrated by idiosyncratic attitudes or for other reasons peculiar to any particular board, or member, or chief executive of a board. Those are two aspects of this section that concern me and I would like to hear constructive assurances from the Minister on them before we pass from this section.</P>

      <P>In dealing with the point raised by Deputy Shatter, it is important to point out that in the majority of cases that will come before the health boards the health boards will make the application to the High Court. In cases where they do not do so it is open to the adoptive parents to make the application to the High Court.  If the adoptive parents are successful the costs will be met by the health board.  The number of cases that would be obliged to look for support under the legal aid scheme would be very small.  Regarding the difficulties with the legal aid scheme, while I accept that there can be delays, they would not be our responsibility under this legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the case of a child who was fostered for seven years and the expense involved for the parents in applying to the High Court for an order for the adoption of that child. This legislation will not affect that particular type of case.  The legislation to deal with that is the 1974 Act and that legislation remains in place.  This legislation deals with the adoption of certain specified children.</P>

      <P>I see little point in further pursuing this issue.  There seems to be a total incomprehension on the Minister's part regarding the issue being raised.  Perhaps it is because he is not familiar with the way in which these issues arise in the courts.  What the Minister does not seem to understand is that if the health board do not bring proceedings there is a cost problem which we dealt with earlier.  If the health board bring the proceedings it is likely that the adopters will be still added as notice parties to the proceedings by the court.  They will still incur legal costs and there is a major problem here. It seems that we are going around in circles and that we will not make any progress.  The Minister does not understand what we are talking about, or he does not pretend to know what we are talking about and on that basis I will not pursue the issue any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of section 3, I wish to raise a totally different issue.  When this Bill was before the House on Second Stage, as in the case of my own Bill 12 months ago, the issue was raised in fairness to prospective adopters, or foster parents who might try to use this provision and who, when this Bill is passed, will ultimately put themselves, whether the health board brings the application or not, at serious risk of major legal expense, that it was essential that any adoption order subsequently made under the provisions of this Bill &mdash; section 3 sets out the basis upon which the High Court should make these decisions &mdash; be valid and secure and that there be no question of an issue arising later as to its constitutionality.  In the interests of everyone concerned and to ensure that this Bill works &mdash; and is not <Col N="578" /> proved to be a bit of legislation passed by this House to increase a perception that we have done something when in reality we have done nothing &mdash; it is essential that prospective adopters or foster parents who bring court cases to free children for adoption do not find themselves at risk of becoming embroiled in highly complex and extremely lengthy constitutional actions in both the High Court and the Supreme Court in which someone, be it a natural parent, a health board or some other person, seeks to test the consitutionality of this measure.  In the context of both my own Private Member's Bill and of this Bill, I made the point that this Bill should be referred by the President, under Article 26 of the Constitution, to the Supreme Court, following its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that the court can give a decision as to its constitutionality and, in particular, a decision as to the constitutionality of section 3 and the provisions contained therein, which set out the criteria for which the court must have regard in making a determination.</P>
    <P>The usefulness of such a procedure is that the Supreme Court can, once and for all, decide whether a measure is or is not constitutional.  If it decides that it is constitutional it means that that issue cannot be raised in further court cases and cannot place prospective adopters, foster parents and natural parents at risk of becoming embroiled in a constitutional action.  If the Supreme Court decides it is unconstitutional we will know, once and for all, and if there is a commitment in this House to extend the possibility of adoption to abandoned children born within marriage, that we require a constitutional amendment to tackle the issue.  The matter should not be left in an obscure position.  While I know that the Minister has no particular function in referring a Bill to the Supreme Court it is not unknown that Ministers when steering measures through this House make it known in their speeches that they would be anxious that such a step be taken to ensure that there are no difficulties at a later stage with the Bill. The worst scenario would be for no such <Col N="579" /> reference to be made for a number of children to be adopted and for someone in four, five or six years' time to challenge the constitutionality of the Bill and, in effect, set aside all the adoption orders made under the Bill.  I urge the Minister to put on record his view that this measure should, following its enactment, be referred by the President for no reason other than to use his authority to highlight the fact that there is a view in this House that it is in the general interest of ensuring the workings of this legislation that this issue be determined by the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;(1)  Each health board shall after the expiration of each year publish a report giving the following information in relation to that year&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the number of requests made to the health board to apply to the Court for an order pursuant to section 3 of this Act and the decisions of the Bord thereon.</P>
      <P>(b)  the number of applications made by the health board to the Court pursuant to section 3 of this Act and the decisions of the High Court and, if any, of the Supreme Court on appeal thereon.</P>
      <P>(c)  the number of requests made to the health board in respect of which the Board declined to apply to the Court pursuant to section 3 of this Act and the reason in each such case for the health board's decision,</P>
      <P>(d)  the number of requests made to the health board in respect of which the health board&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  declined to apply to the High Court, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  did not decline to apply to the High Court within 3 months of the making of such request but in respect of which the Board made no application to the High Court</P>
      <P>and where a person or persons in whose favour the Adoption Board made a declaration under section 2 (1) made application to the High Court pursuant to section 3 (1) (b) of this Act and the decision of the High Court and, if any, of the Supreme Court on appeal thereon in respect of the application to authorise the Adoption Board to make an adoption order in respect of payment of costs,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> (e)  the total sum in respect of legal costs discharged by the health board or for which the health board is liable by virtue of court orders made pursuant to section 3 (3) and 5 of this Act and the manner in which the amounts are apportioned or payable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to parents of a child who was the concern of such proceedings,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to a party or parties who applied to adopt a child,</P>
    <P>and the sum so paid and the sum still payable,</P>
    <P>(f)  the total number of children within the functional area of the health board either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in residential care, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  in foster care,</P>
    <P>for a continuous period of three years or more.</P>
    <P>(2)  Each health board shall present a copy of the Report to the Minister who shall cause it to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure some way of monitoring the manner in which health boards are operating the statutory functions conferred upon them by this Bill.  As things stand, the health boards will exercise a very broad discretion under section 3 in determining whether they make any application at all.  As things stand, there will be no means of monitoring what each health board are doing, whether any health board are processing these applications, which health board are refusing to process applications and which health boards are willing to do so.  There will be no means of knowing if a health board are refusing to make applications where foster parents themselves bring court proceedings and regularly succeed in getting orders from the courts freeing a child for adoption.  Up-to-date statistics are not available &mdash; this has been a problem for many years &mdash; through the Department of Health of the total number of children <Col N="582" /> in any one year in long-term or short-term foster care or residential care.  Any Dáil questions seeking to ascertain the number of children in long-term residential or foster care in the last four or five years have resulted in people being given statistics of how many children were in care in 1983.  If this Bill is designed to ensure that children in long-term foster or residential care who have no prospect of residing with their natural parents are afforded the opportunity of adoption, it is essential that the Department of Health, first of all, have some means of assessing whether the health boards are using this Bill to provide the possibility of a secure family upbringing for children.  This Oireachtas is entitled to know how the Bill when enacted is being operated by health boards and this measure should require the boards to report annually.</P>
    <P>This is not a particularly unusual requirement.  Since the Adoption Act was passed in 1952, an obligation has been imposed upon the Adoption Board to report annually to the relevant Minister as to how the board have operated their functions.  The board have been required to give annual statistics with regard to the number of applications made for adoption, the number of adoption orders granted and refused, detailed information as to the background of the people adopting, whether they are married couples, widows, widowers, single people or relations of a child being adopted.  Under the Adoption Act, 1952, the report of the Adoption Board submit to the Minister is laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  We have been able to monitor the manner in which the Adoption Board have processed adoption applications ever since 1952 when we first provided legislation for adoption.</P>
    <P>If it is desirable in the interests of children that Members of this House, the general public and the Minister of the day know what is happening in this area, if it is desirable to require the Adoption Board to produce such a report, it is equally desirable to require the Adoption Board to produce such a report, it is equally desirable that the health boards <Col N="583" /> produce such a report because of the central role the health boards are given in this area.  This amendment is designed to ensure that as much detailed information as possible is provided and made available by health boards.  In this context it is worth knowing that under the Child Care Bill health boards are to be required to give annual reports to the child care committees of a number of matters that fall within their jurisdiction, though that Bill does not cover this area of adoption.</P>
    <P>I hope this is not a contentious amendment and that the Minister will accept it. There is nothing exceptional in it.  It is merely allowing Members of this House, the general public and the Minister to monitor the operations and workings of this Bill by health boards and ensuring a degree of accountability on the part of health boards for the manner in which they fulfil their functions under the Bill and, even more important, ensuring that if there are difficulties arising with the manner in which the Bill is working Members of the House are made aware of those difficulties and, as a consequence, have the opportunity to bring in any amending legislation that may be required.  If this is not done there will be a complete absence of any definite information about what is happening and it will be impossible, even in this House, to table questions that will elicit a proper response from any future Minister as to how the Bill is operating and what health boards are doing.  If a question is tabled without this provision being contained in the Bill a Member of the House will be told this is a matter which falls within the jurisdiction of the health board and the Minister has no statistics and does not keep information about it.</P>
    <P>This very important, uncontentious amendment is designed to ensure the Bill works in the manner in which the Minister has told us tonight he believes it will work.  It will ensure that we can ascertain that his aspirations for the Bill to fulfil its functions fully and for the health boards to work it will be realised.  The Minister has the means of ensuring that what he intends is implemented and he has a <Col N="584" /> means of redressing the matter if it is not implemented.</P>
    <P>I conclude by hoping that, instead of getting what I would describe as the usual Governmental knee jerk to any Opposition amendment tabled to a Government measure &mdash; usually an automatic scrabbling around to find some semi-coherent reason to oppose it &mdash; we can get this particularly uncontentious amendment which seeks to ensure some degree of accountability under this Bill accepted without division.</P>

      <P>It appears that Deputy Shatter is seeking in this amendment that information should be publicly available on how health boards operate the provisions of this Bill.  While I accept that this is desirable, it is an extremely cumbersome way to achieve that objective. In other words, he is introducing a great deal of red tape.  It is quite unnecessary that we get ourselves bogged down here in the precise details of the information to be made available.</P>
      <P>Essentially, it is an administrative matter and it can be dealt with without the need for such complex legislative provisions. The Deputy will be aware that my Department already collects information from health boards on an administrative basis on all aspects of the child care services, including statistics on child abuse and the number of children in care. The Adoption Board, for their part, have introduced an ongoing survey of adoption applications and this has produced a wealth of new information.  I see no reason why similar arrangements cannot be made available in the processing of applications under the Bill without having to set down rigid legislative requirements.  I am prepared to give an undertaking to the House that the type of information the Deputy referred to will be available to anybody who wishes to have it.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has told us that the Government accept, <Col N="585" /> in principle, the desirability of information being available to the Minister and the public about the working of the Act by health boards.  Conceding that to the Minister, and without getting into the rights and wrongs of the detail &mdash; I agree the proposal is a very cumbersome one for a simple objective &mdash; I should like to know if he would be disposed to consider accepting a simple amendment to the effect that each health board shall after the expiration of each year publish a report giving the information on how the Act is implemented by each board.  I would leave out all the other extraneous matter and have written into the Bill a simple proposal that it be incumbent on each board to produce an annual report to the Minister on the workings of the Act.  That is a simple and short way of addressing this issue.</P>
      <P>There should be a positive duty in this important and sensitive legislation, which has been welcomed by all concerned, on health boards to report to the Minister and for the Minister, in turn, to impart that information to the House.  I accept the view of the Minister of State that there may be a lot of red tape wrapped up in the amendment but I suggest to him that, rather than getting bogged down in argument, he should consider a simple proposal along the lines I have suggested. If he did there would be a positive obligation on health boards to produce an annual report which can be passed on to each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what Deputy McCartan has said.  There is nothing cumbersome about the amendment. A single column of figures would contain all the information requested.  It is information that the Minister for Health must have for the purpose of making budgetary decisions in this area. It is information that is, therefore, available and it is simply a question of putting it in a form that can be read by the public. I do not see what is cumbersome about that.  I do not agree with the idea of letting the Government, whoever they are, off the hook by inviting them to present an annual report on the implementation of <Col N="586" /> the Act.  That could amount to a one-line statement to the effect that the Government believe that the Act is working satisfactorily. The Oireachtas has a slightly higher level of responsibility than that. Deputy Shatter's amendment, seeking specific information, is a good one.  I accept that the amendment is long but when one reads it one will see that the figures required by it could be accommodated on a large postage stamp.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not hide behind the epithet, &ldquo;cumbersome&rdquo;, in order to avoid providing information that he probably has.  It is simply a question of putting it in a statutory form for publication.</P>

No cumbersome procedure is involved and I should like the Minister of State to explain how he would comply with the request of the mover of the amendment.  In other words, is there any information that he is reluctant to impart or make available? Deputy Shatter is seeking information which should be available to Members of the House and the general public.  The amendment requires that health boards make that information available.  The Minister has indicated that he has no objection to that.  What mechanism does he suggest would be less cumbersome because in my view what is requested is a straightforward system of reporting.</P>

If the information is available, why is it that the Minister will not agree to make it available in the form requested in the amendment?  It appears that the gathering of the information is not the difficulty because from what the Minister has said the information required will be readily available.  Deputy Shatter wants <Col N="587" /> the information made available in an orderly and regular fashion.</P>

    <P>Seeking such detailed information would tie up health board officials.  They would have to pursue this on a regular basis in order to comply with the legislation.  It is not necessary to include such provision in the Bill.  The information will be available to the House, to members of health boards and on request but not necessarily in the statutory form proposed by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>We intend to closely monitor the performance of health boards under the provisions of the Bill.  If it were to become apparent that any board was failing in their duty under the Bill we will take immediate steps to have the matter investigated and any problems ironed out.  If a need for change is identified, appropriate amending legislation will be brought before the House.  We do not consider that the amendment is necessary.  It is a cumbersome, red tape bureaucratic type of proposal which is of no use.  It would hold back people from their duties under this Bill.  We can say quite clearly that we will monitor the performance of the health boards in relation to this Bill.  We do not see the need for this type of amendment which is proposed by Deputy Shatter.  It is a most detailed, bureaucratic red-taped amendment which is totally unnecessary.  We will monitor the operations of the Act.

This legislative requirement, that every year this information will have to be available in a certain form and will have to be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas, is bureaucratic, unnecessary red tape.  Every effort will be made by the <Col N="590" /> Department, together with each health board to monitor the workings of this Act on a detailed basis.  The elected Members of this House will always have the opportunity of placing questions before the House on any item but not in the detailed form which Deputy Shatter suggests.  If at some stage in the future Deputy Shatter is still on that side of the House, and I presume he will be, and he wants to put down a detailed question on the matter, the Minister or a civil servant will obtain the information for him, but it will be obtained only on request at that time.</P>

Whether they monitor it on an annual basis or every two years, they would still have to get the information.  If they monitor it in a very inefficient way we may only get a bit of the information.  Any health board who function properly under this Act will for their own purposes, to ensure that they know how the Act is working, have to know what decisions are made in each of the court cases brought not only by themselves but by other health boards. By requiring an annual report to be published by each health board, all health boards would be facilitated in properly fulfilling their functions under the Act. Otherwise they would not have general access to court decisions delivered on applications made.  Most of the court decisions delivered in the family law area and the adoption area never appear in the newspapers, and rightly so, because they are held in private.  They never even appear in the official law reports.  The monitoring process will facilitate the efficient workings of the Act for the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I have been in this House long enough not to expect an intelligible or sensible response to any amendments to a Bill tabled by an Opposition party. <Col N="591" /> I find it verging on the hilarious for the Minister to tell me on the one hand that this amendment is very complicated and bureaucratic and that he cannot include it in the Bill and on the other hand that his Department are going to do what it proposes anyway.  If that is the right way to deal with the matter it should be set out in the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>I will make a prediction that if this provision is not included in the Act and if any Deputy in the House tables a question in two years time, based on each matter referred to here, looking for information with regard to the way each of the health boards are operating the Act, the Minister of the day and his Department will not have most of the information available to them.  They will probably tell Deputies, as I have been told on occasion in reply to Dáil questions, that this information is not available in the Department of Health but that if the Deputy writes to each individual health board he will get it.  It is very sad that the Minister, having assured the House that the Bill will work well, is not apparently prepared to put his assurances at risk by allowing, through a statutory format, a proper monitoring of the working of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In this case it is very easy for the Minister to give in advance a fairly accurate estimate of the number of cases likely to come before the courts, the Adoption Board and the health boards under this Bill.  We know that the number would be very small on an annual basis. In view of what the Minister has said, I wish to ask him which of the six paragraphs in the amendment he thinks would cause a problem in providing information or that might prove cumbersome, unnecessary or bureaucratic.  Which of these matters is the Minister claiming will cause enormous problems when compiling a short annual report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put <Col N="592" /> matters right from the point of view of my earlier contribution to this section.  I had understood the Minister of State to indicate that he felt that the wording of the section was cumbersome and over-lengthy for what it was seeking to achieve. I had inferred &mdash; it was a misunderstanding on my part &mdash; that the Minister of State had agreed in principle to the information being collected and collated by his Department being available. I thought we were all agreed on that.  The Minister of State felt that it was a rather cumbersome proposal as drafted.  From his reply to Deputy Bruton, it appears that the Minister of State feels that to put information into a report and to present it to the House would add to the workload of the boards and his Department and for that reason he rejected the proposition.  What he is telling us is that if we want the information we should go to them and they will give it to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be clear about the facts. The boards will be monitored and the information will be available in the Department.  There is no difficulty about that.  We are at variance in that the onus should be on individual Deputies and members of the public to canvass for that information before the Department will release it.  There is a fundamental variance of principle there.  In a healthy parliamentary democracy information should always be made available on a regular basis when it is to hand, particularly where it impinges upon the operations of a particular statute of the House and even more so where it relates to particularly sensitive legislation, as this legislation undoubtedly is, and where it relates to court actions which, by their definition and nature, will be heard behind closed doors, <i>in camera</i> and, for all the right reasons, in the most secretive and confidential surroundings.  In other words, the workings of this Bill will not be apparent to a member of the public or a Member of this Parliament at first regard.  For that reason it is doubly important <Col N="593" /> that the Minister ensures that there is a report mechanism.  If the difficulty arises in having such a lengthy amendment, the Minister should accept the compromise suggestion I put to him.</P>
    <P>Information on each one of these paragraphs amounts to no more than a figure which should be available at the fingertips of a computer controller in any board or in the Department.  I presume that the health boards have all the information on computer, that that information is automatically relayed back and that the computer does all the work for the Minister. I remember earlier this year asking the various Departments the number of VDU units that exist therein.  The Department of Health certainly are not without computer components and there should not be the slightest difficulty in getting information from them.  Each one of these headings can be translated into a computer and at the press of a button the figure could be delivered immediately. That information could be compiled in a report and circulated to the 166 Members of this House and about 60 Members of the Seanad.  The Minister's duties would then be discharged under this section.  I misunderstood his earlier views.  I thought he said our amendment was too wordy and that he wanted a simple amendment to the principle we are all agreed on.</P>
    <P>The Ministers should reflect a little on what they are telling the House.  They are not doing themselves the slightest service in advancing the arguments that this amounts to cumbersome red tape and imposing an unbelievable burden on the Minister, his staff or the staff of the board, considering the nature of the proceedings and how they will, of necessity, be conducted.  We are entitled to know this, and I am sure the Minister appreciates that point.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter was concerned that if he made a good case we would be prepared to accept it, but no good case has been made for the legislative <Col N="594" /> form being proposed by him to include this section in the Bill.  The format, this detailed list of requirements, would take a considerable effort on the part of the board to provide this information but there is other information which is not mentioned here which may be required.  I could spend hours debating the kind of information that would, could or may be required in relation to an annual report to be prepared by the eight health boards individually each year under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Our concern is to get this Bill into operation, to help people and to ensure that officials at health board level are available to take cases and so on, not to tie them up gathering detailed information every year for the report they must present without fail.  This would involve a number of people collecting data at a time when there is a shortage of funds.  We want the money spent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In making his case that an amendment of this kind would impose burdens on health board officials, the Minister is implicitly suggesting that health board officials keep no records, have no idea of the number of cases in particular categories they deal with in a week that they cannot count or, if they do, that they have to spend so long at it that they are engaged in the process of <Col N="596" /> so doing to the exclusion of other work. While there have been many criticisms made of health boards and their officials, few would contend that they do not have reasonable facility in numeracy.  Yet, that seems to be the case being made by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, a case which does him little credit.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State could do a little better justifying his case than he has done on this occasion.  This was one of the worst cases I have had the misfortune to have to listen to in defence of the unwillingness of the officials of the Department and the Minister for Health to accept an Opposition amendment in my considerable number of years in this House.  We seem to be getting back to the worst kind of attitude I thought we had lost in this Dáil where Ministers take the view that once a proposal comes from this side of the House, once the Minister has not thought of it, it should be rejected for that reason alone.  As I said, the Minister has made about the weakest case I have heard in this Dáil against an Opposition amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.&mdash;Paragraph 13 of the First Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subparagraph (d) of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> `(e) the number of applications for an order pursuant to section 2 of the Act of 1987 and the decisions of the Board thereon.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the Principal Act, the 1952 Adoption Act, there are provisions which set out the nature of the information the Adoption Board must publish when they produce their report each year.  In the context of that provision, in paragraph 13 of the First Schedule to the 1952 Adoption Act, there is a provision which says that the Adoption Board shall, after the expiration of each year, publish a report giving the following information in relation to that year.  The Adoption Board in giving the following information do not get unnecessarily tied up in bureaucratic red tape.  The information the board are required to give at present is the number of applications for adoption and the decisions of the board thereon, the names of the registered societies concerned in the applications, the number of applications for registration of societies and the decisions of the board thereon, and the names and address of each society registered.</P>
    <P>In the context of adoption, the number of applications for adoption and the decision of the board thereon is a particularly important statistic because it indicates the number of applicants who apply to the Adoption Board, the number who succeed in having adoption orders made in their favour, and the number of adoption applications that are refused.</P>
    <P>My amendment seems to add an extra provision to the Schedule which would add to the information the Adoption Board must furnish, requiring a board to supply &ldquo;the number of applications for an order pursuant to section 2 of the Act of 1987 and the decisions of the Board thereon...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we regard as desirable that the Adoption Board should state how many applications for adoption they deal with in the determinations, the application under section 2 of this Bill is different to <Col N="598" /> what is referred to in the existing Schedule. The application under section 2 is not asking the Adoption Board to make an adoption order, and the board are not making a decision if they will or will not make an adoption order.  They are asking under this Bill that the Adoption Board indicate whether, if the High Court was willing to free a child for adoption, it would or would not make an adoption order.  It is necessary to have an indication as to how this Bill is operating.  It has been regarded as desirable since 1952 that the Adoption Board should supply all this other information and it would seem correct that a statutory duty should be imposed on the board to indicate how many applications they receive under section 2 of this Bill.  That would indicate how many foster parents are applying each year about the possibility of their adopting children.  It would also be relevant to discovering what decisions the board are making, whether they are granting most of these applications or refusing to indicate that they would make an adoption order.</P>
    <P>This is a simple amendment.  It is not too complicated or lengthy.  I would regard it as the least important of all the amendments tabled, but in the context of the Minister's rejection of the previous amendment it has assumed a somewhat greater degree of importance than it would otherwise have.  It may be the only source of definitive information available annually as to how the Bill is working.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to require the Adoption Board to furnish certain details in their annual report.  Article 13 of the Schedule to the Principal Act sets out four items of information which must be included in the board's annual report.  These are as follows: the number of applications for adoption and the decison of the board thereon; the names of the registered adoption societies concerned; the number of applications for registration of <Col N="599" /> societies and the decisions of the board thereon; the name and address of each society registerd or whose registration is cancelled during the year.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to add a fifth item of information relating to the number of applications for orders under section 2 of this Bill.  I accept that it is right and proper that the Adoption Board should include in their annual report in the future details of the number of cases dealt with under this Bill, but I do not believe it is necessary to impose a statutory obligation on the board to do so. The reality is that layout, scope and presentation of the annual report has improved dramatically in recent years and it now contains a wealth of information far beyond the essential details required by Article 13.  The report provides an extremely detailed analysis of adoption applications and all aspects of the adoption process.  The annual report, the 1987 edition of which was published this week, contains a wealth of information apart from what is required by statute, including the following: the number of orders in respect of boys; the number of orders in respect of girls; the number of orders in respect of orphans; the number of orders made in favour of widows and widowers; the number of orders made in favour of divorcees; the number of orders made pursuant to section 3 of the Adoption Act of 1974; a statistical breakdown between family adoption and non-relative adoption; the age of the children involved; the socio-economic grouping of the adopters; and the age of the natural mother.</P>
      <P>I have made the point that the annual report is better and more comprehensive than ever before.  I have every confidence in the staff of the Adoption Board and I have no doubt that their annual reports in future will reflect the changes in adoption legislation which we are discussing.  I see no need to have this amendment written into the Bill and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 8, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;No court fees shall be charged in respect of any application to the Court, or an appeal to the Supreme Court under this Act or under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that adopters and natural parents who become embroiled in court proceedings do not find themselves faced with having to pay court stamp duties, which can be extremely expensive in the context of the swearing of affidavits and other court documents.  In the context of the worries I have expressed about the financial impact on prospective adopters of bringing court proceedings, this measure if accepted would afford very modest assistance, but at least it would mean that the State would not seek to profit out of the misfortune or difficulties of prospective adopters in having to go through this labyrinthine process to effect an adoption. I hope the Minister will agree that prospective adopters should not be penalised by the State requiring them to pay court stamp duties simply for processing these applications.  Prospective adopters who will have to foot the Bill for legal proceedings would be saved a figure of less than £100 by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the State is anxious to protect the welfare of children it is highly unreasonable to impose a charge of this nature <Col N="601" /> on prospective adopters or foster parents simply for filing court papers in the High Court so that the court can make a determination under this Bill.  I am not optimistic that the Minister will accept the amendment.  If not, perhaps he would indicate in what way he thinks it is in the interests of the welfare of children, foster parents, prospective adopters, natural parents or the health boards that such charges be imposed as a new charge by the State on those who seek to process these applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  The Deputy will be aware that court fees are charged in respect of all kinds of proceedings before the courts, including proceedings relating to various aspects of family law.  It is proposed here that adoption proceedings should be given preferential treatment over and above all other proceedings, including proceedings in other areas of child care and family law.  I am not prepared to accept this as it would result in a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  In any event, court fees account for only a very small part of the overall cost of court proceedings. The bulk of the cost is in respect of solicitors' and barristers' expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no function whatsoever in relation to the scale of court fees.  That is entirely a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I understand that the idea behind court fees is that litigants should make some contribution towards the hugh cost of maintaining the court system.  This is quite reasonable, particularly when it is borne in mind that persons who are granted legal aid do not themselves have to pay court costs.  I would also make the point that the court costs account for only a very small part of the overall cost of taking court action. For example, I gather that the fee for initiating a section 3 case under the 1974 Adoption Act is of the order of £60. Presumably the fee for initiating proceedings under this Bill will be of roughly <Col N="602" /> the same order.  I suggest that this is not an unreasonable contribution to seek from litigants nor would it be a significant element in the overall cost of bringing the proceedings in the context of solicitors' and barristers' expenses, sometimes running to four or even five figures.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Kemmy gave notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of damage and vandalism to local authority houses in Limerick city.  The matter is in order.  The Deputy has some 20 minutes to present his case and the Minister some ten minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you for giving me the time tonight to raise this matter which is of serious moment not only to the people of Limerick but also to the country at large.  I am also grateful to the Minister for Justice for coming into the House at this rather late hour to respond to my statements and I am rather fortunate that the Minister comes from the adjoining constituency, knows the <Col N="603" /> area quite well and should be able to give me a fairly good response to my statement.  I would not have asked to be allowed to raise this matter in the House if I did not think it was an urgent matter requiring the attention not only of the House but of the Minister and Government.</P>
      <P>It concerns first of all a local authority shopping complex at Hyde Road, Prospect, Limerick city.  The flats and dwellings are owned by the corporation, so we are talking about public housing.  There are flats over these shops which were built about 40 years ago.  These flats were due for renovation in the next few months. The Minister or the Environment, Deputy Flynn, has set aside some £200,000 for the renovation of these flats. Therefore it is a great waste of public money that this damage should now be taking place.  Four flats have been vacated in the last few weeks and one flat was vacated last Tuesday week.  It was necessary for everybody living in the flats to vacate them before the renovation and refurbishing work could take place. Within days, and in some cases within hours, of the flats being vacated they were gutted, demolished and destroyed. Cylinders, boilers, lead, timber, even the concrete blocks which the corporation workers use to seal up the doorways and windows, were stolen.  The entire flats have been gutted.  About £60,000 worth of property has been destroyed in the last few weeks, and numerous fires have taken place in the period.  When the firemen came to put out the fires they were stoned from the windows of the flats.  The firemen returned later on with a Garda escort, managed to put out the fire, and then withdrew under police protection again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the same degree of protection is not being given to the residents of this area and the people living in the adjoining houses are suffering great distress because of the activities of these young vandals.  The residents have complained <Col N="604" /> to the Garda on many occasions but the Garda have failed to stop the trespass and destruction.  The residents in that area believe that the Garda are unwilling or unable to put an end to this illegal activity and to the wanton waste and squandering of public money.  Anybody passing these flats in the last two weeks can see young people pulling the flats asunder, hopping in and out through the windows and doors of the flats like acrobats and starting fires with impunity.</P>
    <P>The Hyde Road flat complex is not isolated.  It is close to the centre of the city, about half a mile away from the new Garda Station at Roxboro Road which the Minister opened recently.  They are about the same distance from the old Edward Street Garda Station which has been scaled down but is still functioning to some degree.  They are also about half a mile from Sarsfield Army Barracks in Limerick centre.  So there is no shortage of gardaí, soldiers or Army officers. Every day as I pass through the city of Limerick I see Garda and Army personnel moving money from business communities to banks and guarding their property.  Every day I see armoured cars, paddy wagons and squad cars lined up in the streets with Garda and Army personnel in Limerick's streets, quite close to the area I am talking about.  So there is no shortage of gardaí to protect private property and private money.  The same degree of protection is not being given to public property and to the people who live in that property.</P>
    <P>Let me move now to the north side of the city to the housing estate of Ballynanty, again about 40 years old and built by a Limerick Corporation direct labour scheme, consisting of good housing accommodation.  Again we move to the flats there.  In the last two years more than £200,000 worth of damage has been done in these flats.  That is £200,000 of public money.  This destruction, damage and vandalism has been carried out in this area less than half a mile from Mayorstone Garda Station.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I find it incredible that this vandalism can occur almost in the shadow of a Garda station and nothing is being done about it.  Limerick Corporation have endeavoured to stop the vandalism.  In the case of the Ballynanty flats not only did they use concrete blocks to board up the flats when they could not get tenants to occupy them but they used steel shutters and bolts to bolt those shutters to the windows and doors of the flats.  The vandals came and not only did they gut the flats and remove the cylinders, boilers, lead and joists but removed the rafters from the roofs and the roof titles and took off the bolts and steel shutters in broad daylight with people passing, including the Garda.  Over a two year period £200,000 worth of damage has been done there.</P>
    <P>I have received deputations from both areas of Ballynanty and Hyde Road.  The flats in Ballynanty are indeed in a very sorry state, without roofs, without rafters, the whole building pulled asunder and roof tiles stripped off and taken away.  In the case of Ballynanty, the police made an effort, even if only a token one.  On one occasion they apprehended some of the young people responsible for the damage and brought them to court.  However, that did not stop the vandalism, although it brought a slight improvement.  Even at present, the flats are being gutted.  The vandals have moved from the first to the second block and then to the third.  They have gutted it as well and good people have been driven out.</P>
    <P>The sad thing about all this is that money has been squandered because of vandalism.  A sum of £250,000 &mdash; a sizeable amount out of any budget &mdash; has been used to refurbish, improve and renovate houses which are even older than the dwellings I am speaking about, which are only 40 years old.  Houses were built in 1935 in St. Mary's Park &mdash; the Minister knows the area about which I am speaking &mdash; and about £200,000 is being spent there to update those houses <Col N="606" /> by putting in bathrooms and making them more attractive.  On that side of the city such money approved by this House is being spent to uplift the standard of the houses while in another part of Limerick vandalism is causing terrible damage.  It does not make sense at a time of stringency and scarcity of public money.  I do not understand such a policy.</P>
    <P>Limerick Corporation this year are building only three dwellings, when three years ago they were building 350 houses.  I am not making any outlandish statements here; these are figures that I will stand over.  In fact, I may be understating the case.  The Minister is well aware of some of these problems in Limerick city.  I approached him on the subject of the intimidation of Limerick Corporation workers by people who own wandering horses.  I stand over the right of the corporation to take action to remove the scourge of wandering horses.  The Minister promised all the assistance necessary and that he would instruct the Gardaí to act.  The city has now, by and large, been rid of that scourge.  That was done through the support of the Minister, as a result of my visit to him and I am very grateful to him for that.</P>
    <P>I have received deputations from the residents of the areas I have mentioned and I would be lacking in my duty as a public representative from Limerick East if I did not make the statements I have made tonight.  I have tried other ways of dealing with the problem, having raised the matter with the housing committee of Limerick Corporation on last Tuesday week, 7 June.  As I was speaking in the Council Chamber, another family were being forced to leave a complex at Hyde Road because of the fires and the vandalism. Last Monday I was at a meeting in the City Hall which was adjourned because of the death of a father of one of the councillors.  A deputation of 15 residents came to that meeting to make their voices heard.  They are living in terrible conditions in Hyde Road, Prospect.</P>
    <P>I know that there are many calls on the <Col N="607" /> Minister but this would be a small bill.  It would be politics of despair if we, the public representatives, turned our backs on public property that could be used to accommodate people on the housing list and allowed young people to bulldoze them apart.  I have positive ideological views about public property.  I ask the Minister to let the Garda give the same amount of protection to public property as is given to private property, to keep whatever housing stock is available in Limerick from being pulled apart.  The people have got so sick of the property being damaged that they are asking the corporation to completely demolish them, but this would really be the politics of despair.  We should not be overawed by people who cause such damage and destruction.  We must ensure that they are not encouraged to continue that vandalism. It is very sad that in a relatively small city like Limerick such destruction should happen.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of the Garda for not giving the same attention to public property as to private &mdash; they also have their problems &mdash; but the Minister should issue a directive for the protection of this property.  If the Garda are detailed to stand guard over that property the destruction will not continue.  I do not accept, as is the case made to the residents, that the Garda would find it hard to apprehend these vandals because there are too many escape routes.  That is a useless answer.  We must protect those who live in our inner cities, the decent people who are living an ordinary life and doing a normal day's work.  I ask the Minister to use his good and high office of Minister for Justice to assist in the protection of property and to end the destruction taking place in Hyde Road, Prospect and Ballynanty Flats.</P>

      <P>First, let me say I welcome the opportunity given to me this evening, late as it is, by Deputy Kemmy to deal with what <Col N="608" /> obviously he regards as a very important problem, a problem we certainly would be prepared to do our best to help with. The Garda authorities have informed me that there have been problems with vandalism to vacant local authority flats in two areas of Limerick, the two areas mentioned of Ballynanty and Hyde Road, Prospect.</P>
      <P>I understand that the problem in Ballynanty has received every attention from the Garda and in this respect, so far this year four persons have been convicted of breaches of the Vagrancy Act and the Larceny Act, arising out of incidents in the area and a further prosecution is pending.  The Garda have had a number of meetings with Limerick Corporation and, as a result, sturdy metal fences have been erected by the corporation as a means of securing the flats concerned against intrusion, but I do bear in mind what has been said by Deputy Kemmy on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda tell me they are satisfied that the erection of these fences and the convictions &mdash; which are the important matter &mdash; to which I referred have helped to curb the problem. I have been assured, however, that continued Garda attention by way of foot and mobile patrols will be given to the area to ensure that the problem is kept under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also that the problem of vandalism in a flat complex in Hyde Road area has emerged in recent months.  The Garda attribute the problem to the increasing number of flats being allowed to remain vacant and to the fact that these are being left inadequately and insecurely boarded up.  The Garda have had ongoing discussions with Limerick Corporation and a further meeting to discuss this matter has been arranged with local authority personnel for 22 June.  In the meantime, the Garda have been paying attention to the area and they will continue <Col N="609" /> to do all that they can to minimise the distress and inconvenience which I genuinely accept from Deputy Kemmy are being caused to local residents.</P>
    <P>I genuinely sympathise with the local residents.  These acts of vandalism, coupled with other acts of a less serious nature such as broken windows and graffiti, create a feeling of impoverishment of their environment and are inevitably a cause of frustration and annoyance to them.  I assure these communities and the House that the Garda will do all they can, be way of additional patrolling and by actively advising the local authority on preventive measures, to curb the problem. If, as Deputy Kemmy said, the measures agreed on the date between the Garda and the local authorities are not as effective as I have been led to believe, we will tackle the problem immediately.  I would appreciate Deputy Kemmy's help in this area and I am sure it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for the Garda to provide round the clock, seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year, protection on vacant property in an effort to prevent vandalism of this nature.  While they can be relied on, naturally, to do what they can to tackle the problem, the owners and occupiers of the premises can do most to eradicate the menace of vandalism in the communities.  The local authorities concerned can make a real contribution in this regard.  Perhaps they will take a fresh look at the policies pursued by them to provide protection for vacant premises and, in conjunction with the Garda, improve the measures which have not been as effective as they were meant to be.  We will also play our part, but the onus is on them to take whatever steps are necessary in the first instance to come to terms with what is happening in some areas.  Unfortunately, a significant portion of the problem of vandalism is attributable to the activities of young persons and parents have a special role to play by instilling in their children a <Col N="610" /> greater respect for property and by exercising greater supervision over them. Institutions such as schools, youth organisations and residents' associations must also take responsibility and be ready to co-operate.  Agencies concerned with housing and planning also have a contribution to make and many of these organisations have been providing real and positive action in this regard.  With greater intensification of effort all round a big impact can be made on reducing the incidence of vandalism and general delinquency and in influencing persons &mdash; in particular our youth &mdash; away from criminal tendencies.</P>
    <P>I know of the meeting of the city council which took place on 8 June and I understand the comments and criticisms made.  It would be unfair to comment on some of the allegations made.  Deputy Kemmy genuinely and seriously publicised matters of great concern to certain communities in Limerick and it is my intention to ensure that these comments will be brought to the attention of the chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána in the area.  I will ask that the type of meetings which have been taking place to date with corporation officials will be looked at by the chief superintendent.  I ask Deputy Kemmy to suggest to our mutual good friend, the Mayor of Limerick, Alderman Lidden, for whom I have great respect and regard, and the city manager, Mr. Higgins, that they should become involved and bring the matter to the highest possible level.  Our best efforts will surely bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I say solemnly to Deputy Kemmy that if there is any question of intimidation of workers of Limerick Corporation in fulfilling their lawful duties and functions, I will be glad to speak to the Garda chief superintendent because we will not tolerate behaviour of that kind.  We could not regard ourselves as a democracy if we allowed little bully boys or other groups to prevent people from going about their duties, especially when they <Col N="611" /> are trying to preserve housing stock and to protect public investment.</P>
    <P>I will be as helpful as I possibly can and I appreciate that Deputy Kemmy has availed of this opportunity to bring the matter to my attention.  I thank him for the even way he presented his case and I <Col N="612" /> am sure he will accept that I will do all I can to ensure that the citizens of Limerick have the type of community life to which they are richly and justly entitled.</P>

      <P>The development of the pigmeat sector and the achievement of increased exports are dependent on the creation of an efficient modern industry capable of competing on equal terms with the best in the Community.  With this in mind I unveiled a major development and rationalisation programme for the pigmeat industry in July of last year.  The programme involves total investment of £140 million, including generous State and FEOGA assistance, towards improved slaughtering and processing facilities.  Substantial progress has already been made in carrying out this programme.  A number of new facilities are now close to completion and work on others is going ahead or at an advanced planning stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist further the development of the pigmeat industry I established the pigmeat production group last autumn. The group examined many of the issues addressed in the report to which the Deputy refers, looking in particular at the best ways of expanding pig numbers on a sustained basis and identifying potential constraints which might militate against expansion.  The group which reported to me in March has identified areas at all levels of the industry where <Col N="413" /> action is needed if the pigmeat sector is to progress.  Targets and time frames have been set by the group for actions in such areas as feed imputs, breeding, finance, slaughtering, processing and marketing. A round of discussions between the group and the various interests involved in the pig industry has just been concluded and the views expressed are now being assessed. At the same time, slaughterers and processors have been asked to submit development plans for their plants before the end of this month detailing how the various targets are to be met and highlighting a marketing strategy for handling increased output.</P>
    <P>CBF will of course be playing a central role in promoting pigmeat on both home and export markets.  An overall marketing strategy for the sector is now being devised by CBF and this should greatly facilitate the continued development of pigmeat exports.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> Projects under all of these headings are being continued by the Health Promotion Unit established within the Department of Health on 1 January 1988.  In regard to particular projects under these headings, the new unit is not constrained in the development of its activities to continuing the projects undertaken by the bureau.  Some new projects are being undertaken and a number of projects previously undertaken have been discontinued. Some had reached a natural conclusion and in other cases alternative means of pursuing them have been sought.  For example, teacher training in regard to health education is now regarded as a matter for the Department of Education, consistent with the recognition that health promotion must be pursued on an inter-sectoral basis rather than by the health services in isolation.  Similarly, the development of community health education is now regarded as a matter for the health boards to pursue in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements for health promotion introduced by the Government in January 1988 reflect the importance attached to this aspect of health policy. The new structure includes: a health promotion unit within the Department of Health, responsible for developing health education as part of a wider policy of health promotion; an advisory council on health promotion, drawn from the main economic and social interests which impact on health with the remit of making recommendations for change in public policy which will impact positively on health; and a committee of Ministers, reflecting the need for inter-sectoral action and the collective commitment of the Government to the promotion of health in all relevant areas of public policy.  This committee is chaired by the Minister for Health and also includes the Ministers for Agriculture, Education, Energy, the Environment and Labour.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this new structure means that for the first time there is a formal mechanism in existence through which the many aspects of health promotion which lie beyond the remit of the <Col N="422" /> health services can be pursued on a co-ordinated basis.</P>
    <P>The importance of health promotion, including health education, in the development of health policy in Ireland has been articulated in a number of public documents, including the consultative statement on Health Policy &ldquo;Health &mdash; The Wider Dimensions&rdquo; published by the Department of Health and the HEB report &ldquo;Promoting Health Through Public Policy&rdquo;.  This approach is also consistent with that advocated by the World Health Organisation which places a heavy emphasis on the development of health promotion as an integral part of a primary health care based health system.</P>
    <P>Under the programme headings already listed, the Health Promotion Unit is undertaking the following projects in 1988.  The stage of development of each project is also indicated:</P>

    <P>Additionally, the unit in association with the Public Health Division of the Department, the Environmental Health Officers' Association and the food trade recently launched a major food hygiene campaign, titled &ldquo;Cleanwatch&rdquo;.  This campaign is of continuing relevance and is regarded as particularly important during the summer months and as a support to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Apart from this work programme, the Health Promotion Unit works closely with the Advisory Council on Health Promotion. The council is currently considering a range of policy issues related to tobacco, alcohol, accident prevention, nutrition and exercise and expects to make recommendations on a number of these topics shortly.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new structures for health promotion introduced last January represent a significant stage in the development of health promotion as an integral part of public policy-making in Ireland.</P>

        <i>Limerick West)</i>: It must be recognised that the detection of submerged submarines remains the most difficult and expensive problem for naval forces, even for those countries with large modern navies.  Irish Naval Service vessels are fitted with appropriate equipment for the task of surveillance of Irish territorial waters but it would not be in the interest of security to give details of the equipment or of proposals for the acquisition of further equipment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with international law, submarines within territorial waters are required to navigate on the surface and show their flag.  As regards statistics on the activities of nuclear submarines the Deputy is referred to the reply given by the Taoiseach to Deputy Kenny in the Dáil on 17 May 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement in question has the following elements:</P>
      <P>(1)  A revised schedule for teacher appointments is to be implemented, involving on a cumulative basis an additional unit at each level of the existing (1982) schedule.  This arrangement is allied to the fixing of maximum class sizes of 39 for single-grade class-groups, 38 for class-groups with two consecutive grades and 35 for multi-grade class-groups;</P>
      <P>(2)  Henceforth the staffing for the whole school year will be based on the number of pupils on roll in each school on 30 September of the preceding school-year;</P>
      <P>(3)  The rationalisation programme of amalgamating schools will be intensified in 1988;</P>
      <P>(4)  Existing arrangements in relation to staffing of schools currently designated as disadvantaged schools and in regard to the staffing of special schools will be maintained.  There will be no reduction in the stock of remedial teachers;</P>
      <P>(5)  The normal arrangements that apply, year by year, to dealing with the problem of providing primary education in the developing areas will continue to operate;</P>
      <P>(6)  An improved staffing schedule will take effect from 1 September 1990.  This schedule will involve, on a cumulative basis, a reduction by one unit at each level of the 1988-90 appointment schedule;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(7)  Further reviews by the Government and the INTO will be held subsequently and will, in the light of <Col N="427" /> prevailing circumstances, aim to improve the pupil-teacher ratio by retaining posts which would otherwise be lost as a result of falling enrolments.  These measures differ from those announced in 1987 as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  The appointment-retention schedule is being adjusted by a cumulative one unit, rather than three, at each level of the existing schedule;</P>
    <P>(b)  The effective date of this change is 1 September 1988, rather than 1 January 1988;</P>
    <P>(c)  From the 1988-89 school year onwards, staffing levels will be based on the enrolment on the preceding 30 September rather than on the average quarterly and annual enrolment figures used heretofore;</P>
    <P>(d)  The specific provision for non-teaching principal teachers is retained;</P>
    <P>(e)  There is agreement in relation to rationalisation of school provision and the approach to pupil-teacher ratio improvements in 1990 and subsequent years.</P>
