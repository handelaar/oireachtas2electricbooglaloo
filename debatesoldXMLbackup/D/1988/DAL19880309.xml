I should like to ask the Taoiseach if the Government have any serious intention of proceeding with this legislation which was promised in the last session and which has been with the parliamentary draftsman for about six <Col N="2044" /> months.

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill introduces a number of major improvements in social welfare.  It is the most comprehensive piece of social welfare legislation since the early seventies. It includes a number of significant developmental measures which implement several recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The extension of social insurance to the self-employed brings within the system 20 per cent of the workforce who up to now have been excluded.  This is the first time since 1974 that social insurance cover has been extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in rates, particularly the higher rates for those on the lower payments, demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the incomes of the less well-off sections of our society despite present budgetary constraints. The introduction of a pre-retirement scheme for the older long term unemployed is also a major development bringing greater flexibility into the unemployment payments system.  The Bill also deals with a long-standing <Col N="2046" /> anomaly in the old age pensions scheme. Persons who could not qualify for old age pensions, because of gaps in their insurance records due to the operation of the income limits between 1953 and 1974 will now qualify for <i>pro-rata</i> pensions.</P>
    <P>The general increase of 3 per cent in social welfare payments will protect their real value, given that the rate of inflation this year is expected to be 2.5 per cent. However, we are giving much higher increases to those on the lowest payments, namely unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. These increases are a clear indication of the Government's concern to protect those less well-off in our community.  By any objective standard they more than meet the Government's commitment outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and agreed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>There are three main improvements in rates.  These are: (1), a general increase of 3 per cent in widows and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefit and other weekly payments; (2), an 11 per cent increase in the personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance and a 6 per cent increase in the rates for their dependent children; and (3), a streamlining of rates for child dependants involving increases for larger families.  In future there will be two different rates per scheme.  In general there are four at present.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits.  Last year we brought forward the increases proposed by the previous Government from November to July.  We made sure that the income of social welfare recipients was fully protected against inflation up until July.  This year again increases will apply from July. This will mean that social welfare recipients will not only be protected against cost of living increases but will receive real increases, particularly those on the lowest payments.</P>
    <P>A family with three children in receipt of unemployment benefit will receive an increase of £3.10 per week giving them a <Col N="2047" /> new rate of £102.30 per week.  A couple on retirement or old age pension will receive an increase of £3.00 per week giving them a new rate of £99.20 per week.  A widow with three children in receipt of a contributory pension will get an increase of £2.80 per week giving her a new rate of £93.30 per week.  The cost of this 3 per cent across the board increase is £67 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for special additional increases for people on the lowest social welfare payments where the personal rates are being increased by 11 per cent. It is the first time that the position of people on these low levels of payment has been directly tackled by a Government. This is a concrete example of this Government's concern for the less well off members of the community.  For example, the personal long-term rate of unemployment assistance in urban areas will now be £42 per week, that is an increase of £4.20 per week.  Other personal short-term and long-term rates are being increased <i>pro-rata.</i> This means that those who are on the lowest rates at present, that is £34 per week, will now be paid £37.80 per week.  A married couple with three children will get £6.70 extra per week bringing their total to £98.80.</P>
    <P>At present, there are 36 different rates of increases for child dependants.  The amount payable in respect of a child depends not only on the particular scheme but also on the number of children in the family.  Most schemes have separate rates for the first child, second child, third to fifth children and sixth and subsequent children which, in effect, means there are four different rates for children in each scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that a start should be made on streamlining these various rates.  Instead of having four different rates there will be two for each scheme.  The new rate for the first two children will be the average of the two rates with the 3 per cent increase applied.  All families will receive at least a 3 per cent increase in their rate. The rate for the sixth and subsequent child will be increased to that for the <Col N="2048" /> third to fifth child.  This will mean very significant increases in the rates for these larger families, at a cost of £3 million in a full year.  For example, the rate for the sixth child for a family dependent on unemployment benefit will increase by 29 per cent that is, from £7.20 to £9.30 per week; for a widow the increase will be nearly 20 per cent &mdash; from £12.10 to £14.50 per week.</P>
    <P>A further improvement is also being made in the rates for children of those on the lowest weekly payments.  This will give an overall 6 per cent increase in the rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance for these children and will provide a significant improvement in the position of these families along with the 11 per cent increase in personal rates that I mentioned earlier.  The total cost of the increases for child dependants is £9.7 million in a full year.  For example, a family with two children in receipt of UA at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £6.20 per week.  Their present rate of £84.20 per week will, therefore, rise to £90.40 from July next.  A family with six children in receipt of UA at the long-term urban rate will receive an increase of £9.70 per week to a new rate of £124.00.  The overall social welfare package of improvements in payments will cost an estimated £44.8 million, including health allowances, this year and some £101 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable will be raised from £15,500 to £16,200, with effect from 6 April 1988.  There will be a small increase in the employers' occupational injuries fund contribution from 0.43 per cent to 0.5 per cent from 6 April. This is necessary to ensure the solvency of the fund which, under statute, is funded entirely by employers.  At the average industrial earnings, the extra cost per year per employee will be £7.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for an increase from £62 to £66 in the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay-related benefit. This change will affect only new claims from 4 April.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> The Bill provides for an increase in the income limits for family income supplement in line with the increases in rates of unemployment benefit.  Some 5,300 people now avail of the scheme.  One of the commitments in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was that a detailed study would be carried out to identify what adjustments might be necessary to improve the take-up of the scheme.  A review is underway and I expect to have the report shortly.  The results of this review will guide the future development of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides for powers to make regulations which would allow for a waiving of interest charged on arrears of social insurance contributions. This will facilitate the special incentive scheme announced by the Minister for Finance to encourage taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill provides for the extension of social insurance coveage to the self-employed.  This is an historic development in the social welfare system. The need for it has been recognised on all sides for many years.  This Government decided in principle in July last that this proposal would be implemented this year.  In the intervening period a lot of work has been done to prepare for the introduction of the new scheme which will come into operation at the beginning of the tax year on 6 April.  I want to express my appreciation of the work done by the National Pensions Board who agreed at short notice to examine and report to me on this proposal.  The board's conclusions have been of great value to me in preparing my detailed proposals on the scheme.</P>
    <P>There are two main reasons for bringing the self-employed within the scope of social insurance.  First, it gives self-employed people the opportunity of contributing to pensions for old age or widowhood without a means test.  Secondly, it brings greater equity into the financing of social welfare as a whole.</P>
    <P>The basis of social insurance is the provision of a basic level of protection as a right and without a means test.  Social <Col N="2050" /> insurance also involves an element of solidarity and redistribution between different groups.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare were of the view that the further development of social welfare in this country would be best pursued by expanding and improving the present system.  This is the path on which we are proceeding and the extension of social insurance to the self-employed will fill the major gap in coverage identified by the commission.</P>
    <P>The self-employed comprise over 20 per cent of the workforce.  Up to now they were excluded from compulsory social insurance and left to make their own pension arrangements.  Many now rely on means-tested social assistance.  Up to 70 per cent of formerly self-employed persons qualified for social assistance pensions for which they had not directly contributed.  The result of this policy was inadequate pension cover for a large segment of the population and inequity in the financing of social welfare generally. This year the general taxpayer will contribute £331 million to finance such means-tested pensions.</P>
    <P>Compulsory social insurance will ensure that every person with an independent source of income contributes part of that income to financing basic pension cover on a non-means-tested basis.  This will ensure that the rate of pension which persons are entitled to receive will not be affected by any assets they have and that their pension payments will not reduce if they supplement those payments in whatever way they wish.  Similarly if a farmer or other self-employed person dies his widow will receive a non-means-tested pension for life.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the new scheme are contained in section 11 of the Bill which inserts a new Chapter into the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act dealing specifically with self-employed contributors. The persons to be covered by the scheme are defined in terms of their sources of income.  Self-employed people generally pay income tax under Schedule D. Schedule D income will now for the <Col N="2051" /> first time be liable for a PRSI contribution. The contribution will be collected along with income tax and the rules for collection of tax will apply to it.  As Deputies will know, significant changes are being made within the tax system for self-employed people designed to make the system more effective, including the introduction of self-assessment.  These changes will apply also in the collection of PRSI contributions from the self-employed under Schedule D.</P>
    <P>Apart from income under Schedule D certain income under Schedule E will also be liable for contributions under the new system.  The main category of people involved are some 40,000 proprietary directors of companies.  They are liable for income tax under Schedule E but they are not employed under a contract of service and so are not covered by the social insurance system.  Many of these people would also have incomes assessable under Schedule D.  The Bill provides that payments, other than earnings arising from employment, made by way of salary by a company and classified for income tax under Schedule E, will also be liable for contributions under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>Income under Schedule D includes earned income, that is, income from a trade, profession or vocation.  Schedule D also includes, with Schedule F, unearned income, that is, income from rents and income from investments such as dividends and interest.  Unearned income is already subject to the health contribution and to the employment and training levy.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons such as directors are sometimes in the position to manage their affairs in such a way that they receive the bulk of their income as unearned income.  If contributions were payable only on certain types of income, there would be scope for taking advantage of this to limit PRSI liability.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that both the earned and unearned income of self-employed persons will be assessable for PRSI contributions and reckonable income is so defined in section 10 of the <Col N="2052" /> Bill.  Capital allowances will be deducted in calculating the reckonable income as recommended by the National Pensions Board.  In effect, PRSI contributions will be levied on income as assessed for income tax purposes, as outlined in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>There are certain types of income which come within the ambit of Schedule E other than employee income and which will be excluded by regulation from liability for PRSI contributions under the new scheme.  These include social welfare and occupational pensions which it would not be appropriate to subject to PRSI contributions and income from the holding of public office.  The position of public office holders is analogous to that of public servants who are subject to limited insurance which does not include cover for contributory old age pension.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that full social insurance cover should be extended to public servants and the position of office holders would fall to be considered in that context.  The National Pensions Board are preparing a report which will cover the position of public servants.</P>
    <P>In addition to exempting certain types of income it is also necessary to exclude certain categories of person from the scheme.  Section 12 of the Bill lists the categories of persons to be excluded.  The main categories of persons excluded are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;assisting relatives;</P>
    <P>&mdash;persons on unemployment assistance;</P>
    <P>&mdash;persons with income below a prescribed amount;</P>
    <P>&mdash;employed contributors or occupational pensioners whose only income under Schedule D is unearned income;</P>
    <P>&mdash;persons in modified social insurance such as permanent and pensionable public servants;</P>
    <P>&mdash;persons in receipt of widow's pension, deserted wife's benefit or analogous payments.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board concluded <Col N="2053" /> that while the position of assisting relatives calls for further examination they should not at this stage be brought within the social insurance system.  I have accepted this recommendation and will consider their position when the board report on pension coverage generally.</P>
    <P>In the case of married couples who are partners and who jointly own and operate a self-employment enterprise, they will each be insured as self-employed in their own right with a contribution payable by each and each having an independent right to pension.</P>
    <P>Self-employed persons whose income is low may qualify for unemployment assistance at present and it is not considered that persons in this situation should be covered by and required to contribute to the new scheme.  Persons in this situation who have previously been insured as employees may be entitled to credited contributions which maintain their entitlement to contributory pensions. Smallholders on unemployment assistance also come into this category. Arrangements will be made by regulations to enable self-employed persons to qualify for credits on similar lines.  The National Pensions Board will be examining the whole question of the conditions, including credited contributions, for entitlement to pensions and reporting to me on this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the exclusion of persons on unemployment assistance, there will also be a general exclusion for people whose total income is below a certain level.  This level will be prescribed in regulations, but I envisage that initially at least the level will be set at around £2,500 a year which is approximately the rate of the old age non-contributory pension for a single person.  There is already under the scheme for employees an exclusion in respect of employment of inconsiderable extent and an exclusion of this kind is also appropriate in the case of self-employed people.  The only feasible way to do this is by reference to income and I consider that a level of around £2,500 per year is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Other categories whom it is proposed to exclude from the new scheme are <Col N="2054" /> employed persons and occupational pensioners whose only other income is unearned income.  Persons in modified social insurance such as permanent and pensionable public servants are not covered for contributory old age pension at present because they have adequate occupational cover.  They may, however, have some additional income from self-employment. These will also be excluded.  Otherwise they could, in return for a relatively small additional contribution, acquire entitlement to contributory pension additional to their occupational pension.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is proposed to exclude self-employed persons who are in receipt of widow's pensions, deserted wife's payments and payments under other analogous schemes.  A similar exclusion already applies in the case of the scheme for employees in that the categories concerned are not required to contribute towards the costs of the system.  It is considered that it should also extend to persons in these categories who are self-employed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the excepted categories the scheme will be compulsory for all self-employed persons just as the scheme for employees is compulsory.  The suggestion has been made that self-employed persons who are in a position to make their own pension arrangements should be free to opt out on the grounds that this would ultimately result in net savings to the Exchequer.  In fact, the opposite would occur.  A selective scheme under which self-employed persons on higher incomes opted out would result in the social insurance scheme being left with what might loosely be termed the bad risks and the net cost to the State would therefore be much higher.  Every pension scheme is based on a mixture of good risks and bad risks and this is particularly the case with social insurance schemes under which coverage is so broadly based.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if the persons concerned failed to maintain their pension cover and ended up with no income in old age or if their survivors had no income, the general taxpayer would be required to provide them with a basic means-tested <Col N="2055" /> payment, but no direct contribution would have been paid by them.</P>
    <P>For these reasons there will be no question of the scheme being optional or confined to self-employed persons who cannot make their own arrangements.  I see no justification for such an approach which conflicts with the whole idea of comprehensive social insurance coverage for basic pensions.</P>
    <P>I have given a comprehensive outline of the coverage of the new scheme and the categories of persons and incomes which it is proposed to include.  There will be the opportunity to go into this aspect in greater detail on Committee Stage and I hope that I have given sufficient clarification at this time on what is a relatively complex part of the legislation.</P>
    <P>To summarise briefly what I have said, all persons who have income which is assessable under Schedule D, estimated at over 200,000, will be liable for PRSI contributions on their taxable income.  In addition, certain persons whose income is taxed under Schedule E, principally an estimated 40,000 proprietary directors, will be included.  Assisting relatives, persons on low income and certain other categories of persons will not be included in the scheme.  The income which will be liable for contributions will, for persons on Schedule D, be income net of capital allowances but inclusive of unearned income and, in the case of proprietary directors, emoluments less superannuation contributions as in the case of employers.</P>
    <P>In extending social insurance to the self-employed the Government also decided to bring into social insurance for the first time certain categories of employed persons who had hitherto been excluded. These include registered doctors and dentists, Ministers of religion and members of religious orders.  Continuing to exempt these categories from social insurance as employed persons would either result in their having to be totally excluded from compulsory social insurance cover or included but as self-employed contributors. The first option could not be <Col N="2056" /> justified when their colleagues in self-employment are being brought into the system.  The second option which would in effect result in certain categories of employees being treated as self-employed persons would clearly be anomalous.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to clergy and other persons in Holy Orders, under arrangements made in 1974 they can be brought within the social insurance system in circumstances where the appropriate authority certifies that their exclusion is unreasonable.  As a general rule, however, clergy are not covered at present.  Clergy may be liable for income tax under Schedule D and as such they will be able to contribute towards the provision of social insurance pensions for themselves.  In this context it would not, I feel, be appropriate to continue to exclude from the system those religious who are employed in what might be termed secular employment under a contract of service and, therefore, not liable under Schedule D.  The categories involved here would be mainly religious employed in schools, hospitals and other institutions and they will now come within the system as employees, insurable at a modified rate appropriate to their particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>Apart from the three categories I have mentioned there are a small number of other categories such as coroners and public analysts employed by local or public authorities whose continued exclusion from the social insurance system would be anomalous in the new situation.  There is power under existing legislation to make those involved insurable under the system subject to the normal conditions and I propose to exercise that power.  The draft regulations in question must be subject to a resolution in both Houses and they will be agreed concurrently with the passage of the present legislation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the new system will also result in many persons who are or were voluntary contributors under the present system now becoming compulsorily insured.  The persons concerned <Col N="2057" /> would, as voluntary contributors, have been covered for additional benefits such as retirement pension from age 65, deserted wife's benefit and death grant. To enable them to have maintained this cover it would have been necessary to have provided for three separate voluntary contributions at relatively low rates.  This could have resulted in the cost of collecting such contributions exceeding the actual revenue.  I am, therefore, making provision in this Bill that any additional benefits for which these persons were insured as voluntary contributors will be maintained in the new situation.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision to enable persons who cease to be compulsorily insurable as self-employed contributors to maintain their social insurance cover by the payment of contributions voluntarily. Such persons will be required to pay £208 annually.  A flat-rate contribution is necessary in their case as by definition they will not have reckonable income or reckonable emoluments on which an income-related contribution could be levied.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the benefits to which self-employed contributors will be acquiring entitlement from 6 April. Under the scheme social insurance cover will be extended to the self-employed for old age and widow's and orphan's pensions.  The contribution conditions which apply at present for entitlement to these pensions in the case of employed persons will also apply in the case of self-employed persons.  Thus, after four years a self-employed man who is married will have acquired for his family an entitlement to the contributory widow's and orphan's pension.</P>
    <P>Under the old age pension scheme self-employed persons will obtain entitlement to the old age contributory pension after completion of a minimum of ten years insurance before reaching age 66.  Where persons have completed periods of insurance previously either as employees or on a voluntary basis, those periods will be counted to their credit.</P>
    <P>Explicit provision has also been made to avoid anomalies arising in the case <Col N="2058" /> of persons who have previous insurance. Deputies will be aware that when social insurance was extended in 1974 to non-manual workers who had been excluded because their income was above the limit for insurability, previous periods of insurance which had been completed when their income had been below the limit served subsequently in effect to deprive them of entitlement to an old age pension.  This arose because their contributions were averaged from their first date of entry into insurance.  This resulted in their average from that date to the end of the last contribution year before pension age being too low to qualify for pension.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that this will not arise under the scheme.  Persons with previous insurance who become self-employed contributors on 6 April 1988 will be able to choose that date as their date of entry if it is more favourable to them than calculating their average from their previous date of entry.  This is provided for in sections 13 and 14 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Persons who fail to qualify for an old age contributory pension will be eligible for the old age, non-contributory, pension on a means-tested basis.  Up to the present persons who entered insurance for the first time within ten years of reaching pension age have been entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of the contribution on the basis that they would be unable to qualify for a pension. Such refunds were paid irrespective of whether the persons concerned subsequently qualified for an old age non-contributory pension.  As self-employed persons were not compulsorily insurable and as the majority did qualify for the old age non-contributory pension, refunding contributions to employed contributors in this situation was clearly justifiable.</P>
    <P>However, it would now be difficult to justify such refunds when virtually all persons whether employed or self-employed with an independent income are required to contribute.  Persons who qualify on means grounds for a pension receive a substantial entitlement fully financed by the Exchequer.  If they have contributed for even a short period as <Col N="2059" /> insured persons, such contributions should, in equity, be regarded as in part contributing to the cost of the old age pension.  The National Pensions Board referred to this matter in their report and recommended that the refund of the old age pension element of the contribution should only be made, provided the person concerned does not qualify for a pension on a means-tested basis.  I am accepting the advice of the National Pensions Board in this regard and the necessary provision will be made in regulations.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me in relation to self-employed persons who have never been insured before but who, because they have less than ten years to go before pension age, will not under the present rules be able to qualify for an old age pension.  My Department examined in detail the possibility of making provisions to enable such persons to continue paying contributions after age 66 until they had ten years of insurance completed.  The potential cost of this concession, however, would be prohibitive. It was estimated that in year 11, the first year in which the persons concerned would qualify for a pension, the additional cost of paying them the pension would be £40 million for the full year alone.  This would significantly exceed the total amount of contributions collected from them in the previous ten years and would be a continuing cost over the following years.  Accordingly, they have not been included.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board concluded that the conditions for entitlement to invalidity pensions as they apply at present to employees would not be appropriate for the self-employed.  They undertook to deal with the whole question of invalidity pensions in a future report and recommended that, in the meantime, pension cover for this contingency should not be provided.  I accepted the advice of the board and recommended to the Government that invalidity pension cover for the self-employed be postponed until I receive the board's report.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> The pensions board, while recognising the importance of a retirement condition in the case of the self-employed, also decided not to make a recommendation on this issue until they had more time to consider it.  The Government decided that old age pension cover for the self-employed would, for the present, be on the same basis as for employees, namely a pension from age 66 without a retirement condition.</P>
    <P>The pensions board will be examining the desirability and feasibility from an administrative point of view of introducing a retirement condition that would be applicable in a fair and equitable manner both to employed and self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of the proposed scheme that has given rise to most discussion has been the cost of and financing arrangements for the scheme.  Concern has been expressed that the scheme will put a long term financing burden on the Exchequer and that the rate of self-employment contribution is not high enough.  Much of the comment which has been made has not, however, been well informed.</P>
    <P>A majority of the members of the National Pensions Board recommended that, on grounds of equity, the rate of contribution should be the same as the combined employer employee rate for old age and widow's and orphan's pensions &mdash; that is a rate of 6.6 per cent when allowance is made for the tax relief on the employer's contribution.  The board recognised, however, that in setting the rate of contribution the Government would have to take into account the ability of the self-employed to pay the rate recommended.  This is, of course, what the Government did in deciding to phase in the contribution to be paid over three years.  Thus the contribution will be 3 per cent in the contribution year 1988-89, 4 per cent in 1989-90 and 5 per cent in 1990-91 subject to a minimum contribution of £208 and this is explicitly provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The minimum contribution for people paying income-related contributions, as I explained in my speech on the budget, is necessary in the case of the self-employed <Col N="2061" /> as, given the fact that capital allowances are deductable for PRSI purposes, self-employed persons with high capital allowances who would otherwise have a reasonable level of income could end up paying a very small amount by way of a self-employment contribution.  A minimum contribution of £208 or £4 per week is reasonable in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Government also accepted the view of the National Pensions Board that it is necessary to have a system of flat-rate contributions for those whose incomes are below the level at which they are regularly assessed for income tax by the Revenue Commissioners.  It was concluded that a flat rate contribution of £208, equivalent to the minimum contribution for those paying income-related contributions would not be justified.  The level of flat rate contribution for people in this situation has been set at £104 per annum which is the equivalent to £2 per week.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the rate of contribution to be charged, the Government have to ensure that the yield from the contributions is adequate to meet the additional cost of the proposed scheme and at the same time reduce the existing burden on the Exchequer of financing social welfare pensions for the self-employed. The first issue in this regard is the overall cost of the scheme and the estimates of the cost over a 50 year period have been set out in the report of the National Pensions Board.  Given the speculation in recent weeks about the impact of the proposed scheme on the Exchequer I would like to refer in some detail to these costs.  The board showed that the additional costs, over and above the costs of continuing the present arrangements, will be £6 million in year five, £21 million in year ten, £73 million in year 20, £99 million in year 30, and £89 million in year 50.</P>
    <P>Much of the erroneous speculation referred not to the cost but to the anticipated yield from the self-employment contributions.  It was based on a misunderstanding of the yield for 1988 of £15 million referred to in the Financial Statement of the Minister for Finance <Col N="2062" /> on budget day.  That £15 million is the estimated yield of a 3 per cent contribution to be collected in an eight month period only from April to 31 December this year.  No account was taken in that estimate of any yield from the flat rate £104 contribution as the collection arrangements for that contribution will not be operational in time to effect any significant yield this year.  However, some commentators seem to have taken this £15 million as the estimated yield from a 3 per cent contribution and calculated that this is equivalent to £31 million from a 5 per cent contribution in a full year.  This explains why they concluded that the new system could give rise to a major additional burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have estimated that in a full contribution year the actual yield from a 5 per cent contribution would be £45 million and that the flat rate contribution would yield an additional £5 million when the collection arrangements for this contribution are fully operational.  This estimated yield, moreover, is based on the incomes of the self-employed in recent years which, especially among farmers, was low relative to what it has been this year.  It is also based on the collection performance of recent years which is now being significantly improved.  I am confident that the yield estimated by the Revenue Commissioners is, in fact, conservative and that the actual yield may prove to be significantly higher.</P>
    <P>The Government in setting the rate of contribution are budgeting for a yield of £50 million per year on a conservative basis.  By the end of year ten the total income from self-employed contributions will have exceeded additional expenditure arising from the scheme by around £360 million over the period.  The income from these contributions will be paid directly into the Social Insurance Fund and will have the effect of reducing the Exchequer subvention into that fund. This, of course, will in turn have the effect of reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement up to the year 2000 and result in substantial savings on <Col N="2063" /> interest during this period.  This aspect must be borne in mind when the overall financial impact of the proposed scheme is being examined.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment during the past few weeks that the Government, in introducing this scheme, are just concerned with achieving a short term improvement in the State's finances at the price of incurring major liabilities in the longer term.  This is not the case.  The introduction of this scheme will effect a significant improvement in the State's finances over the next decade and at a time of severe difficulties on that front this has to be seen as a very positive development.  But the Government are also determined to ensure that the overall effect of the scheme over the full 50 year period will be to provide a net gain to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Although the Government accept the estimated costs of the proposed scheme as set out in the report of the National Pensions Board, the estimates of the yield from the contributions may be too conservative. I consider that over the next few years the income of the self-employed will be higher than it has been in recent years and the collection performance significantly improved, which will result in a higher yield than has been estimated.</P>
    <P>For that reason specific provision is made in the Bill in section 17 C (e) that a review of the scheme will have to be undertaken in the period October to December 1990.  At that stage data on the actual yield from the contributions will be available and there will be a solid basis for determining the adequacy of the percentage rate of contribution being charged <i>vis-à-vis</i> the benefits being conferred.</P>
    <P>In fact, by that stage the final report of the National Pensions Board will be available which will, among other things, contain a detailed examination of the projected cost over a 50 year period of the existing scheme for employees.  The Government intend that this report, together with the report on social insurance for the self-employed and the <Col N="2064" /> other reports of the National Pensions Board, should form the basis of establishing a comprehensive national pensions system under which both statutory and private occupational pension schemes will be placed on a sound financial footing.  Thus existing and future pensioners will have a certain level of pension guaranteed and the burden of financing pensions on both contributors and the general taxpayer will be spread on an equitable basis.</P>
    <P>Those whose incomes are subject to Schedules D and F will pay the social insurance contribution, health contribution and employment and training levy with their income tax.  The Government have decided that collection of the self-employment contribution, health contribution and employment and training levy should be combined with income tax in the case of Schedule D taxpayers in the same way as the PRSI contribution is combined with income tax under the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Under the new system a distinction will be made between these contributions and income tax for accounting and other purposes, but no distinction will be made in collection and enforcement procedures. Thus when a person subject to Schedule D receives his demand for tax, the amount charged will include income tax and PRSI contributions.  The new system will be much more cost effective, will result in much greater compliance on the part of contributors and will also be more straightforward for contributors who will now have just one tax demand to deal with.</P>
    <P>In the case of those self-employed contributors, for example proprietary directors, who are subject to tax under Schedule E, they have hitherto been liable for a Class K contribution of 2.25 per cent which represents the health contribution and employment and training levy.  From April they will be liable for a new Class S contribution which will include in addition to the existing 2.25 per cent, the extra 3 per cent PRSI contribution, increasing to 4 per cent and 5 per cent in line with the contribution of self-employed contributors generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2065" /> The income-related contribution of 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent subject to the minimum of £208 per year, will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners and liability will commence from 6 April next.  The Revenue Commissioners will also have a role in relation to the collection of the flat-rate contribution of £104 from persons who are not being regularly assessed for income tax. A notification informing the people concerned that they are not required to make a return of their income will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners in each case and those involved will also be informed that they may be liable for the £104 contribution.</P>
    <P>Whether they actually have to pay that contribution will depend on whether their income exceeds the minimum level of £2,500 for inclusion as a self-employed contributor.  The notifications from the Revenue Commissioners to the people concerned will have issued in the bulk of cases by the end of the summer.  I am taking the necessary powers in the Bill to enable the actual liability for the first year in these cases to be prescribed in regulations.  The precise mechanism by which the £104 contribution will be collected and the date of commencement of this aspect of the scheme are under examination at present and the details will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 to 22 of the Bill contain a series of measures in relation to prosecutions, proceedings and increases in fines for offences in relation to the Social Welfare Acts.  Section 19 provides that an offender shall not get the benefit of the Probation Act until such time as any amounts due to be repaid to my Department have been repaid.  Section 20 is an omnibus provision which consolidates the existing provisions in relation to proceedings and prosecutions for offences under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 provide for increased penalties and fines for prescribed offences for employers and employees under the various insurance and assistance schemes.  The maximum fine for conviction on indictment is being increased from £3,000 to £10,000 and the <Col N="2066" /> maximum term of imprisonment is being increased from two to three years.  This will bring the provisions into line with those provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1987.  Certain fines for lesser offences are also being increased.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that a great deal of work has been done in preventing fraud and abuse of the social welfare system in the last year.  At last we are making headway in tackling this issue.  There can be no doubt that the vast majority of claimants are entitled to their social welfare payments and would not dream of trying to &ldquo;make&rdquo; on the system. However, there are some unscrupulous employers and employees who seize any opportunity to exploit the system or, indeed, to manipulate it to their own benefit whether fraudulently or otherwise. These people have no regard for the legitimate rights of the vast majority of social welfare claimants.  They have no sense of responsibility towards the hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who maintain the social welfare system for those of their fellow workers who are no longer in a position to maintain themselves and must, therefore, depend on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Since taking office I have shown my commitment to stamping out abuse. Measures which have been taken to date include the setting up of an external control unit in my Department.  This unit's main activity is to interview people where there is reason to believe that they are not entitled to the payments they are claiming and I am expanding significantly this unit from 19 to 32 personnel.  I am also expanding, by 15 staff, my Department's commitment to the joint inspection unit which has, up to now, operated on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is a technical amendment to the disability benefit scheme which provides that, for the purposes of determining whether a claimant has exhausted 52 weeks entitlement to disability benefit, only claims which occurred during the previous six years will be taken into consideration. It introduces a cut-off point of six years beyond which previous claims will not be reckoned.  This will affect only <Col N="2067" /> a very small number of claims and will operate to the claimant's advantage.</P>
    <P>The opportunity was taken in last year's Social Welfare Act to round to the nearest 10p the weekly social insurance and assistance personal rates and increases for adult and child dependants. The purpose of the rounding was to simplify as far as possible the large number of payments now being made.  Section 24 applies to amounts of injury benefit and unemployment assistance payable for periods of less than a week while section 25 provides that the scale of rates for unemployment assistance purposes will be in units of 10p rather than 5p as heretofore.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 26 of the Bill is to remove the obligation on urban local authorities to contribute towards the cost of unemployment assistance.  The contribution which has been in operation since 1933 and which is based on rateable valuation amounts to about £0.5 million per year.  In the context of annual expenditure on unemployment assistance of £444 million and in the light of the size of the Exchequer contribution to local authority financing, the current contribution is largely anachronistic at this stage.  The amount involved will in future be met by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 27 of the Bill provides for an amendment to the Employers' Employment Contribution Scheme Act, 1981, so as to permit the unspent funds of the scheme to be transferred elsewhere.  The purpose of the scheme, which operated for a period of one year, 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982, was to maintain employment levels in the textile, clothing, footwear and leather industries.  It was funded by employers to the extent of an additional 0.2 per cent on their share of the PRSI contribution.  At present, there is a balance of about £15,000 remaining in the scheme's account and about £370,000 awaiting transfer from my Department. This arose from delays in the collection of contributions for the year in question arising from liquidations and receiverships. The provision in the Bill enables <Col N="2068" /> both existing and future funds to be transferred to the occupational injuries fund which is financed entirely from contributions from employers.</P>
    <P>I now come to a new pre-retirement scheme which is part of my on-going efforts to introduce flexibility into the unemployment payments system to cater for the needs of particular groups.  The rapid increase in the numbers unemployed in recent years has highlighted the fact that there is a great diversity of groups of unemployed persons on the live register.  Some are prepared to accept part-time jobs in the hope that they will lead to full time work; others would like to use this period of enforced inactivity in a constructive way by improving their educational attainments.  Some persons would like to become involved in community activities and volunteer their services for the good of their communities. I have always felt that we should cater for the varying needs of the unemployed in so far as this is possible within the confines of my Department's main business which is to provide income maintenance to those not in a position to support themselves or their families.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that I propose to extend the part time job allowance scheme nationwide from April 1988 and that I am interested in increasing the scope of the educational opportunities scheme which I believe has great potential for the unemployed many of whom left school early and feel they have little possibility of competing successfully with younger, better educated and skilled workers.</P>
    <P>One further group on the live register which we can cater for are the older long term unemployed and provision is being made for them in this Bill.  The pre-retirement scheme is intended to provide more flexible arrangements for older unemployed people many of whom regard themselves as semi-retired and not really members of the labour force.  At present, these people are required to sign on each week at their local office where they receive their cash payments.  This new scheme would relieve claimants of the necessity of attending the local office <Col N="2069" /> while, at the same time, providing them with alternative arrangements for receiving their basic income maintenance entitlement.  Section 28 of the Bill sets out the basic conditions to be satisfied by a person in order to be eligible for the pre-retirement allowance.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be optional.  Those who qualify for the allowance will be paid by pension order book which can be cashed weekly at their local post office and they will not have to attend the local office to sign on.  However, they will be asked periodically to confirm that they are still, in fact, retired.  Initially, the scheme will be confined to persons over 60 years of age who are entitled to the maximum rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 29 of the Bill is to extend the scope of the occupational injuries benefit scheme to unemployed persons undergoing training courses provided by ACOT and CERT.  FÁS trainees (formerly AnCO) already have cover for occupational injuries benefit and also have contributions credited to them during periods of training.  It is proposed to provide a similar facility in relation to ACOT and CERT trainees.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill provides that regulations may be made giving entitlement to pensions at a reduced rate to those persons who, having earlier left the insurance system, came back into insurance on 1 April 1974 when the earnings limit for insurability was abolished and all workers became compulsorily insured, irrespective of their income.</P>
    <P>Before 1974 non-manual workers were excluded from social insurance if their earnings exceeded a prescribed limit. This limit was increased from time to time and, consequently, some persons found themselves in and out of insurance for periods as their earnings fluctuated above and below the limit in force at the time.  They now find themselves adversely affected when they reach pension age because of the intermittent nature of their insurance records prior to 1974.  The yearly average of contributions necessary for qualifying for pension in their case is calculated over a long period <Col N="2070" /> going back to when they first became insured and is diluted by the gaps in their record caused by the periods when they were out of insurance.  Consequently, the minimum average number of contributions necessary is not satisfied in their cases and they do not qualify for pensions.</P>
    <P>By contrast, those who had never been insured prior to 1 April 1974, because their earnings were reasonably high and they were over the insurable limit, have the yearly average number of contributions calculated over a shorter period which only goes back to 1 April 1974, the date they first became insurable.  Thus, it can happen that this latter group may qualify for pension on the basis of relatively short periods of contributions while others who may have contributed over a longer period and overall have paid a greater number of contributions may not qualify for a pension at all.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned about this anomaly for some time as I know other Deputies in the House have been.  The plight of this group of former workers was highlighted in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  This provision will enable me to do something for the 1,250 persons now involved.  Following the enactment of this legislation, I will be making regulations providing reduced pensions for them in line with the commission's recommendations with effect from October next.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of information, whether computer-based or otherwise, between the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners so as to facilitate the proper administration of social welfare schemes including the registration of self-employed contributors.  Provision is also being made for the transfer of information between the Department and other specified bodies such as local authorities and health boards for the purpose of the administration of social welfare schemes and other schemes administered by these bodies.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this Bill is a major piece of legislation which contains <Col N="2071" /> a number of very significant improvements in the social welfare code.  In particular, the extension of social insurance to the self employed is a measure which is long overdue and which will fill a major gap in the present system.  The other provisions in the Bill also represent very significant improvements for people who depend on social welfare.  I am very pleased to be in a position to bring this package of measures before the House and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deserves to be christened the &ldquo;mincemeat Bill&rdquo;.  It guarantees for another year that the &ldquo;Es&rdquo; in what the sociologists refer to as the C to E class will get their mincemeat at least once a week.  For many thousands of families the only meat they ever get is mincemeat.  There are women in my constituency who, in a heroic effort to give their families some variety of food within their budget, have learned to cook and present mincemeat in at least 67 varieties. For some, the least well off of all, mincemeat is their Sunday best.  The Bill before us gives no relief and no hope for those at the bottom of the mincemeat pile. The Irish social welfare system has never sought to target the truly needy for exceptional help.  It is an across the board system with percentage increases which give more to those on higher allowances and sometimes with two or three pensions and least to those on the lowest allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This practice is reflected also at Christmas &mdash; time when the smallest bonuses are given to the least well off. Unfortunately, by the end of this year there will be a great deal more people on minced meat as their staple diet, as the policies being pursued by the Government are set to end in disaster, and this will become manifest by autumn.  By then it will be clear that the zero growth forecast for this year will have been optimistic, that there will in fact be negative growth.  Even after the Jobsearch scheme <Col N="2072" /> and emigration, unemployment will further increase.  There will be adverse revenue buoyancy, and the 1989 Estimates will be due for presentation.</P>
    <P>Where, then, will the Government go? Can they revise the health or education estimates?  Can they sack 10,000 more public servants to pay next year's pay increase to those who remain?  Can they reverse their commitment to indexed pay in social welfare?  If they cannot touch those four Estimates any more, how can they bridge the gap between revenue and expenditure.  All of the other Estimates between them do not, in aggregate, make up the amount spent on education, health, social welfare or pay.  No further savings can be got from these sources.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the Government have gone offside in three major areas.  The first is the plan for national recovery, so-called, which was a fundamental mistake.  To agree any pay increases for the public sector is unsustainable in present circumstances.  To agree to annual increases for three years and to pay for them by disemploying, this year, 10,000 public servants, most of whom are needed like teachers and nurses, defies reality.  The second case where the Government went offside was in regard to the budget which was a &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; political budget, when a radical reforming budget was desirable and possible given the clear advance support of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill now before us is the Government's third major economic mistake.  It is a mistake both in its contents and in its omissions.  The contents of the Bill are mainly mechanical and insignificant except in relation to extending pay-related social insurance to the self-employed.  This proposal, despite all the waffle in the Minister's speech, is one of the worst examples of the short term thinking for which Fianna Fáil are notorious.  When, on 29 July of last year, the Minister announced his intention to introduce this measure, he made as his principal point the need to get a net contribution from the self-employed sector towards the pensions, at present non-contributory, which many of them now <Col N="2073" /> enjoy on retirement.  With this objective I concur.  However, it is very clear, no matter what smoke screen the Minister tries to make, that within the decade the proposal before us will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds per year.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons this will be the case but I will summarise the points: first, future pensions will be at the higher contributory rate rather than at the present non-contributory rate and therefore will cost millions more per annum; secondly, many who, on means grounds, do not now qualify for non-contributory pensions, will qualify as contributors for contributory pensions at the new higher rates; thirdly, the National Pensions Board says that to break even on present costs, the Exchequer would need to charge a 4.5 per cent rate and have a 100 per cent collection rate.  The mathematicians among us will know that if it is a 5 per cent rate we will need a 90 per cent collection rate because 90 per cent of 5 per cent is 4.5 per cent.  If we had a 6.6 per cent rate, which the pension board recommended, we would need a 70 per cent collection rate just for the proposal not to cost the Exchequer more than it cost now.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the experience in regard to the health contribution and the youth employment levy indicates a collection success rate of less than 30 per cent, and possibly a good deal less than 30 per cent. The Minister made no reference to the present problems of collecting health contributions and youth employment levies; fifthly even with a 100 per cent success rate at 6.6 per cent, the National Pensions Board report states that self-employed pensions would enjoy a 60 per cent subsidy compared to a 38 per cent subsidy for existing contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Sixthly, the self-employed will have plenty of opportunity to evade becoming contributors until the propitious time which is at age 54, just before their 55th birthday, because of the minimum requirement of ten years contribution for old age pension.  They will also have plenty of incentive to understate their income because, while contributions are <Col N="2074" /> pay-related, pensions are not.  So they will lose nothing by under stating their income and have all to gain.</P>
    <P>Seventhly, the implications for the handing over of farms and businesses to the younger generation of this proposal are very profound indeed.  At the moment there is a very strong incentive for farmers and other self-employed to hand over farms or businesses when approaching the age of 66 to qualify for non-contributory pensions.  As contributors they will be entitled to their pensions regardless of their means and will have no incentive to pass on their business.  Conversely younger farmers not of pension age who have sons or daughters and who are already contributors will have a major incentive to hand over their farms and businesses to their children and thereby themselves become eligible for means-tested social welfare payments and avoid having to make contributions.</P>
    <P>There is but one favourable argument to counter the adverse arguments, that is, that in the early years there will be a flow of contributions into the Exchequer and no outlays arise until the fourth year, because in the fourth year the liability for extra widows contributory pensions begins to occur.  The outflows begin at year four and become very significant after year ten.</P>
    <P>This is a 1977 type policy in its implications. Even before considering the massive administrative issues that arise, this proposal is a serious mistake and one which should be withdrawn and reconsidered. Here is a case, if ever there was one, for the Government to listen to the Dáil.  Fine Gael agree with the objective of reducing the Exchequer outlay for non-contributory pensions and if that was the effect of the Minister's proposals we might not oppose it.  A better way by far would be to require the self-employed to show evidence annually of adequate private pension cover or, alternatively, to become contributors to the social insurance fund in the manner that voluntary contributors do.  Such a proposal involves the State in a great deal less administration and checking for evasion. <Col N="2075" /> Most important, it would progressively reduce Exchequer expenditure on non-contributory pensions as the years elapsed.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister dismisses this idea in advance without giving consideration to the full proposal.  He uses the words &ldquo;bad risks&rdquo;; the bad risks will stay in the social welfare system.  He also told us that 70 per cent of all self-employed claim non-contributory pensions. Why can the Minister not make it a requirement that the self-employed produce evidence of adequate pension cover or, if they do not, that they be required to become contributors to the social insurance fund in a manner similar to the voluntary contributors' arrangement.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, a Cheann Comhairle, I do not consider the PRSI proposal for the self-employed as the most serious defect of this Bill.  The Bill operates as if there was no unemployment crisis.  It has that in common with the budget.  It is a softly, softly, mechanical, run-of-the-mill Bill as if there was not a crisis of unemployment and a crisis of poverty.  As the OECD points out, Ireland has the taxation and social welfare system most biased against labour in all the OECD countries.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that we also have the highest rate of unemployment in the developed world? This situation is now being compounded by the Government joining the years old stampede of the private sector to shed jobs.</P>
    <P>The big fashion is to get rid of people. That has been the fashion for a number of years in the private sector.  The measure of success of a manager is by how many he can reduce his workforce.  That now is the key of success to Ministers. How many can he get out of the workforce, shed public servants, shed nurses, shed teachers and let the grass grow in public parks surrounded by estates full of unemployed people.  That is the effect of the Government's policies and it is the effect of our taxation and social welfare <Col N="2076" /> systems.  The budget and this Social Welfare Bill accentuate these trends and that is why we are heading for the rocks.</P>
    <P>The biggest flaw in this Bill is the absence of any reform in relation to the employment disincentive effect of many social welfare provisions.  I had hoped, a Cheann Comhairle, that some or all of the following social welfare reforms would have been contemplated in this Bill.  I cannot pretend that these are new or novel ideas that have originated with me.  These ideas have been put forward by eminent commissions, for example, the Commission on Taxation, the Commission on Social Welfare and others.  My first proposal is to adopt the Commission on Taxation proposal for a social security tax as a substitute for all or part of the employer's social insurance contribution which is a tax on employment.  I will give an example of what happens.  Two employers pay out £200,000.  Both have the same pay roll.  One employs ten people at £20,000 each, the other employs 20 people at £10,000 each.  Who pays the most tax &mdash; the man with the ten people employed or the man with 20 people employed?  I have asked that question of a number of people and invariably I get the answer that it is the man who has ten people employed.  The answer is wrong.  The man who has 20 people employed pays more tax.  Under our system he is taxed for employing people.  Given the level of unemployment and emigration why should there not be a social security tax in lieu of this mad system whereby we tax an employer for using labour and we do not tax his property, his capital or his machines?</P>
    <P>The second proposal I would have liked to have seen in this Bill in the area of employment incentives, or removing disincentives, would have been the restructuring of the rates of contribution for both employers and employees so that while gaining the same revenue yield, as at present, labour-intensive industries and more earners would pay less.  This could be achieved by exempting, as they do in the income tax system, the first few thousand pounds of income and increasing the rate for income thereafter.  This <Col N="2077" /> would obviously facilitate people taking up jobs.</P>
    <P>I had four people in the last month at my clinics who are giving up their jobs because they are better off on the social welfare system; one is a man with seven children and the other has six children.  I can understand that decision because in the social welfare system one is paid for every child but in the tax system no allowances are made for any children. Your differential rent, your medical card and your FIS are all assessed on your gross income, not on your net income, and that creates another anomaly.  The net effect is that you are better off not working, you are better off on the social welfare system where all of these things are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that there are 250,000 people unemployed, four married men with families have given up their jobs because of the disincentive effect of our social welfare and taxation systems.  Why not exempt from tax the first few thousand pounds of income?  My third proposal is, why not reform the FIS to deal with this problem?  Why do we confine FIS benefit to the first five children and not to the sixth, seventh and eighth child etc. when in the social welfare system you are paid for every child?  Why is gross pay and not net pay the consideration?</P>
    <P>My fourth proposal deals with disability benefit because our absentee rates, despite our unemployment problem, are almost twice the UK rate.  The level of our disability benefit claims are 11.5 per cent compared to the UK average of 6 per cent.  Why is that?  The reason, of course, is that the system can be exploited.  Under the present system you can actually be at work and claim disability benefit and there is no mechanism for finding this out.  A few hundred people were caught out last year.  There were a few other spectacular cases, one in County Louth and one in one of the Smurfit companies recently.  This is the result only of spot checks.  You can actually send in certificates while working and get disability benefit.  You can also be out sick and get disability benefit and in many cases given your rebate of tax, given <Col N="2078" /> medical card eligibility and given your differential rent you can be much better off because there will be no bus fares to work etc.  Admittedly, a good deal has been done to remove these anomalies over the past few years but not enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not proceeded with his other announcement of 29 July which was to transfer responsibility for paying the first 13 weeks of disability benefit to employers.  Obviously, it is a good deal more complex than the Minister thought on 29 July.  I am not criticising him for not proceeding with it.  He should now go back on his other announcement of 29 July about PRSI for the self-employed because that is equally fraught with difficulties and loopholes.</P>
    <P>Disability benefit cheques are printed by computer, so when paying disability benefit why should we not add an additional detachable slip addressed to the employer because every person in employment has an RSI number and an employer's number for tax purposes?  The employer's number is obtained easily from the tax number.  On the same day the disability benefit cheque is sent out, why is not a slip sent to the employer stating the amount paid to that employee?  This would have a number of advantages: first, you would not have the situation, unless the employer is colluding with the employee, of employees actually drawing disability benefit while they are at work.  Second, it would allow disability benefit to be treated as normal income as it should be if we are to remove the anomaly whereby people can be better off out sick than at work.  This is done in every single country in Europe except Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal in the Bill to remove that disincentive to employing people &mdash; the high absentee level.  Do not blame people for exploiting loopholes in the system because it is the fault of the politicians in this House for allowing so many loopholes in the system, and that is one that should be closed off rapidly, it only requires a simple administrative change that should have been introduced long ago.  If such changes were introduced in this Bill I believe the opportunities <Col N="2079" /> for creating more employment would be enhanced greatly.  I would also like to see the Finance Bill addressing the fact that labour in this country is taxed to the hilt compared with any other country in the developed world, whereas property and capital are taxed very slightly.  In my view there is an urgent need for a decisive change, a decisive reduction in income tax and a shift towards property and capital taxes.</P>
    <P>There are also aspects of our social legislation which were well intentioned, like the Unfair Dismissals Act, and which have actually had the effect of either deterring the employment of people or that employers are opting for illegitimate employment, black economy employment or &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; or &ldquo;consultancy&rdquo;. The fashion is to get them off the payroll and not to pay the 12½ per cent payroll taxes.  There is another way of employing people: you get labour more cheaply if you allow them to sign on the dole on Tuesday or Thursday.  The employer pays half, and the workers are better off because they are not paying tax and they are getting unemployment assistance. We have to change that.  We need a radical package of measures in this Bill and in the Finance Bill if we are to do anything about unemployment.  I consider the defect in the budget and the principal defect in the Bill is the absence of any radical restructuring on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Another area that burns me up is how we humiliate the needy.  I have a possible advantage as I come from a working class urban family who understand very well the humiliation that can be thoughtlessly inflicted on the needy.  Unlike Dublin Civic Offices no one can be blamed for designing our social welfare system.  Just like ugly varicose veins the system has emerged without shape causing pain and embarrassment to those who use it.  That is how our social welfare system is.  Let us just ponder the experience of someone who becomes unemployed and goes eventually to seek unemployment assistance. First they have to apply for unemployment assistance, for which there is a <Col N="2080" /> means test.  Means test number one sets a certain criteria and it takes six weeks or so before payments are made.  Meanwhile the person goes to the supplementary welfare officer in the heatlh centre for supplementary welfare assistance. Lo and behold, he has to go through another and different means test for that. If he wants to be considered for a medical card he has to go to another set of publicly paid officials in the health board, at different offices and in a different section and he has to go through another means test which has different criteria.  In September he may wish to apply for footwear for his children in the winter, but he has to undergo yet another means test.  He should apply for the free fuel allowance in October, but if he forgets to apply in time or overlooks to apply because of sickness he loses the allowance for the first, second or third week and he has to undergo yet another means test.  If his children are bright and they strive to go on to third level education and they apply for an education grant they have to go through another means test with different officials in a different Department with different criteria.</P>
    <P>If he or she &mdash; and it is mostly females in this case &mdash; want legal aid because of problems, they have to go to the Legal Aid Board, Department of Justice, and deal with a different set of officials paid from public funds and they have to go through another means test with different criteria.  I could go on and on.  Almost a year ago I raised this in the Dáil and I described what I have just described now, but probably with a little more colour and in more detail.  I suggested that this massive triplication and quintuplication of bureaucratic effort must be costing the State a fortune, apart from humiliating and inconveniencing the poor.  Incidentally when people go for these means tests and discuss their personal business in health boards or social welfare offices or when they go to the local authorities to discuss their rent arrears or whatever, they frequently have to discuss their business at a window with queues of people behind them.  They have to sit there listening to other people's business until <Col N="2081" /> their turn; they then have to talk about their business in front of a queue.  Sometimes they have to discuss very personal intimate details explaining their difficulties. That is how we humiliate the poor; it is not intentional but that is its effect.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Bill addresses those problems.  It is not that notice has not been given to the Minister.  That is why I described this Bill as purely mechanical. We might as well put a robot into the Department of Social Welfare.  I will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage along the lines that there would be one single national means test which I suggest should be called an eligibility certificate which would be used to decide all social welfare, health, local authority, legal aid and education entitlements.  This would facilitate the elimination of these stark cut-off points whereby if a person is £1 under the limit they are eligible for medical cards etc., but if they are a £1 over the limit they lose out and are caught in the poverty trap.  This is a classic poverty trap and is a classical disincentive to improving yourself.  My amendments would enable us as a nation to do away with the stark cut-off points and allow for a tapering eligibility.  Payments could be reduced to 75 per cent, 50 per cent, or 25 per cent but you would not lose everything by getting an increase of £1, as is the case at present.  Secondly, these eligibility tests, as I would call them, would be carried out at local health centres instead of having people make costly bus journeys from the outer ends of Dublin when they may not have the bus fare.</P>
    <P>The second amendment I shall be proposing is that, in all public offices where interviews are conducted involving personal business, minimum standards of privacy, particularly against overhearing and visual observance, will be a right guaranteed by law.  I do not know whether many Members of this House have been actually in some of the public offices.  I have had the humiliating experience of accompanying constituents in particularly thorny cases and finding you have to sit at a window in front of a queue <Col N="2082" /> discussing problems.  The House owes it to the less well off to ensure that, having lost their prosperity, at least they will not lose their dignity.</P>
    <P>Another matter for which I have been campaigning for some time and on which I proposed amendments in this House in December is the question of moneylending which again is a rampant problem in the large new working class estates on the fringe of the city and, I am sure, elsewhere.  Following my initiative, the Minister agreed to refer this matter to the Combat Poverty Agency and that at least is some progress.  But there are urgent problems.  There are people, mainly women, who are drowning in debt and are under great pressure.  In many cases their husbands do not know because they are fearful of telling them.  Those people are being subjected to exorbitant rates of interests.  I have cited cases here which came to my notice in the course of my constituency work where community welfare officers took initiatives to ease the burden on those people.  They went to the Department for approval to pay off the moneylenders but no approval was forthcoming from the Department because there is no legislative cover for this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said recently at Question Time that such discretion exists but my understanding is that it does not exist. Even though I am quite happy that at least the Minister has responded to my initiative by referring the matter to the Combat Poverty Agency, in this Bill there should be an enabling provision giving the discretion to a superintendent community welfare officer to give, in cases of urgent and special need, interest free loans.  Obviously the provisions would have to be very clearly spelled out and defined but there should be some facility to relieve some of the pressures on those people, especially in cases where there has been a bereavement, or moving house, or for a family at Christmas time or at the commencement of the school year when there are exceptionally high costs.</P>
    <P>I am proposing this measure not as <Col N="2083" /> a substitute for any grants or payments which may be available at present but as an addition to those payments, as one way of solving the problem of moneylending. It is only the very needy people who go to moneylenders.  Other people who are not as badly off go to the credit union and can save a little themselves.  Up to 39 per cent interest rate is allowable to moneylenders, which is incredible, but sometimes rates exceeding 100 per cent in real terms are charged.  I know the Minister for Social Welfare has not got responsibility for moneylending legislation but I hope this year amendments will be made to the Moneylenders Act, 1933, because that Act has not been amended since 1933.  I will be pressing for amendments to the Act but, in the meantime, I will be proposing a further amendment to this Bill to deal with enabling loans to prevent moneylending.</P>
    <P>I described earlier the humiliation which many social welfare applicants experience and the inconvenience of having to go from one part of the Department of Social Welfare to another and from one part of the health board to another, frequently involving expensive bus fares.  There should be a great deal more decision-making at local level.  I strongly recommend the development of social welfare policy along the lines of more local discretion, in other words, developing the supplementary welfare system.  Apart from the inconvenience and delays caused by the centralised system which we have at present, the very nature of that centralised system means it is distant from people.  It has led not only to inconvenience but to abuse.</P>
    <P>The dogs in the streets are barking about the abuse.  The official line is always that there is only I per cent of abuse and so on.  Yet last year, with the assistance of this side of the House, the Minister at last we now have a separate Minister for Social Welfare and this was long overdue &mdash;&mdash; saved many millions of pounds by tackling abuse.  Many more millions can be saved.  I feel strongly about this matter because that money is being diverted from the needy, about whom I talked at <Col N="2084" /> the beginning of my speech, who are at the mercy of moneylenders.  Those people need more resources and if we are to find those resources we must ensure that we overcome the problem of abuse and that the money saved is given to the needy.</P>
    <P>Matters such as the unmarried mother's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, free telephone rental, free television licence and free electricity allowance which are peculiarly susceptible to abuse, and also to local knowledge, should be localised.  There would be a very large saving if these matters were localised, if the applications were made and decided on at the local health centre.  It would also eliminate much inconvenience for those who are genuinely entitled to that money.</P>
    <P>Another omission in this Bill is the question of the unemployed widower or deserted husband, one of the most discriminated against minorities in this country.  An unemployed widower with children gets £20 to £30 a week less than a widow, a deserted wife or an unmarried mother in similar circumstances.  That is totally unfair and is probably unconstitutional. I know we treat widowers and deserted husbands differently from widows and deserted wives.  I do not think anyone would suggest that the State ought to or could afford to give pensions to widowers or deserted husbands because the implications would be quite horrendous.  But there should be some provision in law or at least some discretion whereby deserted husbands or widowers who are unemployed could be given a supplement over and above their unemployment assistance.  That would bridge the gap between the level of unemployment assistance and the level of widow's pension.  It does not have to be a global provision; it could be a localised provision where discretion is given to the supplementary welfare officer to meet hardship cases.  There are only 4,000 or 5,000 people in this category as far as I know, but I may be wrong.  I appeal to the Minister that, when I table an amendment on that matter, which I am going to do, he will accept it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House any <Col N="2085" /> longer.  The whole social welfare system is so extensive that we could be here for a very long time going into the minutiae of the matter.  In summary, I want urgent action in a number of areas.  First, I want the adverse effects on employment which the social welfare system brings about eliminated.  That can be done within the scope of suggestions made by the Commission on Taxation and the Commission on Social Welfare.  Second, I want the humiliation people on social welfare feel stopped (a) by having one national eligibility certificate, and having that decided at local level, and (b) by providing in law the right of minimum privacy in public offices.  Third, I want an end to the anomalies which arise in the system by stark cut-off points for entitlement and the anomaly where those employed on low pay have their gross income rather than their net income taken into account.</P>
    <P>Despite all our economic problems, we are still one of the 25 wealthiest countries in the world.  It is well within our compass to eliminate poverty from this land because by world standards this is a land of plenty.  The principal objective of our social welfare policy should be to see that everybody has a guaranteed basic minimum income.  That is the central objective which I, as Fine Gael spokesman, will be pursuing and so far as the social welfare system is concerned, those whose fate temporary or otherwise, it is to have to depend on social welfare for their livelihood will be treated at all times with dignity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very lengthy Bill. Deputies have not had an ample opportunity to consider all its implications, especially rural Deputies, because spokesmen do not receive Bills until Monday or Tuesday.  However, we have done the best we can to try to tease out the implications of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 31 sections contained in four Parts in this Bill.  However, I believe it is necessary to deal in detail only with Parts II, III and IV.  Part II provides for an increase of 3 per cent from July 1988 in the weekly rates of payment under the <Col N="2086" /> schemes of social insurance, social assistance and occupational injury benefit.  It provides for higher increases in the weekly rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance. The rationalisation of the rates of child dependant increases and adjustments in the family income supplement are to be welcomed.  However, I could not altogether agree than an increase in the earning limit for social insurance contributions is necessary at this time.  Neither do I believe that the increase, small as it is, in the rate of employers' contributions to the occupational injury fund is warranted.  It is very naive of the Minister to try to reduce the amount of benefit a person can receive by increasing the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the pay-related benefit of those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves out of work.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of this Bill relate to increases awarded in the budget of 3 per cent for those in receipt of social assistance, social insurance and occupational injury benefit.  This has to be welcomed as, indeed, has the II per cent increase in the weekly rates for the long term unemployed and those on the lowest rung of the social insurance ladder, namely, those on supplementary welfare allowances.</P>
    <P>In their<i> Programme for National Recovery</i> this Government talked of greater social equity in terms of access to social welfare benefits.  They talked about maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and considering special provisions for those who are in greatest need but what this Government have failed to recognise &mdash;&mdash; and repeatedly fail to recognise &mdash;&mdash; is that it is no longer acceptable to maintain the living standards of those on social welfare because the vast majority depending on social welfare are committed and sentenced to a life of poverty.  Poverty prevails in so many Irish homes that almost 1.3 million people are now seriously affected.</P>
    <P>The Government in their<i> Programme for National Recovery</i> told us measures would be taken to ensure closer liaison <Col N="2087" /> with voluntary organisations in the preparation and implementation of policies in the social welfare area.  Where are the policies in the social welfare area that relate to the poor?  Maintaining the living standards of social welfare recipients is no longer acceptable and, even though I welcome the increases provided in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill, they do nothing to alleviate the fear I have that retrenchment and a reduction in social welfare expenditure is indeed the policy objective of the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to changes in the family income supplementary scheme. It provides for adjustments in the family income supplement as a consequence of the general increases in rates.  The maximum weekly family income limit for entitlement to family income supplement in the case of a one child family is being increased from £104 to £108 and the increase in the limit for each additional child up to and including the fifth child is being raised from £22 to £23.  These changes will affect claims for family income supplement from 28 July 1988.</P>
    <P>In February of this year the Minister speaking in the budget debate in relation to family income supplement said:</P>
    <P>In line with our commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> I am having a detailed examination of the family income supplement scheme carried out in order to identify any adjustments to the scheme that may be required.  Deputies will recall that we made significant improvements to this scheme last year.  The present family income supplement weekly payments are quite significant.</P>
    <P>Yet, in his Estimate for his Department under the heading &ldquo;Social Assistance M&rdquo;, the Minister seeks a reduction of 2 per cent in the family income supplement from £4,800,000 to £4,700,000.  I want clarification on that.  On I March the Minister was asked by Deputy Cullen the amount paid out in family income supplement for the year 1986-87.  We are discussing a very important area of the family income supplement scheme and I <Col N="2088" /> want to make sure the Minister is giving this area the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill refers to pay-related contributions and provides for an increase from £15,500 to £16,200 with effect from 6 April 1988 in the annual earnings ceiling up to which social insurance contributions are payable.  The Progressive Democrats are opposed to the principle of separate PRSI payments because we regard it as a regressive tax on work masquerading as insurance.  In its present form, it is nothing short of another form of taxation, a view to which the Taoiseach himself subscribes.  It is a further attack on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for an increase in employers' occupational injuries fund contributions from 0.43 per cent to 0.5 per cent with effect from 6 April next. Despite the fact that we are talking about a very small increase of 0.7 per cent, it is important to point out to the Members of this House that it represents an increase on a prior contribution, and will cost employers more to employ people. When will the Minister and this Government wake up and realise that creating further discentives in the employment area is not the way to create jobs and reduce the intolerable levels of unemployment obtaining at present?</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, was introduced to replace the workmen's compensation scheme and provided for compulsory insurance against injury caused by accident arising out of and in the course of employment and against prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. We have gone through this issue on a number of occasions.  This scheme is being financed by weekly contributions payable in full by the employer.  Yet the vast majority of claims under the provisions of the scheme show an element of employee negligence.  We seem to be continually attacking the employer by way of additional taxation, thereby creating a disincentive to the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the extension of regulatory powers to include the waiving <Col N="2089" /> of interest on PRSI contributions to facilitate the special incentive scheme announced in the budget whereby interest may be waived on outstanding tax and PRSI contributions on the condition that all outstanding tax liabilities are settled on or before 30 September 1988.  That provision is to be welcomed. However, I do not believe it will act as a deterrent to those involved in farming, those self-employed who continue dishonestly to withhold their legal commitments in relation to paying into the Exchequer their employer and employee contributions.  It appears such people are not interested in upholding the law. Repeatedly they have signalled their intention to frustrate every effort the State makes to collect its just taxes.  The position is now so serious that there are a substantial number of farmers and self-employed people who are completely outside the system, who have not yet been caught even by initial assessment. The waiving of interest on outstanding tax and PRSI contributions will be no incentive to such people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider further strengthening the powers of the courts and city and county sheriffs under this section because it would appear that that is the only language some of these groups understand.  I recall in December last supporting amendments Fine Gael had tabled for the introduction of severe penalties on those who collude in defrauding the system, withholding legitimate payments, thus depriving the State of its rightful contributions from such people.  It is about time we woke up to the problem of abuse.  One could talk all day about the kinds of abuse being perpetrated within the whole structure of social welfare.  I am afraid we are not putting sufficient effort into eliminating that kind of abuse which deprives those unfortunate people most entitled to social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>I wish now to address the provisions contained in Part III which covers sections 10 to 18, inclusive.  These sections provide for the extension of social insurance to self-employed persons <Col N="2090" /> with effect from 6 April 1988.  The self-employed will be covered for contributory old age and widows and orphans pensions under that scheme under broadly similar conditions to those which apply in the case of employed persons and they will be liable for the payment of social insurance contributions.  It is noted that assisting relatives and persons in receipt of unemployment assistance and other persons on lower incomes will be exempt from this system.</P>
    <P>On 10 June 1987 the Minister for Social Welfare requested the National Pensions Board, as a matter of urgency, to examine the issue of extending social insurance to the self-employed.  It is important for the Members of this House to remember that, during the period 1985 to 1987, the then Government in their plan, entitled <i>Building on Reality</i> gave a commitment to publishing a framework for a national pensions plan.  However, in advance of the publication of the proposed framework document, the Government decided to establish the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board were set up in February 1986 with the basic aims of, first, recommending regulatory measures for occupational pensions schemes, second, advising the Minister for Social Welfare on the question of providing employees pensions related to their earnings and, in particular, assessing the potential of occupational pensions schemes in that regard.  The board was comprised of representatives of the Government, the trade unions, employers, the self-employed and the pension industry.  On 29 July 1987 the Minister for Social Welfare announced that the Government had decided to extend social insurance cover to the self-employed, including farmers, with effect from 1988.  The Government further indicated that those self-employed would be insured for retirement pensions, invalidity pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  The Minister for Social Welfare said the Government's proposals would reduce the cost of paying social assistance to the self-employed, at the same time <Col N="2091" /> providing contributory pensions to those groups.</P>
    <P>By mid-January 1988 the National Pensions Board said they were obliged &mdash;&mdash; in view of the Minister's request and the subsequent Government announcement &mdash;&mdash; to submit an interim report on the matter.  That interim report contained the following proposals: first, to defer the decision on retirement pensions for the self-employed available at age 65 because many such self-employed persons continue to be economically active after that age.  Second, they recommended that the whole question of invalidity pensions should be dealt with in a further report of the board which we have not yet seen. They said then that they considered the present arrangements for invalidity pensions for employees were not appropriate to the self-employed.  Their third proposal was to extend old age contributory pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions to the self-employed.  Their fourth proposal was to charge a contribution rate of 6.6 per cent on reckonable income.  Furthermore they said that if the cost of the recommended level of coverage was not acceptable, it might be necessary to reduce the benefits provided by way of the amount or extent of cover, thus restricting the self-employed to a maximum of the old age pension non-contributory levels.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board, in their first report, recommended detailed proposals on the priority requirements for the regulation of occupational pensions. The main conclusions reached by the board were that the most effective method of establishing the regulatory framework for the occupational pension scheme would be through the enactment by the Oireachtas of a pensions Act.  I should like to ask the Minister for Social Welfare why he has not followed up the first report published by the National Pensions Board and why he has not brought before this House a pensions Act instead of the present legislation which to a certain extent is an attempt to coerce the Members of this House into accepting a package which on the one hand contains <Col N="2092" /> very acceptable proposals and on the other hand contains proposals which my party will not accept.</P>
    <P>Because it is of vital importance, I should like to outline exactly what the National Pensions Board were trying to convey to us in their report.  The first report of the National Pensions Board stated that the enactment of a pensions Act should propose the following: the provision of minimum preserved benefits for members who leave a pension scheme, that is, change their employment; the introduction of a minimum funding standard for such schemes; the requirement for periodic examination of annual reports and audited accounts &mdash;&mdash; it is vitally important that every member should know the valuation of the pensions and the audited acccounts; requirements for the mandatory disclosure of certain information to scheme members; provisions in relation to the appointment and duties of the trustees and the setting up of a statutory board called the National Pensions Board to monitor the implementation of the proposed new requirements and to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on developments on pension schemes generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has behaved in an extraordinary manner.  He has refused to follow the recommendations or the advice that has been given to him by the National Pensions Board which <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> contained.  I put it to the Minister and to this House that there is a very simple explanation as to why the National Pensions Board's recommendations have been completely ignored.  I put it to him that in the best traditions of the Fianna Fail Party he is trying to serve several masters.  On the one hand, he is telling the trade unions that he is, rightly, going to extend the PRSI system to the self-employed and farming community and, on the other hand, he is telling the farming community and the self-employed that if they agree to this extension of the PRSI system in ten years' time they will have accrued the legal entitlements to contributory old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I understood on 10 June 1987 when <Col N="2093" /> the Minister for Social Welfare made the original announcement that the National Pensions Board were, as a matter of urgency, to examine the issue of extending social insurance to the self-employed it meant that more equity was going to be introduced into the system and that the level of burden on the PAYE sector was going to be reduced by spreading the burden and including farmers and the self-employed in the PRSI net.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the farming community and the self-employed community as a group are not aying their fair share of taxation.  I am not talking about everyone.  Pending the introduction of a comprehensive and fair general taxation system which would include a social security tax, as suggested by the Commission on Taxation, the Progressive Democrats are prepared to see measures put in place by the Government which would redress the present imbalance there exists between the PAYE sector and the self-employed and farmers. If that included the extension of the PRSI system to the farmers and the self-employed then we would agree with it but to extend the PRSI system at 3 per cent to the self-employed and the farmers and include into that a series of benefits which they will have a legal entitlement to in ten years time is fundamentally wrong and unjust.</P>
    <P>Let us consider briefly the reasons advanced as justification for the proposed extension of PRSI to the self-employed. First, there is the notion that this will provide the self-employed with a pension as a right.  Under current arrangements, self-employed people on reaching 66 years of age may qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.  This is subject to a means test.  As a result some self-employed people fail to qualify for this pension while others are paid less than the full rate.  The notion of providing pensions as a right is equivalent to providing a pension for people who apparently do not need one.</P>
    <P>Another reason advanced for the <Col N="2094" /> extension of this scheme to the self-employed is that the present arrangements are unfair because the self-employed receive non-contributory pensions for which they have made no contributions. I think £330 million was paid out to such people this year.  Non-contributory pensions are financed out of general taxation.  The self-employed are, of course, liable for income tax.  If it is felt that they are not paying their fair share of taxes, and this problem should be addressed directly, appropriate arrangements should be made by the Government to ensure that all workers pay their fair share of income tax.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that in this country at present there are 228,300 self-employed people of whom 122,600 are estimated to be involved in agriculture.  It is estimated that 15,500 of these farmers will get smallholders unemployment assistance and will not be required to make any contributions towards this pension scheme.  A further 10,000 farmers are returning incomes of between £2,000 and £5,000 per annum and are currently not required to make any annual returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  Only 20,000 farmers have ever returned farm profiles and they will be expected to pay a flat rate contribution of 3 per cent this year on earnings of approximately £3,500.  The remaining number of farmers are Schedule D taxpayers.  Even if this scheme was equitable and just, there is simply not enough money from the agricultural community which would go in any way towards self-financing the scheme and the State's contribution on the farming side alone would be enormous. The small amount of money that would be available would not have a significant impact if only one-tenth of the benefits were being provided.  All of this is based on the assumption that there is a 100 per cent collection rate.  I would question that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I put down a question some two years ago on the health levy collected from farmers.  I was told at that time by the Minister for Finance that the amount due in health contributions was about £9.7 million but that all he could expect to <Col N="2095" /> collect was £2 million.  That is a very serious matter.  I do not know what arrangements the Minister has made regarding the collection of such moneys. What will happen if the people refuse to pay?  Our approach to this matter is very clouded.  We should be told exactly all the statistics which are available to the Minister and how he is calculating the amount.  Will this money be spent in other Government areas on policies?  Is it to be invested in a way which will at least offset any losses by virtue of the interest accruing from such investment?  We are not being told all those things.  We are hoping to tease out much of this when the matter is being discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>The IFA say they are prepared to pay the employee level at only 2.4 per cent. This would pay 14 per cent of the long term cost, leaving a massive 86 per cent of the cost in the hands of the State.  The more one analyses the extension of this scheme to the farming community, the more one is convinced that the Minister should and must do the honourable thing and withdraw completely Part III of this Bill.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Government have tabled this proposal to extend PRSI to the self employed in the hope that there will be some short-term revenue gains for the Exchequer.  I want to go on record now as informing the Minister that this gain will ultimately impose a substantial burden on the Exchequer's finances.  It has been justified on very dubious grounds.  One is left with the feeling that the short term attractions have outweighed the long term disadvantages in framing the budget numbers.  If the Government wish to collect extra taxes from the self employed, which appears to be the exercise, there are other ways of doing so.  There are other taxes.</P>

    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to ask the Minister for Social Welfare to withdraw the grossly unfounded allegations made against the Leader of the Progressive Democrats at the Fianna Fail Party's recent Árd Fheis.  He said that Deputy O'Malley did not agree with increasing social welfare payments at this time.  Deputy O'Malley never made such a comment and the record of this House will show that on budget day our spokesman for Finance, Deputy McDowell, and Deputy O'Malley welcomed the provisions for social welfare recipients and indeed, the broad thrust of the budget. It is only right and proper that the Minister for Social Welfare would contradict that statement.  I know the Minister personally and he is big enough and strong enough to stand up here and contradict <Col N="2097" /> that statement, which I believe was totally and utterly out of context.  It was totally against any kind of decency that may exist in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to join with Deputy Wyse in saying that it is rather difficult for the spokespersons of the Opposition parties to have to deal, in such a short time, with very complex legislation of this nature, probably one of the most important pieces of social welfare legislation to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would ask that in future the Minister allow some extra time, in other words, that the Bill be circulated well in advance of its coming before the House.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex Bill, introducing major changes and reforms in the social welfare system.  To be forced to deal with it within a 48 hour period is very difficult. I am sure that the Minister himself, having been Opposition spokesman, will appreciate that.  The Bill does not deal with the regulations which will flow from it but many of the points I would have wished to raise, having read the Bill, have to some degree been clarified in the Minister's speech this morning.  This, again, is a very substantial document which will take some considerable time to digest. One must read substantially between the lines of many of the statements contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Minister and with my other colleagues in congratulating the National Pensions Board who have done a good job of work.  It is unfortunate, however, that many of the recommendations they have made have not been included in the Bill, but it is hoped that their work will continue and will lead to a better understanding and a simplification of the social welfare system.  I can see in the Bill some attempt being made on those lines.  Perhaps not all the points that we would wish to see clarified, streamlined and simplified are included. Nevertheless, a beginning has been made and the Minister should set down a programme for the board who have the expertise and the backup to enable them <Col N="2098" /> to produce the necessary recommendations to streamline a system which has become extremely complex.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Bill is under a number of headings with which I will deal as I go along.  I am concerned that the Bill gives very substantial powers to the Minister under virtually every heading. It allows the Minister of the day, by regulation, to alter every section of the Bill which could prove disastrous for social welfare recipients.  I should like to back that up by giving examples of what happened during 1987.  In fairness, most of the regulations in the various sections of the Bill will have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas but there is a difference between circulating regulations and putting them in legislative terms.  The details are spelt out more clearly in legislation and are much more binding than regulations issued to, for example, local employment exchanges and very often interpreted in different ways.</P>
    <P>From experiences last year, it can clearly be seen that many of the regulations issued were not circulated to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Deputies and Senators had to wait until social welfare recipients came to the various clinics to seek clarification on changes in benefit conditions. It is only then, by way of Dáil questions or inquiries to the various sections of the Department of Social Welfare, that we can establish what changes have been made and their effects on people in receipt of social welfare.</P>
    <P>SI 106 raised the ceiling for voluntary contributions from £3,560 to £4,750 in 1987.  Most people on this type of contribution pay a rate of 6.6 per cent of base earnings or, if they earn above the base, they pay on the amount earned. This means that the Minister will collect a very substantial amount of money.  SI 107 increased the contributions from 26 to 39, either paid or credited, which meant that those wishing to claim disability benefit or unemployment benefit needed 13 extra contributions.  The rationale behind this move was to stem <Col N="2099" /> the rising number of claims for both categories of benefit.  This was not covered by legislation but contained in regulations under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Claimants who did not reach the required number were either deprived of disability benefit or placed on unemployment assistance, which has brought considerable savings to the Department of Social Welfare.  Approximately 4,000 claimants are affected and the saving to date, from research I carried out, is in the region of £5 million.  SI 107 also made provision for increases in the required number of contributions for long-term disability benefit, from 156 to 208, thus particularly penalising young workers.</P>
    <P>SI 109 made provision for increases in the reducing rates of disability benefit, old age contributory pensions, widow's contributory pensions, retirement pensions and deserted wife's benefit but the provision was very short lived.  There was a subsequent change in the 1988 budget which abolished two of the rates.  There is now one maximum rate of £42.30 which applies to 48 contributions and £40.70 for those with 39 to 47 contributions.  The budget and the Bill give no reducing rate to those who have fewer than 39 contributions.  The savings from this change cannot yet be costed and only time will tell the financial effects.</P>
    <P>Having received credit for the provision of optical and dental benefits to the spouses of workers, the Minister then introduced SI 250 which excluded wives of workers who do not have 200 paid contributions or 39 contributions in the governing year.  This will exclude a substantial number of people on social welfare, or PAYE workers making social welfare contributions, from benefits.  SI 344 changes the position of those in receipt of widows' pension, deserted wives, unmarried mothers, prisoners' wives, etc. in relation to allowances.  Formerly these categories if they worked and became ill could claim benefit, plus half of the benefit to which they were entitled as a result of being out of work.  This provision has now been eliminated by regulation.  Over 1,000 women will be <Col N="2100" /> affected and will lose benefit.  I could go on and on.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Bill cannot possibly cover every situation and that the Minister will have to have some facility for changing regulations but this Bill gives him extraordinary powers.  Regulations applying to any section of the Bill should be circulated to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister should give us a commitment to do that because Members of both Houses must spend a lot of time searching through various regulations when trying to establish why constituents who visit their clinics have had their benefits changed.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the Bill is that it gives effect to the increases announced in the budget and which will be effective from July.  The Labour Party, and most Members, hold the view that those increases are insufficient to meet the needs of those who are unfortunate enough to have to depend on social welfare benefits.  I will deal with the increases at a later stage but I must point out that we welcome some of them.  The Bill also provides for the extension of social insurance to the self-employed and proposes to introduce contribution rates of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent successively up to 1990, subject to a minimum annual contribution of £208 annually, or £4 per week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the pre-retirement allowance for the elderly under which such people will receive unemployment assistance without fulfilling the normal conditions such as the signing on procedure.  The Labour Party have highlighted examples of officials in employment exchanges telling many people over 60 years of age that they had not made themselves available for work and were not seeking work.  Many of those people have been unemployed for long periods and it is ridiculous to tell them that they were not making themselves available for work or were not seeking work when so many young people cannot obtain employment.  On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome that provision which is long overdue. <Col N="2101" /> The Bill provides for the making of regulations allowing those with broken insurance records who fail to satisfy the current average tests for qualifying for pensions to qualify for reduced pensions, thus ending a very unfair anomaly.  On many occasions I referred to that anomaly and asked the Minister, and his predecessor, to rectify it.  I hope the provision will eliminate that anomaly once and for all.</P>
    <P>Our main criticism of the Bill is that it does not raise benefits to an adequate level, particularly in the light of the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare that the appropriate rate for an individual should be of the order of £50 or £60 per week and <i>pro rata</i> for families.  It appears the main recommendation of the commission will never be achieved and that concerns us all.  I do not know how those on social welfare can manage to feed and clothe their families.  In the long term we must make a determined effort to reach the targets set by the commission.  I accept that a start has been made in the Bill but we must continue that work.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the decision not to increase children's allowances, recommended as a priority by the commission. It appears that the intention is to eliminate children's allowances because no attempt has been made in recent budgets to keep those allowances in line with inflation.  It is important that they should be kept in line with inflation because many women use that money to buy such essentials as footwear and clothing for their children.</P>
    <P>As far as social welfare benefits are concerned, women continue to be classed as second rate citizens.  There is a lot of discrimination against them in the social welfare code.  The Labour Party National Women's Council have persistently drawn attention to the plight of two groups of women in the social welfare code.  There is concern about the plight of women who care for elderly relatives on a full time basis.  It is unfortunate that that job is always left to women but the Department of Health and the social welfare code do not recognise the excellent <Col N="2102" /> work such people do for their elderly parents.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that it costs in the region of £500 per week to keep a patient in a geriatric unit but we do not recognise the woman who is prepared to give up her employment to stay at home and care for her elderly parents, or parent, or an incapacitated brother or sister on a daily basis.  Those women save the State a substantial amount of money by caring for those people.  I accept that they qualify for what is described as a prescribed relative allowance which will be increased to £27.20 per week but that allowance is paid to the pensioner.  The Minister should consider paying that allowance to the person who is taking care of the elderly or incapacitated individual.  I intend proposing that that unemployment assistance, £37.80 minimum or £42.20 maximum, be paid directly to the person concerned.  I estimate that there are 2,000 women in this category.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position of women on separate payments, those who receive the adult child dependant portion of their husband's social welfare payment. I estimate that about 5,000 women receive this payment.  The Minister will be aware that this arises because of a broken marriage.  At present a wife with two children receives about £45 per week while the husband receives £37 for himself. This causes severe difficulties in budgeting if the husband does not share his portion or where the couple are living apart.  In the latter case the wife's income is about £6 below the minimum supplementary welfare level.  Such a woman may have to follow her husband around the town looking for money which he may have gambled or spent on drink. She must first queue for her share of her husband's unemployment assistance at the local labour exchange and then go to the health centre to get the money to make up the balance.</P>
    <P>I have suggested in a number of debates on social welfare that there should be some rationalisation of the system.  I do not see the logic of making a woman queue with her children to collect her portion of the social welfare payment <Col N="2103" /> and then proceed to the community welfare officer to collect supplementary welfare benefit.  Surely a single payment can be made, either from the Department of Social Welfare or from the community welfare officer.  The present system is degrading and it must be possible to issue a simple regulation which would rectify it.  I urge the Minister to ask the National Pensions Board to examine this matter as a priority with a view to simplifying the procedure.</P>
    <P>With the abolition of the contribution by local authorities to the cost of unemployment assistance, there can be no justification for paying lower rates to people in rural areas.  The Minister will be very familiar with the Dublin area.  I would point out that the rural areas in County Dublin include such places as Tallaght, Ballinteer and Clondalkin, despite the fact that the population in these areas exceeds that in many of our major towns. I have held that if the treating of these places as rural areas for the purposes of social welfare were challenged in the courts, it would prove to be unconstitutional. Why not have one rate of unemployment assistance?  Nobody has ever explained to me why a person living in rural Ireland should receive a lesser payment than his fellow citizen in the city.  Why should somebody in Clogherhead or Termnonfeckin in County Louth receive less than a person living in Dundalk or Drogheda?  In many instances people in rural areas of Louth have to travel to Dundalk on Drogheda to collect their assistance.  Perhaps the answer is an economic one.  I have asked time and again for an explanation.  I find it strange that places like Tallaght and Clondalkin are still dealt with as rural areas.</P>
    <P>We welcome the introduction of social insurance for the self-employed.  I have not had time to examine the figures given by the Minister but I am glad he has grasped the nettle of the £331 million paid in means-tested pensions.  People with substantial property and financial holdings, by simply transferring this wealth to a relative, can qualify within a <Col N="2104" /> short space of time for a means-tested pension.  I do not know what portion of the £331 million is accounted for by that category but I was always of the opinion that the amount involved was substantial. While the organisations and pressure groups representing the self-employed and the farming community will argue that they should not be paying a particular percentage, they will have to recognise that £331 million of taxpayers' money is being spent on providing means-tested pensions in the sectors referred to by the Minister.  Could the Minister tell us what categories are involved?  I assume the vast bulk of the money is derived from the PAYE sector and that the people who actually get the benefit of these pensions have not made any contribution to the system.  I see the Minister nods his head. I am glad this problem has been recognised by the Minister and by the National Pensions Board.</P>
    <P>I find great difficulty in agreeing with the commentators who say that the contribution being asked by the Minister from the self-employed and farmers is too great.  If anything it is a conservative figure and I believe the figure of 6.6 per cent recommended by the National Pensions Board should be required.  People should no longer be able to get something for nothing.  The PAYE and PRSI sectors have carried the whole system of social welfare on their backs for long enough. I would like the pressure groups to explain to me how they can justify a means tested non-contributory pension being paid to retired self-employed people for the rest of their natural lives without them having contributed anything to the system?  How one can justify it is beyond me.  We are always accused of having a rural-urban division but there is no division when it comes to this and there cannot be.  I ask the Minister in his reply to spell out clearly where that £331 million is going to come from, what categories it will go to, how many of those people have contributed to the system, how many of them have contributed partially to the system.  Those questions need to be answered.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's <Col N="2105" /> attention to what may very well be an anomaly as regards the self employed. On a first reading of the Minister's very lengthy speech I thought it had covered this particular point but having gone over it again I am not sure that it does.  In regard to, for example, prescribed relations of self-employed people who work in a family business but who are not partners, I understood the Minister to say that the spouse of the owner would be covered for a pension in the event of the death of the owner, in other words, that a wife would qualify for a contributory pension in her own right, but there may be many situations where a husband and wife may not be partners in a business and would, therefore, be exempt from making contributions.  This would leave them without the right to benefits.  I would like the Minister to clarify as to what exactly that particular section means.  Partners or spouses in that type of situation would have very little, if any, cover and now that the Minister is bringing them in we should close what I believe to be a gap in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the Bill I would like to refer to but in particular two areas which I regard as being problem areas.  Obviously, on Committee Stage the parties will table a number of amendments so all I need to do at this stage is to highlight our main concerns.  As I have said, the Labour Party welcome the proposals to end the anomaly as between contributors who paid insurance before 1974 but who have insufficient stamps for pension and those who began paying only in 1974 and who, of course, will receive full pensions.  The family income supplement income ceilings are raised slightly in the Bill.  As the Minister is aware, the Commission on Social Welfare pointed out that one of the main problems with the scheme was that the income limits based on gross income were so low that few low-income families qualify and they suggested net rather than gross income as the basis for the scheme.  Even after that change a one-child family would only benefit if gross <Col N="2106" /> wages are under £108 a week and a two-child family would only benefit if gross wages are under £131 per week.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly the Minister might consider, which certainly is not dealt with in the Bill and which perhaps could be dealt with by way of regulation, is where a woman who works whose husband is in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, cannot, at least as I understand it from inquiries I have made, be paid FIS.  I understand that she would not qualify even if her husband was not in receipt of social welfare payments. A woman should have the same rights under the FIS scheme as a man.  If a woman is the main breadwinner of a family she should be treated in the same way under the FIS scheme as a man. Perhaps the regulations are being wrongly interpreted in this instance but I know of a number of cases where women have made applications under this scheme but were turned down.  That is definite discrimination against women.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to make and I ask the Minister to take them into consideration.  I strongly recommend that under the regulations governing UA, the long-term unemployed, who will always include those on unemployment assistance, should be given some form of incentive to work and given back some dignity. They should be allowed to work for even a small portion of the week.  If a person on unemployment assistance can obtain a few hours work one day in the week they should be allowed to work on that one day to supplement their income. First, this would give them back a little dignity and keep them in touch with the workplace without penalising them.</P>
    <P>Let me give a typical example of what I am talking about.  I know of a man who could have obtained a job in a cattle yard &mdash; a very menial task let me say &mdash; and earned £8 for the few hours he would work.  He is in receipt of £16 a day unemployment assistance as he has a wife and a couple of children.  I contacted the Department of Social Welfare and asked if there was any way that this man could go out and do a few hours work to earn <Col N="2107" /> a few pounds extra but I was told by the Department that under the existing regulations &mdash; of course I know this anyway &mdash; that if he went out to work and earned £8 a day he would lose his £16 a day social assistance.  I ask the Minister to allow in the regulations for a maximum of say six hours work in a week or between two and four hours work in a day in order to give people some incentive to go out to work and not to always frame the regulations so as the incentive is not to work.  There are many people who would avail of an incentive to work.</P>
    <P>One of my concerns relates to how the money from this new sector of the self employed and the farming community is to be collected.  I assume that they will make their contributions at the end of the financial year.  If that is so, we will get bogged down in the appeals system. The assessments which will be sent out at the end of a year will be appealed, there will be delays and payments will end up a year or two behind.  If the same collector is going to be involved in the same way we will end up with the same problem, with massive arrears of outstanding contributions from this new sector and this again will have to be carried by the PAYE sector.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 7, inclusive, and written Question No. 77 together.</P>
      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is an international agreement between two sovereign Governments and is therefore binding on both Governments and their successors in office.  It cannot be set aside unilaterally.</P>
      <P>This Government made it perfectly clear on coming into office that we accepted the agreement as binding and furthermore that we would use the machinery of the agreement to secure any possible improvement in the situation of the people of Northern Ireland and in particular of the members of the Nationalist community.  We have done that consistently.</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the agreement deals with the question of devolved Government in Northern Ireland.  It is important to look at what exactly the agreement says about this issue.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of Article 4 states:</P>
      <P>It is the declared policy of the United Kingdom Government that responsibility in respect of certain matters within the powers of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should be devolved within Northern Ireland on a basis which would secure wide-spread acceptance thoughout the community. The Irish Government support that policy.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (c) of Article 4 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Governments recognise that devolution can be achieved only with the co-operation of constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there.  The Conference <Col N="2112" /> shall be a framework within which the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the modalities of bringing about devolution in Northern Ireland, in so far as they relate to the interests of the minority community.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 (b) therefore makes it clear that devolution is primarily a matter for the United Kingdom Government and the community in Northern Ireland.  The paragraph simply states that the Irish Government support that policy.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 4 (c) does two things.  It spells out clearly that devolution can only be achieved with the co-operation of the constitutional representatives within Northern Ireland of both traditions there. It goes on to state that the Irish Government may put forward views and proposals on the modalities of bringing about devolution.  But an important qualification is that this right to put forward views and proposals is confined to doing so in relation to the interests of the Nationalist community.</P>
    <P>The role of the Irish Government in regard to devolution is therefore a limited one.  Taken as a whole, Article 4 makes it clear that devolution is primarily a matter for the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland with the Irish Government having a supportive role should they deem it appropriate to exercise it in the interest of the Nationalist community.  The agreement cannot be interpreted as placing an obligation on the Irish Government to initiate devolution proposals.  The Irish Government clearly have complete discretion as to whether or not they would put forward views or proposals at any stage.</P>
    <P>This was the position of the previous Government.  They did not regard themselves as having any obligation during their term of office to put forward views and proposals and they did not in fact at any stage put forward any proposals.  I think most people would agree that they were right in that decision.  The fact that they did not make any proposals makes it clear, that not alone is there no obligation on the Irish Government to put <Col N="2113" /> forward proposals for devolution but also that it may well be preferable not to do so if the circumstances do not warrant it.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that some Deputies apparently wish to use the Anglo-Irish Agreement as something of a political football.  Even though we have clearly stated that as a Government we fully accept our international obligation to honour the agreement and that we have consistently availed of its procedures in an effort to improve the situation of the people of Northern Ireland, these Deputies continue to attack the Government over the agreement.  I think it is legitimate for me to ask what purpose they think they are serving by these tactics. They are certainly not improving the status or the prospects of the agreement itself by suggesting that this Government are endeavouring to undermine it.</P>
    <P>Instead of trying to wrongfoot the Irish Government would they not be better employed in examining how the British Government are meeting their obligations under the agreement and whether they have in fact adhered to the provisions of the agreement on some important occasions recently?  If they did that, they would much more effectively serve the interests of the Nationalists of Northern Ireland, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view and I believe that the view would be shared by the leadership of the SDLP that no opportunity exists at present for the Irish Government to put forward any views or proposals on devolution.  From the Nationalist side there are no definitive proposals on the table.  As far as we know there is no commitment at present by Unionist representatives to any acceptable form of power sharing devolution. Dr. John Alderdice, the Alliance Leader, stated recently that, at this stage, it would not be particularly helpful for the Dublin Government to make devolution proposals and, of course, Article 4 (c) as I have mentioned, states that both Governments recognise &ldquo;that devolution <Col N="2114" /> can be achieved only with the co-operation of the constitutional representatives in Northern Ireland of both traditions there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to state again that it is my belief that a long term and lasting solution to the agony of the North will only be found through the establishment of new all-embracing political structures for the whole of this island.  The Leader of the SDLP has stated that if agreement were to be reached between the SDLP and the Unionists alone it would be a very unstable agreement because Unionists would still look over SDLP shoulders to Dublin.  In saying that I believe he clearly envisages a broader framework.</P>
      <P>This Government are deeply anxious to secure political movement in Northern Ireland and will keep the situation under continuing review and avail of any opportunity that presents itself for constructive and open dialogue directed towards that purpose.</P>
      <P>Whether or not a system of devolved Government would bring peace to Northern Ireland in the short term is a matter of opinion.  In my judgment it would not bring permanent and lasting peace. Others may disagree and, of course, they have a perfectly legitimate democratic right to do so.  But no-one can argue that there is anything in the Anglo-Irish Agreement which makes devolution a mandatory solution and, in fact, the agreement clearly gives to the constitutional representatives of Northern Ireland the right to assent or not to any proposals.</P>

      <P>Am I correct in assuming from what the Taoiseach has said that he intends to work, as the agreement demands, with determination and imagination all aspects of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that if he does not consider the present time suitable for putting forward views and proposals on devolution he will use the opportunity when he does consider the time suitable?  Will he also look at what the preamble to the agreement says about the rights of both communities in Northern Ireland to participate in the structures and process of government there?  That is part of the preamble to the agreement which he did not quote here.  Because of the difficult relations between the UK Government and our own at this time a &ldquo;present&rdquo; narrowly defined like that is not a suitable time for putting forward views and proposals, but will he ensure that the cochairman sitting next to him will put them forward when the time is suitable?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat the essence of my reply, namely, the agreement should be interpreted much more clearly as indicating that the initiative in regard to devolution rests with the British Government in co-operation with the constitutional representive from Northern Ireland, as Deputy Barry said.  As I interpret the agreement it is allocating to the Irish Government a role of vetting <Col N="2116" /> and supporting any such proposals if in their view they are in the interests of the Nationalist community.  I think that is a fair summary of the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put some supplementary questions to the Taoiseach. Since the Taoiseach returned to Government have any discussions taken place between him and the British Prime Minister or in the Anglo-Irish Conference on the question of devolution in Northern Ireland?  If that has not happened, in what circumstances would he consider putting forward proposals in relation to devolution?  Lastly, is the Taoiseach satisfied at present with the Anglo-Irish Agreement as an appropriate framework for bringing about reconciliation in Northern Ireland?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances are really outlined for me or anybody else in the agreement itself, that it would be the policy of the British Government to attempt to devolve powers inside the North of Ireland.  I should make the point here that it is only powers which are exercised by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland which can be devolved. The agreement visualises the British Government taking the initiative in devolving such powers, discussing that devolution with and, presumably, securing the agreement of the constitutional representatives, and only at that stage would the Irish Government come into it.  They are the circumstances in which the Irish Government would have a role in regard to devolution proposals.</P>

      <P>Article 4 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which the Taoiseach has outlined in great detail commits the Irish Government to supporting the policy of devolution.  Let me ask the Taoiseach if this Irish Government support the policy of devolution in the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach has accepted, after some circumnavigation of the issue, that devolution would be a stage in which the mechanism of devolution might help to bring about reconciliation. Is the Taoiseach not aware that the Leader of the Official Unionist Party <Col N="2118" /> is reported to be of the view that the Taoiseach has concluded that even power sharing devolution was not a worthwhile objective?  Is the Taoiseach not aware also that the Leader of the OUP has quoted a statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to the effect that it was up to the Taoiseach to decide whether to put forward proposals?</P>

      <P>No, I was paraphrasing very freely but accurately.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that if the interpretation put on his remarks last week is to the effect that other people believe he sees no role for devolution, he is thereby running the risk of cutting out of the whole process one stage, a stage which he admits would be useful?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that, as I made clear in the Dáil here on 8 December last, the previous Government put forward no proposals on devolution and that the question I asked this day week out of which this controversy arose was not whether the Government were putting forward any proposals for devolution, but whether the Taoiseach would see devolved government as possible or desirable as a political solution in Northern Ireland and as part of an interim solution to bring peace in Northern Ireland?  Finally, the subject matter of my question is whether the Taoiseach <Col N="2119" /> would agree that the Government would welcome the development of an active dialogue between the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland on the range of issues of concern at present including the possibility of establishing a basis for devolved government which would secure widespread acceptance throughout the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss as to the Deputy's thread.  The only thing I can do is repeat what I said in my reply to the question.  As Deputy Dukes has pointed out, it is very easy to be misinterpreted on these matters.  It is not a very satisfactory process to have to give answers in this way across the Floor of the House to supplementary questions on something as important and as complex as this.  So I repeat what I said.  Whether or not a system of devolved Government would bring peace to Northern Ireland in the short term is a matter of opinion.  In my judgment it would not bring permanent and lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, before I ask my question, that the Taoiseach's original reply was very long and complicated, so I hope that questions arising out of that will not be ruled out on the basis of repetition. Does the Taoiseach accept the view that the Irish Government's role at the Anglo-Irish Conference is to put forward views and proposals in the interests of the Nationalist community of Northern Ireland, and that whatever views Nationalists might have on the long-term solution to the problem in Northern Ireland, it is incumbent on the Irish Government of the day to do things that will relieve the plight of the Nationalists in the North and that one of the ways of doing that is by giving them a role now in a power-sharing devolved Government there?  We can look after our shared aspirations later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Deputy there.  What I have said &mdash; and I thought the Deputy was agreeing with me &mdash; was that as of this stage there does <Col N="2120" /> not seem to be any sort of fruitful ground for the bringing forward of proposals for devolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the Taoiseach attaches importance to the views and feelings of the Northern majority, which one has come to suppose he does, would he not consider the possibility that the reason Mr. Molyneaux and others may have misunderstood him &mdash; if they have misunderstood him &mdash; is his constant or very frequent reiteration of his own personal belief, which may be as easily wrong as right, that there is no permanent solution to be found within the Six County framework?  That may be a correct view regarded in the light of a century, but it ought not to obstruct, as I think everybody in the House would agree, a short-term solution.  If the Taoiseach would pipe down about his personal prophetic beliefs about what is or is not going to happen in 50 or 100 years possibly we might get somewhere in such a way that the people now alive will have a normal existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's words I would like to crystalise the clarity of his response by asking two questions.  First, in his opening statement, I understood him to say, in summarising Article 4 (b), that it involves a commitment to support devolution if it would benefit the minority.  I thought I heard him say in reply to a supplementary that the agreement, in Article 4 (b), involved supporting devolution to the extent that it benefits the minority. Would the Taoiseach not agree that Article 4 (b) is unconditional and that it states that the Irish Government support devolution and do so for the reasons set out in the preamble, because the Irish Government believe &mdash; and that belief is set out in the agreement &mdash; that devolution would and will benefit the minority?  I would like clarification of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement says <Col N="2121" /> nothing about benefiting the Nationalist community.  It merely talks about the interests of the Nationalist community. The best thing I can do at this stage is quote what the former Taoiseach himself said in his remarks at the signing of the agreement when he indicated that the majority of the Irish people should share this aspiration to Irish unity being achieved peacefully and by agreement.  In other words, I think that the former Taoiseach, on that very important occasion, confirmed the Nationalist position which Deputy John Kelly is now attacking me for reaffirming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not replied to the question which relates to the unconditional character of Article 4 (b).  Second, I would like to ask him about another reference in a reply to a supplementary question when he said that in regard to the putting forward of proposals or views by the Irish Government &mdash; something which is by no means appropriate or necessary at this stage &mdash; that this would arise only after agreement had been reached on devolution.  Only at that stage, the Taoiseach said, would the Irish Government come in.  Would he not accept that the purpose of Article 4 (c) is to make provision so that the Irish Government can make a useful intervention, helpful to the situation in Northern Ireland and to the interests of the minority in advance of agreement being reached rather than after the event when there is no point in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself said on one occasion that the agreement is not written in stone and, therefore, to that extent I do not think we should be trying to speculate on what might or might not happen in the future and what developments might take place and what might evolve.  In so far as the present position is concerned and without preempting future developments or devolution as envisaged by the former Taoiseach, I would give it as my view that the initiative does not rest with the Irish Government.  Perhaps there is room for <Col N="2122" /> an alternative opinion on that, and if so I would like to hear it argued.  My reading of the process as outlined or envisaged in the agreement is that the initiative would lie primarily with the British Government; that they would start devolving powers from the Northern Secretary of State, discussing that devolution in the first instance with the representatives of the constitutional parties in the North and, as that process was taking place, the Irish Government would have a role especially from the point of view of the interests of the Nationalist community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply that devolved government would not bring a permanent or lasting solution, which is something with which I could go along, does the Taoiseach agree with the statement of his Minister for Foreign Affairs in December last that he would welcome dialogue between constitutional parties in Northern Ireland on a range of issues, including the possibility of establishing the basis for devolved government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest answer to that is that I would welcome any dialogue with representatives of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  As I made clear in my speech and in reply to Deputy Spring on another occasion, I would be glad to hear at first hand from the representatives of the Unionist tradition their views on anything about the situation, whether it is devolution or anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <P>It certainly was not our view that the Irish Government would have this passive role when Nationalists in the North have waited for 65 years to have an Irish Government have some say <Col N="2123" /> over their affairs in the North.  It is almost treacherous of the Government to throw away that opportunity now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the correct summation of the Taoiseach's position that he does not consider it a suitable opportunity at present to put forward views and proposals on devolution but that at some later time, circumstances permitting, he would do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First I want to suggest that the Deputy is misinterpreting the position.  What has been said about the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the way we have acted in regard to it is that we will avail of its mechanism and procedures to achieve any progress possible in the North.  I do not think Deputy Barry can attack me on the question of not putting forward proposals in regard to devolution because, for the 18 months that ensued from the signing of the agreement until he went out of office as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he did not put forward any proposals for devolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get some clarification because I would not want any misinterpretation of this very important discussion this afternoon.  There seems to be some difference in the reply the Taoiseach gave to me earlier in this question session and the reply he gave to Deputy FitzGerald.  I assume that this agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, gives the Irish Government major powers as an initiating body.  We are equal partners in the agreement and I would see <Col N="2124" /> that our role is anything but passive.  I am rather concerned now about what the Taoiseach has been saying in his later replies, that he does not envisage an initiating role for the Irish Government, and that in fact he is relegating this agreement to the third division.  I want some reassurance that that has not been allowed to happen and that the Taoiseach, leading his Government, will have an initiating role in the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have said is very clear.  I am simply endeavouring to interpret the agreement as I have it before me.  As I have said, the thrust of Article 4 of that agreement makes it clear that devolution is primarily a matter for the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government come onto the scene in a supportive role, in giving views and proposals on the modalities of devolution as proposed in the interests of the Nationalist community.</P>

      <P>Regular <Col N="2128" /> statistical information of the type requested by the Deputy is not available on a comprehensive basis.  Partial information can be derived from the census of population where horse racing is distinguished as a separate activity.  In 1981 some 1,075 persons at work were coded to horse racing on the basis of the specific information returned on the census forms.  All other persons involved in any aspect of the horse industry (breeding, schooling etc.), where horse racing was not mentioned, are included elsewhere e.g. with &ldquo;farming and stock rearing on farms&rdquo; or under &ldquo;other recreational activities&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very specific question about a very specific matter and apparently Deputy Molloy wanted to get into the whole area about which he could have asked questions.  I want to ask the Minister in regard to this specific question if he is aware that the voluntary committee in an area of very high unemployment, where such a sports and leisure complex is absolutely essential, fear there is a danger of this expensive centre closing down on account of a mixture of outstanding fees from builders and various other difficulties?  The Minister mentioned in the course of his reply that no application had been received apart from one in respect of the building of a store <Col N="2132" /> ancillary to this sports and leisure complex &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the sports and leisure complex has been completed already.  Favourable consideration would not be possible because the relevant grants have to be made available in respect of new projects or phases of existing projects of new work undertaken in 1988.  The ancillary store is the one that has been recommended by Dublin Corporation but it represents a very much smaller amount of money than that suggested in the Deputy's question.  It is not possible to grant aid work already undertaken which has been grant-aided previously. The scheme does not allow for that.  However, the second element &mdash; the building of a store ancillary to this sports and leisure complex &mdash; would be in order.  An application has been received in respect thereof and a sum recommended by Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 22, 29, 31, 48, 59, 60 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Environmental Research Unit are specified in the Environmental Research Unit (Establishment) Order, 1988, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 12 February 1988.  I have appointed the following officers of my Department to be the management committee of the new unit: Mr. Desmond Malin (Chairman); Mr. Brian Campbell; Mr. Brendan <Col N="2135" /> O'Donoghue; Mr. Patrick O'Duffy and Mr. Séan Walsh.</P>
    <P>The Environment Awareness Bureau will cease to operate at the end of April next.  An Foras Forbartha will be wound up as soon as possible.  The question of a continuing working relationship between the unit and these two bodies does not therefore arise.  It will be a matter for the management committee of the unit, with my consent, to decide what property, if any, it should take over from An Foras Forbartha.  The new unit will be financed by grants from Subhead R &mdash; Research, Analytical and Related Services &mdash; of my Department's Vote which provides a sum of £1.750 million for research and other services in 1988.  The sum to be paid to the unit in 1988 will depend on the rate of progress made in bringing the unit into full operation.'</P>
    <P>It is intended that the number of employees necessary to enable the new unit to perform its functions will be drawn from the staff of An Foras Forbartha. The terms and conditions of these employees are being finalised and are the subject of discussions with the unions concerned.  The remaining employees of An Foras Forbartha will be dealt with under the voluntary redundancy arrangements or by redeployment to other fillable posts in the public sector.</P>
    <P>While I have not yet given any direction to the unit as to the keeping and auditing of its accounts and its finances generally.  I envisage that the standard arrangements applicable to bodies of this kind will apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has sought, with the approval of the House, to answer a lot of questions together when, understandably, there will be many supplementaries. I shall confine myself to asking three specific questions.  First, will the Minister give the House an assurance that the ongoing negotiations between the representatives of the staff of An Foras Forbartha, his officials and himself will not result in anybody currently working in An Foras Forbartha being obliged <Col N="2136" /> to be demoted or to enter an open competition for an analagous post in the new unit which they currently hold in An Foras Forbartha?  Second, will the Minister indicate &mdash; I do not think he did so in the course of his lengthy reply &mdash; whether the unit will continue to be based in St. Martin's House, Waterloo Road?  Third, can the Minister give an indication as to whether the public will continue to have access to the information of an environmental nature which in the past was produced by An Foras Forbartha but no doubt which will now be produced in a similar manner by the ERU?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very recently.  A fair interpretation of what transpired there is that we agreed on certain matters.  I hope the whole question concerning An Foras Forbartha and the new arrangements for the ERU will be resolved in the immediate future.  The question of a selection procedure was discussed in so far as the selection of those who would go into the new unit is concerned.  As I indicated to the staff representatives, I would like that selection procedure to be devised, if that is the right word, in consultation with them and I would like them to be happy with it.  I gave an undertaking that I would discuss it with them.</P>

That is what I would expect.  I sincerely hope that they will have access to the environmental information that will be required by outside bodies.  I am not saying that the ERU are not going to charge for their services.  I think there is some scope there.  In my discussions with the unions about the possibility of consultancy work, they were very forthcoming that there was great scope for making money by the officers for the expertise that will lie within the ERU. They would like to maximise that and, in fact, they will be proposing more expanded arrangements for making money that will be to the advantage of the ERU, the unions and to all concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister made reference to the voluntary redundancy scheme which is being offered to the staff of An Foras Forbartha but can he tell the House whether the discrepancy between <Col N="2138" /> the terms of that scheme and the other schemes offered to the public service generally has been addressed and whether that scheme has now been brought into line with the offers being made to the rest of the public service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Some have taken up the redundancy package &mdash; I think 21 &mdash; and so far as I can remember 25 others have indicated that they are interested in doing so.  There will be a need for redeployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked was totally different.  The Minister is probably aware that the terms of the scheme being offered to the people in An Foras Forbartha, because of the fact that they pay full PRSI, is substantially different and not as attractive as similar schemes offered to people in other public service type employment.  There is a need for this scheme to be amended to make it comparable with the wider public service scheme.  Can the Minister say if that question has been addressed and resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has been addressed. That question and the question about salary scales attached to individual members of An Foras Forbartha who will be transferred to the ERU, about the grades they are working at in the AFF and the changes that will be necessitated by their transfer to this new arrangement have been discussed with the unions.  So far as a settlement is concerned, I am very pleased, from what transpired at our last meeting, that we will have an arrangement with the unions that will be to everybody's satisfaction.  It was a very fruitful meeting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the areas are in need of renewal and offer good prospects for redevelopment.  Since the commencement of the scheme, a number of developments have taken place in the designated areas in Cork, though not on as large a scale as in some other centres. My Department and I are monitoring the progress of the scheme and will take whatever measures are possible to improve its effectiveness.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the taxation changes proposed in the budget including the reintroduction of section 23 type allowances and the changes in capital allowances which will leave the designated areas with a further advantage over other areas.  I have no information regarding the amount of employment <Col N="2140" /> created by the urban renewal scheme in Cork.</P>

The Minister referred to the headworks and he was correct in saying that grants have been approved for that but it is planned to have ten miles of water mains.

      <P>The number of meetings I have had with NATO indicates that I have restored them to the position of making a submission and consulting with my staff on an ongoing, regular basis on all matters related to rents.  In fact, they were pressing very hard for the tenant purchase scheme.  Mind you, I think I went a little further than even they had anticipated, but they were generous enough in recognising that.  They were also generous enough in recognising that they had been in close consultation with us about that tenant purchase scheme and all other matters they had wished to talk about.  We reached agreement with them on a huge number of the more non-controversial areas they wished to bring up and they had a large shopping list, as the Deputy knows.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 76 together.  I understand from local authorities that the work of the task forces set up to deal with water pollution is progressing satisfactorily and <Col N="2149" /> that a significant number of farms will be surveyed before the silage-making season commences.  It is for the local authorities to determine what remedial measures are required to deal with any sources of pollution identified in the reports on individual farms.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to make grants available to assist farmers to comply with the requirements of water pollution legislation.  However, brochures containing advice, guidelines and standards on the collection, storage and disposal of farm wastes are to be distributed to farmers.  In addition, ACOT are operating a new farm environment service to provide professional help for farmers in the effective managment of farm wastes and in the prevention of pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinPGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that we should all try to do something about water pollution particularly in view of what occurred last year and will he agree that advice alone will not sort out this problem?  Is the Minister aware of the difficulties that have been encountered by farmers, and certain industries, in trying to curtail pollution?  Will he accept that if he does not do something about providing financial assistance we will face the same problems this year that we faced last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of all the difficulties involved.  I must remark that the Deputy's attitude in the past year has been very supportive and that is appreciated. It is certainly more important to identify the sources and the culprits who are deliberately polluting &mdash; there are not that many of them &mdash; and I am happy to report that many of them when approached recognised the pollution they were causing and wanted to do something about the problem.  However, others do not care and we will have to pursue them the hard way and that is why I will be introducing an amendment to the 1977 water pollution Act before the House. That amendment will stiffen the penalities. However, the enforcement of the law on its own is not the real answer, there has to be an educational process <Col N="2150" /> which may be long and tedious.  The latter is having its effect.  The Department of Agriculture have been most supportive in regard to curbing pollution.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a grant available under the farm improvement programme to full-time farmers but that grant is only paid when suitable and adequate waste storage facilities are provided. Part-time farmers have a difficulty but I understand &mdash; I hope I am not out of order now &mdash; that considerable progress has been made in trying to get farm aid under the western package.  I expect we will get good news later today or tomorrow that will have a bearing on this problem.  The Deputy should accept that we are all conscious of what needs to be done.  It is our intention to carry out a dedicated campaign with the assistance of industrialists who have licences. I should like to tell the Deputy that every licence &mdash; there are about 1,600 of them &mdash; must be reviewed to check if industrial waste emissions are in accordance with the schedule attached to the licence.  Surveys are an integral part of the method of dealing with this problem and they are working very well in the majority of county councils.  It is gratifying to note that the suggestion put forward by the Deputy last year in regard to this has been taken on board.  There is a willingness to co-operate and I am pleased about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals are being discussed at EC level, particularly in regard to part-time farmers who do not have the capacity to deal with the problem.

The apathy that existed worldwide in <Col N="2151" /> regard to environmental matters has dissipated and all countries represented at the last meeting I attended indicated their willingness to do something about pollution, not just in so far as farm waste is concerned but air pollution and so on. There is a willingness to deal with the problem and I am pressing to get some funds from EC sources to help us out in the way the Deputy has suggested.  In my view we are making progress.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the whole question of social welfare it is clear from a variety of reports, official and unofficial, that the level of poverty in our society is appalling.  What is more appalling is the response of the Government in relation to that problem, particularly in regard to the Bill before us. Considering the unprecedented level of poverty the amount of the increases in social welfare are clearly inadequate.  The policy of increasing social welfare simply in line with inflation would only be acceptable if the existing basic levels of payments were themselves adequate to meet the needs of people.  It is clear that that is not so.  That has been recognised to be the case for a long time by many groups, including the Combat Poverty Agency and, more specifically, the Commission on Social Welfare.  That commission recommended that the basic income for an adult on social welfare should be about £60 in today's figures but with the increases proposed under the Bill, and the extra increases for the long-term unemployed, most people will be getting less than two-thirds of the payment recommended by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other worrying aspect of this problem is that quite a significant proportion of the increases being given under the Bill will be clawed back by local authorities from their tenants.  It is a fact of life that many of our citizens who exist on social welfare payments are also those who, because of the way in which local authority houses are allocated, are local authority tenants.  In the Dublin area rent <Col N="2220" /> increases of up to 10 per cent are being sought from local authority tenants.  On the one hand great play is being made of the fact that increases are being given under this Bill while on the other hand the local authorities, on the dictate of the Minister for the Environment, are clawing back those increases to a significant degree.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase further the amount of weekly earnings disregarded in calculating the rate of pay-related benefit is another attack on those unfortunate enough to have to claim social welfare. It is an attack on the whole pay-related concept.  The benefit of the pay-related system has been gradually eroded by the actions of successive Governments in the past few budgets.  As a result of the decision to increase from £62 to £66 the amount to be disregarded in calculating entitlement to pay-related benefit, the maximum figure payable will decrease for a person who had been earning over £200 per week from £19 to £18.24.  This change will substantially reduce the value of social welfare increases for many of those on pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>The Bill increases the ceiling for pay-related social insurance contributions to £16,200.  This means that there is now a massive gap between the ceiling for contributions at £16,200 and the ceiling for benefits which remains at £11,000. This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.  We have always argued that there should be no ceiling for contributions but that if there is to be a ceiling then the ceiling for benefits should be similar to that for contributions.  This was the situation until a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the pre-retirement allowance for the elderly long-term unemployed is welcome, but it needs <Col N="2221" /> some clarification in the Bill.  The Minister said in his speech that it is optional, but it is not clear from the Bill that this is the case and it would be quite unacceptable if people who reached that age had to apply compulsorily for that system.  There must be no attempt to write off the unemployed simply because they might have reached a certain age. People should be allowed to remain on the live register if they so wish and if they are still interested in seeking employment. It is to be hoped that this is not another attempt to put a gloss on the unemployment figures by artificially reducing the numbers on the live register. This is what happened in relation to the Jobsearch programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister spent almost half his speech going into detail about the PRSI contributions to be paid by the self-employed and farmers.  Regarding the contributions being sought, there seems to be an attempt to pull the wool over our eyes.  I made it clear in my contribution to the budget debate that by providing automatic pensions to people such as the self-employed and farmers we would be placing a greater burden on the PAYE sector who are already carrying almost 90 per cent of the tax burden.  I do not propose to go into detail again but I would ask the Minister when replying to take up this point.  The National Pensions Board reckoned that it would cost 16.6 per cent of income in pay in full for pensions to the self-employed and farmers. However, they reckoned it would be inequitable to put that kind of burden on that sector and that it would be fairer to apply a rate of 6.6 per cent to their income.  The Government have not done that, but even if they had done so they would still be paying something like 40 per cent of the cost of the pensions.  As I understand it, the PAYE worker pays 40 per cent of the cost of his pension, the employer pays about 30 per cent and the State pays a further 30 per cent.  In the case of the self-employed and farmers we are foregoing the 30 per cent employer's contribution and putting them on the same level as the employee.  To apply only a 3 per cent rate in the first year and <Col N="2222" /> then 4 per cent and 5 per cent seems to leave a greater burden on general taxation. The Minister might point out where my error is if I am wrong or indicate likewise if his own figures are wrong. The Bill clearly provides opportunities for farmers and self-employed people to reduce their liability for PRSI contributions by clever accounting, for example, by using the capital allowance loophole.  The Minister for Finance announced in his budget speech that from 6 April this year capital allowances will also be deductible in assessing the liability of farmers and the self-employed for health contributions and various levies. This is unacceptable and will provide further loopholes for those sectors who have a totally abysmal record in regard to the payment of health and other levies. PAYE workers are assessed on their gross income both for PRSI and levies and it is my contention that the same principle should be applied to farmers and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I have discovered by way of Parliamentary Question that there are 9,500 women and 3,100 men aged 25 and over who are signing for credits for unemployment assistance and are excluded from social employment schemes because they are not in receipt of actual money from the labour exchange.  The Minister may argue that this is the responsibility of the Department of Labour and I should welcome an indication as to where responsibility lies.  It seems to be discrimination against these people to have a condition applied to them which effectively precludes them from social employment schemes simply because they are living with a spouse who is working or living with a parent who has an income.  They are therefore means tested and do not receive unemployment assistance.  It is a double discrimination on the grounds that they are living at home and the family is adjudged to have an income and these people have means tests applied to them in order to get a job, even though it is only a temporary job under the social employment scheme. The Minister might refer to that point when replying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> I have also discovered by way of further Parliamentary Question that of males and females under 25 years of age there are 1,100 signing for credits who are not in receipt of any money.  Again, these are people who, presumably, are living at home and because their parents or spouse have been assessed as working they are adjudged to have means.  Any person who is unemployed and who is known and has proved himself to be available for work should be entitled to a basic minimum income and some amount of money in order to exist.  It is not reasonable to expect them to live off their spouse or parents.  There is an obligation on the State to ensure they have a basic income.</P>
    <P>I tried to get information on the number of people who were signing on for unemployment assistance and who were getting very little money, say £5 or £10 a week and I was told that the records did not show that kind of information.  I have a vague recollection of getting similar information a couple of years ago but I have not yet been able to go through my files to dig that reply out.  I would be grateful if the Minister could give us any information in relation to the number of people who are signing on and getting a mere pittance, in many cases only getting enough to pay the bus fare for a trip in and out to the labour exchange.  That fact is largely ignored by many people when they talk about dole spongers, those who are getting as much money on the dole as they would if they went out to work.</P>
    <P>There are between 13,000 and 14,000 people who are signing on validly looking and available for work who are not getting a single penny.  Presumably it is costing them money to get to the labour exchange each week in order to sign on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 9,500 women and 3,100 men over 25 years of age not getting a penny and there are 1,100 men and women under 25 years of age who are also not getting a penny even <Col N="2224" /> though they sign on every week for at least one year to indicate that they are unemployed and have proved they are looking for work.  They are not getting a penny from the State and, in fact, as I have said, they are forking out money to get to the labour exchange in order to sign on and maintain their record of credits. That is poverty which many people are not aware of and which many people ignore when they get on their high horse about abuse.  What we see here is a reversal of abuse in that these people are being abused by the system.</P>
      <P>The next point which I want to make is in relation to the prescribed relative allowance.  It is extraordinary that an old age pensioner can be paid an extra £26 a week if a relative stays at home to look after them because they are incapacitated in some way or another.  It is not that the old age pensioner should not be getting some money but I feel the individual involved, and again it is women who are involved, has virtually no rights under the social welfare code.  These people are carrying out a service which, if the State were to provide it, would cost it a fortune. It would cost the State hundreds of pounds a week to maintain an elderly man or woman in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there is pressure on the health boards to move towards community care and the budgets of the health boards and the health services are being cut back left, right and centre.  We are told that the reason they are being cut back is that this much money is not needed because we are decanting &mdash; to use that horrible word &mdash; our psychiatrically ill and our elderly into the community for community care.  However, community care usually consists of a female relative looking after their old mother or father, uncle or aunt, psychiatrically ill or handicapped brother or sister or son or daughter.  It does not make sense to have a woman who is prepared to give up any possibility of having a job outside of the home, who is prepared to spend the best part of her life looking after an elderly person and yet this measly £26 a week is not given to her but to the pensioner.  I have come <Col N="2225" /> across the odd case where the unfortunate woman doing the caring did not get any part of that £26.  Apart from that, it is pennywise and pound foolish not to improve the prescribed relative allowance and make it payable to the person who is doing the caring.  It needs to be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go on any further in relation to this Bill.  There are a number of amendments which I will be putting forward on Committee Stage.  I do not believe the Bill is adequate.  It does not deal adequately with poverty in our society, a topic on which I spoke at length during the debate on the budget. I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;congratulate the Minister on a job well done in introducing this legislation.  I am a Member of this House for only 12 months and in the past three or four months I have seen the Minister introduce two major social welfare Bills.  Between them they incorporate 50 pieces of legislation, many of which we ignored in the past.  The excuse which was used was that they were quite complicated but this Minister has been able to deal with them.  There has never been a more active Minister that I am aware of in this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is of critical importance, and not just because of the financial implications.  Everybody is now aware that the bill for social welfare exceeds £2.6 billion each year but despite the huge demands which are at present on resources the Government intend to honour that commitment, to look for social equity and to protect the less well off.  What is of equal importance is that each of the over one million people receiving these payments will be affected in some way by this legislation.  That is a <Col N="2226" /> fact which we might consider more often when discussing finances.</P>
    <P>Following many meetings with the Minister on various issues I know that his first consideration at all times is how legislation will affect the least well off.  In this Bill he has targeted a number of specific objectives which deserve mention. First of all, he is pursuing in a very positive way the goal of the national plan, which is to give the most benefit to the least well off.  This national plan idea has been floating around for the past 14 or 15 years.  During that time various people have held ministries and they are now experts on the subject but in the interim period they did nothing to bring the plan to fruition.</P>

      <P>Section IV of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> commits the Government to maintain the overall value of social welfare benefits and within the resources available to consider special provision for greater increases for those receiving the lowest payments.</P>
      <P>I welcome sections 3 and 4 of this Bill. The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that a minimum payment of £50 a week would be required for a single person to live.  The measures introduced in the budget and confirmed in this Bill show the Government's determination to achieve that target.  In the 12 months since coming to office the Government have brought the unemployment assistance rate in urban areas up to £42.  This is indicative of the Government's commitment to the less well off sections.  Like other people, I could offer simplistic proposals to improve things further.  There will always be room for improvement but improvements must be paid for.  The Minister must avoid the trend evident from 1983 to 1987 which doubled the national debt.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Deputy Mitchell was a Minister in that Government. One of the criticisms expressed about the social welfare system generally and which was touched on by Deputy De Rossa is that there is no incentive to work. People have a false idea that one is better off on unemployment benefit than at work.  The provision in section 5 of this Bill will once and for all nail that lie.  A married man with five children on the rural rate of unemployment assistance will get a maximum rate of £90.20 a week.  The new arrangements in the Bill mean that a married man in a similar situation earning £150 a week can now claim £25 a week family income supplement, bringing his income to £175.  That is a reward for working.  Not too many people are aware of this measure.  We should continuously make efforts to make it more attractive to people to work, so we should highlight this measure.</P>
      <P>We must also preserve the dignity of the individual dependent on social welfare. The major thrust of this Bill is contained in Part 3 where provision is made in sections 11 to 17 to extend the social insurance scheme to the self-employed with effect from 6 April 1988.  As far as I can recall Deputy Mitchell was the first to be very negative about this proposal. Again this morning Deputy Mitchell was worried about the highest rate of unemployment in Europe and so on.  At the end of the Deputy's contribution I can well understand why the public are cynical about politicians.  They see a brass neck &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I feel sorry for all the people who are unemployed.  From Deputy Mitchell's speech it seems that unemployment only started in his area since last February &mdash; I am sure he looked after them properly up to that &mdash; but that is not the public perception of it.  I would not normally attack anybody but if the Deputy wants to harass me I will match him every inch of the way.</P>
      <P>It is incredible to hear the opposite sides of the problem that the Deputy is trotting out, having failed to do anything for four and a half years.  An aspect being highlighted by the same Deputy and being flogged by the media relates to budgeting loans.  I heard this proposition again this morning from the Deputy and it sounded like a very intelligent original idea except that probably like himself I happen to have the document from the DHSS.  This is a British idea which was put out to save money in the social welfare area.  That is not what I want to do. I praise the credit unions which make good moneylenders and I would encourage people to use them.  Gimmicks such as the one proposed by Deputy Mitchell will not alleviate the problems.  It is not an original Mitchell idea, it is a Margaret Thatcher idea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of a social insurance system for the self-employed up to now was crazy and in contrast with other European countries.  Those who are less well off in the farming and the self-employed community have to rely on various social assistance schemes.  The cost of that has been met out of taxation.  The <Col N="2229" /> estimated cost for this in 1987 is £323 million.  The extension of the PRSI system to the self-employed and to farmers will not alone give them better entitlements as a right but will redress the balance in the funding arrangement and will lead to greater equity and social justice. Anybody commenting on the cost must take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>In relation to non-contributory old age pensions, it is important to point out that we have an increasing old population and in terms of community care it is important that these people should be able to live in dignity in their own homes for as long as possible.  It is humiliating for anybody with a genuine interest in old people to be involved in means testing committees. Some people might glory in it, but it is humiliating for a person who has worked for most of his life to have to go parading before politicians and social workers to be means tested.  That is not what we want and we should work to get rid of this system.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board reported their findings to the Government and they calculated that the appropriate rate of contribution is 4.5 per cent.  I accept that but the imposition of a 5 per cent rate which the Government feels is necessary would be harsh if it were done in just one effort.  It is indicative of the care and commitment of the Government to do this in three stages.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months the Government have been accused of refusing to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is appropriate to point out that it was the Commission on Social Welfare who recommended that the self employed be included in the national pensions plan. Indeed, as far back as 1976 a Green Paper on the proposals was published.  Since then people have hedged and it has taken this Minister to come to grips with the problem.  All members of the workforce and their dependants, on retirement, should have an income sufficient to enable them to have a standard of living that is consistent with their existing standard of living.  There has been talk of a White Paper.  I am sure that was mooted <Col N="2230" /> during the period of the last Government but for ideological reasons or whatever it got bogged down, but that is not my business.  I am dealing with the present situation.  The 1978 Green Paper asserted that the self employed should be covered by social insurance.  Proposals for reforming the system have suggested that the social insurance system should be made as comprehensive as possible.  To this end the self-employed should be brought within the social welfare system as has been recommended in every statement and report of the commission.  We will be meeting one of the deficiencies in the pension system if we go ahead with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Since 1978 successive Governments and Ministers for Social Welfare have failed continually to do what this Government and Minister have decided now to do.  The Green Paper identified the flat rate, low level of pensions as constituting a shortcoming in the system and consequently made a case for a pension which had a close relationship with the standard of living to which individuals had become accustomed.  During past months the pension provisions of the social welfare system had become the focus of attention in the debate on earnings-related pensions. This debate will go on because the amount of money involved in pensions and pension funds is astronomical and deserves long discussion and examination.</P>
    <P>All the proposals are concerned with achieving a minimum adequate maintenance income for all categories of people.  In the review of the current provisions we argue that adequacy in relation to need is the essential criterion.  In this context we see the provision of basic payments as a priority.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill for extended cover will bring about many changes.  I would like to make a few points in relation to the scheme.  The extension of the scheme will mean a wider range of contributions to the social insurance fund within the scheme.  A move must be made towards implementing the tax report recommendations to broaden the contribution base.  A figure of 230,000 extra <Col N="2231" /> people will be brought into the scheme. I emphasised earlier in regard to the elderly that there will be no means test for pensions in future.  Many people have met with hardship because of the death of the breadwinner and various matters, when insurance was not taken out.  That is something we cannot tolerate.  We must ensure that everybody is covered, and that leads me to the next point.  A lobby is building up for opting out of the scheme.  I want to refer again to the figure of £330 million plus which is being paid out at present to those who opted out or were not included in other schemes, and £254 million of that was paid to the self-employed. I am not accepting that and I hope other parties are not accepting it or asking that we condone it.  Taking good and bad risks together is a basic principle of insurance policies.  Taking the mean is standard practice.</P>
    <P>Who is going to opt out?  Is it people in this House?  Is it their friends who in some cases may be earning over £100,000 a year?  Some of these people are totally out of touch with reality.  Now we have the media baffled.  Last week in a survey some Members were asked what their salaries were.  A Member said to me that in some cases the salaries of these people would be nothing more than pocket money.  It is totally unreal in the light of that survey to talk about these people opting out.  A million PAYE people are involved in social welfare, paying contributions, and they were not asked if they wanted to opt out nor were they allowed to opt out.</P>
    <P>The method of collection was discussed this morning and one of the scandals revealed was that £9 million is owed on the health levy.  Of the 230,000 people concerned, 74,000 were paying the health levy and that leaves 156,000 owing £9 million.  Obviously, many of those people are farmers and self employed, respectable, decent people paying what is owed. A small group owe £9 million and that cannot be tolerated.  With the extension of the insurance cover all these outstanding debts should be collected at the one stage.  For example, it is ludicrous <Col N="2232" /> that the Revenue Commissioners can take a court action against somebody for debts owed to the State on income tax and do nothing about the health levy and leave it to the health boards or the Department to take that kind of action with all the costs involved.</P>
    <P>The costs were discussed this morning, and most of us know the costs over the years.  A basic mistake was made by some outside economist who got television time and it seems everybody else has jumped on that bandwagon.  We will not go through the figures at this stage but they are freely available.  The estimated figure is £360 million surplus in the short term.  The Government insist that there will be a net gain over 50 years, and the commission are in agreement with that. When they gave 4.5 per cent as the break even figure £15,500 was the ceiling.  That ceiling is now £16,200 and the contribution is 5 per cent.  Do we tell them they have got it all wrong?  Nobody is disputing the possibility of extra costs but it is hoped they will not arise.  The figures given by the Minister and the pension boards indicated that there will be no loss.  Even allowing for annual overruns we must consider the present cost.  We cannot just keep on paying £330 million with no income.  This morning Deputy Wyse was worried about the time we have had to read this Bill.  I am less experienced than most in this matter but I have done the best I could.  I appreciate he is his party's spokesman and he is usually fair in his contributions, unlike some people.  He had his doubts in certain areas, but I hope the Minister at the end will have convinced Deputy Wyse and others that this is a good scheme which will be implemented.</P>
    <P>Some former Ministers have dodged the issue.  Deputy Mitchell's only contribution was to stifle the proposal last year even before the details were available, and that is in the record.  Was it because his own people had fudged the issue and he had not the decency to acknowledge the great input, commitment and motivation of this Minister? In years to come the people involved and <Col N="2233" /> their families will know who did the work for them.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that the Department will in future absorb the costs of contributions of unemployment assistance which the local authority paid up to now.  As a long term member of a local authority, I know this is a hardy annual and we have appealed to Minister after Minister about it.  The amount of money was not massive but an anomaly existed here.  Again this Minister has responded in a positive fashion here.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides for <i>pro rata</i> pensions. Everybody who has canvassed at the doors has met some unfortunate person caught up in a problem.  The anomaly there was in the reduced rate of pensions for the people involved in the previous insurance system who came back into the scheme after 1 April 1974. This should have been addressed years ago.  I am amazed that previous Ministers ignored it and again I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative here despite talk about shortage of cash and so on.  The Minister has shown the same care and consistency in relation to the alleviating payments dealt with in previous legislation and he was willing to go to Cabinet to look for the extra money. The previous Government decided that this would be stopped last year.  The Minister felt that the people would be as badly off last December as they had been the previous December and he got the money to keep that scheme in operation.  I welcome that and I ask him to keep it under consideration.</P>
    <P>One major fault is delays in payment of social welfare.  I was Chairman of the Southern Health Board in a year when we paid over £2 million because of the need for supplementary welfare, and 55 per cent of the cost was caused by delays in paying legitimate claims.  The people concerned had to get supplementary welfare. They got their claim eventually after the usual trafficking up and down to Dublin and back to Cork.  That was a big waste of money and it was degrading for these people.  The delay was caused by the old fashioned system and nobody was willing to say that we must spend money <Col N="2234" /> to give these people the service they deserved until Dr. Woods became Minister.</P>
    <P>Computerisation was the answer.  My colleague in Cork North Central, Deputy Dan Wallace, pressed for years for improvements in the processing of claims and was one of the first to call for decentralisation of the system.  Now the Minister is forging ahead with the installation of this computerisation and has almost eliminated the crazy situation in Cork whereby thousands of medical certificates were being sent to Dublin every week, referred back, lost, mislaid or whatever, leading to delays for people who are entitled to better.  The Minister intends to have one of these links installed per month in each town.  This is tremendous and will free people in the Department to provide a proper advice and information service.</P>
    <P>There are a few other issues that need to be examined and I would ask the Minister to place them on the agenda for future discussion and action.  In regard to the appeals system against refusal of claims, there is a need for more elaboration on why claims are refused, and delays should be eliminated.  I know the Minister is working on this and has made rapid progress but he should keep at it until we have a situation where cases are being dealt with on the day of the claim.</P>
    <P>There is no child benefit for children over 18 years who are in full time education and they would not normally have any other income or social welfare benefit. Education grants may be available but there is hardship in many cases.  While I would not propose anything that we could not pay for at the moment I would ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>Another question that needs to be looked at is the position of widowers and widows, particularly those with young families.  Last year the Minister gave a once-off grant to the Widows Association of Ireland to do a survey on some of the needs and requirements with a view to constructing a programme to help people in this situation.  That was a good move and was to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The question of children's allowance is <Col N="2235" /> being kicked around at the moment.  The question of taxing these allowances or of paying them only to people under a certain income level has been a topic of discussion over the past few years and it would be no harm to say a few words on it.  It is worth remembering that in some cases the amount of income making its way to the housewife, who must provide the necessities of life, may be very small despite the income into the home.  The husband's income may be large but in many cases the children's allowance is the means of keeping the home going. This whole question needs serious consideration and should not be trotted out as a political gimmick by the better off politicians as happened in the past, with politicians appearing on the media waving their arms and saying they do not need children's allowance.  I would say that whatever town or village or city they are in, there is a local charitable organisation and if they feel any twinges of conscience they could either donate these allowances to those organisations or return them to the Minister to be reallocated to somebody less well off.  Let us look at the question seriously.  There will be administrative problems but the question should be debated though not in the fashion in which it has been debated in recent times.</P>
    <P>There is £12 million paid to people with incomes of over £25,000 a year but it is too simplistic to suggest that we should not give these people any child benefit. This is an important topic and deserves better.</P>
    <P>To bring the Bill into context, we need to deal with the departmental expenditure under three headings: £1,200 million on social assistance, £1,300 million on social insurance, £27 million on occupational injuries and £106 million on administration.  That is where our £2.6 billion goes, and that is a lot of money. This must be spread as far as possible. The scheme that the Minister is suggesting for the extension of employment insurance would help that.  At the <Col N="2236" /> moment employers pay almost £700 million a year and employees pay £300 million but the Exchequer is still picking up the tab for £1,600 million and this cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The Bill not alone improves the situation for social welfare recipients but has also moved on the national pension plan and has removed many longstanding anomalies.  It is perfectly consistent with the Government's understanding of the reality that is facing the country and I support the Minister totally in recommending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the debate Deputy Wyse was inadvertently deprived of 10 or 11 minutes of his time.  Accordingly, I am appealing to the understanding and the sense of justice of the House, especially those Members present, that the House should correct that now by allowing me to call on Deputy Wyse before I call the next speaker from the Opposition who will be Deputy Paul Connaughton.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I knew a mistake was made this morning but I did not wish to challenge the Chair at the time.  I appreciate the opportunity the Deputies are now giving me to conclude my statement of this morning.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House the amount of money currently outstanding because of tax evasion by the farming community and the self employed?  When I asked this this morning I was accused by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, of being anti-farmer.  I was trying to be as practical as possible because we have to face reality where moneys due to the State are concerned.  I am not anti-farmer or anti-self employed.  I am quite the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House the number of people he expects to partake in this pension scheme and the procedures to be put in place in regard to those who fail to contribute?  It appears to me that the courts and the sheriffs' office are saturated with outstanding tax liabilities in regard to the very same people that the Minister now proposes to <Col N="2237" /> include in this scheme.  Social welfare and pension provisions should be about equity and justice.  This measure is a measure of social and fiscal responsibility. In introducing a Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill in this House as far back as 1961, the late Mr. Seán McEntee, as Minister for Social Welfare, said that the self-employed were excluded from the scheme because it was considered that the administrative difficulties experienced by their inclusion in similar schemes elsewhere were probably insuperable except at inordinate cost. The same applies today.</P>

      <P>Maybe his words will be tested in the next two years.  It was always my ambition to see a national pension plan in place.  I thought about using insurance companies and existing pension plans in an effort to have the self-employed and farmers provide for themselves and thus not be a burden on the non-contributory schemes which the State operates.  I sincerely ask the Minister again to withdraw this part of the Bill in its entirety and I ask his Department, in conjunction with the private insurance companies, to come back to this House with a scheme based on equity and justice which would be self-financing.  I have no doubt that we had ideas of that kind some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would certainly support sections 19 and 20 which provide for changes in the provisions relating to proceedings and the taking of prosecutions under the Act.  I have in the past, and will continue to do so in the future, support any measures which would help to eliminate abuse in the social welfare system.  Until such time as abuse is weeded out of the system we <Col N="2238" /> cannot go on to tackle the real problem of poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn my attention to section 28 of the Bill which provides for the introduction of a new scheme of pre-retirement allowances for the long term unemployed person who is 60 years of age or over and who has, effectively, retired from the labour force.  While I accept that these proposals will free some staff in our employment offices throughout the country, and while I believe it is more dignified to have an allowance paid in book form at a post office or sub-post office, it is an indictment on the Government that it is assumed that unemployed people at the age of 60 are on the scrap heap, that it is a sad admission of failure that one has no job and will not have one before reaching 66 years of age.  I have my suspicions that this could be a sinister attempt to substantially reduce the numbers on the live register.  I would like the Minister to tell me exactly how many people will be affected by these measures, and it is important that we have the exact number.  Furthermore, it is a recognised fact that Ireland has an ageing population, more than any other country in Europe, and that more and more people in the next couple of years will be moving into the 60s age group.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reply to the questions I am putting to him today.  Can he tell the House if those on the pre-retirement allowance scheme will remain part and parcel of the live register for statistical purposes in order to reflect at all times a true position in relation to the number of people out of work?  I welcome the extension of occupational injury benefit to AnCO and CERT trainees.  I welcome section 31 which makes provision for the transfer of information between the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and also for similar transfers between Departments and various State bodies for the purpose of proper administration of social welfare schemes and schemes administered by other agencies.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat a question I put down to the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="2239" /> MacSharry as far back as Tuesday, 12 May 1987.  I asked him then the amount of money that was due.  In the second last paragraph of his reply he stated:</P>
    <P>The total amount now outstanding from farmers and collectable by the Revenue Commissioners is £9.7 million. This figure is no more than an estimate and on the basis of previous experience the amount will be subject to downward revision on closer examination, on appeal, and for various other reasons, and the figure will change accordingly.  The actual amount which is likely to be collected out of the £9.7 million is £2 million.</P>
    <P>It is worth thinking about this.  I hope the Minister will give us more information about the whole procedure of collection. I am not one to come into this House and try to downgrade any effort made by any Minister of any Government but I believe we are doing something we will regret. We are doing an injustice to the people who are really deserving of social welfare benefits.  I am fully convinced of that but if I am proved wrong I will be the first to stand up in this House and say to the Minister, I apologise; I was wrong.  I have studied this pension plan down through the years.  Everybody should contribute to social welfare because everybody benefits from it at the end of the day.  I am somewhat disappointed with what the Minister is doing.  I must assume it is a move to eventually bringing in a national pension plan.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to put on record that the Progressive Democrats are concerned for all and particularly for those in receipt of social welfare payments. They are committed to increasing these payments by effecting savings through the elimination of fraud and wasteful practices and by redirecting payments to the most needy.  I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to complete my speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The most controversial part of this Social Welfare Bill is undoubtedly the decision to bring the <Col N="2240" /> self-employed into the PRSI system.  My immediate reaction to the development was, spare us from more Government involvement in our lives.  There is no doubt we are going to have more Government involvement, an all-embracing State involvement in our daily lives.  We are certainly going to have more State involvement financially which I will prove in a few moments.</P>
      <P>Having listened to many of the speakers today, it is an entirely legitimate argument for the 800,000 PAYE workers to moan and complain about the disastrous high levels of PRSI and income tax they have to endure and it is equally legitimate for them to expect that the 240,000 self-employed be &ldquo;penalised&rdquo; just as they are. The facts are entirely different.  Even for the PAYE sector who pay crippling PRSI payments, the State will have to bail out the pensions by a subvention of over 40 per cent of the total moneys collected, even under the heading of PRSI.  That is a feature of pension schemes not alone here but in every other democracy also. What will the State indebtedness be in respect of such a retirement pension scheme when another 230,000 or 240,000 participants appear in the system in ten years' time?  That is the central question. Instead of this Social Welfare Bill benefiting the Exchequer, there will be an enormous and an alarming drain on our resources in ten years' time and onwards. There will be a smaller drain on the resources in three years' time when the widows' and orphans' pensions become payable.  After ten years that will constitute an enormous drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me address the core problem in relation to the subject matter before us &mdash; how to get self-employed persons to organise their retirement affairs without imposing a huge cost on the Exchequer. Most speakers referred to that matter but it appeared they side-stepped the issue to some extent.  Of their very nature self-employed persons, through their enterprise and commitment, must take big risks, of that there is no doubt.  They make a huge investment of their time, energy, finance and expertise.  Of course, some self-employed people make real <Col N="2241" /> money.  The types of people who spring immediately to mind are Ryanair, Smurfit, Ben Dunne, those type of people who make real money whereas the vast majority of the self-employed in the industrial and services areas are merely ticking over.</P>
    <P>It appears that every conceivable hurdle is placed in their way, from difficulties in relation to planning permission, VAT, crippling bank interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates, labour problems to security &mdash; the list is endless for those people, it is like the Litany of the Saints.  The imposition of PRSI contributions on top of all of those can mean the straw that broke the camel's back, which cannot be far off for many. If, as a nation, we accept that personal motivation is manifested through hard work, high risk-taking, high levels of expertise, the qualities which will lead eventually to real jobs being created &mdash; not Jobsearch jobs but real ones &mdash; surely we should not paralyse the very people who might just provide those jobs.  It is important that we should give that category a chance to show their mettle.  Why did the Government not adopt the sensible approach, allowing the self-employed the facility to look after their retirement without any State involvement whatsoever?  This is possible.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the imposition of PRSI contributions on the farming community. I get the whiff of a scheme with an in-built pre-determined yield factor whereby, irrespective of whether there is income sufficient to meet this charge, it will be collected.  I view the flat-rate of PRSI contributions levied on small farmers as totally obnoxious.  There is no reference whatever to ability to pay, something the Minister and his other Cabinet colleagues went to great lengths to point out in the course of the farm taxation discussions over the past couple of years.  At that time the central principle advocated was that any such charge must be based on ability to pay.</P>
    <P>When the present Government assumed office they abolished the proposals for the imposition of a land tax, deciding that people should pay on the <Col N="2242" /> basis of accounts to be prepared to prove their ability to pay or otherwise.  I ask: why is not that central principle being deployed in regard to the flat-rate contribution particularly as it pertains to the farming community?  It appears there is no concern for the poor financial standing of many thousands of small farmers.  I am sufficiently experienced to know that there is a big difference between them and their larger counterparts.  In so saying I am not trying to side-step the argument that taxes should be paid, that health contributions should be paid and I shall revert to them later.</P>
    <P>If one takes a recent statistic of the Agricultural Institute, they were able to show independently of the Government, the Opposition, indeed of the farming organisations themselves, that almost 50 per cent of farmers' incomes amounted to between £2,500 and £3,000 the year before last.  That represents approximately £50 a week.  I understand there are approximately 14,000 farmers drawing the dole &mdash; farmers just beyond eligibility for small farmer's assistance &mdash; who I understand will be exempt.  However, I estimate that there are at least another 25,000 farmers of the type about whom I speak, who have no other income, who are certainly not in the large farmer category and yet are not eligible to draw the dole.  It appears that very soon they will receive a demand for £208 per annum. I can guarantee that that demand will amount to £208 for the first year only.  I have every reason to believe that that amount will be increased as time goes by. Some people might say in a somewhat flippant fashion: what is £208?  To a person independently assessed as earning less than £50 a week, who because of mik quotas, and so on, is not allowed to expand even if he was able to &mdash; that £208 constitutes a fair imposition.</P>
    <P>If I have read the provisions of the Bill correctly I understand there is also a certain category of farmer whose enterprise has not yet been brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners, who have not completed farm profile forms for submission to the Revenue Commissioners who, incidentally, have <Col N="2243" /> not the staff to process such applications. I understand they remain in a heap in the office of the Revenue Commissioners.  I notice a hazy mention in the Bill that the vast majority of small farmers below that latter category will be subjected to the attitude: well, if we know they are eligible, as such, we will charge them £104 annually.  I happen to represent an area with a predominence of that category of farmer.  The only way one will ever ascertain exactly the family income of any particular farmer is by way of prepared accounts.  Therefore, I must conclude that what this Government and the Department of Social Welfare are now attempting to do is to bring every farmer within the tax net.  They know in their hearts and souls that there is a certain percentage of farmers only with taxable incomes.  I am not making a case, nor could anybody in all equity in their favour.</P>
    <P>Are we now moving in the direction in which the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance &mdash; in order to prove that that bottom category of 25,000 farmers is eligible or ineligible and in order to get this Bill from the Department of Social Welfare towards the cost of their retirement pension &mdash; might cause them to expend as much as £500 or £600 on a group of accountants, appeals, inspectors and so on.  I want to put on the record that this constitutes a most dangerous development.  It should be remembered that these people represent a more numerous category than any other self-employed category at present.  I cannot understand why people are not much more concerned about it.  Equally I believe they will become concerned, and very quickly.  There is no other system the Department of Social Welfare can legitimately bring into being which will prove conclusively that they should be exempt from PRSI contributions.  The only way that can be done in farming is on a flat rate &mdash; which is what is proposed &mdash; or by asking people to declare their <Col N="2244" /> incomes.  The only way that can be established is through the production of prepared accounts to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Whatever has been the growth of the accountancy profession to date &mdash; and there has been considerable growth because of their involvement in all aspects of our lives nowadays which appear to rotate around accountants of one type or another &mdash; it is my belief that they are in for a bonanza.  As we say in my part of the country, they will have the time of Reilly in their involvement with this scheme.</P>
    <P>I worry enormously about this proposed flat rate contribution, leaving aside altogether ability to pay or otherwise.  It is my belief that we are now constructing a platform which can easily be boarded by any Minister for Finance once the system is established.  If it happens that figures are tight before a particular budget, you can wheel this model out as easily as you like and slap another few quid on to it.  Once this model is put in place it is something that will be wheeled out very often in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Let us stick to the small farm category for the moment.  They are not often talked about on the Floor of this House and I believe that that category of people deserve better than that.  Every family are subjected to financial constraints, irrespective of where they live or who they are.  Many small farmers have loans, are under stocked or work on poor land but they also have the financial burdens that families everywhere have, burdens such as health, education and clothing. Their costs are much the same but the problem is that their earning capacity is not great and will not be great.  I was in the company of some 200 farmers in a part of my constituency the other night. The only reason they had come together in that one place was to talk of the problem whereby they have to pour their milk down the drain because of the super-levy. It would be very difficult to get them excited about a new Bill or about a demand that was likely to come through their door for a contribution towards <Col N="2245" /> retirement pensions at a time when things are going so badly for them.  I believe that what the majority of that category of farmer wants is leadership which will point the way to methods that will improve their income as opposed to penalising them as this Bill will obviously do.</P>
    <P>Larger farmers will pay more PRSI in relative terms for the same income than PAYE workers will pay and for a much reduced and curtailed benefit scheme.  It is a major omission that invalidity and disability pensions are not to be part of this scheme.  Even though I am completely against the concept of the Bill for the reasons I have mentioned, I welcome one part of it.  I welcome the fact that widows and orphans pensions will be paid after three years contributions.  This is something which was very badly needed. As Deputy Wyse said, sufficient attention has not been paid to the question of getting the self employed to fund their own pension schemes so that the Government and the State can be kept out of it altogether. That is no place for them when one considers the huge financial loss that most economic commentators tell us will develop in this scheme after year ten.</P>
    <P>I am a bit cynical about why the scheme was brought in at this time.  Various assessments have been done on what the income from this scheme will be after a year or so.  These assessments vary from between £25 million to £50 million.  I do not have the figures at my disposal so I do not know which is right but if one were to do a quick sum it would certainly appear that between £35 million and £40 million will come from the self-employed by way of contributions through the PRSI system.  If we assume that that money keeps coming in and increases every year obviously in the short term it will be a nice financial boost for the Government.  The widows and orphans pensions will, numerically speaking, be very small.  Therefore, there will be no great drain in the system for ten years. One can imagine the amount of money &mdash; and I have to call it &ldquo;funny&rdquo; money at this stage &mdash; that will be in circulation for some other purpose.  I should like <Col N="2246" /> to know how the fund managers in the Department propose to invest that money.  What will be done with it for ten years, what return are we likely to get from it, how will the fund be managed or will it go into general taxation?  Many people want to know the answers to those questions.</P>
    <P>I am cynical about this scheme because I believe that when the sums were being done for the budget, because of an agreement reached to placate the unions, when the national plan was being hammered out, the attitude was, screw the self-employed irrespective of whether it is good for the economy.  In other words a deal has to be done at all costs.  I contend that this PRSI on the self-employed, bearing in mind the reasons I have given to the House about why I am opposed to it, is not really a pension fund at all that it is direct tax.  Because many of the self employed outside of the farming area altogether who are trying to create jobs for themselves and for others are beset by a multiplicity of problems already, this is something some of them at least could well do without.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention.  We have had a concept for 100 years or more about our social welfare code, the concept that there would always be a fund available for people when they got old, a fund that would be there by right.  People, especially those at the lower end of the scale, expect after giving a lifetime to whatever area of activity they have worked in to get a pension when they retire.  Many people can well afford to pay for their pensions and do not care if there was never a State pension scheme.  Such people should be allowed to pay for their pensions but they should never have access to State funding for this purpose.  However, there are many others who, for one reason or another, never aspire to having a good income in their life, many through no fault of their own.  Their understanding of the non-contributory pension is that if they spent their years toiling, rearing their families and doing all the things <Col N="2247" /> families should do, that system of non-contributory pension should be there for them.</P>
    <P>I am beginning to understand that what the Government are at is that these will be the last ten years of non-contributory pension for anybody.  In our efforts to reduce the £330 million drain on the Exchequer, which I acknowledge is very high and which funds the non-contributory area, I hope that as a country and a Parliament we will never lose sight of the fact that there are certain people who will always have to get non-contributory old age pensions.  I do not want to see the day when some social welfare office will say: &ldquo;I am terribly sorry but because you did not join this Government scheme you are not entitled to anything and because you did not contribute you are not going to get a pension.&rdquo; I hope that neither the Minister nor anybody else in the Department of Social Welfare will bring it that far.  If there was a very imaginative scheme whereby the pressure would be put on the self-employed who are able to pay to organise their own retirement schemes I would fully accept that if they did not do so they should not be a drain on the State afterwards.  I want to point out clearly the difference between those who have had a reasonable income during their working lives and those who for one reason or another cannot make ends meet.</P>
    <P>A few unusual things are going to happen concerning property owners when this scheme comes in, if it does.  In rural Ireland, at least, when the head of the household, the father or mother, becomes a pensioner it is normal practice to transfer the farm to the son or daughter, for two reasons.  One is to allow the older generation to become eligible for the pension and the second is that the time has come to hand over to the younger generation.  As somebody who has been very closely involved with the whole question of inheritance over the last four or five years, I take particular pride in the fact that the Government of which I was a member brought in the stamp duty exemption.  We had courses organised all <Col N="2248" /> over the country.  It proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that if the incentives were right land would be transferred at least five to seven years sooner than would be normally expected.  From the point of view of our being an agricultural country, that is of benefit.</P>
    <P>There will be a unique situation now in that there will be no pressure whatsoever on fathers or mothers to transfer the land because they will have the contributory old age pension.  I can see many problems arising in that land will not transfer until the old farmer is called to his or her eternal reward.  That creates a huge problem for young people coming into agriculture.  I ask the Minister to look at that part of the legislation because it will create a great amount of trouble. Some people asked me if I was advocating a system, in times of great financial stringency, whereby people would divest themselves of a great deal of property and at the same time claim non-contributory old age pensions.  I am not doing that.  It is time that as a Government and a Parliament we addressed that matter. Of course, there are people who divested themselves of their property and were able to claim that they were entitled to the non-contributory old age pension.  The area of inheritance should be tied up in such a way that people will have to get rid of their property perhaps seven years before they can claim a pension.  If they have paid into a private pension fund they will not have to be looked after with a non-contributory pension.  When one puts the argument together, we are going down the wrong road with regard to the PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters to which I would like to address myself.  I notice, from reading the list of exemptions contained in the Bill, that it has been decided to exempt widows and deserted wives who are recipients of deserted wife's allowances.  I welcome that.  It is very important because there is a great trauma involved with such categories of people. There is great psychological pressure on them and it ill behoves us to ask that category of person to contribute to the retirement pension scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2249" /> The family income supplement is another aspect that should be given greater attention.  I have a bee in my bonnet about the prescribed relative's allowance.  I notice, particularly in rural Ireland, that the prescribed relative's allowance is paid to the pensioner, not to the relative.  There must be a new riding instruction from the Department of Social Welfare because I see many such allowances being withdrawn on the basis that the prescribed relative is not available to look after the pensioner.  If you have ten, 15 or 20 acres of land which the Department knew about when they were sanctioning the pension &mdash; and there would not be great income from that &mdash; surely it is not too much to expect that the person who is looking after the old age pensioner should be allowed to do a small bit, as we say, outside on the farm? I know what is behind this.  It is just another cutback, but it is a sore and niggling one.</P>
    <P>The question of means testing cuts across all parties.  I have never before had a chance in the House to mention this. There is a great case for rationalising means testing.  I could count at least 12 or 14 different types of means tests involving different types of benefit.  It amazes me that there cannot be rationalisation to reduce the band to three or four.  There is no valid reason why that should not happen.  A point was raised by Deputies Dennehy and Bell regarding persons being in receipt of unemployment assistance and being allowed to do some work. I sincerely hope that some Minister at some time will change the present system.  I hear on the grapevine that it may be proposed to reduce the normal rate of social welfare benefit over a period of time to allow the person involved to do whatever he or she likes during the week.  There are a thousand reasons for that being a good development.  I sincerely hope that it will be put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare sees the State involved in a very human way with its citizens.  I have been greatly surprised at criticisms levelled by Opposition spokesmen against this Bill throughout <Col N="2250" /> the day.  Nobody would contend that rates of unemployment assistance are high enough, but everybody will recognise that, in the context of the amount of money available to the Government, it is the very best that can be done.  The point appears to have been missed that in this Bill the Government have given to people on social welfare an increase of £101 million. For the very first time in the history of the State, they have addressed the question of those at the bottom of the pile, as Deputy Mitchell said this morning. I was a little incredulous at the attitude of that Deputy who for four and a half years in the previous Government did absolutely nothing to help those people.  It takes brass neck to criticise the Government on this issue, when this Government were the first to seriously consider the plight of those at the bottom of the social welfare scale.  The amount being spent on these people has increased from £20 million to £53 million which is an indication of the Government's commitment to those at the bottom of the social welfare scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been a considerable amount of criticism of the extension of social insurance to the self-employed. Much of this criticism has centred on the false argument that this measure will eventually cost the State millions of pounds.  That is based on the false premise that figures used by certain people outside the House are correct but it is abundantly clear that they are not.  Far from being a liability on the State, the yield from the extension of PRSI to the self-employed will be of great benefit to the Exchequer.  The money can be utilised for the repayment of the interest on the national debt, thereby reducing the requirement to borrow further.  Since the figures published officially show that the State will gain from this measure, it is extremely foolish of people to criticise it on this account.  Other criticisms levelled against the measure is that it is taxation by another name.  For far too long people have been widowed and left with very little.  Now, for the first time, widows of the self-employed, after three years, will be in a position to receive the widow's <Col N="2251" /> contributory pension.  That is a social step forward of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>For many years politicians said that the self-employed, particularly farmers, were unable, for one reason or another, to pay their health contributions.  This money is now to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners but up to April 1984 it was collected by the health boards.  A considerable number of farmers will say that there is no place in which to pay the health contributions and this is why the new method of collection announced in this measure is of such importance.  For the first time, the self-employed, including farmers, will be in a position to pay their health contributions with their tax, PRSI and youth levy.  This will eliminate a considerable amount of administrative expense and, ultimately, make the method of collection far easier than it was.</P>
    <P>Some critics have said that there should be an opt-out provision.  I do not think that any person with a social conscience could agree that the wealthiest should be in a position to opt out of the scheme while those at the lower end of the scale are caught.  One must always remember that the circumstances of people at the top of the scale could change, that they might need to rely on a non-contributory pension and that it would be grossly unfair to allow them to opt out of the scheme at present.  To request an opt-out provision is like informing an insurance company that they should insure all the bad risks but not the good ones, which does not make much sense and could not be accepted.  In due course, under this measure, the Government should introduce an invalidity pension for the self-employed and I sincerely hope that this will happen as it is of tremendous importance to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>I support the recent call for unemployment assistance to be given to emigrants for a certain period.  Too often our young people travel abroad unprepared and under-financed and with false hopes. It is only fair that these young people should be assisted by the State for a certain period so that they may settle abroad <Col N="2252" /> and have an income during that time.  I call on the Minister for Social Welfare to do everything in his power to introduce this measure with a view to assisting our young emigrants.</P>
    <P>The age limit in relation to social employment schemes is too high.  They are very good schemes but, if the age limit was reduced to 18 years, it would have several distinct advantages.  Perhaps the greatest would be that a young person unable to find alternative employment would immediately get used to the working environment which is crucially important to a young person setting out in life. The Minister should also give consideration to reducing the waiting period to six months during which a person may not join a social employment scheme because of having been on one previously. At present people participating in social employment schemes may not rejoin a scheme for 12 months and, unquestionably, this is causing difficulties. I earnestly request the Minister to consider this proposal.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of British old age pensions are excluded from many of the allowances to which those in receipt of Irish pensions are entitled.  This is anomalous and since it relates mostly to Irish citizens, the Minister might now give consideration to extending the allowances granted to Irish pensioners to those with British pensions.  More often than not, these people were obliged to leave the country in years gone by through no fault of their own.  They are in receipt of social welfare from a foreign country and the least they might expect from their own country on their return to retirement is equal treatment with those in receipt of Irish old age pensions.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was a tremendous innovation but, to a large extent, it has remained an innovation.  I say that because a considerable number of people are not aware of the provisions of the scheme.  I do not know if that is due to the fact that it did not receive sufficient publicity or that people did not realise its potential.  However, many people entitled to the income supplement have not applied for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2253" /> The increase in the family income supplement must be welcomed by all.  In my view the income supplement represents a support for the family and is a real expression by the State of its concern for the family and its maintenance in the future.  However, an argument can be made for reducing the income limit and broadening the base.  One could save the amount that this would cost by reducing the amount of the supplement.  It would have the effect of allowing a greater number of people into the system and, if operated in the manner I have suggested, would prove to be self-financing.  There are many families whose incomes are marginal and who would greatly appreciate an extension of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton, and others, referred to small farmers.  It is important that we should be clear that small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance are not subject to the new PRSI rules for the self-employed.  They are being specifically excluded, and rightly so.  We have to recognise that because there appears to be a certain amount of confusion about it.  It is important that that is cleared up.  This scheme expresses further support for those on the lowest income by providing that they need only pay £2 per week to participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>For many years the live register has given a false impression in relation to a certain number of people.  In many instances where factories closed down people in their mid-fifties and older found themselves tragically and suddenly unemployed.  It is time we realised that many of those people may at that stage wish to retire.  They may never get employment again because of their age. To this extent it is clear that that group of people should, and must, be allowed retire with dignity and the introduction of the pre-retirement allowance is an excellent measure for such people. Under that scheme those who opt for the retirement allowance may now be removed from the live register and they will not be lumbered with the burden of having to sign on at their local exchange. <Col N="2254" /> It is a dignified approach, an ingenious scheme which must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address Deputy Connaughton stated that stamp duty would have to be paid on all transfers of land and that this would mean that many farms would not be transferred.  The Deputy must have missed the announcement that the farm installation aid had been restored.  I view that as a greater incentive, if one is needed, to get people to transfer their property to their sons or daughters.</P>
    <P>It is always a disappointment when excellent measures are introduced, when increases of unprecedented levels are granted to those at the lowest end of the social welfare schemes and innovations are brought in, to find that they are criticised by people purely for the sake of criticism.  I am satisfied that the provisions in the Bill will be greatly appreciated by the general public and that there is general recognition that for the first time a Government have recognised those who are at the bottom of the scale. There is appreciation for the fact that the Government have increased the allocation for social welfare by £101 million.</P>
    <P>One of the great defects in the social welfare system over the years has been the absence of localised services.  The administration of social welfare has been too centralised and in this context the announcement by the Minister that he intends to localise this service must be welcomed.  It will mean extra employment in rural areas because there will be a need for decentralisation.  It will also mean computerisation and that will result in speedier payments.  I have no doubt the move will be of tremendous benefit to those in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>When the Jobsearch scheme was introduced many people said that it would not be possible to interview 100,000 people in one year.  The same people are now saying that the Government cannot create 40,000 jobs in tourism but it is important to stress that 100,000 people were interviewed.  The criticism of the Jobsearch scheme did not come from <Col N="2255" /> those who participated in it.  It came largely from people who knew little about the scheme.  It is interesting to note that more than 72 per cent of those interviewed said that the scheme was helpful to them.  This scheme was ingenious in its concept and has been tremendously efficient in this operation.  It has given a new sense of pride, hope and belonging to those who have participated in it and this is a factor which cannot be underestimated.</P>
    <P>The extension of the dental and optical benefit scheme must be welcomed but the reaction of some dentists was, to say the least, disappointing.  These people who are in good professions but have refused to participate in the scheme have a social obligation to the State which spent so much on educating them.  They have a duty to participate for the sake of the workers in their area.  It is indefensible that some dentists have refused to do so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a tremendous step forward. It is innovative, inventive and imaginative. I hope that in future years under this outstanding Minister for Social Welfare we will continue along the road of social equity and ultimately give all those on social welfare sufficient to live as well as most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Superficially the notion of contributory pensions for all has attractions, but the more I examine the implications of this scheme the greater are my reservations.  I focus on this issue because undoubtedly the proposal to extend pay-related social insurance to the self-employed is the most significant change introduced by this Bill.  I want to present a number of issues in a reasoned rather than a political fashion with a view to suggesting to the Minister and the Government that they should think again.  I do not want the type of debate in which all the arguments from the Government side will be totally in favour of this proposal while those emanating from the Opposition benches will be totally against it.  I have already said that superficially I can see attractions in <Col N="2256" /> having contributory pensions for the self-employed, including the farmers.  The more I examine the scheme, however, the more my reservations develop.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Minister's speech that a decision in principle was made last July without any evaluation of the scheme.  He said that subsequently in the intervening period much work was done to prepare for the introduction of the scheme.  He also complimented the National Pensions Board who agreed at short notice to examine and report to him on the proposal.  Clearly this was a case of putting the cart before the horse.  The National Pensions Board should have been asked to examine the proposal on a neutral basis, not on the basis of a decision in principle having already been taken by the Government.  When their report was produced, the Government should have obtained an actuarial report on the consequences and issued a White Paper so as to enable a reasoned debate on whether it is in the interests of the country that this approach should be adopted.  In practice this did not happen and the Government rushed at the issue. That was the wrong approach and I would ask the Government to recognise that fact and go back to teasing out all the implications.  Let us have a reasoned debate, not one which is based on members of Fianna Fáil pointing out the benefits of the scheme and the Opposition pointing out the defects.  We must try to find a consensus as to what is in the best interests of the country.  I am afraid, however, that the way this issue has been tackled will not now permit that kind of reasoned debate to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave basically two reasons justifying this scheme.  First he said that it gives self-employed people the opportunity of contributing to pensions and, secondly, it brings greater equity into the financing of social welfare as a whole.  Do these reasons stand up?  The self-employed already have the opportunity of contributing to pensions.  A large number of them are already doing so and are involved in making their own pension arrangements.  To suggest that we need an all-embracing State scheme <Col N="2257" /> to enable the self-employed to have the opportunity of contributing to pensions does not stand up in logic since that opportunity is already being availed of. Dragooning every self-employed person into this new system and making available State pensions to many who either do not need or do not deserve them may not be the answer to the problem.  I am not adopting an attitude of outright opposition. I am raising the necessary questions. The first justification advanced by the Minister does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The second justification is that it brings greater equity into the financing of social welfare as a whole.  Where is the greater equity in a situation where people who would never qualify for social welfare pensions will now be brought into the scheme and have to be paid such pensions on their retirement?  The wealthiest people in the country will become social welfare recipients by way of contributory pensions after the age of 66, pensions for which they have never asked and which will have to be funded partly by the taxpayer. Where is the equity in that?  Has that aspect been considered?</P>
    <P>It seems in some ways that the establishment of this all-embracing scheme is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. I can see that the Minister desires to get a certain amount of contribution from people who would otherwise qualify for non-contributory pensions and I do not disagree that that is a laudable objective if they can afford to pay contributions.  If so, we should establish some system which would permit that to happen.  But it does not make sense to produce an all-embracing scheme which would bring people willy-nilly into the system who would thereby qualify for a contributory old age pension and who will be from among the most wealthy in the country. Is that what the Minister means by equity?  My notion of equity is entirely different.</P>
    <P>My approach at this stage is to ask the Minister and the Government to take into account the reasoned reservations being expressed in this House.  I ask them to think it over again and not to rush into this scheme which could have disastrous <Col N="2258" /> consequences from the point of view of some of those who will be forced to pay contributions and from the point of view of the taxpayer once the old age pensions come on stream after a period of ten years.</P>
    <P>There are a number of general points I wish to make.  The Minister spoke about how the social welfare system is being extended and about the views of the Commission on Social Welfare in this regard.  When talking about the social welfare system I wonder should we talk about an entirely different approach.  The social welfare system before the Beveridge report seemed to develop by way of accretion.  We had various systems in place prior to the major changes which took place in the UK in the early forties. They were largely followed here following the publication of the Beveridge report in the UK.</P>
    <P>The system has developed willy-nilly, bit by bit, by way of accretion rather than by way of any clear vision of what we were trying to achieve through the provision of social welfare and of what the objectives of the system were.  Adding on another layer does not necessarily improve the social welfare system.  In my view social welfare should be aimed as much as possible at those in need.  The greatest amount should be paid to those in greatest need and those who have lesser needs should be paid lesser amounts.  I have doubts as to whether the universal approach makes any sense and I also have my doubts as to whether a country with our level of development and wealth can afford to have that kind of approach.  At present there is a great need in regard to social welfare to have a fundamental reappraisal and examination of what we are trying to achieve rather than just adding a further layer on to the social welfare system through the extension of contributory pensions for the self employed.</P>
    <P>This additional burden on farmers who are not particularly well off and on small or medium-sized businesses may be the last straw, the one that will put them out of business.  Again, that is a factor which should be thought about very carefully. <Col N="2259" /> At present I hold the portfolio for agriculture and while I would like to make some remarks on the effects of this on the farming community I am also very conscious of the position of the small businessman who has been hit in so many ways by competition from supermarkets and who in many instances is trying to eke out a living through late openings. They have to cope with all sorts of problems arising from the plethora of taxation measures which affect everybody in the self employed category and which have a much greater effect on the small business person than on the substantial commercial concerns.</P>
    <P>The small businessman when trying to get established in his twenties or thirties would not think an awful lot about his pension contributions.  He would be directing his energies and any moneys he had towards paying his mortgage on his business and his house.  Once having got over that challenge I would hope that he would think about making provision for his old age and get in touch with an insurance broker who deals with pension funds.  At his own pace he would be making his contribution towards the pension which would be available to him on his retirement but he is now going to be forced willy-nilly into this system at an earlier stage and I am fearful that this additional enforced compulsory payment on the number who are on a knife edge between survival and going under may be the last straw which will push such people into bankruptcy or worse.</P>
    <P>The same may apply to some people in the farming sector.  It is important that we appreciate the low level of income on most farms. There are some farmers who are making a lot of money.  Let us acknowledge that fact but they are very few and far between.  When talking about farming generally we have to look at the overall picture.  In looking for the average we can go on the figures which have been produced in the various farm surveys. The latest figures from the Agricultural Institute indicate that on average seven out of ten farmers are earning less than <Col N="2260" /> £5,000 a year.  Within that figure there is a number of farmers who are earning much less than that and a considerable number are earning less than £50 a week. The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gallagher, is present in the House holding the bench for the Government and I am sure he knows farmers in his area as I do in south west Cork who fit this description.  If we want to draw extra money from the farming community we cannot do so on the basis of the alleged crock of gold which exists among the farming community. That crock of gold is not there.  The sooner that is fully realised the easier it will be to have a reasoned debate on the contribution farmers are making and on the contribution they should make in the future.  Any such debate has to be on the basis of the figures and the figures of the farm survey said that there are 10,000 farmers earning less than £5,000 a year. If that is the situation we start from a premise which is entirely different from the one that motivated people to push the Government into the introduction of a contributory pension and PRSI contributions for farmers.  I am convinced that the people pushing the Government on this issue did so because of a perception that huge money was being made in farming.</P>
    <P>Since I have been involved in this portfolio on behalf of Fine Gael I have delved deeply into the subject and the more I delve the more I am convinced of the major difficulties that face the farming community, or a large percentage of them.  I admit that a few are making a lot of money.  One could draw the same analogy when talking about people involved in shops.  Yet, we cannot judge the small shopkeeper by comparing him with the big supermarket.  In the same way one cannot judge the ordinary farmer by the occasional example of the large farmer who is making a lot of money.  It seems to me the system was pushed for farmers because of a wrong perception, a perception of a crock of gold in the farming community.</P>
    <P>There is another major point in <Col N="2261" /> relation to the effectiveness of the extension of this scheme to the farming community which needs to be touched on. Heretofore, it has been part of the policy of all Governments to encourage the transfer of farms prior to the death of farmers so as to encourage a younger age structure on the land.  Because many farmers would not have qualified for the non-contributory old age pension without transferring their farms it was a very usual thing for farmers to transfer their farms to the next generation prior to the owner reaching the age of 66.  Under the new system the farmer will be entitled to a contributory old age pension irrespective of means at the age of 66 and, therefore, there will be no incentive to transfer the land to the next generation.  We will now revert to the system that applied 40 or 50 years ago where land was held to the very last and new owners were taking over at the age of 55 because there was no inducement for earlier transfer.  I see this as a consequence of the introduction of this provision.  It will be bad for agriculture and for the economy.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable measure which encourages the early transfer of farm holdings is good for agriculture and for the country and any measure which provides a disincentive to such early transfer is bad for agriculture and for the country. That disincentive will be a consequence of the introduction of this measure.  It is fairly clear it is a consequence that neither the Minister nor the Government have considered.  I am raising the issue to give the Minister and the Government an opportunity to think again.  I am gravely concerned at this consequence.  It runs counter to a policy which has been the policy of every Government since the foundation of the State.  The incentive for early transfers is now wiped out.</P>
    <P>In a way the situation is worse than I have described.  A farmer approaching 66 can apply for an old age non-contributory pension and transfer the farm to his son. In the new situation a farmer approaching 66 can apply for the pension and get it without any problem and he can hold on to the land.  It is actually in the interests of the family for the farmer to hold on to <Col N="2262" /> the land because having got his contributory old age pension he can hold the land and he will now not pay any contribution and the son remains on the holding waiting for 20 or 30 years to take over and in the meantime the son is not making any contribution because he has no income.  That is a very serious consequence of the introduction of this scheme and it has not been adverted to at all.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to think again about the advisability of introducing the scheme at all at this stage.  If the Government insist on the introduction of the scheme now, I want the Minister to focus on that issue, let me know the thinking of the Government on it and give me an answer to it.  If there is no answer, then it is quite clear the Government have committed another major bloomer in their thinking, or lack of it, on this issue.</P>

      <P>I will conclude by suggesting very strongly to the Government that now is the time for a rethink. There are other ways in which contributions can be got from those who are not at present contributing but who will ultimately qualify for a non-contributory old age pension.  There are ways of achieving that effect without bringing in everybody, rich and poor alike, and giving them pensions at the higher contributory rate, in many instances giving pensions to those who do not need them, do not deserve them, and do not even want them because they have made their own arrangements.  A possibility might be a requirement that people should produce annual evidence that they themselves have made adequate pension contributions with some form of sanction if they have not so done and there are, I am sure, many other possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Government and the Minister at this stage to stand back from the issue, rethink it now and come back to this House with a fresh, new approach with other options, showing that other options have been considered.  If, having examined the pros and cons of all the <Col N="2263" /> options the Minister is able to produce a 100 per cent justification for this approach, I will not stand up and say &ldquo;no way&rdquo;.  That is not what I am saying.  I am saying the Minister should rethink in the interests of this country and come back to us when he has so done.  Do not bulldoze through this measure which could have disastrous consequences not just for the self-employed but for the taxpayer and the whole country.  That is how seriously I feel about this, not on any basic point of principle but on the basis that my reservations have not been satisfied, my concerns have not been removed.  I feel strongly enough about this issue to make a final appeal to the Government to think again before they bulldoze this through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go into detail on the Bill I would like to refer to a number of points raised by Deputy O'Keeffe in relation to PRSI being extended to self-employed people. Deputy O'Keeffe leads us to believe this was rushed in.  I do not accept that.  The Minister said in his statement that he took various proposals on board in July and then asked the pensions board to come in on this.  In fact in 1982 when Deputy Michael Woods was Minister for Social Welfare he brought forward proposals for this type of scheme and these proposals, I understand, were in the Department of Social Welfare for the four and a half years that Deputy O'Keeffe's Government were in power and they did not see fit to bring anything forward.  In this Bill we have the culmination of nearly ten years' work in relation to the extension of PRSI to the self-employed and farmers.  I understand a Green Paper was produced some ten years ago in relation to this.  To say this is a rushed matter is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As any public representative would know, the extension of this is generally welcomed by the general public, particularly those people involved because so many widows of self-employed people are not entitled to any help from the State.  I had one with me recently.  Her problem was that her husband's tax affairs were such when he died that the <Col N="2264" /> business was in absolute turmoil.  She came to me to see if she could get either a contributory or a non-contributory pension. She was not able to get either.  The Department of Social Welfare were not satisfied about her means in relation to the non-contributory pension.  For all her working life she paid stamps.  She was a housewife in latter years.  Her husband, who paid substantial stamps in his early years, then went self-employed.  Because neither of them had the required recent contributions she was not entitled to a contributory pension.  This is a case in point which leads to this Bill here today, and the Minister and the Government are to be commended on bringing it in.  I will come back to the question of PRSI later.</P>
    <P>This Government since they came into power have to be congratulated because of the efforts they have made in relation to the social welfare code.  The Government came in and had to take very difficult decisions in relation to a number of other Departments, but this was the social welfare area and this was the commitment given by the Taoiseach and the Cabinet that people on low incomes would not suffer as a result of cutbacks. All speakers in the House have to give credit for the fact that from day one this Government have done all in their power to increase and broaden the scope of the social welfare code.  The amount of money this country spends on social welfare, £7 million per day, is massive and a very great drain on the Exchequer. Somewhere in the region of 1.3 million people rely on social welfare and that is a massive number by any stretch of the imagination.  The Government in the previous Social Welfare Bill and in this Bill have seen fit to increase the various allowances and benefits.  Some of our critics will say we are leaving it until July before we bring in these increases, but when we came into Government there was a proposal to bring in increases in November 1987.  We brought that back to July of 1987 and we are now, a year later, proposing to increase these further. Therefore, I do not accept that criticism <Col N="2265" /> and I do not think any reasonable person would accept it.</P>
    <P>The increase of 11 per cent in the unemployment assistance personal rate and the supplementary welfare allowance is to be commended because in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare the desire was to get as near to £50 to £60 per week basic as possible.  Obviously, our finances are such that we will not in the near future be in a position to bring that about, but this Government have increased the basic rate from in the region of £37 to nearly £43 and that is a very good increase in this day and age.  The increase for dependent children of 6 per cent and the basic 3 per cent increase in relation to all the other benefits generally are welcomed and the people relying on these payments are looking forward to July when the payments come forward. People with large families, because of the streamlining of the child dependant allowances, will get larger incomes as a result of these measures.</P>
    <P>Here let me digress and be a little parochial.  The Minister very kindly allotted some money in this year's Estimate to help make badly needed improvements to the Drogheda exchange.  I had the privilege of going down and meeting the Minister at the Drogheda exchange recently and I was astounded at the very good facilities available now to the people in Drogheda.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind that the facilities in the Dundalk exchange are not comparable with those in the Drogheda exchange and if there is any money available, I ask him to do some alterations there.  The Dundalk exchange is very old.  There are more people going to this exchange than to the Drogheda exchange, even though they are similar sized towns.  While there were some improvements there the facilities are such that the general public from time to time have to queue in the rain. Exchange officials make the point that there is no need for queueing but people are not geared to turning up just like clockwork and, unfortunately, there are problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister also announced in relation to computerisation that it was his <Col N="2266" /> intention to have more autonomy in the local exchanges and Dundalk and Drogheda were included.  I welcome this because it means people can get decisions made much more quickly.  The whole idea of computer terminals and having a centralised system through the computers is to be welcomed.  Any money spent there is money well spent.  I understand we are the envy of the social welfare authorities in the North whose headquarters are based in Newcastle and they do not have the same autonomy or the same network we have.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced one-stop shops recently.  This concept has been tried in a number of areas and will be extended ultimately throughout the country.  I welcome this because the days are gone when the local exchange was seen as an employment exchange; it is now only a place to get a hand-out, with no element of finding jobs for people. Now people are in a position to get their weekly benefit and also go into FÁS and the various offices that once were AnCO and Manpower.</P>
    <P>The Minister also recently announced the extension of dental and optical benefit to spouses.  During the last election when we said at the doors that we would do this the people, particularly the women, said they would believe it when they saw it.  This is happening now and, despite some opposition from the vested interests, it is working well.  The claims that have come in amount to about £18,000.  This is substantial and shows that the scheme is of major benefit to families.  There are about 200 dentists involved and more will become involved when they see that there are benefits for them also in this scheme.  Dentists in rural areas are taking part although some dentists are digging their heels in and not getting involved, but that will probably change.</P>
    <P>In regard to the local authority contribution to unemployment assistance, the cost to local authorities is £0.5 million and this is now being stopped.  This is a welcome move because my own local authority are absolutely strapped for cash.  Louth County Council is probably <Col N="2267" /> one of the worst off in the country and any relief in regard to what they must pay to the Central Exchequer is welcome.  I would like to make the point that at the moment the staff in my local authority are working short time, working for approximately three days and working short time for the other two days and being paid social welfare, in effect, for not working.  This may be a saving on the Department of the Environment Estimate but it is coming out of the Social Welfare Estimate.  I ask the Minister to liaise with the Minister for the Environment in relation to this.  I am sure other counties, particularly County Offaly, have had this problem before.  There may be a good explanation for it but, on the face of it, it does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was mentioned earlier.  This has not, up to now, been utilised by the general public, the people who would most benefit from it.  In my home town quite a number of the soldiers from the military barracks have told me that people elsewhere in Dundalk are getting more money in the form of social welfare payments than they are.  I suggested that they use the family income supplement and when they investigated they found there was something in it for them.  I would make the point &mdash; and this is not a criticism &mdash; that it might be more beneficial to take in more people at the lower end of the scale rather than increasing the rates.  This might be of greater assistance to people who are just over the limit for medical cards and so on.  These are the people who in this day and age are most hardpressed and every effort should be made to help them.  I understand the Minister is proposing a review in relation to the family income supplement and if something along the lines I am suggesting comes out of it it would be welcomed by most people.</P>
    <P>The part-time job allowance scheme is being extended.  This has been handled under a pilot scheme in my own county and has been of great benefit to people who do a couple of hours work and are still entitled to a social welfare payment provided they meet certain conditions. <Col N="2268" /> The extension of the educational opportunities scheme posed some problems. There were a number of cases of people attending VEC courses for just one morning a week who had difficulty in relation to their unemployment assistance claims.  Thankfully, all these problems have been sorted out and these people are now in a position to participate in these schemes.</P>
    <P>One other item in the Bill that I would like to refer to is the <i>pro rata</i> pensions. Most public representatives come across instances where people because of an anomaly, are not entitled to a non-contributory pension.  Recently in a daily paper there was a letter congratulating the Government on bringing this forward. There was definitely an anomaly and people who paid quite substantial contributions during their working lives were being prevented from obtaining a pension.  Because of the measure the Minister has brought in, I understand that quite a sizeable number will be included. This is something that cannot go unnoticed and the Members on the other side of the House should give credit for it.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the occupational injuries fund is referred to in the Bill.  The contribution is being increased from 0.43 per cent to 0.5 per cent.  This tends to fluctuate depending on the number of accidents that take place in the workplace.  It brings to mind the fact that all employers and employees should make every effort to ensure that fewer accidents happen.  If fewer accidents happen less money will have to be paid into the fund.  I understand this basic increase will mean a maximum of approximately £7 per year per employee, which is a very small increase.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that the Minister has been very vigilant on, and I congratulate him on this, is fraud.  The previous Bill that was introduced in the Dáil and on which I had the privilege to speak took account, by and large, of the problems of fraud.  It put a greater onus on the employer and this is something that should be welcomed.  The provisions in <Col N="2269" /> this Bill in relation to fraud are an extension of the work that the Minister has done in this regard.  It is in everyone's interest that fraud does not take place because at the end of the day it is the taxpayer who has to pay.  I compliment the Minister and his officials on the diligent work they have done.  They have set up the various investigation units which obviously are effective because they are finding out major areas of fraud.</P>
    <P>To return to PRSI, as I have said already, Deputy O'Keeffe accused the Government of rushing in but that is not correct.  There are Members in the House who are calling for a bigger contribution from the self-employed and the farmers. These are the people who were in Government for four and a half years and they did not do a jot about it.  As I said earlier, the previous Minister, Deputy Woods, had proposals in the Department but none of the people in the Labour camp or the Fine Gael camp brought forward these proposals and I do not know why.  By and large, it is the PAYE worker who is paying for these non-contributory pensions and any effort that is made to reduce this burden on the PAYE worker should be welcomed.  I understand that in the region of £330 million is being paid out on means-tested pensions.  That is a massive amount of money and this proposal will reduce it quite substantially.</P>
    <P>The fact that people cannot opt out is a non-argument.  As Deputy O'Donoghue previously said, you have to take the good with the bad.  If you start allowing people to opt out, you are not only leaving yourself open to the accusation that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor but you are also building up an administration which would need more money to operate.  I do not think that it is in anyone's interest.  In relation to PRSI there is a problem with people over 56 years of age.  A number of people came to me who had difficulty in that they would not be in a position to benefit from the old age pension when they were 66 because they did not have the ten year requirement.  This is a problem.  I understand the Minister examined this matter <Col N="2270" /> and found it was not possible for these people to buy extra years.  We would like that to happen but from a financial point of view it was not possible because it would cost billions of pounds to implement.  These people will be in a position, at the very worst, to get back the money they have paid and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the fact that we hope an invalidity pension will be included at a later stage.  Again, this has major implications from the social welfare as well as from the finance aspect.  Obviously the Minister will have to carry out a review on that to see what the implications are.  One aspect of the PRSI extension is that the people who get the pension at 66 do not have to retire. This is to be welcomed in that these people will be able to do odd jobs without having to look over their shoulders.  They will be able to live out their lives with this pension under their belts and they will not have the problem that they will be caught out eventually.</P>
    <P>In regard to the various rates of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent, the National Pensions Board recommended a figure in the region of 4.5 per cent.  It is more equitable to phase it in at this stage, with a maximum of £4 per week from most self-employed people and £2 for low income earners.  The Minister has been accused &mdash; and a number of commentators have jumped the gun and produced facts and figures which have been alluded to by Opposition spokesmen &mdash; that this is a short-term gain, that in the earlier years there will be nothing to pay out but that we do not realise the enormity of the amounts of money that will have to be paid ultimately by the State. The Minister, in his speech, explained this in detail and pointed out the errors of their ways.  The National Pensions Board, when deliberating on this did not take into account the unearned income which the Minister is including in the assessment. This is something which will help these figures.  The raising of the earnings ceiling for PRSI from £15,500 to £16,200 will also be of help.  Obviously that figure <Col N="2271" /> will not remain static in future.  The Minister pointed out that over a ten-year period we will be in a net position of in the region of £360 million and that ultimately over 50 years the taxpayer will be a net beneficiary of this scheme.  I do not think anyone on the Opposition side has answered that argument properly today.  The Minister's figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>A criticism was made in relation to the collection of PRSI.  The introduction of self-assessment will be of major benefit in this regard.  PRSI, the youth employment levy and the health contribution are relatively small.  Up to now the problem has been that if the State was to institute proceedings for tax and PRSI it would have to do so separately but from now on it will be able to do so in one lump. When self-assessment comes into operation it will also improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I did not refer earlier is the pre-retirement scheme.  This is an excellent scheme.  All public representatives know quite a number of people in the latter years of their lives who have to go to the dole office to sign on and to collect money and there is no hope of them getting a job.  People seeking jobs even at 40 are now &ldquo;over the hill&rdquo;.  These people on unemployment assistance have to travel to the employment exchange to collect their money and sign on.  The provisions of this scheme are meant to benefit those people.  I would hope that in future years, when administration allows, the Minister, and future Ministers, would bring this down to a realistic level.  In saying that I am not saying it is not pitched at a realistic level. At present it is based on the fact that our national finances are such that we may not be able to introduce it across the board.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his efforts to bring some sort of equity into the PRSI system.  He has done an excellent job, fighting his corner at Cabinet level, in bringing the plight of people on social welfare benefit to the fore.  The Taoiseach has stated already that medical card holders &mdash; people at <Col N="2272" /> that level &mdash; will not be affected by the various cuts.  That guarantee is to be seen in the provisions of this Bill and in other measures introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon, a colleague from my home town, had something to say in relation to my remarks on the increases brought forward in the budget.  He castigated the Government because of the level of increases this year.  He stated that the Coalition Government increased social welfare benefits by 25 per cent in two successive years.  Perhaps that is why the country is now in such a bad state. The present Minister has brought forward these increases although operating on a very tight budget.  As I said earlier, we pay £7 million a day on social welfare. Taking all of that into consideration as well as overall Exchequer spending, the Minister has done an excellent job, a job on which he should be congratulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of features of this Bill which are good.  I do not want to be taken as being universally critical or destructive in what I have to say about it but there are also a number of its features which are bad and which should be identified and criticised on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a considerable volume of discussion in this debate as to the costs which this State is undertaking in extending pay-related social insurance to the self-employed.  So far as I am concerned, doctors and experts will differ while patients die.  But I have no doubt that any cool, calm and rational evaluation of the position would reveal that, in return for an uncertain liability &mdash; I will put it no further than that at this stage &mdash; in respect of making contributory old age pensions available to the self-employed the Government are accepting, in the short run, a flow of moneys from the self-employed which is a fiscal and budgetary advantage to them in the short term. Indeed it goes further than that.  In circumstances in which, to accept such a flow of moneys in the short run the Government are undertaking a long term liability, this House would be very foolish to validate Government strategy, or give <Col N="2273" /> its imprimatur to it unless it was clearly spelled out in a convincing way on precisely what figures or calculations it is alleged that the bargain is one we should strike.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of hedging in argument on this issue, a good deal of obfuscation and creating smokescreens behind which people are effectively predicting something which is, in the last analysis, somewhat unpredictable, that is the ultimate cost to the Exchequer of making old age pensions of a contributory kind available to everyone, as of right, in the community who has contributed. There are a number of things which do emerge through all the obfuscation and smokescreens.  First, the National Pensions Board's calculations have not been validated independently, they have not been scrutinised and, in my view, are deeply suspect.  There has been reference to the helpful paper in terms of the public interest delivered by Patrick Massey to a seminar on this subject in Trinity College on 18 February 1988.  The Minister has queried some of Mr. Massey's assumptions in arriving at the conclusions he set out in his paper.  The Minister is entitled to do so.  Indeed on television the Minister has queried some of the figures and calculations that Mr. Massey and others, be it said, have advanced to suggest that the ultimate liability to the taxpayer which is implicit in extending PRSI to the self-employed is in fact under-funded.</P>
    <P>I believe that in all of these cases &mdash; where the Government bring proposals before this House &mdash; the process should be based on a two-staged argument. First, the Government should, in advance of their bringing a Bill before the House, set out in a White Paper or Green Paper the precise implications of what they are going to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had Green Papers and White Papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a Green Paper a long time ago.  I read the Green Paper when published, I think, upwards of eight or nine years ago now.  But the calculations on which extension of social <Col N="2274" /> insurance to the self-employed was proposed in that paper &mdash; to put it charitably &mdash; were niggardly, no effort having been made to quantify the implications of such a step in that Green Paper.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Department of Social Welfare, through the Minister, set out in absolute detail their projections, year by year, of the net benefit to the Exchequer in the first few years and the net cost to the Exchequer thereafter. That has not been done.  The Minister has never set out in a coherent form &mdash; because he does not want to tie himself down to one posture in this matter &mdash; precisely the calculations, figures and assumptions on which this measure is based and proposed.  It is proposed in two different lights.  It is proposed, first, as a measure of equity.  Deputy Dermot Ahern mentioned equity as a reason for bringing in this extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  That implies, and I am not suggesting that it is totally wrong, that the self-employed are getting away with an inequitable advantage at present, and that equity for those who are not self-employed, the PAYE sector in society, demands that social insurance, in some sense, should be extended to the self-employed.  That is one argument and it is easy to understand. The suggestion is that the self-employed should carry a larger portion of the burden but it is somewhat two-faced, in the technical sense and not an abusive sense of the word, because it is then sold to the self-employed as an unqualified advantage.  As things stand now giving a further advantage to the self-employed who are supposed to be, for one purpose, receiving an unfair advantage, achieves equity, defies logic and underlines a fundamental contradiction in the arguments being advanced for this step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My view is that the trade unions, who were party to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, viewed extension of insurance to the self-employed as something which would confer fewer advantages than disadvantages on the self-employed, something which would effectively mean that the self-employed would <Col N="2275" /> pay a greater portion than they do at present of the burden of keeping people who are on pensions paid and of defraying a greater proportion of the liabilities of the State in respect of those who are on pensions.  If that was the understanding of the trade unions, it is no surprise to see them now &mdash; as expressed through the attitude of the Labour Party and The Workers' Party &mdash; expressing deep dissatisfaction with this Bill.  At the very least it is being portrayed as something entirely different.  It is being portrayed as something which is conferring on the self-employed a stream of payments which are an advantage in return for a bargain basement price even at the introductory level of 3½ per cent rising to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is not a measure which is being introduced at present in any effective way to achieve equity.  It is not a measure which, in the long run, will achieve either equity or an advantage to the self-employed.  I believe that, as time goes by, this measure will have an unforeseen effect, that is a dilution of the political will and the economic base of social insurance itself.  Some Government in the next ten or 15 years are bound, no matter what complexion they have, to come to the conclusion that cannot be paid regardless of need, and must be done on the basis of need.  At that stage we will be driven to the point where pensions are payable not as of contractual right in a social insurance sense but based on need. That will be the final undermining of the social insurance concept.  The people who will lose out most will be those who have paid in most and those who expected that they would have given to them, as of contractual right with the State, a flow of pensions and other benefits during their working life and after their working life is completed.  They are the people whose position will be undermined because the concept of social insurance will be fatally attacked by the strains which the additional burden of the self-employed will place on it.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go through the arguments made by Mr. Massey in his paper. I think the Minister has probably heard <Col N="2276" /> them until he is tired of them.  I should like to make a few comments in the light of the debate that occurred between the Minister and Mr. Massey indirectly on television &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>You invited him to denigrate his calculations on television. There are two aspects which occurred to me as raising doubts in relation to PRSI for the self-employed.  The first is that the likely cost of the proposal and its implications for public finances have not been worked out and are more serious than we thought.  The second is the whole philosophy and rationale which underlies social insurance as a concept.  I am not suggesting that those are entirely different issues but I think they should be dealt with separately.  The Minister on television indicated that commentators &mdash; and I will not personalise it further than that &mdash; were in error on the basis of their calculation as to what the yield would be based on the figures now being set by the Government for contributions.  On the basis of the cost as estimated by the National Pensions Board, and given the budget estimate of net revenue arising in 1988, it was estimated that the scheme would begin to impose a cost on the Exchequer after year 12 and that the cumulative cost after 50 years would have a net present value of £789 million.  It also seems that the National Pensions Board revised their cost estimates and that that happened between the writing of their draft and final reports.  On this basis it looks like the net present value of the cost to the Exchequer is about £750 million.  The Minister disputed that figure and he argued that between April and December only 55 per cent of the revenue which would accrue in a full year would be collected.  It is interesting to know why 55 per cent of that figure will only be collected between April and December <Col N="2277" /> every year.  I do not think the maths of that add up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>You just do not understand it, Deputy.  I will explain it to you later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Consequently he claimed that estimates of the revenue arising in future years were understated. Using that argument it seems that if a five per cent contribution rate is assumed, the net revenue yield in a full year would be £36.5 million.  The budget states that there will be some loss in taxation arising from the proposal, so the net increase in revenue is the important figure to arrive at when you are looking at this issue.  The budget suggests that the net present value of the cost over 50 years might be as low as £508 million.  However, the Minister has claimed that at the five per cent rate revenue in a full year would amount to £50 million and for this to be true there must be some other explanation in addition to the 55 per cent argument which the Minister has already advanced. Secondly &mdash; and I can see now why that may be so &mdash; it is not clear whether the £50 million referred to by the Minister was net or gross revenue lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has now proposed to extend PRSI to cover unearned income in the hands of the self-employed.  This is justified in the speech which the Minister delivered today in this debate, on the basis that self-employed persons such as directors are sometimes in a position to manage their affairs in a way that they receive the bulk of their income as unearned income and that if contributions were payable on certain types of income only there would be scope for taking advantage of this to limit PRSI liability.  That is all very well except that there are a great many self-employed people who have no such option.  It is all very well to extend PRSI to unearned income so as to close off a loophole but <Col N="2278" /> if by doing that you create a further injustice and discrimination, I think the Minister owes the House a greater responsibility than he appeared to undertake when he composed his text for delivery here today and to explain precisely why that is a justifiable step.</P>
    <P>Why should unearned income be liable to PRSI in the hands of the self-employed if it is not so in the hands of the employed?  Why should it be that somebody who, for instance, receives interest should have his interest receipts calculated for PRSI purposes because he is self-employed when the same man in similar circumstances employed would not be liable to pay PRSI on his interest receipts?  Why should that be?  That is a profoundly arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between two sets of people.  Justifying it in terms of closing off a loophole is naked as an excuse.  It does not stand up at all.  To treat income differently in the hands of two different sets of people because one set of people might decide to abuse their position seems to be profoundly unfair.  Its consequences are not yet understood but when they are understood and a lot of people suddenly realise that they are being charged PRSI on income which if they were employed they would not be charged on, they will understand immediately that under the guise of closing off a loophole the Minister is in fact extending an arbitrary and unfair discrimination between two sets of income.  I spoke about interest income but there are hundreds of alternative sources of income which it would be grossly unfair to treat differently in the hands of those who receive them simply on the basis that a loophole is to be closed off.  I suggest to the Minister that he should rethink this proposition because it will cause deep-seated political unpopularity at any rate and a sense of injustice among the community at large.</P>
    <P>Whatever the rights and wrongs of the revenue <i>versus</i> eventual liability equation and all the controversy which has surrounded that, there are a number of reasons to suspect that the National Pensions Board estimates as to the cost of <Col N="2279" /> the benefits they were dealing with are suspect.  The costs are equivalent to the amount of money that will be paid out to people included in the scheme less the amount of money that will be saved on non-contributory payments.  However, it is assumed that most non-contributory benefits are paid to people who were previously self-employed.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board stated on page 3 of their report that people covered by non-contributory pensions are mainly the self-employed. Nowhere in this report is there any evidence advanced to support this critical assumption.  Still less is there any evidence to quantify the extent to which it is true.  Significantly, on page 55 of the report we are told that the Department of Finance representative considered it would be equally legitimate to assume a lower take-up rate for non-contributory old age and survivors' pensions.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy M. Higgins on 8 March 1988:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the particular attack on the vocational sector represented by the cuts inflicted on the sector at second and third level by the Minister for Education and the Government; noting in particular the increase in the pupil/teacher ratio, from a band of 17 &mdash; 19-1 to 20-1 in the vocational sector, and an increase from 19-1 to 20-1 in the community and comprehensive sector, with a reduction of 10 per cent in the number of teachers; noting the threat to temporary teachers at second and third level; noting the suspension of the building programme, and the deferral of urgent extensions and refurbishment; noting further the proposals of the Minister and the Government to <Col N="2280" /> abolish or amalgamate some vocational education committees, calls for democratic and prior consultation before this specific proposal is published; conscious that the vocational sector is responsible for a disproportionate share of remedial teaching, special provision for the disadvantaged, and community related and second chance education; calls on the Minister and the Government to withdraw their proposals for cuts in the vocational sector so as to enable this sector of State education to survive and expand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;conscious of the special role played by vocational, community and comprehensive schools in the education system particularly as it affects the disadvantaged young person, calls on the Government to convene a meeting of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in order to examine the implications of the decision to increase the pupil teacher ratio in that sector in the context of the statement in the Programme at section IV, paragraph 15 `that the burden of adjustment does not fall on the disadvantaged' and that such examination should take place within the existing overall public expenditure provision for 1988.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to use my time to mention some of the questions raised last night and to develop them somewhat further. Let me retrace how this issue began. On 9 October last the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and accompanying national pay agreement were published <Col N="2281" /> nationwide, amid great publicity and general brouhaha by one and all.  In this programme there was a section on education and also a mechanism for checking on the implementation of the aspirations and undertakings in the programme.  On 13 October, a few days later, the Government published their Estimates.</P>
      <P>Several people, including myself, immediately identified the major connection between the two events &mdash; the coincidence of £70 million pay increases in the programme and the Estimates savings of £70 million by taking people out of the public service.  On that point there were very many public statements and warnings by many others and myself that the consequences for education of taking such numbers out of the classroom, out of teaching, out of the education system would be disastrous and that it contravened the undertaking in the programme agreed to by the social partners that the burden of adjustment would not fall on the disadvantaged.  That phrase is used in the Fine Gael amendment and it is used in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> at paragraph 15 in the education section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interestingly enough, on 15 February, I understand, a document was drawn up by Government Departments reporting on specific measures included in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I have a document here which is headed &ldquo;Specific Measures included in the Programme for National Recovery &mdash; Summary of Position (as reported by Government Departments)&rdquo;. I do not think it necessary for me to say how it came into my possession. It goes through each of the education items and undertakings in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> but not once does it mention the cut in the vocational teaching numbers or the cut in the primary teaching numbers.  It goes on at great length about measures for the disadvantaged which were in place already, long before this programme was brought out and, in fact, most of which were put in place by the previous Government and in some of which the amount given by the previous Government in the <Col N="2282" /> allocations for the disadvantaged were cut.</P>
    <P>At no point does it mention the conflict between the cut in the primary teaching numbers and in the vocational teaching numbers, which are the subject of this debate.  It is an extraordinary document. I find it very depressing because the implications are that it was circulated to the social partners as a report by the Government on the implementation of the programme and that not one person involved in the social partners in that programme saw fit to point out the contradictions.  I find that quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Last evening, in this House we had representatives of the Labour Party, The Workers' Party, Deputy Kemmy and myself setting out the facts about the section of the population particularly catered for by the vocational sector.  It was pointed out that some of these are also catered for in other sectors, but the vocational sector has a particular care for the disadvantaged among our young people.  We set out facts about the practical and technical subjects.  We repeated what everybody knows already about these schools.  No matter what gloss is put on the situation, or what denials are put out by the Minister of State, or any other member of Government in an attempt to say otherwise, young people training in vocational schools who will be hurt most by this proposal are the least able to bear the &ldquo;burden of financial adjustment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is a great need immediately to rethink this decision.  The parents, teachers and Opposition parties mounted a concentrated effort against the second unjustifiable cut in the primary class side proposed last autumn. That Circular 20/87 was suspended.  The status remains uncertain.  I understand from reading the latest edition of the INTO journal that they are convinced it is a dead duck.  In fact, they warn us all against raising the matter at all in case we disturb the dust covering it.</P>
    <P>There have been massive cuts at every level of education apart from the few attempts to change class sizes at primary and vocational levels.  The education world since this Government came into <Col N="2283" /> office has generally been staggered by the education cuts, not only because of the size of the cuts themselves but more because of the promises and assurances given by Fianna Fáil in Opposition that there was a better way and that everything in education would be looked after. My party, because of their firm belief which has been consistent in Government and Opposition, that the financial stability of the country must come first have singled out two areas where the education cuts are unjustifiable.  We believe that they will cause great hardship and problems to the weakest in our community. A Deputy from Dundalk told me even today about 800 youngsters in the Dundalk area who attend vocational education and the number of teachers that will be lost to them under this proposal. Dundalk very badly needs its vocational education sector.  We read in this morning's papers and have heard tonight also that the vocational preparation and training course allowance is about to be axed. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> itself &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I cannot see how the social partners and the Government can square that with what has happened in the past few days.  I call on the Government to recall the real wish of Dáil Éireann to see this cut removed.  I call upon the social partners and the Government to convene immediately the mechanism under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the central review committee, which is already in place.  I call on the social partners, and most particularly the Congress of Trade Unions who have such strong links with the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, who have among them &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The committee can be convened next week.  The issue can be dealt with before it goes any further.  No circular has been sent out to the schools.  They have not been told yet that they are going to lose these teachers.  I call on the Minister to withdraw any proposal to disimprove the teacher-pupil ratio in the vocational system.  I call upon the social partners and the Government to go back to the table and look again at the undertakings they solemnly made in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to withdraw this cut so that the vocational sector &mdash; and I would add the primary sector &mdash; will be relieved of this threat hanging over them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, like my colleague last night, I thank those who have so far contributed to this debate: Deputy Higgins who moved the original motion, followed by Deputy Mac Giolla of The Workers' Party, Deputy Kemmy, Deputy Hussey and my own colleague and fellow Minister, Deputy Fahey.  I wish to express my appreciation of the very sincerely held views of the various people who spoke here.  The speakers put their views extremely concisely and clearly and I am also glad of this opportunity to speak on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hussey said that her party recognised our financial situation at present and most people also very clearly recognise it.  People who wish to see the country developing for their own sons and daughters &mdash; or for young people in general &mdash; are conscious that we can only develop it if we rid ourselves of the burden of debt.  We cannot build jobs if we are in debt, that is a clear factor and one which we have all learned to face up <Col N="2285" /> to in the last while.  Everyone accepts that it is essential that the economic and financial problems which continue to beset this country must be resolutely tackled.  Due to the determination of the Government and the measures taken in the 1987 budget, we have witnessed a spate of competitiveness, a restoration of confidence and a realisation that good and firm foundations for national economic recovery have been built.</P>
    <P>Our competitiveness in the international marketplace has been strengthened in 1987 and a marked improvement was made against our EC partners.  There was a most impressive growth in 1987 in our exports with an increase of some 16 per cent in the volume of exports compared with only 4 per cent in 1986.</P>
    <P>One must maintain the thrust and the drive to overcome our economic difficulties and to maintain continued improvement in our economic performance. This can and will be done by the continuation of the policies, strategies and measures which the Government have adopted for 1988.  Already in 1988 there are indications of positive results deriving from such policies. Ireland's exports continue to thrive &mdash; in January 1988 exports rose to an all-time record for the month to £799 million. With imports for the month at £698 million this gave a surplus of £101 million &mdash; a new January record which augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>However, in order to build on the favourable outcomes achieved in 1987, it is essential to continue to reduce our dependency as a nation on borrowing and thereby reduce the extremely large interest bill which must be paid on bor-rowings.</P>
    <P>The strategy adopted in the 1988 budget is designed to lower the current budget deficit from 6.8 per cent of GNP in 1987 to 6.3 per cent of GNP in 1988. These targets are realistic and necessary to ensure that this country's financial and economic difficulties are resolved.</P>
    <P>The great majority of the Irish people have clearly indicated that sacrifices must be made in the short term and that a level <Col N="2286" /> of services in line with our resources and which we can afford should be provided.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of this Government to ensure that our limited resources are allocated and utilised in the most effective and efficient way possible and that they be linked with measures which will promote and encourage economic growth and development.</P>
    <P>Despite the financial difficulties which face this country, the Government recognise the important contribution which an efficient and cost effective education system can make to the economic and social development of our country.  In 1988 over 18 per cent of net expenditure went on non-capital services, whereas in 1986 the corresponding figure was 16.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The total gross cost of education in 1988 is £1,206 million approximately and this represents 6.8 per cent of GNP while the total net cost is £1,123 million and corresponds to 6.3 per cent of GNP.  These figures compare more than favourably with expenditures on education in other EC countries.  The 1987 <i>Statistical Year Book</i> published by UNESCO, shows that Ireland spent a greater percentage of GNP on education than most other countries. The latest relevant figures in the year book refer to 1984 and in that year, while we spent 6.7 per cent of GNP on education, the United Kingdom spent 5.3 per cent while the corresponding figure for Germany was 6.5 per cent.  Indeed, only the Netherlands at 6.9 per cent spent a greater percentage of GNP than Ireland.  We should reflect on the fact that we spent well over £1,200 million on education.  We can only spend what we have, which is our GNP, and out of that we are second highest in Europe in our spending on education.</P>
    <P>It is an earnest of the Government's commitment to education, in line with the record of achievement in education by Fianna Fáil Governments down the years, that in spite of the restraint on public spending which the country's financial situation demands, the Government are allocating over £1,200 million to education in 1988.  That represents an expenditure of over £300 for every man, <Col N="2287" /> woman and child in the country.  At a time when all public spending has to be critically examined in the interests of setting the economy back on an even keel, it is a matter for congratulation that the Government have given such a priority to education.</P>
    <P>The Labour motion mentions various issues which I will address.  The third level VEC sector was mentioned last night by Deputy Higgins.  I intend to introduce legislation which will give greater autonomy to the regional technical colleges and to the colleges of technology.  It is worth pointing out &mdash; and I do not do so in an acrimonious sense &mdash; that the Green Paper produced when Deputy Higgins's party were in Government proposed taking regional colleges and colleges of technology from under the aegis of the VECs.</P>
    <P>These colleges will be encouraged and provided with the opportunity to place greater emphasis on applied research and development activities.  They will also be in a better position to form new links and to strengthen existing ones with local industrial and commercial interests so that they may play a more active role in shaping the industrial and economic development of the regions in which they are located.  In this context I should mention the COMETT programme.  This is a European Community action programme for education and training for technology and was adopted in July 1986 &mdash;during the term of office of the previous Government &mdash; for an initial three-year period with a funding of approximately £35 million from the European Community. The programme involves co-operation and the forging of closer links between the world of business and industry on the one hand and higher education on the other.  Those closer links will make a significant contribution to the economic and industrial development of individual member states and will improve the technological capacity and competitiveness of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The need to bring the worlds of business and higher education into a closer relationship is well recognised.  Each can <Col N="2288" /> learn from the other and in this COMETT are playing a very large part. I am happy to say that the third level VEC educational institutions have responded very well to the COMETT programme. We should indeed pay tribute to all the staff in those colleges &mdash; not just the lecturers &mdash; but also the ancillary staff for the way the colleges have coped so remarkably with the changing circumstances and how they have adapted to the needs, not just of their own region which was their original remit, but also to national standards and the production of graduates.  Almost all those institutions, including the RTCs, are involved in the three university enterprise training partnerships.  In the first and second round of applications in 1987, we have been allocated a total of almost £380,000 under the programme.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the Erasmus Programme, a European action scheme for the mobility of third level students.  I was lucky in that the programme had been prepared before I attended my first meeting of the Council of Education Ministers.  I accept that initially there were teething problems in regard to the allocation of money for the programme.  However, I understand that VEC third level institutions have produced applications to run courses under that programme and are determined to make the most they can of the assistance. I was pleased to be able to attend a seminar last week organised by German and Irish chambers of commerce where the RTC and DIT programmes for language teaching were launched.  I accept that those institutions have language programmes but there will now be an intensification of them.  The Erasmus Programme will be reviewed at the end of the three-year period and I will certainly be pressing for an increased level of Community funding as well as seeking a mechanism which will reflect, in an increased financial allocation, the difficulties presented by student mobility to states on the periphery of the Community.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the single internal <Col N="2289" /> market in 1992 will see the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.  The free movement of people and the rights of establishment guaranteed by the Treaties can only become a reality with improved foreign language competence.  I would safely say that all European Education Ministers share the view that a major initiative needs to be taken at Community level in the teaching of foreign languages.  I understand that the Commission of the European Communities is preparing what I should hope will be a major initiative in the field of language teaching which they expect to present to Education Ministers in May.  I hope that a programme like the Erasmus one can be applied to second level so that our students can gain a competence in foreign languages.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper, <i>Partners in Education: Serving Community Needs</i>, which was published in November 1985, in considering the position of regional technical colleges and other colleges under the aegis of VECs stated that provision ought to be made to allow RTCs to operate with considerably more autonomy than heretofore.  It was also proposed that the DIT be constituted as an independent institution by legislation.  Consultation and discussion were then held with all the major interests.</P>
    <P>Broadly in relation to the RTCs the views fell into two camps.  There was the firm view that the RTCs should remain within the VEC system while getting more autonomy.  There was, however, strong pressure from the principals and staff of the colleges for complete independence.</P>
    <P>On 9 March, 1987 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney, announced that the Government had authorised the drafting of a Bill along the lines of a scheme giving greater autonomy to the RTCs.  The effect would be to constitute each of the RTCs as independent institutions and take them from under the aegis of the VECs.</P>
    <P>Legislation is currently being prepared in order to make the college boards of management larger and more representative, to afford them a greater <Col N="2290" /> degree of autonomy than at present, while operating within the VEC structures and whereby the colleges can in accordance with agreed policies and guidelines become involved in research and development work consonant with their teaching functions and in support of enterprise within their regions.  I hope they will prove to be far reaching in the area of research and development.</P>
    <P>Pending the introduction of formal guidelines in this area a range of activities in the research and development area has already been put in place.  We have had the appointment of industrial liaison officers in a number of the RTCs and the establishment of business incubator units.</P>
    <P>The question of the amalgamation of VECs was referred to in the motion and dealt with last night by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  He alleged that we would be taking undemocratic decisions in regard to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>The question of the amalgamation of VECs was also referred to in the amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  It is highly appropriate in my opinion that this question should be addressed and I have already outlined that it is the Government's intention to reduce the number of VECs from 38 to approximately 20.  The Vocational Education Act, 1930 has served this country well.  It proved a flexible, adaptable and imaginative basis by which local, education, industrial and social requirements have been met.  I do not propose, therefore, to abolish the VECs as was proposed by the previous Government.  I propose to merge, to amalgamate but not to abolish.  Each committee already in existence will have their representatives on the proposed amalgamated committees.</P>

      <P>That is a very logical question.  I hope that the legislation will <Col N="2291" /> be ready for the term after Easter.  In this regard it is quite disingenuous of the Labour Party to be framing motions critical of the Government's approach to the VEC sector when, in Government, that same party supported proposals which would have meant the abolition of VECs as we know them.</P>

      <P>The Government's proposal for the vocational education sector will be aimed at consolidating the achievements of the past half century and introducing reforms which recognise the needs and realities of the year 2000 and beyond.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation, therefore, of a number of VECs is designed to create a more efficient and cost-effective system and to enable the new VECs to provide a better service to the public in their areas.  It can hardly be argued that it is in the best interests either of providing a coordinating service or of making the best possible use of resources to have the work of VECs divided over 38 committees as is now the case.  It would appear a more appropriate number of committees given the size of the country, the population spread, and the changes proposed would be about half of what it is now.  In fact, at 20 to 21 committees it will be slightly more than half.</P>

    <P>Deputy Higgins raised the question of consultation and I should like to tell him that I was involved in an intense process of consultation.  On many occasions I met with representatives of the TUI.  In fact, whenever that body requested a meeting I willingly met them despite any difficulties there might be on policy matters. I have always maintained that a Minister should have close personal relations with organisations with whom he or she deals. I will continue to meet representatives of that body whenever requested.  I have met with the Association of Chief Executive Officers on several occasions and I met with representatives of the IVEA on many occasions.  I am about to meet representatives of AVEC and of the <Col N="2292" /> Association of Principals of Regional and Third Level Colleges.  It is my intention to meet representatives of the student bodies in the different regional colleges.  I have signalled my intention to the student bodies that in a VEC area, be it amalgamated or in its present state, a student representative of a local third level college will be appointed to the VEC board.</P>

      <P>I would like the Deputy to see reports of the consultations that took place.  However, the previous Government proposed to go ahead with their programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect to be shortly in a position to indicate firm proposals on the amalgamations and in making my decision I shall have full regard to the many representations that have been made on this issue.  I have of course already had discussions and consultations with the various interest groups and I shall continue to have dialogue with those groups on the implementation of my proposals.  I am convinced that the proposals will in no way diminish the valuable contribution <Col N="2293" /> by VECs to education; on the contrary I consider that they will enhance it.  They will lead to a more efficient organisation which will preserve all that is best in the vocational education system and enable it to give the best possible service to the public.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Minister for Labour I have been considering the position of those young people, numbering about 6,000 annually, who leave the school system without qualifications. There is a clearly defined cohort of disaffected young people who do not want to stay within the regular school system because they feel it does not serve their needs.</P>

      <P>We have established a liaison group representative of both our Departments to consider how best the educational and training needs of this group of students might be met.</P>
      <P>We have decided to make proposals to Government for a special training initiative to be taken within both the educational and training systems to cater for their special needs.  The new programme will differ substantially in context and methodology from the well-established vocational preparation and training programme. It will probably be delivered mainly in out-of-school locations.  This problem is largely an urban one and I have raised the matter initially with the VECs which cater for predominantly urban populations.</P>

      <P>I am not allowed to address it because of Deputy Higgins, the great social reformer.  I am happy to say that the response to date has been very positive.  I hope soon to be in a position to enter into detailed discussions with the VECs in relation to the funding and delivery of these special programmes which we hope will cater in the next session for an initial intake of 600 early school leavers.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Frank Fahey, has referred to the various measures in place to help disadvantaged groups, but I believe the needs of the disadvantaged and what is being done for them bear repeating.  My colleague has already had extensive talks with various people in the urban areas who are serving young people affected by drug abuse or who are drop-outs and sleeping rough.  We are allocating lottery funds for special initiatives to help these people.  That programme will be launched within the next four weeks.  I do not care precisely where the money comes from, as long as it helps young people who have suffered the effects of deprivation from which they cannot recover of their own accord.  It would be very wrong of any party to denigrate any help for those young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of the Government in regard to the educational needs of disadvantaged groups is described in the <Col N="2295" /><i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, section IV, paragraphs 15-19.  I should mention that even though it has been necessary to limit expenditure we have not curtailed provision for disadvantaged groups.  The current VEC allocations will enable us to keep the community and literacy programmes in place at the same high level which was reached by the last portion of special funding given under the previous Government's programme. We have been enabled to keep it at that level.  We are making it a feature of the allocations that the VECs should fund those programmes as a priority, as well as programmes for travellers' centres and various initiatives taken by groups representing travellers' interests.</P>
    <P>Of the 200 or so posts for remedial education in the post-primary sector, about 100 have been allocated to the vocational education sector and this provision has been preserved, as has the provision of 41 ex-quota posts which take account of the needs of the disadvantaged. We have also provided 26 special resource teacher posts to VECs in order to assist them to make special provision for the handicapped.  We also have in place a number of curriculum projects.  Initiatives have been taken in dealing with disadvantaged groups, travellers' children, and curriculum needs and development.  These matters have been gone into very willingly and very early on by the VEC system.  The Vocational Education Act of 1930 has proved to be a most flexible piece of legislation.  The amendments we will be proposing to the Act will greatly help it but it is my wish that the thrust and direction of the original Act should remain.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party for putting down this motion and giving us the opportunity to contribute.  I do not doubt the integrity and sincerity of the Labour speakers and the signatories to the motion but it is extraordinary that the motion contains no suggestion as to where the money should come from.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 2 in the <Col N="2296" /> name of Deputy Máirín Quill of the Progressive Democrats, there is much of interest in the way the amendment is framed and presented and the points it contains.  I find myself unable, because of the general thrust of where the money is to come from, to support one particular aspect.  However, I recognise very clearly the objective way in which the subject has been approached, particularly with regard to the rationalisation and amalgamation of VECs.  The redundancy package is already on offer.  The amendment in the name of the Fine Gael spokesperson on Education, Deputy Hussey, is interesting and practical and I feel sure we will be able to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2, which is in my name, reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;conscious of the need to rationalise all resources in the post-primary sector of education, calls on the Minister to reduce the number of Vocational Education Committees, to suspend the present redundancy package on offer to post-primary teachers pending the outcome of a Review of Post-Primary Education by the Central Review Committee, and to refrain from the introduction of a rigid 20-1 pupil/teacher ratio in the second level sector which would discriminate against vocational, community and comprehensive schools operating in disadvantaged areas and would place an enormous financial burden on the Social Guarantee Programmes operated by FÁS and further erode the <Col N="2297" /> efforts already made to discourage students leaving school at an early age to participate in these schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In support of our amendment let me say this: in times of severe economic stringency when all targets cannot be met at once, it is imperative that we agree on absolute priorities within any sector of our public service.  In relation to education we argue that the retention of an adequate number of properly qualified and well motivated teachers is an absolute precondition to maintaining of standards in education and that to do otherwise will lead inevitably to a deterioration in standards.  That is our priority and that is why we as a party have concentrated consistently on the question of the pupil/teacher ratio.  We did so in relation to Circular 20/87 and we do so again here this evening.</P>
    <P>The main plank in our amendment is this: we call upon the Minister to suspend the redundancy package on offer to post-primary teachers pending the findings of the review of post-primary education by the Central Review Committee.  We further ask the Minister to make these findings known to this House so that this House can then make an informed judgment on the matter and that no action in relation to a reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio should take place until that is done.  That in effect, means putting a time limit on the deliberations of the review body.  It is only right and sensible that the Minister should proceed along these lines, otherwise she is asking this House to make decisions blindfolded, decisions which could have severe educational and financial implications later on.</P>
    <P>I am exceptionally concerned about what is already happening in the primary sector and I do not want to see the same beginning to happen in the post-primary sector.  At present we have the spectacle of experienced teachers being wasted out of the system, being let go with a generous enough golden handshake while, at the same time, calls are being made for replacement teachers to fill the vacancies caused by those who are being <Col N="2298" /> officially enticed out of the service.  These calls make very good sense on the educational front but the financial implications are very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>A central policy issue in teacher employment is that if teachers take up the State offer of redundancy in significant numbers and if in a short period it transpires that we have to recruit more teachers to remedy shortages, the net result will be that each new post will cost the taxpayer one and a half times the teacher's salary &mdash; that is, the salary of the teacher who is being wasted out of the system &mdash; together with the cost of the redundant teacher's lump sum.  The very concept of redundancy is based on there being an excessive number of employees in relation to the tasks for which the employees have been employed in the first instance.  I remain to be convinced that such is the case in relation either to first or second level schools.</P>
    <P>The large number of teacher applicants for redundancy does not in any way reflect an excessive number of teachers relative to the needs of education but it may very well reflect the attractiveness of the package as offered or perhaps it tells us something about the stress and the pressures that have to be endured by teachers in our first and second level schools at present.  For the point of this argument let me say this.  Each teacher who leaves education will take with him or her a considerable amount of valuable resources, not least of which is experience, experience which is very badly needed at present.  He or she will be paid not to teach and if in time that teacher has to be replaced, as will inevitably happen, the cost of the replacement will be close to twice the cost of paying the original teacher in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Unless it can be demonstrated objectively that there are too many teachers in the service at present, redundancy is not an appropriate means of rationalisation or an appropriate means of cutting back on budgets.  That is why we are asking for the findings of the review to be made available so as to allow us to make a judgment as to whether there are too many teachers in the service.  That is why <Col N="2299" /> we reject any efforts made to ask us to make that judgment when we are not in full possession of all the facts.  If, on the other hand, it can be proved to us that there are too many teachers and that there is a surplus of teachers, we will be delighted to find ourselves in that position because we can then proceed to provide within the system the very badly needed in-service training for teachers which has been called for consistently by everybody who is concerned about curriculum development and the direction which education should be taking at present.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that there is a great demand at present for more in-service training for our existing batch of teachers. If it can be proved to us in this House that we have a surplus of teachers, it would be an ideal opportunity to form a cadre of teachers who would stand by and fill in for the teachers who could then be pulled out of the system and sent or encouraged to go away to do in-service training.  That needs to be done and unless it is done now I can see no hope at all for the introduction of more modern languages, for example.  How can we properly provide for the teaching of German or Spanish or for the more effective teaching of modern European languages unless we have a sufficiency of qualified teachers?  The reality is that we do not have a sufficiency of teachers at present.  Our immediate challenge is to take teachers from our existing teaching stock and provide in-service training for them which would enable them to go back into the service and teach those subjects.</P>
    <P>The need is not alone in the field of languages.  We heard to our delight last week that the Minister is proposing to introduce technology into second level schools, and not before its time, but how can that be done effectively unless there is a sufficiency of teachers who are adequately qualified to devise, produce and teach the programmes?  This can only be done in the context of in-service training.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that if as a result of this review she finds there is a surplus <Col N="2300" /> of teachers she should grab that opportunity and avail of it to enable her to provide this much needed in-service training.  When the time comes when there is a sufficiency of trained or retrained teachers in the service and, perhaps at the same time, when the fall in the population begins to work its way into the system then the Minister will be in a position to offer redundancy to a certain number of teachers.  I am very worried about any offers of that kind being made before that time comes.</P>
    <P>I am delighted Deputy Higgins put down this motion as it gives us an opportunity to reflect, discuss and stop before too much damage is done to the system. My main difficulty with the motion is that at one level it is too narrow and asks for too little while at another level it can be said to be too wide and asks for more than we can reasonably be expected to provide at this time of economic stringency. When I say it is too narrow, let me immediately say that it is entirely simplistic to postulate that all children from economically deprived areas are bundled into State schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that and I am glad that fact is not ignored in the context of this debate as it is absolutely true.  As I have said it is foolish to assume that all voluntary secondary schools cater only for privileged children of wealthy parents.  That is not so and I know that from first hand experience.  I spent more than 20 years teaching in a convent school and increasingly I dealt with children coming from homes where there was severe unemployment due to closures, redundancies and so on because of the general breakdown of the traditional industries in the city of Cork.  Parents whose elder children could call on them <Col N="2301" /> for money for anything and everything, but now afflicted by unemployment, were sending their younger children to school on a vastly reduced income and on a vastly reduced attitude to education and to life.  That is only one school but it is one of many schools.  What Deputy Higgins asks for in relation to pupil teacher ratios must be extended to schools like that around the country.</P>
      <P>Considerable numbers of voluntary schools in common with VECs have begun to offer VPTP courses and have begun to move in the direction of a comprehensive curriculum in the manner of vocational schools.  In that sense the gap has already been narrowed.  I am told that there are 157 voluntary secondary schools now providing VPTP courses.  I hope they will continue to provide those courses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As was said in the main thrust of Deputy Higgins's speech last night, it is foolish to think we can apply a common ratio to all schools.  It is foolish to think that every school contends with the same <Col N="2302" /> conditions.  That is the implied supposition in what the Minister has done and it cannot be supported in any way. Any introduction of a common pupil-teacher ratio completely ignores the socio-economic position of the catchment area where so many of our schools are located.  These are not alone vocational, comprehensive and community schools but voluntary secondary schools as well. The proposition fails to take account of the standard of attainment of pupils at entry point.  Statistics from some schools in my own area show that students are coming to second level with a very low level attained.  It can be argued in the long term that that is something that should be remedied at first level.  Until we get around to doing that we cannot write off a generation of children who come to second level schools in that condition.  We must seek to put at that point adequate remedial services to enable those children to catch up if we have any ambition at all to work in the direction of equality of educational opportunities.  What we are talking about here is nothing that the Minister has not addressed in many of her speeches.</P>
    <P>I will not engage in a long descriptive talk about the conditions that have to be surmounted by children coming from certain areas.  I do not want to label children, for the purposes of making my argument, as coming from disadvantged areas.  Heaven knows that children coming from disadvantaged areas have enough difficulties to surmount without us officially labelling them as coming from disadvantaged areas and by definition as somewhat disadvantaged themselves. I would prefer to believe that everybody here knows what I am talking about when I say that it is unrealistic to expect schools in an area like Tallaght or Knocknaheeny in Cork to be able to provide a service with the same ratio as schools like Mount Anville or Christians College.  That is utterly unrealistic and must not be allowed to happen.  The Minister knows exactly what I am talking about as was evidenced when she spoke on the 1987 Estimates in this House and said in relation to the proposed reduction <Col N="2303" /> in population that this new situation would present us with opportunities, that she intended to ensure that full advantage is taken of them and that she hoped to use the opportunities presented by falling numbers to identify and examine areas of special need and to divert towards these areas some of the resources which will be released.  In a sense, all we are asking is that the Minister keep her word and extend to those areas which are clearly identifiable what the Minister promised to do in her speech in this House in November.</P>
    <P>Much of what I had planned to say about the potential of schools that have already embarked upon the vocational preparation courses has been made redundant.  I talked about redundancy earlier in my speech and much of my speech has been made redundant by what was said by the Minister, that her intention is to take the VPTP courses out of the schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Minister.  I had hoped to argue that these courses are courses that are taking us in the right direction.  I have the utmost faith in the principals and teachers who have designed and devised those courses and who have put them in place in their schools.  I see great hope in those courses. I thought I could ask the Minister with confidence here tonight for an extension of those courses into other schools that would like to and have a need to embark on those courses if they are to move away <Col N="2304" /> from the over-academic emphasis in education and towards an education that gears children for life and for work after school.  I hope that any additional resources that might come our way from ERASMUS or any other source would be stitched into the schools and not taken out of the schools or put to use in other agencies.  We do not know what other agencies are in question at this stage. The Minister's speech is very vague.  She merely says it will probably be delivered mainly out of school.  We have to wait until we get more specific information on that.</P>
      <P>I am worried about any efforts being made to take a section of our children and not try to actively encourage them to stay in mainstream education in our schools for as long as possible.  Inevitably children who drop out early and get any kind of educational attention outside of school, carry with them through life the brand of being early school-leavers and they carry out of the system a great handicap.  I would be much happier to keep those children in the schools.  If that meant setting up certain sections in classrooms within school buildings, it is worth the effort to do that and not have them as outcasts of the educational system so early in life because that has serious repercussions later.  I am worried about that and I hope the Minister will spell out more about that very soon.  That is a road down which I would not like the Minister to go.  There is valuable experience in teaching staffs in our vocational schools and in some voluntary secondary schools. I hope that experience will benefit other people who plan to devise more of these courses.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to rationalise the number of VECs and to work for a reduction from 30 to approximately 20. That is a good, positive move which gets my total support as does any measure that takes more money away from administration and puts it directly into classrooms.  I hope the Minister does that sooner rather than later.  I believe she mentioned next term and that is fine with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> Having decided to bite the bullet I hope the Minister will now go further down the road of rationalisation.  In some areas, especially areas of declining population, we have sometimes a duplication or often triplication of schools in the same area. In the spirit of the rationalisation that has begun and continuing down that road, it seems the time is ripe for the Minister to make her move and rationalise schools in that situation.  She can begin almost immediately by working towards the provision of specialised teachers on an area basis rather than a school basis.  I refer specifically to teachers of German or the new teachers of technology whom we hope to put in place shortly.  If we listen to everything said to us day after day by the CII, people involved in marketing and people who look to where the jobs are going to be in the future we realise that we do not have time on our side in relation to the introduction of more modern European languages, but it is unrealistic to expect we will be able to provide a teacher of German or a teacher of the new technological courses in every school at this time.  I hope the Minister will use her initiative to ensure that teachers of that nature, specialised teachers, are provided in certain areas on an area basis to make sure we do not have children perhaps in large urban areas or going to certain schools who will fairly quickly have access to teaching of those subjects while children in provincial towns and remote areas in smaller schools with small enrolments are totally denied access to these modern subjects and modern teaching.  I see the Minister going quickly down the road I have suggested and if that leads to more rationalisation that is good.</P>
    <P>Regarding the motion before us, I agree entirely with the section of it that relates to the pupil/teacher ratio.  I have no quarrel with that.  Certain other parts of the motion ask for more than we can reasonably expect to be provided in this economic climate and that is why I cannot give total support to the total content of the motion.  In the amendment proposed by Fine Gael I see little, if any, merit.  It is much too vague.  All it is asking is <Col N="2306" /> that a meeting be held to examine the implications of the decision to increase the pupil/teacher ratio.  It does not ask in any clear or definite way when that meeting will be held.  Deputy Hussey said a meeting could be convened next week, but really we got no response on that from the Minister.  It could equally be argued that that meeting could be convened the week after the new pupil/teacher ratio was put in place, then we would be closing the stable door after the horse had gone.</P>

      <P>Secondly, Deputy Hussey has asked for certain information.  Assuming that information is forthcoming in time, we have no clear indication of what Deputy Hussey would do with it herself or what she would ask the Minister to do with it. On those two grounds mainly I see no merit in that amendment.  It is far too weak.  In no way does it address itself to the serious issues involved here.</P>

It addresses itself to the priority need within second level education at this time.

Each and every one of us would like to pander to those who call for their own areas to be left unscathed.

      <P>I will be very brief anyway.  I would like, with your permission, to concentrate on the college areas.  It is important when we are talking about cuts that we recognise success in particular areas.  The college sector must be seen as one that has shown tremendous success for years.  For instance, student enrolment has gone from 10,000 in <Col N="2308" /> 1981 to 20,000 in the school year 1986-87. The number of lecturers and teachers in that sector shows a dramatic increase to 2,152 in the 1987-88 period.</P>
      <P>I was very pleased here tonight that the Minister mentioned the college authorities and staff who have been asked to ensure a greater linkage with industry. They have responded brilliantly.  Let me be parochial for a minute to prove that point.  In the Cork regional college a few short years ago there was absolutely no contact with industry.  Now they have generated in this year in excess of £300,000 by way of contracts through research and development, specialised courses for industry and industry-related student projects, thereby bringing the college an element of self-financing that is an absolute necessity at a time of financial constraints.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned the ERASMUS and COMETT programmes. It is important to emphasise the impact of COMETT in relation to the third level institutions in Cork.  Already 20 firms in that area have been linked into that programme. One could go further down the road and ask oneself how many jobs have been created in the Cork area since Fianna Fáil came into power.  Approvals have now surpassed 2,000 and the vast majority of those are high technology linked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like initially to thank all those who have contributed to the debate on this Labour Party motion.  I want to immediately, once again, thank representatives of The Workers' Party, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Independents who are supporting this motion without amendment.</P>
      <P>Let me say immediately that the Labour Party, as I mentioned last night are not accepting the Fine Gael amendment to this motion.  We are not doing so because, as I stated last evening, we are being invited to accept the bringing into existence of talks within a committee while at the same time deleting all those words from our own motion which call for the withdrawal of the threat to vocational education, the cuts that I said are clearly implied in the three sources that I mentioned: the changed ratios, the circular which the Minister has circulated in relation to gross pay savings, and the badly thought out redundancy scheme which she has circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither are we accepting the amendment in the name of the Progressive Democrats.  Time does not allow me to go into more detail.  Last night I made reference to the fact that that amendment accepts, for example, some things that are simply not acceptable to us.  For example, it does not grant the principle of prior consultation in relation to the proposed amalgamation of vocational education committees with all its connotations of reduced democratic participation and control.  Neither does it specify what it means by &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; and it seems to beg the question as to whether the Progressive Democrats are <Col N="2311" /> living within the so-called &ldquo;budgetary constraints.&rdquo; I believe that their motion is more clever, perhaps more devious, in so far as it appears to differ from the Fine Gael motion but it operates within the same logic.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by simply saying about that amendment that it offers nothing in response to those parents, to those teachers and to those who are involved in the vocational education sector who have asked us very explicitly to oppose the cuts in the vocational sector for reasons that I developed last night.  In response to that request different members of vocational education committees all over the country have met parents and teachers and have met those who work in the system at administrative and teaching levels and have entered into commitments.  In failing to support the Labour Party motion, people here who were party to those commitments given locally are now welching on them.  It is not possible, in the honourable democracy, to say something locally and to vote the other way in the Parliament.  This is the Dáil; it is here the decisions are taken. It is here tonight that the cuts in vocational education could be stopped.  I have said publicly &mdash; I said it last night &mdash; that if a guarantee was given even at this stage by the Minister for Education that she would withdraw the threat to the sector, I would, at that stage, be perfectly willing to have all the kind of meetings of committees dealing with inequality, to have all the discussions and so forth that we wished.  But to leave the threat there, to allow the people to leave the set, and at the same time participate in a committee would, in my view, be an exercise in cynicism.</P>
    <P>Very important points have been made in this debate by the Deputies who contributed. Deputy Mac Giolla correctly addressed the point that I did not have time today to deal with myself, the important principle of non-selectivity within the vocational sector which has been one of its great achievements and one of its great contributions since the Vocational Education Act of 1930.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2312" /> Deputy Kemmy mentioned the importance of maintaining courses and of not cutting them in an atmosphere of unemployment.  This brings me to a point which was made, and which I find very distasteful, by one Minister after another, speaking in an area other than the financial area.  They began their speeches, as did the Minister this evening, with the now tedious repetition that there is a consensus nationally about the state of the country's economy.  What they failed to say is that there is an agreement among 90 per cent of the people in this House on putting the debt problem before the unemployment problem and putting the debt &mdash; GNP ratio, the investment employment ratio &mdash; before the failure to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has sunk lower and lower within this consensus of the Right. Investment hardly surfaces at all.  I will give an indication of this from the Minister's speech because I like to deal with the world of the real and the world of the accurate.  The Minister gave a figure in her speech for total expenditure on education. She stated that the total gross cost of education in 1988 was £1,206 million approximately.  A great deal of attention has been addressed to this educational cost at this time in the life of the economy. Would that as much attention had been given to a figure that is greater &mdash; the cost of our total amount of transfers to promote industrial policy, which is about £300 million more.  If we paid as much attention to that we might not perhaps have the present position in relation to unemployment.  We are now being asked to sink into the sordid kind of economics to give priority to a kind of climatological theory of economics.  I challenge those who question the economic view of those of us on the Left and those who say that we are the economic illiterates.  Over there there is a pragmatic view of the economy.  How pragmatic is it to go on and on, week after week, talking about climatology like a demented weatherman from a television station who has wandered into an economic seminar?  The climate is improving; now we are going to get investment and <Col N="2313" /> if we wait the moisture level will go up and we will get the jobs.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with some real economic figures.  We have in this country no wealth tax at present.  It existed briefly for a period in the eighties.  At that time an assessment of about 1,200 individuals showed they had assets of £1,850 million in this country.  More importantly, we abolished even that meaningless attack on the wealthy.  If today that wealth tax existed at the same level as in the eighties it would be yielding £20 million.  Where are the 90 per cent who gave the £20 million back to the wealthy and are now taking it from disadvantaged children?  I have listened with more than my share of patience to people who, in that dangerous phrase, thanked me for putting down the motion so that they could have a fine debate, which meant that they could indulge in irrelevances that avoided the terms of the motion altogether.</P>
    <P>The motion is very specific.  It deals very firmly with a number of fundamentals in relation to the vocational sector.  I stated last night that I did not say that all the disadvantaged and the deprived are exclusively within this sector.  I referred to the recent publication by the ASTI.  This motion calls for no change in the ratios; it calls for the protection of jobs within the sector; it draws attention to the appalling level of buildings and the implications of freezing projects at different stages within the Department of Education; it mentions the threat to democracy that is involved by going ahead with proposals for amalgamation without prior consultation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One has listened a great deal this evening to people indulging their pet hobby-horses in relation to education.  The motion before the House is one that Fine Gael want to amend in favour of some kind of committee meeting and that the Progressive Democrats want to amend in favour of some form of rationalisation.  I cannot accept those amendments because it would be wrong of the Labour Party to go back on a <Col N="2314" /> commitment that we have given to this sector over many years.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to both the Minister of State's speech and that of the Minister. The latter will not give me much difficulty because apart from addressing the issue of amalgamation of VECs, the Minister ignored the motion altogether.  There was not a line in her speech about the changed ratios, not a line about the building programme, not a line about temporary teachers being under threat or about the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> about the recent appalling decision to remove the maintenance grant from the VPTP programmes which will affect the poorest and most disadvantaged families in the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fahey sat over there talking about what Fianna Fáil had always done for Galway.  I was entertained to a point. He said there was no school in this country that I could give as an example in which the woodwork teacher had no wood and using cardboard, as I had stated in my speech.  I challenge Deputy Fahey to go to the County Cork VEC and he will find a school or two in which this position prevails.  When speaking about this to a teacher afterwards she asked me if the Minister, when distributing the money from the national lottery, would distribute some funds to purchase flour for home economic teachers in some schools in the Dublin area, one of them quite close to the Taoiseach's constituency. Those schools have not been able to buy flour for the home economics courses because they have no funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day this motion is about egalitarianism and equality.  I have listened with more than my share of patience to the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and her colleagues drone and moan about the national debt.  I have listened to other people here in the past divide the national debt by every member of the population. It was as meaningful as if they divided it by the number of dogs in the country.  It is as good a statistic.  Are they saying that the children will not now come to the schools because they have lost £300 a year?  Are they saying that the people <Col N="2315" /> who will not have a teacher available to them created the national debt?  What an immoral suggestion that is.  We are being lured into accepting a philosophy, that even the most weak, disadvantaged and deprived must be driven further into an atmosphere without hope and told that they will not have courses in schools.  The maintenance grant will be taken away but the courses will be left.  Other things outside the school will be left for those who want them provided they are separate from the educational system.  This is a very regressive step and is not in the interest of any kind of equality.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the direction in which we are going.  The Minister talked very clearly in terms of her review and in terms of the courses that she is going to provide outside of education.  The Minister for Education and I will take up the implications of that again.  I want to make one point very clear.  As we spoke in this debate the situation got worse with the removal of the maintenance grant.  As we speak in this debate there are counties without adult education officers.  As we speak in this debate there are people who need remedial teaching.  There are people for whom the proper ratios are necessary if there is to be some kind of progress in relation to remedial care.  There are people who know their children will now <Col N="2316" /> be sent to buildings and rooms which the Department themselves have acknowledged are neither of the size nor have conditions of safety in which they can be taught practical subjects.</P>
    <P>This is not an argument to set the formal secondary level sector, the traditional sector, against vocational education.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before Private Members' Business, the Progressive Democrats' view about extending social insurance to the self-employed is that the case has not been made for it. The party believe that there are huge liabilities now being undertaken which have not yet been quantified and we believe that the argument for equity is not borne out by the way in which the case is being presented.</P>
      <P>If the extension of social insurance to the self-employed is the unqualified advantage as it is described by some Government speakers, then it cannot assist in the achievement of equity as claimed by other Government speakers. It seems that the extension of social insurance to the self-employed will have several significant political consequences. The first is that a major liability, which has not been quantified to the House by the Minister for Social Welfare, will be undertaken by the State.  The second is that the nature of social insurance will, unconsciously but nonetheless effectively, be undermined.  The third is that by damaging the concept of social insurance, which itself is under suspicion in any event, there will be political turmoil and social division created by pitting one interest group against another.</P>
      <P>Our view very simply is that if a case was made on the basis of equity to extend the PRSI burden to the self-employed in order to ease the burden on the PAYE sector we would support it but if it is, as we believe, a measure which will not in any sense ease the burden on the PAYE sector but will, in the long run, exacerbate the sense of deprivation and discrimination which they feel at the moment, then the measure must be rejected.</P>
      <P>On that account I am indicating to the House that we will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage the purpose of which will be to force the Government, first, to justify their decision to extend the PRSI system to the self-employed and secondly, to get the Government to come down one way or the other on the issue of whether this is being proposed in the interests of equity or in the interests of the self employed and the farming sectors.  Thirdly, our amendments will clearly underline the economic consequences of failing to quantify what the House is taking on in terms of liabilities now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequences of the Bill before us are unpredictable in many respects and, in so far as they can be predicted, are unfair.  One immediate effect of the Bill being passed will be that for the first time a small holder in the west of Ireland, <Col N="2323" /> who at the moment is eligible for what is colloquially referred to as the farmers dole will, when he reaches the qualifying age, be entitled to a social insurance pension on the contributory level.  He will have, due to circumstances beyond his control, contributed nothing to the system.  I understand that 55,000 small holders are to benefit.  Am I wrong about that figure? Has the Minister changed that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for that decision.  Originally the Minister proposed to extend to 55,000 farmers the benefits of the system.  At least he has retracted from that position and I bow to his decision in that respect.  That is one manifest injustice avoided.  However, we are faced with an extension of the PRSI system in an unfunded way.  Pay-as-you-go social welfare is to be extended to a group who do not need the benefits of that extension.  Pay-as-you-go social welfare is to be extended to cover people who at the moment are providing for their own pensions in some cases and in other cases do not wish to do so because of their net capital position going into their retirement.  In those circumstances it appears that the net effect of the extension is to dissipate the redistributional arm of Government and to extend benefits to those who cannot make out a case based on need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our chief objection to the Bill is that it is extending benefit to those who cannot make out a case based on need.  It is extending it on a diffuse and self-contradictory logic, that it is somehow demanded by equity and, at the same time, is an unqualified advantage to those to whom it is extended.  Those two arguments do not stand up; they contradict each other and in the last analysis the <Col N="2324" /> mathematics are not satisfactorily established or made out by the Government. My view is that we are undertaking liabilities today which we have not quantified and cannot justify in terms of social need. At some time in the future there will be a reckoning in relation to the liabilities we are undertaking.  Some group of politicians, whether us or a different group, will have to contend with the results of what is being done today.  The fact that it may be ten or 11 years down the line is irrelevant because somebody will have to clear up the mess we are creating today.  That mess was born of political motives, not motives based on social justice. It is a mess which was created by a confusion of thought, not clarity of thought, not a desire to focus redistribution but, on the contrary, a desire to diffuse social redistribution.  The consequences will be political ones for our successors in this House.</P>
    <P>It is my view, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that the measure as proposed is likely in the last analysis to lead to a weakening of the social will to redistribute resources, is likely to increase the level of taxation on work and effort, is likely to work in the wrong direction in focusing redistribution of resources on those who do not need in our society rather than on those who do need.  For those simple but pressing reasons we oppose this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his caring and concerned attitude towards the poor and the less well off. This Bill shows that he fought and won a battle at the Cabinet table to ensure that people in this sector will be protected, despite the overall financial constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases are on the lines proposed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the greater increases being given to those on the lowest income.  There is a 3 per cent increase in widow's and old age pensions, unemployment, disability and other payments but there are much higher increases for those on unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  The Government have recognised the plight of the lower <Col N="2325" /> income group.  There is an 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of unemployment assistance and a 6 per cent increase in rates for dependent children. I welcome the streamlining of the rates for child dependants.  In future there will be only two rates.  These special increases are a major step in the Government's plan to provide additional assistance for those in receipt of the lowest social welfare payments.  This is the first time any Government have decided to do something for these people, particularly the single person and the family who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  All of us would like to see the Minister go further but we must admit that in the face of current financial difficulties he has done a reasonable job in ensuring that these people are protected.</P>
    <P>The pre-retirement scheme for those aged 60 or more is very welcome.  The chances of such people ever getting a job again are remote.  In the face of that unfortunate reality, it is unfair to ask such people to make a claim in the local exchange week after week.  Many of them will welcome this change as being in their best interests.  I hope they will not be continually harassed by social welfare officers trying to find out if they are earning a few pounds extra.  These officers have enough to keep them busy without concentrating on people in this category and I would ask the Minister to ensure that they will not be bothered.</P>
    <P>It is only right to expect that people who are to receive pensions should pay some contribution towards them.  Naturally the self-employed are not too happy with the new scheme but they must recognise that the PAYE worker has been carrying the tax burden for far too long.  I hope the self employed will pay in the right spirit.  Payments are being phased in over a number of years and I would ask the farming organisations and those representing the self employed to accept this decision in the knowledge that they will be given a pension regardless of their means.  This will give them a certain degree of independence.  I do not think the PAYE sector are prepared to accept that they should have to pay £331 million <Col N="2326" /> this year alone for non-contributory pensions. At present approximately 70 per cent of formerly self-employed people qualify for social assistance pensions for which they have not contributed.  I welcome this decision and I hope the Minister will ensure that the contributions are collected.</P>
    <P>The timelag between the submission of a claim for unemployment assistance and the issuing of a decision is far too long, sometimes lasting several months. Delays of this kind in my county are a disgrace.  The attitude of some social welfare officers is deplorable in that they treat the individual in an unacceptable manner.  In the past few years a number of people who had been self employed have been obliged to apply for unemployment assistance.  Because they were assessed on the basis of the previous year's income many of them were told that their means for the period disqualified their claim for unemployment assistance.  These decisions were appealed and in most cases they were successful.  It is ridiculous to assess a person on a previous year's income because that money will have been spent on supporting a family.  The Minister should consider streamlining these procedures. It takes several months for an appeal to be heard, during which time the applicant is dependent on supplementary welfare allowance at a reduced rate.  It is very difficult in such circumstances to live above the poverty line.</P>
    <P>I welcomed last year the introduction of dental and optical treatment for spouses of insured people.  The majority of women have benefited from this scheme but unfortunately dentists in Wexford have refused to operate it.  This amounts to discrimination against Wexford women.  The Minister should intervene to resolve the matter and I appeal to dentists in the area to co-operate. There is an open invitation to any unemployed dentist to set up in Wexford, where he would undoubtedly make plenty of money.  A large number of people have applied for treatment under this scheme but they cannot be catered for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> While I was in Opposition I criticised the fact that widowers are not properly looked after.  In many cases a man has to give up work to look after his family and all he can claim is unemployment assistance. A widower with two children receives £57.30, while an unmarried mother with one child receives £57.80. That man is expected to look after the extra child for nothing.  A family in such position are living below the poverty line. While I recognise the scarcity of money, the Minister should consider this point to see if something can be done next year. Where it can be shown that a widower is looking after his family on his own he should receive a special allowance.  There is no way that a widower at present can look after his family and provide them with a decent standard of living on such a small income.  I have nothing against unmarried mothers or widows but inequality exists on the man's side.  That is an area which should be seriously looked at by the Department of Social Welfare as it is a source of serious concern at present.</P>
    <P>The public have expressed concern at the number claiming unmarried mother's allowance.  In 1973, 1,633 people claimed unmarried mother's allowance while in 1987 the figure had gone up to 14,000.  I will not say that there is a certain amount of fraud in this area but it is an area which should be seriously looked at.  At present the unmarried mother's allowance is £57.80 while unemployment assistance is £37.80, making a total of £95.60.  In the case of a married couple with one child, the unemployment assistance would be £74.  Therefore, so far as that part is concerned, there is no incentive for couples to get married.  This is an area where a lot of money is being spent which need not be spent.  I accept that there are many genuine cases but there are many other cases which I would be rather sceptical about.</P>
    <P>Fraud was mentioned earlier in the debate.  The Minister has certainly started a war on the abuses within the social welfare system.  This is to be welcomed because at the end of the day <Col N="2328" /> those who will pay for the fraud in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit are the taxpayers who are, as I have already said, overburdened.  At present unfair competition exists in the workplace because of the abuses which are taking place in the social welfare system.  I know of many businesses which paid full wages to their employees, which paid PRSI and all of the other levies and yet were forced out of business while at the same time cowboy operators who employ people who are claiming the dole do not have to pay any such contributions. For that reason I welcome the Minister's attack on this area.  I also welcomed his decision before Christmas to impose substantial fines on employers who were found to be employing such people.  I hope the Minister will continue to try to get rid of the abuses in the social welfare system.  I have no hang-ups about a person working an odd day but what is unacceptable is a carpenter or a bricklayer working on a full time basis while at the same time drawing unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Another source of grave concern in my own county is moneylending.  I do not think that any Minister or the Garda Síochána have come to grips with this problem.  In many ways moneylending amounts to legalised robbery.  The moneylenders hound people.  They give loans at special interest rates and when the borrowers, who are usually from the least well off sector, are not able to meet their repayments they will be given further loans which causes even more problems. I would like to see a link up between the Department of Social Welfare and the credit unions so as to ensure that loans can be made available to people in the lower income groups who need them. The moneylenders should be put out of existence.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase in the income limit for the family income supplement in line with the increases in the rates of unemployment benefit.  Over 5,000 people now avail of this scheme.  I believe that more people should be brought within this scheme.  Perhaps for reasons unknown to us, people are not <Col N="2329" /> applying.  I would like to see those who are barely over the income limit included in the scheme.  Rather than to increase the amount of money which they are getting at present I would be inclined to bring them into the scheme.  There are many people who are barely above the income limit who are finding it very difficult to make ends meet.  It is important that we bring as many of those people as possible into the scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like again to compliment the Minister for the work he has done in the area of social welfare.  Since returning to that Department he has done an excellent job.  He has concerned himself with the poor, the least well off, those who are unable to find jobs but who need a decent standard of living so that they can look after their families.  I hope that the Minister next year will be able to give an even more substantial increase to those who need the moneys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I am happy that the Minister has increased the social welfare payments for the disadvantaged.  Since becoming a Member of this House I have heard various compliments being paid to Ministers for Social Welfare for the ways in which they were able to extract from Ministers for Finance increases in the benefits paid to those who are unemployed, sick or unable to look after themselves. However, this Bill is just going to add to the mountain of social welfare legislation which already exists.  Those who are badly off will come to realise, such is the complicated language which is being used by the Department of Social Welfare, that they are being deprived.  Let me give one example.  In the case of two brothers living together and claiming unemployment assistance, one brother will receive the full rate of unemployment assistance while the other will receive a reduced rate because his brother is expected to keep him.  I do not know which Minister can claim the legislation which brought this inequity about but that example is only part of the problem in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" /> During the term of office of the previous Minister for Social Welfare we in the west had a particular problem in regard to the assessment for social assistance of small farmers and smallholders. Some of the reforms brought into the system certainly brought about improvement in so far as the smallholders began to understand exactly why they were being assessed, how they were being assessed and when they would be assessed.</P>
    <P>Other speakers criticised social welfare officers but in my experience they are, by and large, very conscientious.  In any large organisation such as the Department of Social Welfare there will be people who make mistakes when they visit people especially when there is a means assessment.  However, by and large they are very conscientious and they examine the means of the applicant according to the regulations.  The real problem relates to getting due notice to the applicants and giving an indication as to exactly how the social welfare officer will question them and as to what documents they should have ready.  When they are assessed, applicants do not get back a copy of the document that has been used by the social welfare officer to calculate means.  This leads to a lot of aggravation and people claim they do not properly understand what has gone on.  I suggested to the previous Minister and I think he got the Department's officers to agree that a photocopy of this document should be sent back to each applicant. Unfortunately, that is still not the practice in the Department.  Will the Minister examine the system thoroughly and perhaps social welfare officers will agree to my suggestion.  Social welfare officers operate out of offices where somebody is not always in attendance and it is difficult for the applicants to get hold of the material they must have in order to verify the assessment.</P>
    <P>Farmers' dole still plays an important part in the west.  In some cases it has played a major part in saving families from destitution.  It has also assisted in allowing very difficult circumstances to <Col N="2331" /> be surmounted.  This area should be continuously reviewed.  Interest payments on borrowings and other items should get more prominence on the social welfare document sent out for the assessment of means and greater latitude should be given to the officers in making their assessments.  I do not agree that two brothers, one with a family on five acres, should have their total social assistance divided in half.  They would normally qualify for approximately £34, but generally speaking brothers in those circumstances would get £17 each if there is any means of that nature.  There should be a further review in this area.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have assessed the background to social welfare and social assistance and many have referred to social insurance.  The money being held by the Department of Social Welfare does not cover a social insurance fund.  Pay-related social insurance is a misnomer.  The claims being made for farmers and the self-employed by Government speakers about the new proposal to extend pay-related social insurance to them are totally wrong.  In the case of farmers I cannot see how the mobility of land will be improved by bringing farmers into a pay-related system where when they reach the age of 66 they will qualify for an old age pension.  The means test in the non-contributory old age pension was a definite way to get an old man or woman to give up the land and it was a cheap way of insisting on the mobility of land.  I am afraid that if this comprehensive proposal of the Minister goes through, groups like Macra na Feirme and the young farmers will be waiting a long time before they get a satisfactory system introduced in the future.</P>
    <P>Even accounting for the farmers who are paying into the fund there will be a shortfall in respect of these pensions when they fall due.  I do not understand the trade union position that says we will get a small contribution from farmers and the self-employed towards this pay-related social insurance and we will pay them out in excess of what they have contributed.  How would the shortfall be <Col N="2332" /> made up?  Is it not the PAYE people who cannot avoid income tax who will have to pay?  Is it not the trade union people who will eventually have to pay the contributory pensions of the farmers and self-employed when they are already paying for non-contributory old age pensions and the like?  I see the Minister of State shaking his head.  If there is to be a special fund set up to deal with pensions for the farmers and the self-employed and the rate of pension is to be determined by the contributions of the farmers and the self-employed, then I can understand it will not be a burden on the PAYE taxpayer. The pay-related fund has been undersubscribed for a number of years. Now it is only going to meet its targets because the Minister in successive years reduced the payment of pay-related benefits by altering the qualifying percentages.</P>
    <P>When the idea of pay-related social insurance was first mooted it was meant to provide individuals with substantial sums to meet the shock of unemployment. It had a social importance, but never lived up to that when a large number became unemployed.  There was a shortfall in the fund and as the numbers of unemployed and people on social welfare assistance grow the dependency for more and greater contributions on the PAYE sector will become more marked. The figure used from the Government side of £300 million for non-contributory old age pensions takes into account people who have for the last ten years been unemployed and have made no contribution whatsoever to the fund.  They will reach the age of 65 in due course and are unlikely to contribute any increase to the Exchequer because the projected unemployment figures for 1988 in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance allow for at least the same number of people unemployed.  If the matter were assessed accurately many more should be provided for especially when even the optimistic Taoiseach agrees that zero growth rate is his forecast for 1988.</P>
    <P>The extension of PRSI to the self-employed and the farmers is a great mistake, setting up another quango, another <Col N="2333" /> cost factor which will in the long run lead to greater demands on and cost to the State.  I cannot understand the rate of payment expected from farmers.  When the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was being discussed by the Taoiseach and the various sectors of the economy including the farmers, no percentage or idea of assessment was discussed.  I could not understand, for instance, how the former president of the IFA, Mr. Joe Rea, came out from a meeting with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach not knowing what figure was to be charged for PRSI or levies on farmers' income.  It is unbelievable that he would make an agreement without knowing the figure.  If a charge was being imposed on him and he did not know what it was he would be the very man to kick up about it.  I would understand that the president of the IFA sees great benefits accruing to the farmers and the farming community as a result of their inclusion in this new scheme for PRSI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wandered a little in using the former president's name.  I will continue without using his name.  If the farmers' organisations believe there is a major plus in it for them must the other sectors of the economy, for instance the trade unions, not examine this?  If farmers are to get good value for it, the shortfall experienced already in the social fund surely must be made up by people other than farmers.  The organisations involved are quite capable of setting up their own pension schemes, and I commend the latest move by the IFA to set up a fund which would insure family farms against inheritance tax and other such problems when they arise.  They are organised well enough in FBD and their own insurance schemes to provide proper pensions for themselves.  Pension schemes could be of value even to the farmers themselves and &mdash; I see the Minister of State for forestry <Col N="2334" /> present &mdash; let me say pension funds of this nature could be directed towards forestry development which in turn would benefit the farmers.  That would be a positive measure for the economy rather than the current proposal which generally most economists see as the wrong move at the wrong time.</P>
      <P>Claims were made in this House that a Green Paper was published ten years ago about providing PRSI for the entire economy. Why was it not acted on?  Why did Ministers in the famous years between 1978 and 1981, when all the money was being spent, not extend PRSI to those people at that time when this measure could reasonably have been expected to be accepted by the people involved? When we had an increasing standard of living, was that not the right time to introduce such a proposal?  Now the Minister is bringing in this item which is going to increase the costs and eventually this factor will go against the competitiveness of Irish goods abroad.  It is a multiplying factor.  In the long run it will lead to a loss of jobs and employment in this country.  The measure is unnecessary and I appeal to the Minister to review the matter and examine the proposals of the Fine Gael spokesman on social welfare, Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
      <P>This area of social welfare impinges greatly on sick people.  As I have said on previous occassions, I am dissatisfied with the medical referee system particularly because when people, even people seriously ill, are assessed if they are able to open their mouths and give their names the medical referee is inclined to designate them fit for work and they are cut off from benefit straight away.  Such a person can find himself without income for 15 days at least and because of the new credit system he could be waiting another 15 days for unemployment assistance. Anomalies have arisen.  I know people can obtain supplementary welfare, but some people are not made aware of these things and experience a period of distress before being made aware of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates should be notified of what <Col N="2335" /> documents the medical referee will require prior to the assessment.  I have seen cases where people who were supported by senior consultants in the city of Dublin have been turned down by medical referees of the Department of Social Welfare.  What seems to give most difficulty to the Department of Social Welfare is the problem of individuals not being able, because of sickness, to travel to the venue appointed to meet the medical referee, and great distress follows the disallowance.  Medical certificates given by applicants' general practitioners have been ignored by the medical referee.  In calling such people for assessment the Department know from the medical evidence provided by the general practitioner what is wrong with the applicant and they should state that the person is required to prove that he is suffering from this ailment.  Some people have had to go to a third medical referee accompanied by their GP to verify that they were seriously ill.</P>
    <P>People who suffer from depression are very badly treated by medical referees. Perhaps if the Department made direct contact with the GP in such cases it would be a better system.  This may be placing an onus on the GP but after all there is a bond and a trust there when the first claim is made and why should that not continue when the appeal is being examined?</P>
    <P>Another aspect is the effect on the 10,000 skilled people being made redundant this year by the Government.  I am critical of this proposal to make 50 year olds and, if necessary, 40 year olds, redundant.  These skilled people will end up walking around towns like Ennis or Limerick taking up part-time work as petrol pump attendants or driving self-drive cars and pushing the already marginalised people out.  I am coming to an end.  I would like to see some scheme established between the Department of Social Welfare and FÁS to protect the people who can use these jobs.  If these totally skilled people who have been prematurely made redundant flood the market it will be totally unjust to people <Col N="2336" /> at present doing part-time work.  I appeal to the Minister to rethink his whole attitude to pay-related benefit for farmers and the self-employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year when I spoke on the Social Welfare Bill I praised the Minister for his approach to the whole question of social welfare, even in the short space of time he had been in office. He had a very fresh approach.  At that time my remarks were greeted with a certain amount of cynicism and scepticism by the Opposition but I think my remarks were justified.  I have no hesitation this year in reiterating what I said in relation to the Minister.  His record in the past year has been an exceptionally good one.  This Bill shows that he is going to continue his good work in the coming year.  It is obvious that the Minister is very committed and dedicated to the brief he has and is trying to ensure that the people who need to be catered for under the social welfare code will be fully catered for.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the evidence of the Minister's willingness to try new approaches and to listen to other people's ideas, not just those on his own back-benches but on the Opposition benches as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going into the details of the Bill it is important to reiterate the financial context in which we are looking at this Bill.  We are all very much aware that we have had severe budgetary restraints and many Departments have had to face severe cuts.  In social welfare, one of the highest spending Departments, one would have expected severe cuts as well. But again, by his wise approach to the whole area of social welfare, the Minister has managed to maintain, in real terms, the spending in his own Department by improved efficiency and by ensuring that there is less loss of public money through abuse.  The Minister is to be commended on the fact that he has cut back on fraud and on various abuses within the social welfare code and has given the money saved back to the people who deserve it, <Col N="2337" /> those on social welfare.  I will be referring to that later.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare mentioned among their recommendations four main areas for priority attention.  The first was improving the basic payments for those at the lowest payment levels; secondly, improving the level of income support for families; thirdly, a broadening of the social insurance base and, finally, improving the quality of the service being delivered by the Department of Social Welfare.  I intend, very briefly, to use those four headings in my short speech on this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the area of improving the basic payments for those at the lowest payment levels, it is very clear that the Minister in this Bill is carefully following that recommendation. We all know that inflation is now running at approximately 2.5 per cent to 2.75 per cent but in this Bill the Minister has given across-the-board increases of 3 per cent.  It is the first time in many years that the Minister for Social Welfare has exceeded the level of inflation, even when we take into account some of the high increases of 20 per cent and so on that were granted earlier in the eighties.  Inflation was running higher at that time.</P>
    <P>In addition, as he did last year, the Minister has set the date for implementing the various increases in July. Deputies will recall that last year in the Fine Gael budget a November start-up date was proposed which would have meant severe difficulties for many people on social welfare.  I have no doubt that critics of this Government and of the Minister will cry that this is not enough. They will look for a higher percentage increase and an earlier date.  Some of them might even go so far as to say that it should be back-dated but we are living in the real world and we have to work within the real parameters that are set for us by the economic constraints we are faced with.  The Minister has done extremely well to increase all these benefits by 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister went even further in relation to the child dependant rates.  He increased some of those payments by 6 <Col N="2338" /> per cent and this is very welcome.  A side-effect of this increase is a lessening of the bureaucracy involved in the social welfare code.  At present there are 36 different rates of payments for child dependants.  With the way this increase is being implemented, that number will be halved and there will be now only 18 rates of payment for child dependants. Even 18 is too many but it is a step in the right direction and I hope that figure will be reduced even further next year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest evidence of the Minister's commitment to the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare is the fact that he has increased some social welfare payments by 11 per cent&mdash; those on the lowest level of social assistance will get an 11 per cent increase. That is a very welcome move and one which I have not heard anybody criticise &mdash; or anybody from the Opposition praise &mdash; and the Minister should be commended for it.  There was little dignity for a single man living alone trying to live on unemployment assistance of £34 or £35 per week.  It was evident that many of these people had to go to the health board for supplementary welfare allowance which was also paid by the State.  I hope the move that has been made this year will be continued next year.  The size of the increase in this case was as unexpected as it was welcome.  The Minister has done a good job.  Overall, the fact that the Minister has allocated an extra £101 million to social welfare for a full year will be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>The second area I want to speak about is that of improving the level of income support for families.  In this regard I refer again to the family income supplement. Last year I said this was a very worthwhile scheme.  It had been introduced by the previous Government and I commend them for that.  I commend the Minister for continuing it and I hope it will be improved during the coming year.  It is the only scheme that I know of, whether in the tax code or the social welfare code, where there seems to be some form of positive discrimination in favour of the family.  We always claim to hold the family in very high regard but over the <Col N="2339" /> past decade or so the family, as the basic unit of society, has not been given the recognition it deserves by the State.  I hope the family income supplement, as one of the positive measures to assist the family, will be improved in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that, again, this year the take-up in this area has been very low and I hope that something can be done to improve it.  I am sure that more than the 5,000 families or so who are benefiting from this scheme could and should be benefiting from it.  I know from the remarks made by the Minister that a review is to take place on the family income supplement.  Like Deputy Browne, I suggest to the Minister that, instead of increasing the amounts to be paid, he should try to expand the scheme so that more people would qualify under it.  That would be more beneficial.  It is a welcome boost to the families who are already in receipt of the benefit.  I also suggest that perhaps the Minister would consider taking more than six children into account in his calculations for family income supplement.  I know it is tied, to a certain extent, to the average industrial wage and where there is a larger family involved perhaps this could be dispensed with.  Everybody knows how difficult it is to rear a family, with all the additional expenses that are put to them.</P>
    <P>With regard to broadening the social insurance base, there has been quite a considerable number of contributions regarding the introduction of the new insurance scheme for the self-employed. Undoubtedly, this is the most important change in the Social Welfare Bill and probably the most controversial.  Many of the Opposition speakers have condemned it.  All of them seem to be working on the same set of figures by the same gentleman who was mentioned by Deputy McDowell earlier.  The Minister has, on a number of occasions, corrected that.  The person who first challenged the Minister's figures in relation to this matter has not come back to deny that the Minister was right.  The previous speakers came in here today with this <Col N="2340" /> notion and tried to grasp at some kind of straw, at something with which to criticise this move.  They used the same set of figures which the Minister had disproved many times over the past couple of weeks.  They insist on advancing the same arguments.  I would suggest that, before any other Opposition speaker talks about the cost of this to the State and the fact that the PAYE taxpayer will be paying for the farmer again &mdash; they take a good, hard look at the figures when they will find that the Minister is correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe claimed that the Government introduced this without careful consideration.  He claimed more or less that the Government rushed into it without taking anything into consideration. I think Deputy O'Keeffe was wrong.  He was wrong to criticise the National Pensions Board who did a fine job in drawing up their report.</P>
    <P>One other Deputy talked about the £2 flat rate breaking small farmers.  The reaction I have had on the part of small farmers around County Meath, is quite the opposite.  They welcome the chance to draw an old age contributory pension for which they will be eligible when they reach the age of 66 &mdash; there may be changes effected in that figure &mdash; when they will not have to satisfy any means test.  That is a more realistic attitude than that of some Opposition spokespersons.</P>
    <P>Some people have advocated what might be described as an opting-out clause.  It should be remembered that the basis of any insurance scheme is that one takes on the good and bad risks together, overall evening out the cost; people cannot be allowed to opt out.  For example, if an individual's circumstances change and he or she decides to opt out early on and their circumstances change again in, say, ten or 15 years time, when they would like to have the opportunity of opting in again, it could be too late to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the major objections to this scheme has been that it will cost the State money.  I can only reiterate that that theory is based on a false premise.  It is based on the figures given, on a rate of 4.5 per cent on a ceiling of £15,000.  But <Col N="2341" /> the rate will be 5 per cent and unearned income will be included.  The upper limit has been increased already this year from £15,500 to £16,200.  Therefore, it will be seen that people are working from a false premise.  They should examine the scheme again before voicing any further criticism.</P>
    <P>One feature of the scheme which is very welcome is the move to group PRSI contributions, health charges, the youth levy and tax altogether so that they can be collected together by the Revenue Commissioners.  My experience on the Committee of Public Accounts has shown me that separate collection leads to more problems.  The fact that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to collect all of these charges together will give an impetus to their collection, ensuring a higher collection rate.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the Jobsearch programme which &ldquo;saved&rdquo; the Government and the Department of Social Welfare £22 million last year.  It was contended by Opposition speakers that we would not be able to conduct 140,000 or 150,000 interviews in the course of a year.  In fact there were over 141,000 interviews conducted.  As a direct result of that programme 4,239 people were placed in jobs and just over 30,000 were placed on AnCO courses with a further 10,000 on Jobsearch courses. That was a remarkable achievement. Some people may criticise it, contending that they were phoney jobs and so on but the people who benefited do not say that. They are glad of having been given an opportunity to do something useful over a certain period.</P>
    <P>I might address the charges that people were bounded out of claiming unemployment assistance.  Approximately 12,000, in fact nearly 13,000 people left the unemployment register voluntarily; they disappeared from the register.  I am sure they had their reasons for so doing; I have a fair idea of what they were and are.  In fact anybody in the country would know what they were.  A total of 1,951 claims were disallowed as a result of the Jobsearch programme, representing less <Col N="2342" /> than 1.5 per cent of the total number of people called under the provisions of that programme.  That belies the suggestion on the part of many that people were hounded, that this represented a way of getting them off the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>My experience of the Jobsearch programme operated in Navan, County Meath, is that most people there were very satisfied after, I will admit, initial hiccups and problems having been encountered about which I will speak in a moment.  They were very satisfied with the attention they received and the approach adopted by those people designated to help them. There was reference to a survey of Jobsearch participants which was conducted following their involvement in the programme. The statistics would seem to bear out what I am saying, in that 75 per cent of those who participated said they found it useful and, more importantly, 72 per cent of them felt more confident in going for a job having participated in the programme.  Those figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I know there were some problems encountered initially in Navan and, I am sure, in other areas also.  Undoubtedly there can be improvements effected in the operations of the scheme.  For example, we might be somewhat more selective in the mix of people placed on the Jobsearch programme.  Again from my experience of its operations in County Meath I know there were very young people, not long out of school with no work experience, alongside people of 50 or 55 involved in the same programme. It was not easy for the older participants to have to do things that the younger, more educated, felt they could do very easily.  At times it was embarrassing for the older participants.</P>
    <P>There did not seem to have been any effort made to grade people on the basis of their literacy skills.  Let us face it, most people leaving school nowadays have good levels of literacy whereas older people &mdash; who had to leave school for various reasons earlier in the forties and fifties &mdash; might not have the same level <Col N="2343" /> of literacy.  There did not seem to be any account taken of that fact.  I might reiterate my general point that there should be a more selective approach adopted to the participants on one of these programmes. I might also suggest that participants be involved more in deciding course content. I know this occurred in Navan and was very successful.  It may happen in other centres also.</P>
    <P>I hope, in future Jobsearch programmes, the anomaly that arose in the course of the year about the entitlements of people on Jobsearch programmes &mdash; who were told they would have the same entitlements as if they were in receipt of unemployment assistance &mdash; found suddenly around Christmas time that they could have been without fuel vouchers and bonuses.  I made representations to the Minister at the time and that problem was ironed out.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to the need to improve the quality of service advocated by the Commission on Social Welfare. This is one of the areas where the Minister for Social Welfare has shone.  He has provided, and is providing, a much better service for everybody involved.  Up to now our exchanges were based mainly on the idea of serving the unemployed only but the Minister clearly intends that the social welfare offices should be geared to all our social welfare needs.  I hope that that trend will be speeded up as much as possible during the next four or five years. I also note the Minister's plans for computerisation of local offices that has already been tackled in a number of centres and, as somebody mentioned earlier, that programme will continue during the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is, and has always been, a case in the Department of Social Welfare, more than in any other Government Department, for a complete localisation of services, not just from the point of view of people having a certain local knowledge but also for combining the work of the Department of Social Welfare and the work of the community section of the health boards.  It is ridiculous that a <Col N="2344" /> person who is disallowed for unemployment assistance has to go to his community welfare officer and instead of getting his assistance from the Department of Social Welfare he has to get it from the Department of Health.  There is a separate means test in both cases.  The localisation of services should help to cut down this duplication of services at local level.  In this regard the proposal by the Minister for one-stop shops is most welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned the plight of widowers and I should like to add to that the plight of deserted husbands who are trying to rear families.  Some people who have been left in this situation, whether they are deserted husbands with families or widowers, are in a limbo.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  I realise that there are probably very severe cost implications involved in what I am saying but, in justice, we have to try to end this discrimination against fathers, husbands and widowers who are trying to rear families. I ask the Minister to look at this area and I reiterate what Deputy Browne said.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the dental scheme which probably is not within the scope of the Social Welfare Bill but which is within the Minister's brief.  I regret very much that dentists have not thrown their full weight behind the extension of the treatment scheme which the Minister introduced last year.  They are operating their own form of discrimination against married women who work in the home. I appeal to them to end this discrimination immediately.  They are responsible for it.</P>
    <P>In relation to dental treatment, a problem that has arisen in the North Eastern Health Board area is the cost of orthodontic treatment for people whether they have medical cards or hospital services cards.  It is practically impossible to get orthodontic treatment within the North Eastern Health Board area on the health board scheme.  It is equally impossible for many families, and not just those on social welfare, to pay the cost of orthodontic treatment especially, as happens in some cases, when two or three people <Col N="2345" /> in a family need it.  I ask the Minister to consider some kind of scheme, even if it is a loan scheme, which would allow people to borrow money either from the Department of Social Welfare or from a fund run by the Department of Social Welfare, so that people and, in particular, children can get the vital dental treatment they need.  This is a serious problem and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the clearing up of the anomaly in the Social Welfare Bill in relation to <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  This is an anomaly which we have all come across at various times and the 1,700 people concerned will welcome the fact that it has been cleared up.  I should also like to welcome the fact that the local authority contribution to the cost of unemployment assistance is being dispensed with.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few comments on sections 19 to 22 in Part IV of the Bill. Section 19 is a substantial improvement and will serve as a much better deterrent to those who defraud the social welfare system.  Too often after exhaustive investigations people are brought before the courts and charged with defrauding the system only to have the Porbation Act applied to them.  Having to refund money before the Probation Act can be applied will make a huge difference in recouping the losses from fraud and in deterring other types of fraud.  I welcome the provision for the increased penalties.  If the provision for these penalties were implemented many more improvements could be made for those people who live in poverty.  If we can get rid of all the abuses within the system we will have a lot more money for those who deserve it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts to deal with social welfare abuse whether by employers or by employees. The Minister earlier announced a crackdown on the abuse of the unmarried mother's allowance.  This crackdown is on the abuse of the allowance, not on the allowance.  When an announcement like this is made it is inevitable that there will be cries from various sectors about harassment of people and so on but I think the voices of the people who are <Col N="2346" /> paying for all these services should also be heard.  If there is abuse it should be tackled and I commend the Minister for his courage in tackling some of the very serious abuses we have had for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to confine myself to two areas in this debate.  First, I should like to speak about the general area of social welfare and, secondly, about the contentious aspect of the Bill &mdash; the provisions in relation to the self-employed.</P>
      <P>What I want to say might be different from what has been said by other speakers in the House because I do not believe we should indulge in a bout of self-congratulation for barely giving the necessary increases to social welfare recipients. The hallmark of a good social welfare system is that it should reflect the type of society in which we live and that those who are not in need should be able to cough up and look after those who are in need.  Any social welfare system must have that fundamental hallmark.  I do not believe it is the sign of a great society, nor should we be patting ourselves on the back all the time, when we give minimal increases to those who are in dire need. It is only what they deserve and in any caring and just society &mdash; and I believe that is what we are &mdash; those who are better off and the Government, through the areas of taxation and the PRSI system, should take from those who have and give to those people who have not. That is the fundamental hallmark that should be looked for in any social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the social welfare system should not be looked upon as an end in itself.  I would love to see fewer unemployment exchanges, fewer schemes, people being able to provide for themselves, sufficient work and a worthwhile standard of living for all our people.  I do not look forward to the day when we have bigger, better and more modern social welfare exchanges and bigger, better and more expensive new schemes. I look forward to a society in which a minimal number of people will have to <Col N="2347" /> rely on handouts from the State and where the majority will have a worthwhile standard of living and worthwhile employment.  Over a long number of years there have been vast improvements in the social welfare system but it is not an end in itself to provide bigger and better schemes and bring more people into them.  It is no great credit to our society that we give just the minimal pay increases.  However, in these difficult financial times the increases the Minister has been able to provide in this budget are very welcome.  Having regard to the dire economic constraints on us, this is a reflection on the fact that we do care about those who are less well off.  There are two main categories of people in the social welfare area.  There are those who live in real poverty and that represents most of those receiving unemployment benefit or assistance.  There is real poverty on the streets of Ireland, whether in County Kildare, Dublin or elsewhere. People are on the breadline, not being able to provide for themselves, having very meagre means.  We do not have to go too far to see such real poverty.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is abuse of the social welfare system and we are fooling ourselves if we do not recognise that. There is large-scale abuse throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I commend the Minister and his Department on their intention to do something about that.  There are so many different schemes catering for people in receipt of social welfare benefits &mdash; unemployment benefit and assistance, maternity allowances, disability benefit, occupational injuries payments &mdash; and so many officials have to be employed to administer the schemes that there are not enough investigation processes or sources.</P>
    <P>With regard to all schemes, whether in the area of agriculture, industry or whatever else, the original scheme is thought up for a particular purpose but we keep it going, willy-nilly, when everybody has forgotten about its original purpose. That is particularly true of social welfare and the same applies to agencies. <Col N="2348" /> I commend the Government on their examination of these agencies to see if they are fulfilling their original purposes.</P>
    <P>With regard to abuses of the social welfare system, let me give a few examples.  There are small business people here employing two or three people who are officially on the books, but it is nearly impossible to get people to work for them.  If people seek employment in large firms such as Guinness they know that they will be on the PAYE and PRSI system but a small businessman in County Kildare who is looking for people to work on a site knows that nobody will work for him under those conditions. People talk about shady employers but what can they do?  I know the construction industry has fallen on hard times but I can assure the Minister that even if the C 45 and taxation system are in operation for those who are not employees of registered subcontractors, it has now come to the stage where nobody works under that system.  The prospective employees will accept a wage of £150 or £200 a week, but do not want to hear about tax, PRSI, or anything else and that is the plain reality.  The small businessman on a construction contract must get his work done somehow.  It has become part of the Irish way of life to abuse the social welfare system.  It is a reflection on our society that nobody, including myself, likes to inform on these people.  That has a stigma attached to it that we are not prepared to face up to.  If the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners could tackle that problem that would do away with much abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>Our black economy is absolutely thriving &mdash; perhaps it is good that it is, because it may be the only section that is thriving. However, it is a disincentive for the employer to take on people on high rates of taxation and PRSI and is a disincentive also to the worker.  I have always maintained that social welfare payments are not too high but the differential between working and not working is too small.  To a single employee on £10,000 a year, a £20 increase into his pocket will cost the employer about £60 a week with taxation, <Col N="2349" /> PRSI and everything else, so the cost of the services or goods being supplied increases by that amount.  The difference between the gross wage and the take-home pay is far too great.</P>
    <P>The reason taxation is so high is that for the past 15 years we have been living in another world, not in the real world. We have been providing ourselves with a level of services which, while they are necessary and very desirable, we cannot afford.  I am glad that this Government, for the first time in 15 or 20 years have faced up to the plain reality.  I am not talking strictly about social welfare now. Our productivity is such that we cannot afford the services we have granted to ourselves.  We are not West Germany, or the United States.  We are a small, poor country.  For 15 years, successive Governments and the people have accepted that we should have a high level of services.  We have made up the difference by borrowing excessive amounts of money but the chickens have now come home to roost.  No matter how long this Government last &mdash; 24 hours, one month or a few years &mdash; thank God they made the effort to put us back on the road to recovery.  Indeed, even if we faced the people in the morning and were beaten, it would not bother me because I am proud to be able to say that the Government did the right thing.  The people have accepted the realities and I commend the Government and the Minister for their efforts in that regard.</P>
    <P>To get rid of abuses in social welfare, there should be an amalgamation of existing agencies to deal with the problem. At present, in many towns, there is an unemployment exchange at one end of the street, people signing on in a Garda station perhaps five miles away and a Manpower office at the other end of the street.  It should be possible to have these organisations at least located in one building and there should be a register of all employers in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Everyone has the right to refuse employment &mdash; I am not in favour of compulsion &mdash; but people cannot expect the State to support them if they will not take work which is offered to them.  The <Col N="2350" /> whole system is being abused, left, right and centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister has struck the right balance in regard to pensions for the self-employed. One Opposition party oppose it because of the proposed rates of contribution and another party oppose it because it will cost too much.  Obviously, the Minister took these points into consideration when drawing up the scheme and he has got it right.  I had reservations about the extension of pensions to the self-employed, not that I am against it in principle but my worry is that the cost in the long term will be astronomical. Perhaps there will be a short term net gain to the Government but in 20 or 30 years it will cost so much that it will be a millstone around the necks of future generations.  However, the Minister has said that the scheme will not cost millions in the future and I am happy to accept his assurance.</P>
    <P>I have filled up various forms over the years for farmers who wished to claim non-contributory pensions when they transferred their farms to their sons or relatives.  These people never contributed towards a pension in their working lives and I know that many small farmers in my constituency will be delighted to contribute to a scheme like this which will avoid means testing at the relevant pension age.  We should also put this matter in perspective, the minimum contribution will be £104 per annum which would only pay for a packet of cigarettes and box of matches every week or a pint and a half of Guinness.  This indeed will be money well spent.  How will the Government collect this new charge? Self-employed people have to pay health and youth levies and, not so long ago, they also had to pay an income levy.  The office of the Collector General are up to their eyes in paperwork trying to collect millions of pounds.  The Revenue task force are trying to collect more money and the health boards are still trying to collect some of the levies due from farmers. The collection system will have to be strengthened.  I have a small amount of experience in this area and I accept that the advent of the Revenue sheriffs has <Col N="2351" /> made a considerable difference.  It should be collected in the same way as PAYE, etc., but we will have to ensure that the collection is effective.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister for his radical approach to this area.  He could have introduced a White Paper or a Green Paper and commissioned all sorts of reports to delay implementing this measure but he has taken the bull by the horns and has introduced pensions for the self-employed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is one of the most important measures introduced in the social welfare area.  The Opposition parties should recognise that it is major legislation providing the most significant increases, in real terms, in social welfare rates for the long term unemployed.  It has implemented many of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare for which Opposition parties have been calling.</P>
      <P>The Bill highlights the commitment of a caring Fianna Fáil Government to the needs of those on the lowest levels of social welfare payments.  At the same time, it extends social insurance to the self-employed, thus bringing about greater equity to the financing of the social welfare system.  I should like to congratulate the Minister and the staff of his Department for the tremendous work they put into preparing this major Bill in the short period of time since the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the detailed provisions of this Bill, I propose to say a few general words about social welfare in Cork.  For many years now, I have been calling for greater devolution of services to local level.  I see Cork developing as a major regional centre for social welfare services in Munster.  With modern developments in communications and computer facilities, we need no longer look to Dublin as the only centre from which central services can be provided. We need to bring the services closer to the people and our aim should be to <Col N="2352" /> provide a community based and community orientated service for our citizens. I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare is very much in favour of localisation of social welfare services. Since he took office, I have been pressing him to give special attention to developing the services in the Cork area.  I am glad to acknowledge his willingness to co-operate and his interest in visiting Cork on a number of occassions in connection with social welfare developments there.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us provides special major increases for the unemployed I am also concerned to ensure that the quality of the services provided to people who have to rely on social welfare is of an acceptable standard.  Even in the present tough budgetary times we must ensure that the least will-off do not suffer any indignity when applying for or collecting social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the closure of Rosenallis post office, County Laois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  The Chair's decision to give me this opportunity, which I appreciate, is probably partly due to the fact that he represents a rural constituency.  As a rural representative I am sure the Chair shares my concern for people living in such areas who face many difficulties when a local service is withdrawn from them.  The closure of a rural sub-post office represents a big blow to a local community and it was not surprising that I received representations from many people about the closure of Rosenallis sub-post office. Local people, in asking me to oppose the closure of the sub-post office, suggested <Col N="2353" /> that I should highlight the move in the Dáil, if given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Rosenallis is a small village situated in the very scenic area of Slieve Bloom. Over the years Laois and Offaly county councils have done everything possible to improve the amenities in that area in an effort to attract tourists.  I should like to compliment both local authorities on the success of their efforts to attract visitors. Hotels and guesthouses in that general area are now catering for many tourists. One of the most important services in such an area is a good and efficient postal service.  The village has been able to boast of such a service for many years but that changed last week when the local sub-post office was closed.</P>
      <P>That move by An Post will cause great inconvenience to those entitled to old age and widow's pensions, unemployment assistance and benefit, invalidity pensions and deserted wife's allowances.  It was grossly unfair to those people to close that facility.  I am afraid that it is the policy of An Post to close small sub-post offices when they get the opportunity and without much concern for the local people.  That is what occurred in Rosenallis.</P>
      <P>The ownership of the sub-post office changed hands recently and the new owners were confident that they would be allowed to continue to provide the service.  An Post was guilty of a gross abuse of their powers by giving such short notice to the new owners of their decision to cease the service.  It was wrong and unfair to give those people such short notice of the intention to close the sub-post office on Friday, 4 March.  I am very disappointed at that action.  Requests by local public representatives to An Post to postpone the closure so that discussions could be held were not heeded and in a high-handed fashion they closed the sub-post office on Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is dangerous to pursue a policy of closing sub-post offices.  We are all aware of the policy pursued down the years of closing rural schools and Garda stations and now we have a semi-State company removing another service from the rural community, the sub-post office.  The <Col N="2354" /> trend is wrong and foolish and it will damage the quality of rural life.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare, who will be replying to this debate, to do all in his power to have the sub-post office restored to the village.</P>
    <P>Rosenallis post office commenced business in 1882 with the permission of the British Government following a great campaign by local people for the service. It would be very wrong of an Irish Government to allow a semi-State company to close that office.  The people of the village will be disappointed if the company succeed in their action.  A licence to run the post office at Rosenallis was granted by the British Government to John Poole and the Poole family have been in charge of it up to recently when a grandson of the first owner sold it to Mr. Thomas O'Loughlin and his wife.  I hope the post office is reopened under the new sub-postmistress, Mrs. Geraldine O'Loughlin.  I have no doubt that the O'Loughlin family will run the post office efficiently.  An Post can feel confident about appointing Mrs. O'Loughlin as sub-postmistress.  She is well respected in the area and has a thorough knowledge of it.  They certainly would have looked after the interests of An Post in an excellent manner.  Like the previous occupants, they would also have looked after the interests of the old age pensioners and persons drawing invalidity and other benefits.  An Post have been very unfair to the new owners of these premises in not granting them the contract to conduct this business.</P>
    <P>An Post are the agents of the Department of Social Welfare and are paid a commission to distribute pensions, children's allowances and so on.  If they continue with this policy, the Minister must take a very serious view of it.  There are people living in the Ballyhuppan and Cappard areas of the Slieve Bloom mountains who have to travel down to Rosenallis to collect their entitlements. It would be grossly unfair if elderly people had to travel a further six or ten miles to another village or town.  They might have to hire a car or thumb a lift in order to get there.  It is not right that <Col N="2355" /> they should be put to the expense and inconvenience involved.  In some instances they might be unable to travel to collect their pensions.  It is an abuse of the powers of An Post to allow this to happen.  People from the areas of Drummond and Clonduff would also be seriously inconvenienced.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this post office should be allowed to remain open.  I am amazed at the attitude of An Post.  If they will not agree to allow pensions to be paid through small sub-post offices, the Minister will have to look for alternative means of providing this service.  There was also a very good sale of stamps and postal orders in this particular post office.</P>
    <P>The sorting which used to be carried out in the post office at Rosenallis is now being done in Mountmellick.  There is now only one postman for the Rosenallis area, one for Clonaslee and two for Mountmellick.  The service has been disimproved.  If the post office is removed, there will be no real postal service in the area.</P>
    <P>As this is a community matter, Deputy Flanagan and Hyland also wish to speak and I have agreed to share my remaining time with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to convey to An Post the very strong views of the Rosenallis community, as expressed by Deputy Enright.  No doubt Deputy Flanagan will be equally forceful. I have no doubt that the social considerations in favour of keeping the office open far outweigh the economic arguments for closure.  The decision is disappointing and socially unjust as far as the community of Rosenallis are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally disappointed that my efforts to defer the decision for a month to allow for local discussion and negotiations met with no response from An Post.  If provision had been made for a review, a sustainable case could have been made for keeping the office open. That case has already been made in Deputy Enright's contribution.  I regret to have to say that the haste with which <Col N="2356" /> the decision was made was influenced more by tactics than consideration for the social consequences.  I am bound to say that many people are being inconvenienced as a result of the decision, particularly the old and those who have no transport to take them to other post offices to collect pensions and other benefits.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Minister and the Government have no statutory function with regard to the day-to-day operations of An Post, but this House and the Government should do everything possible to ensure that State service organisations like An Post balance the economic arguments against the social consequences of their decisions.  If the current trend continues, the social fabric of rural Ireland will be seriously damaged. The post office, together with the church, the school, the community hall and the Garda station, forms the nucleus and hub of local activity.  While it might be easy to calculate the financial saving which would accrue from closing the Rosenallis post office, it is not so simple to put a figure on the long-term cost to the State of the consequences of damaging the social fabric of a rural community.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to convey to An Post the very strong views of the community in Rosenallis, as reflected by the Deputies who represent the area.  An injustice is being done which must be redressed, even at this late stage, by keeping the office open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this debate and I also thank my colleague, Deputy Enright, for affording me a few minutes of his time.  We have heard from the previous speakers the effect which this decision will have on the local community in the north Laois area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the high-handed arrogance we have seen from An Post regarding this matter.  Only one week's notice was given that patrons of the post office were to be informed that as and from the close of business on 4 March there was no longer <Col N="2357" /> to be a post office in the village of Rosenallis. It was most high-handed of An Post to refuse, as late as this week, to meet a delegation of public representatives from the area in an attempt to resolve the matter.  The fact that they refused to consult the public representatives and people from the community is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>It is high time for the Government to consider amending existing legislation to ensure that bodies like An Post and Telecom Éireann are made far more accountable to the public with regard to their day-to-day activities.  These bodies are totally immune from the provisions of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.  I should like to see a code of practice covering their operations to ensure that people in a community like Rosenallis are not treated in the cavalier fashion we have witnessed in the past few days.</P>
    <P>The Government did not act in the interests of consumers by abolishing the Users Council last year.  The council could have been upgraded and made far more useful.  Its abolition was a retrograde step.  Rosenallis is not the only post office to have been closed during the past 12 months.  When looking at profit we must also consider the matter of service.  The closure of a post office cannot be equated with the closure of a bank which is strictly a private concern.  There is an obligation on the State to ensure that this service is maintained in the locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputies have said, the Government have no function in the day-to-day decisions of An Post but nonetheless I accept the views which have been expressed here.  I will convey to An Post the very strong views which have been expressed to me by the Deputies this evening in relation to this particular closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post recently notified the Department of Social Welfare that they intended closing the post office at Rosenallis, County Laois.  There were some 37 pensioners, <Col N="2358" /> 21 persons on unemployment payments and 34 child benefit claimants who cashed their payments at that office. Post offices are closed from time to time and the usual procedures are being followed in this case to facilitate social welfare claimants in transferring to their next most convenient post office.  I have taken a personal interest in the cases which Deputy Hyland has raised with me and I have no doubt that the other claimants have been on to the other Deputies concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the unemployed, the local employment offices of the Department have already made arrangements with the claimants to have their payments transferred to the nearest post office at Mountmellick or Clonaslee.</P>
    <P>In relation to those social welfare claimants who are paid by books of paying orders, pensioners and child benefit claimants, the books need to be returned to the Department for printing thereon of the name of the new post office of payment.  Lists of the claimants involved have been prepared and the Department are in the course of making arrangements with the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>They have been asked to indicate at which post office they wish their payments to be made in future and to return their payment books for amendment.  A number of pensioners have already indicated that they wish to transfer to the Mountmellick post office.</P>
    <P>To minimise disruption for claimants in the immediate area when a post office closes, it is the usual practice for An Post to accommodate them by cashing their pensions or other payments at another convenient post office of their choice as an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement until the books have been formally readdressed by the Department.  Arrangements have been made with An Post to ensure that pensioners may avail of this facility following the closing of the Rosenallis post office.</P>
    <P>I understand that An Post re-examine the viability of post offices when they become vacant where this appears necessary for them to do so.  I understand that the postmaster of the post office in <Col N="2359" /> Rosenallis resigned last December and that the post office was kept open temporarily over Christmas.  In line with their normal practice, An Post then examined the cost of maintaining the post office at Rosenallis in order to ascertain whether it was economically viable.  Apparently they judged that the small volume of business arising in the general area was not sufficient to justify its retention.  That was their judgment and I can make no comment on it.</P>
    <P>In arriving at that decision, An Post took into account the proximity of the neighbouring post office at Mountmellick, which is three-and-a-half miles away, Clonaslee which is just over five miles distant and Killeigh and Ballyfin which are some six-and-a-half miles away.</P>
    <P>I am assured that An Post are very conscious of the importance of sub-post offices in rural areas and do not wish to close them without good reason.  While I naturally would like to see as many paying outlets as possible for social welfare claimants, the closure of post offices is, however, an internal matter for An Post.</P>
    <P>The network of post offices forms an important part of the payment structure in place for social welfare claimants and naturally I am concerned to ensure that all claimants have convenient and easy-to-use methods for cashing their entitlements. For this reason I am also actively pursuing ways of introducing as wide a degree of flexibility as I can into the various payment methods that the Department use at the moment.  A large variety of payment methods are used, such as payments in cash, by cheques, by postal draft or by books of paying orders cashable at named post offices.  With the introduction of computerised facilities in many areas of the Department, it will be possible to develop more modern payment methods for social welfare claimants. Direct transfer of payments by electronic means into bank or post office savings accounts are possibilities which are being planned for.  This development <Col N="2360" /> is, however, some way down the road yet but is one we have under active consideration. A solution of this kind would clearly meet some of the difficulties being experienced by claimants who may consider that they have too far to travel to their nearest local post office.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I must accept the present structures as they are. An Post are aware of our concern on behalf of social welfare claimants but the question of the opening or closing of post offices is a matter within their own competence. I will, of course, keep the situation under review and raise the matter with them as the occasion requires.</P>
    <P>Deputies Enright, Hyland and Flanagan have so eloquently put the case for Rosenallis.  They emphasised the social deprivation in the area and emphasised also the consequences of its closure on a small rural community where it has many inter-related functions.  I will convey to An Post the very strong views which have been expressed to me here tonight by the Deputies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The input of pollutants to the sea is controlled by the Local Government (Water Polution) Act, 1977, and the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  Under the 1977 Act, all point discharges from industrial sources must be in accordance with the terms of a licence issued by the relevant local authority.  These licences incorporate necessary safeguards designed to protect the receiving waters. As part of the Government's general programme to tackle water pollution, I have requested all local authorities to review existing licences and licence conditions, <Col N="2155" /> where this is necessary to ensure that pollution does not occur.</P>
    <P>Dumping at sea is controlled by the Minister for the Marine under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, and is allowed only where this option is considered environmentally acceptable and is the only practical solution available for disposing of the material involved.  I am advised that there is no authorised dumping of industrial wastes into the Irish Sea from sources in this State.  The only dumping which occurs involves sewage sludge and dredged spoil from harbours and is subject to permits issued by the Minister for the Marine, which set conditions designed to avoid pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 32, 55 and 133 together.</P>
      <P>My statements referred to the question of county roads.  Responsibility for the execution and financing of roadworks, including the repair of potholes on such roads, is primarily a matter for each local authority.  However, because of my concern about the state of the county road system which has deteriorated in recent years, special measures have been taken to increase the level of State funding for works on such roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 a total of £15 million was allocated to local authorities for strengthening county roads, compared with £5 million in 1986.  A further £15 million <Col N="2157" /> has been allocated in 1988.  I have also decided that, in future, local authorities can use the block grant for roads on surface dressing and repair of potholes on primary county roads.  Local authorities can also adopt a more flexible approach to the grant for strengthening county roads which should be spent on primary county roads as far as practicable.  Where it is evident that a stretch of road with a number of potholes is in need of strengthening, the remedial works can qualify for the strengthening grant if the cost of the strengthening is more than half the total cost of the works.  The specific measures to be undertaken on foot of the State grant assistance is a matter for each local authority.</P>
    <P>Detailed information has been received from all county councils, in response to a departmental circular, issued in May 1987, about the condition of the network of county roads together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.  I am considering this information in the context of the preparation of a blueprint for road development which I intend to publish within the next few months.  The blueprint will address the question of the medium to long-term development needs of the entire system of public roads, including the network of county roads.</P>
    <P>Receipts from the sale of local authority houses which mainly comprise weekly annuities payable by tenant purchasers, will depend on the take-up of the scheme by tenants.  In the case of authorities making house purchase loans 60 per cent of the proceeds must be devoted to the making of such loans.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he proposes to <Col N="2165" /> introduce legislation to deal with the problem of incineration, particularly in urban areas; whether he considers the guidelines with regard to emissions from incineration plants to be adequate for the protection of health and the environment; if he will make a statement on all aspects of incineration, including the incineration and disposal of medical wastages which can be highly dangerous and toxic; and his views on implementation of the EC directives in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Adequate powers exist under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 to allow local authorities to deal with harmful emissions from any source, including incinerators. Under section 24, which is in force, there is a general obligation on all non-domestic premises to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent emissions.  Incineration of solid and liquid wastes from new industrial plants will be licensable under Part III of the Air Pollution Act which I intend to bring into operation shortly.</P>
      <P>The disposal of waste by incineration, including hospital wastes, also comes within the scope of the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979 or, if applicable, the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982.  These Regulations give effect to Directives 75/442/EEC and 78/319/EEC dealing with general waste and toxic and dangerous waste respectively and they are implemented by the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>While emission limit values have not been specified for any class of premises, local authorities are bound to achieve the air quality standards for smoke and sulphur dioxide, lead and nitrogen dioxide prescribed in the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 244 of 1987). These are based on criteria developed at international level for the protection of human health and the environment.</P>

      <P>The Government's approach in relation to the private rented housing sector is to create conditions favourable to increased investment in the sector as the most effective way of progressively raising standards and ensuring that an orderly rents regime prevails.  The recent re-introduction of section 23 incentives is a specific measure to this end.  Conversely, any steps, which signal more stringent regulatory measures and controls, are liable to discourage investment, lead to an imbalance between supply and demand and are not in the best interests of potential users of rented accommodation.</P>

      <P>The allocation of funds to the health boards under the special housing aid scheme for the elderly is a matter for the task force, set up under the aegis of my Department, to administer the scheme.  While general guidelines have been circulated to the health boards, it is left to the discretion of the boards to determine in individual cases which works, including the provision of water or sewerage facilities, should be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this scheme caters for elderly persons not in a position themselves to carry out necessary works, it follows that the <Col N="2171" /> termination of the house improvement grants, including those for water and sewerage, should have little bearing on the operation of the scheme.  The amount provided nationally for this scheme was increased from £1 million to £1.5 million in 1986 and this higher level of funding has been continued in 1987 and 1988.  The annual allocation of funds for each health board has been increased on a more or less proportionate basis.</P>

The licensing of industrial emissions envisaged by the directive and the Act is a measure to protect public health and the environment generally rather than a worker safety measure.</P>

      <P>The extent of the smoke control measures to be applied in Dublin will depend on the number and scope of the special control area orders made by the local authorities concerned.  There is no question of making all of Dublin a smokeless zone; compliance with air quality standards for smoke, and with the corresponding EC limit values, is likely to be achieved in Dublin by selective rather than comprehensive application of control measures.  It is not, therefore, possible to estimate the extent or cost of necessary measures at this stage without anticipating decisions which can only be made in the context of the formal application of Part IV of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, to particular areas.</P>
      <P>The level of State subvention to domestic smoke control measures will be a matter for the scheme of financial assistance under section 45 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  I am urgently having this scheme prepared and will announce details as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The target date for compliance with air quality standards for smoke in Dublin is the EC deadline of 1 April 1993.  As I have said, this should be achievable by partial, rather than complete, smokeless zoning of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The original provision for the local improvements scheme for 1987 was £2.5 million.  In March last, the grant allocations notified to county councils on foot of this provision were withdrawn as part of the general financial review for the purpose of the 1987 budget.  The 1987 budgetary provision for the scheme was £4 million, an increase of 86% compared with the original provision.  The 1988 provision for the scheme has been maintained at £4 million.</P>
      <P>Exchequer grants for the local improvements scheme relate solely to farm road projects eligible for EC aid under the western package.  Following a recent review of the package, a draft amending regulation has been prepared.

      <P>I understand that the draft regulation is at present being considered by the Council of Ministers.  If the Council approve the regulation, a revised programme of works, covering various elements of the package, will have to be prepared for the extended area.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> Our concern at events has been conveyed to the Israeli authorities in the course of recent bilateral contacts. Within days of the outbreak of the present disturbances I made clear in the Seanad on 16 December 1987 the Government's deep concern and the importance which we attach to matters affecting the rights of the population of the territories.  Ireland's position on Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories is clearly on the record. We have spoken out consistently at the United Nations, at the UN Human Rights Commission and elsewhere in defence of the rights of the Palestinian population and we have been actively involved in measures to contribute to the economic and social development of the territories.  Our approach is shared by our partners in the Twelve.  The Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Bonn on 8 February in the framework of European Political Co-operation, expressed their profound concern at the deteriorating conditions in the occupied territories. On two occasions since the outbreak of the present violence the Presidency's Ambassador in Tel Aviv has conveyed the Twelve's views to the Israeli authorities and called on them to ensure the immediate protection of the inhabitants of the area.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy's question is in the context of the recently introduced tax related requirements for applicants for grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities. The scheme was introduced pursuant to the commitment in the 1987 and 1988 Budget Statements to introduce tax related requirements for applicants for all grants from State and public authorities. All Government Departments have been circulated with details of the new scheme, which they have been requested to transmit to all public authorities under their aegis.</P>
      <P>In general the scheme provides that applicants for grant and similar type payments in excess of £500 and under £10,000 must provide their tax number and confirm that their tax affairs are in order.  The tax number of the spouse of the applicant will suffice if the applicant has no tax number.  In the case of payments in excess of £10,000, applicants must furnish a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  I would stress that the scheme is a tax clearance mechanism and does not impose any additional tax liability on grant applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that no arrangements for exemptions from these <Col N="2182" /> requirements have been made with representatives of the Irish Colleges either by officials of my Department or of the Revenue Commissioners.  Officials of the Revenue Commissioners have, in fact, met with representatives of the Irish Colleges acting on behalf of the Mná Tí and advised them that tax reference numbers would be required from Mná Tí under the terms of the scheme.  However, arrangements have been agreed between the parties in order to facilitate Mná Tí in acquiring a tax number where a tax liability would not generally arise.  I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the arrangements do not involve derogation from the requirements of the scheme to furnish a tax number.</P>

    <P>As regards the rights of local residents, the 1935 Act provides that any person wishing to object to the grant of a licence for public dancing may do so at the hearing of the application in the District Court.  I understand that persons who reside in the vicinity of the ballroom in question did in fact object to the issue of the licence and that following many adjournments the licence was granted on 18 December 1987 subject to a number of conditions and restrictions.  As licences for public dancing are renewable annually it will be open to any person so interested to object at the annual licensing court in September.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 31 May 1972 and payment was issued to 12 July 1986.</P>
      <P>Payment was disallowed from 14 July 1986, following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 14 July 1986 to 31 December 1986, the date on the latest medical certificate before him.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh medical evidence.</P>
      <P>In a letter from the Department to the Deputy, it was erroneously stated that the person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit up to February 1987. This error is regretted.  It appears that he had been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance during the period from July 1986 to February 1987.</P>

      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for administering the scheme in his area, that the person concerned is receiving supplementary welfare allowance of £14.60 per week.  This represents the maximum weekly rate of £34 appropriate to his case less weekly means of £19.40 deriving from the value of board and lodging in his parent's home.</P>
      <P>The reduction in his entitlement was due to an increase in the assessment of his means in the light of the improvement in the household circumstances; his father's net income has increased significantly since the previous assessment of his means and his brother, who also resides in the household, is now employed and is no longer dependent on their father.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the specialist's report, referred to by the Deputy, is required for the purpose of assessing the person's long term health situation and his possible entitlement to a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  As he is apparently the holder of a medical card, he would not be expected to pay for the medical examination himself.</P>

      <P>Prior to January 1988, where a claimant had 39 but less than 208 contributions paid since entry into insurable <Col N="2193" /> employment, payment of disability benefit was limited to 52 weeks.  Payment of disability benefit could only be made for a continuous period greater than 52 weeks where the person had at least 208 such contributions paid.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 5 July 1986.  According to the records of the Department, the claimant only has a total of 144 contributions paid since her entry into insurable employment.  As a result, she exhausted her 52 weeks entitlement to benefit on 6 July 1987.</P>
      <P>Because of an administrative error, the person concerned was incorrectly considered to have exhausted her entitlement to benefit on 10 January 1987 and payment was disallowed from that date. She was subsequently admitted from 18 February 1987 as an adult dependant on her husband's invalidity pension.  This increase on her husband's pension in respect of the person concerned and five dependent children has continued to be issued to date.</P>
      <P>The arrears of disability benefit payable from 10 January 1987 to 6 July 1987 were withheld to offset against the adult dependant and full child dependant allowances paid on her husband's pension. An adjustment cheque for £873.85 will shortly issue to the person concerned.</P>
      <P>To requalify for disability benefit, the person concerned requires at least a further 13 weeks of insurable employment for which contributions at the appropriate rate have been paid.</P>

      <P>Because of our limited native energy resources, Ireland has a significant dependence on imported fuel.  Coal has an important role to play as part of our energy policy in providing increased security of energy supplies by the diversification of oil imports.  For example, from 1979 to 1985 Ireland's oil requirements decreased by 37 per cent.  Coal had a major part to play in displacing the level of oil imports.</P>

      <P>The EC's international commitments in the context of the GATT preclude the Community from imposing prohibitions on imports of Third Country fish. However, the Community can exercise its right to reduce tariffs on specific quantities of imported fish when such reductions are considered appropriate.</P>
      <P>At the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Brussels on 29 February 1988 a proposal on the opening of autonomous tariff quotas for certain fish species to aid the Community's processing industry was considered at length.  After some amendment the proposal was adopted by a qualified majority with Ireland being the only member state opposing.</P>
      <P>In voting against the proposal I was concerned about (I) the possible adverse affects of the quotas envisaged on Irish whitefish fishermen, (II) the apparent divergence from the principle of granting additional Third Country access to EC markets only in exchange for reciprocal benefits and (III) the lack of action to date by the Commission in dealing with the problems being experienced by Irish fishermen on the herring market.</P>

The relevant State grants are the block grant, county road strengthening grant, special improvements grants and grants for EC western package schemes (FEOGA).  The grants allocated under these headings for Cavan and Monaghan county councils in 1988 are as follows:</P>

    <P>The local authorities have considerable discretion regarding the distribution of <Col N="2203" /> the block grant for roads and the county road strengthening grant.  As announced recently, I have decided that, in future, local authorities can use the block grant for roads on surface dressing and repair of potholes on primary county roads.  Local authorities can also adopt a more flexible approach to the grant for strengthening county roads which should be spent on primary county roads as far as practicable. Where it is evident that a stretch of road with a number of potholes is in need of strengthening, the remedial works can qualify for the strengthening grant if the cost of the strengthening is more than half the total cost of the works.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of the general condition of the networks of main and county roads throughout the country as a result of ongoing contact with local authorities as well as submissions received from authorities, including Cavan and Monaghan county councils, and representative bodies such as the County and City Engineers' Association. Detailed information has been received from all county councils, in response to a departmental circular, issued in May 1987, about the condition of the network of county roads together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.  I am considering this information in the context of the preparation of a blueprint for road development which I intend to publish within the next few months.  The blueprint will address the question of the medium to long term development needs of the entire system of public roads, including the networks of non-national main roads and county roads.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply in the Dáil on 9 February 1988 all consultant appointments are in line with the recommendations laid down by Comhairle na nOspidéal.  Where it is necessary to <Col N="2209" /> arrange for locum cover it is normal procedure for the existing consultant to be involved in the selection of locum candidates.</P>
      <P>I invited the Faculty of Anaesthetists to provide my Department with full details of anaesthetists employed in the health service whom the faculty believe are dangerous and a risk to patients and they did not respond.</P>
      <P>With regard to the unfortunate death of the patient to whom I understand the Dean of the Faculty of Anaesthetists referred, I understand that the hospital in question has already been served with a notice of intent to pursue a claim through the courts.  I therefore do not propose to comment on the matter at this stage.  I would however point out that the employment of unsupervised trainee anaesthetists is not an issue in the case.</P>

      <P>Considerable thought is <Col N="2211" /> given each year to the scheduling of subjects within the timetable for the certificate examinations.  Special account is taken of the number of candidates taking each subject and of previous cases in which there has been a clash of subjects. By longstanding agreement with the school authorities, the examination period may not commence earlier than 8 June each year, nor may it exceed 13 examination days.  The reasons for this agreement relate, <i>inter alia</i>, to the length of the school year and a common desire to keep the overall period of the examination from being excessively long. Regard must also be had to the dates of the University Matriculation examination. Other factors which must be taken into account include the time necessary to mark the candidates' scripts and the need to have the results issued to the schools at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>Given these constraints, it is inevitable each year that a number of the smaller subjects are scheduled for the same day. No change can be made in the examination timetable for 1988 at this stage. Where a candidate has to take more than two subjects in the one day, this matter will be brought to the attention of the examiners involved.</P>
