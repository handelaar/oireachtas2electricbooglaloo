There is no doubt that there was a great need for this Bill and I congratulate the Minister of State on seeing this need and drafting the Bill so quickly. In some ways it is a simple Bill but in other ways it is complicated.  I am sure this Bill will prove to be of tremendous benefit to all right thinking people in the meat trade.</P>

    <P>The provisions and penalties contained in the Bill have been inserted to protect those who wish to carry out their business properly.  Those who wish to do so have nothing to fear from this Bill.  In fact, <Col N="262" /> it should lead to an upgrading of their operations.  I believe that the cowboy operators who have not been observing normal practices in regard to hygiene, or who have been stepping outside the law in terms of the types of meats they have been offering, have a lot to fear from this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to make sure that the penalties and provisions which are embodied in the Bill will be rigorously pursued against those who break the law.  It will be in the interests of the consumer and this country to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I welcome this Bill in so far as it proposes changes in the legislation in regard to the ESB.  The changes will have effect at both local and national level.  Previous speakers have indicated that the technical changes will result in this national body being more accountable for their actions and in a more defined system in regard to the payment of rates.  Previous Governments encountered various difficulties with the board of management of the ESB, especially when the premier body in the ESB decided they would not honour these demands.  In any case the most contentious aspect of this Bill is in relation to the proposal to allow the ESB to expand the utility at Moneypoint.  Other speakers have referred to the extensive berthing facilities which have been developed at Moneypoint with the use of enormous sums of taxpayers' money.  I believe the Minister for Energy is correct in giving the ESB latitude to make greater commercial use of this wharf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, as far as my constituency is concerned and as far as the Shannon Estuary, which covers the counties of Kerry, Limerick and Clare, is concerned any major development proposed by the ESB, even the trans-shipment of coal, is to be welcomed because the natural advantages of the Shannon Estuary will <Col N="264" /> be utilised.  I believe what is being proposed by the ESB will lead to the eventual expansion of the Shannon Estuary.  I welcome this move.  I have been surprised by the contention of other speakers, that entry of the ESB into this commercial area will put limitations on the competitors in the economy.  If the ESB are in a position to import coal more cheaply for wholesale use, surely it is to be welcomed?</P>
    <P>Many of the speakers dealt with pollution from the coal being imported.  My understanding is that the criticism is not totally valid because the ESB in importing American coal have reduced their forward contracts in that area.  In any case, pollution from the stacks at Moneypoint has been fully controlled in the planning permission granted by Clare County Council and monitoring stations have been put in place in various scenic areas, in the Burren and even in areas as far east as Wicklow.</P>
    <P>If there was a greater industrial use of coal surely new industries would use new boiler systems and the quality of the coal and its use would be controlled in planning permissions granted by local authorities in the areas in which new companies were being established.  The positive effect of the coal industry has not been stressed enough in the House. Earlier on, Deputy Richard Bruton instanced the excessive charges on the consumer for domestic coal.  Anything that would help to keep down the price of coal must surely be welcome.  I agree with the Deputy that the new company should not have any particular relief from loan guarantees or because letters of comfort are made available from the parent body of the ESB.  On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will copperfasten this idea.  This matter affects my constituency but I would not like a system of unfair trade to be established.</P>
    <P>I support the call of Deputy John Bruton for guidelines to be drawn up by the Restrictive Practices Commission to deal with the coal trade.  As far as the ESB are concerned in the utilisation of the Moneypoint wharf, the arrival of new <Col N="265" /> up-to-date modern trans-shipment systems would indeed help even the other ports in the Shannon Estuary.  It would be possible for the ESB to set up a system whereby national coal demands could be trans-shipped from Moneypoint across the river to Foynes and then railed from Foynes throughout the country.  This would help to make better use of CIE rolling stock in the freight area.  It would also enhance the southern side of the river to have a rail spur from Limerick out as far as Foynes.  That would be of great benefit to the port of Foynes.  I see major room for expansion in that area. We have out of Limerick an assortment of rail spurs that could easily take this coal south to Cork, east to Dublin or north to Galway.  The proposal is progressive and the ESB companies should be given a chance to utilise the pier and bring it fully into operation.</P>
    <P>This proposal would also draw more attention from the marine people who have been slow to invest in the Shannon estuary.  Those in Clare and in north Kerry have a particular interest in this development.  If we look at other ports like Rotterdam or Le Havre we see that there has been heavy investment and while other speakers have pointed out that the value there has been recognised because of closeness to major population areas, the fact that huge ships can be docked in Shannon and trans-shipment areas utilised, would be an advance in modern techniques.  As well as that, high hopes have already been expressed by the Minister for Energy of an oil find in the Porcupine Basin just west of the Shannon Estuary.  If this find is developed quickly, the ESB have shown the way. An oil refinery on the north or south bank of the River Shannon can be easily put in place because of the infrastructure already in place.</P>
    <P>The long-term problem which the ESB will face if this coal proposal becomes successful, is to see how it can be expanded into other areas.  Berths like Moneypoint are rare in this country. When the members of the Committee of Public Accounts visited the Moneypoint <Col N="266" /> project they were very impressed by the modern facilities there.</P>
    <P>The other area in which I have a particular interest relates to fish development, particularly salmon and the growth and development of the salmon industry at Parteen Hatcheries and in other areas. I compliment the officers of the ESB for their work in this area and for the way in which they are assisting public and private development of the salmon industry. Salmon fishing, particularly rod salmon fishing has a national as well as an international attraction.  While on other occasions I have complained in this House about the abuses of fishermen at sea <i>vis-à-vis</i> salmon, I must say that the ESB have properly conducted research in this area and I compliment them for that.  There is a great opportunity now for the ESB to get involved in salmon breeding, an area which other countries have properly exploited.  They could probably become involved in joint ventures and the expertise and knowledge they have about fish disease could be fully utilised by the State.</P>
    <P>I was puzzled by claims made yesterday in this House about the possibility of totally privatising the ESB and the various methods of generating electricity.  Some Deputies seemed to think it was possible to put oil fired generators in competition with coal fired generators or, in the case of other forms of power, by use of water or wind.  That was simplistic.  I believe it would not be possible to diversify or privatise the ESB and still keep them economical.  They have systems of generation in place which would be of great use in an emergency.  I am referring to turf and water.  Over-utilisation of turf is to be deplored.  However, in regard to water, Ardnacrusha generating station has proved most effective and it is still working well.</P>
    <P>An aspect I regret is that the ESB did not take advantage of the extensive funds made available by the EC after the oil crisis when they wanted to promote alternative sources of energy to oil.  It is difficult to understand why, for instance, more wind generating stations were not built on the west coast.  After all, the west <Col N="267" /> coast is more susceptible to high wind than the southern coast of the Mediterranean. The Bill contains proposals for the establishment of ten or 12 new generating stations.  In some periodical I read an article about the use of sea wave power for the generation of electricity. We may have great resources in this area that we are not utilising.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it affects my constituency.  I think the proposals will be well handled.  The ESB have put together a package and have researched it fully.  I understand the fears of their competitors, that they will be the subject of the easy subsidy.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister that on Committee Stage he should make provision to put this new company at arms' length so that there will be fair competition.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party have no difficulty with this Bill on Second Stage.  However, proposals will be put forward to make some amendments to sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  Section 3 (1) and (2) stand in isolation from each other. They affect the whole question of the distribution of coal, and previous speakers have adverted to the definition and meaning of the word &ldquo;initially&rdquo;.  Section 3 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Where, for the purposes of such distribution or sale within the State, transportation of any such substance or product from the Board's property at Moneypoint, in the County of Clare, is required, the substance or product shall initially be transported there from by ship to a port or harbour in the State.</P>
      <P>However, section 3 (1) which precedes that stands in isolation from it; it appears to give general regulations and powers. Equally, in section 4 the combined effect of subsections (1) and (2) would appear to me in terms of draftsmanship to have some problems.  On Committee Stage it would be well worthwhile to look for a reformulation of those two sections to answer the problems that have been referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> What I have to say in this regard is to some degree to undo some of the impression that has been made by some of the speakers here who were talking about privatising the ESB or the ESB being some kind of State-sponsored monster that is in danger of gobbling up or devouring private enterprise.  I am putting forward ideas about sections 3 and 4 because we are in an atmosphere of high unemployment.  There is traditional employment involved in relation to use of the docks and if the different harbours were to lose the revenues they are getting from current distribution mechanism arrangements we would be losing jobs we could not easily replace.  We can take that up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Let me say something about the ESB in general.  I ought to confess that many years ago &mdash; 26 to be exact &mdash; I was an employee of the ESB.  Probably it was in both our interests that we parted our ways.  I am sure it improved the generating capacity of the ESB and it did nothing too bad for my prospects either. Nevertheless, it gave me an opportunity of having some familiarity with the ESB's inner workings.  I am like what those generals used to refer to each other as, I am a Grade VIII clerk, retired.</P>
    <P>The ESB are a success story.  They are one of those public bodies owned by the people, largely funded and facilitated by different legislative mechanisms that have come in, but let us be very clear about the 1927 Act which is being amended by the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  The Act was passed on the last day of the Fourth Dáil, on 20 May 1927.  The idea of having an ESB at all was introduced by Patrick McGilligan, Minister for Industry and Commerce, but there was comprehensive opposition to it all the way.  For example, one of the leading people who objected to it was the leader of the farmers' party of the day who said:</P>
    <P>People of this country are very conservative with regard to new ideas. They do not take to them as people in other countries.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy needs more, several other Deputies in the House, as we went through the debate, suggested that electricity would never catch on at all.  But there were other opponents of the scheme going ahead. There was, for example, the number of people involved in supplying electricity privately.  They said, and I quote from the same page of the same publication already referred to:</P>
      <P>The Bill is a rich phantasmagoria of fatuities so impracticable that one hopes even the Free State Dáil will pause before casting its electricity supply industry into such a hopeless morass.</P>
      <P>This was at the birth of a company that provides 12,500 employees with work today, that is, to take up the point made by Deputy Bruton last night, of benefit not only to the employees but of considerable benefit to the Irish banking system which is doing very well out of the undercapitalised State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, for example, the ESB paid £125,629,000 in bank interest charges. Equally, Bord na Móna paid £17,460,000 in bank interest charges.  There is another figure which I will keep quoting until it eventually makes its way into some <Col N="270" /> newspaper.  If one took the semi-State bodies last year and the health boards and the county councils and added them together, the Irish banking system made £541 million in interest from lending to local authorities, health boards and semi-State bodies sums of money, without risk, State guaranteed, and all having to be repaid in 12 months.  That is the entrepreneurial risk-taking Irish banking sector, and I have to come in here week after week listening to people talking about creating an environment for the investor to stir in Ireland.  Those people remind me of talking about an ailing cow that refuses to get up on its feet and everybody gives it little kicks with the taxpayers' money to see if it would stir itself to produce a dribble of milk.</P>
    <P>Last year £1,254 million was paid to the private sector to produce jobs.  The year before £996 million was paid, and where are the jobs?  Deputy Bruton has gone off wherever he has gone to but the fact of the matter is that he will not tell one a figure like this.</P>
    <P>We had a period of growth before the first two oil crises.  In the period 1971 to 1983, out of 90,000 jobs created in Ireland, 83,000 jobs that lasted were created in the public sector.  Imagine a situation where the Irish Government had made a different choice from what they had made consistently through the sixties and seventies, that if, instead of taking the taxpayers' money &mdash; and remember that four-fifths of the time it was from the PAYE workers &mdash; and spraying it with a pepper canister across the Irish private sector, they had provided proper capitalisation for the semi-State and State sector and reduced the borrowing requirement of those companies.  They would have reduced the income of the banks and they would have created thousands more jobs.  They chose not to do that and that is &mdash; and this is not sufficiently said in this House by those of us on the Left &mdash; the ideological, ignorant, backward, hopeless, conservative cause of economic decay and emigration in this country.  It all comes from these benches over here and from some of those benches over there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> They want the banks to go on benefiting. They got £541 million in interest alone last year.  One per cent of a reduction would have avoided the cuts in education; 2 per cent would have avoided all the cuts, whether in education, in health or in the other areas of investment where we have cut back.  But if that had been suggested they would all have been up on their hind legs and Deputy Kelly who wanders in now and again to give us a view from the Stone Age would be up on his feet saying that such a suggestion would shake the confidence in the Irish banking sector.  It did not shake the confidence in the Irish banking sector when the banks turned around and looked for the taxpayer to bail them out when they had invested in racehorses with three legs and football teams that could not play soccer and in other daft schemes.  It is this outrageous, ignorant conceit that informs these benches here all the time.</P>
    <P>The ESB, founded in the last days of the Fourth Dáil in 1927, is a public sector success with 12,500 employees, a good record, and I ask any Deputy who will come in here to speak in this debate to stand up and answer this: would we even have an electric light bulb in this country today if it had not been for the fact that we had State-led investment?</P>
    <P>But the scandal is that ideological prejudice against the role of the State, consistently whipped up to a near fascist level in the thirties with all its attendant consequences, that refused a health service in the early fifties, that infected the public service itself, that scared the life out of most politicians in this country, this consistent, anti-State prejudice, was responsible for the fact that we left under capitalised our State and semi-State companies that could have provided the jobs for the people who might have remained in this country and made them such good clients for the Irish banking system.  The reply always from the banks is that it is only the ordinary people who are putting their few pounds into the banks, and they are getting a few pennies back and that it is all wonderful.  A natural law of usury is what it was, and little else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> It is so difficult to point the finger at the Irish banking system given the present arrangements in both Irish politics and the Irish media.  After all they advertise so heavily in the Irish newspapers that it is difficult ever to have published by them a good thumping speech about how much they make out of the Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>The ESB Shannon scheme was opposed from day one.  There were other people who opposed it as well.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6 April 1927 had a most interesting headline &mdash;&ldquo;Confiscation and Robbery&rdquo;.  The editorial of that day spoke about socialism and claimed that the Bill was confiscatory.  It made a comparison with Russia.  It said that that great seedbed of entrepreneurial investment and decision-making, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, got in on the act and that its President, Mr. J.C.M. Eason issued several statements.  Alfie Byrne, knowing that the old anti-State thing was in fact gathering momentum decided to get in on the act as well and he, the shaking hands of Dublin himself, was against the ESB.  After that the Electricity Suppliers Association sought a meeting with McGilligan.  What does this tell us about the establishment of the ESB?  The Electricity Suppliers Association, because they had a little monopoly going, supplying electricity, were so against the idea of State investment that would help modernise this country that they issued all of these statements.</P>
    <P>But is it not from the same stable that we are getting the statements we have listened to over several weeks?  Who now wants to privatise the ESB?  Let us think of the logic.  Efforts were made at the point of its inception to stop the thing coming into existence.  The company employ 12,500 people and have assets of a couple of billon pounds.  Deputy John Bruton has a problem about calculating and his conservative figures are about £1.5 billion.  It is now proposed by some of the speakers I have listened to here that little bits of this company that were founded in an atmosphere of hostility, that were developed out of the public <Col N="273" /> purse, should be handed back to the private sector if there is a possibility of profit.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting that in 1927 <i>The Irish Times</i> had a headline, &ldquo;Confiscation or Robbery&rdquo;, when it was referring to the State being able to compete with the private sector.  What else is it but robbery from the public when people speak about privatising sections of the ESB and privatising the other State companies &mdash; giving the Irish private entrepreneurs dole of £1.2 billion a year and creating no jobs.  Having taken the taxpayers' money and not created the jobs they now want their bit of the State sector as well.  What arrogant cheek; what neck; what a justification of gutless, spineless robbery from the Irish public by people who are not able to create anything but just whinge at the birth of State and semi-State companies and attack them all through their existence.  They send their grey shadowy figures on to their boards and put every obstacle in the way of their competing commercially.</P>
    <P>That is what happened with the Sugar Company and that matter was raised in this House.  A man making galvanised buckets objected to the sugar company being allowed to make agricultural machinery because it would disturb the private sector, the native Irish entrepreneur. When I read these things I sometimes wonder what kind of country I am living in.  It certainly has a romantic quality, the romantic ideological excessive right, cowardly antipathy to the State that we are hearing about day in and day out.  The State is attacking our lives. There are 12,500 working in the ESB who would not be working there if we were relying on the private hucksters who opposed the establishment of the ESB. That has to be said in order to redress some of this codswallop that we hear from people who talk about State monopoly, the dangers of the State and so on.</P>
    <P>A number of very thoughtful points have been made by people who have contributed to this debate.  Having justified State investment in the area of energy and in the area of production of electricity and so on, I do not justify <Col N="274" /> uncritically many of the procedures of the ESB.  For example, it is clear to me that over 20 years ago it had two effective lines of management &mdash; one based on accountancy principles and the other based on engineering &mdash; and that it needed a radical internal reorganisation if it was to be an effectively managed company.  That is a personal view. Having defended the ESB and spoken about their right to expand and to move into other areas, I think improvements can be made.  The ESB suffered an external burden &mdash; at times they appeared to carry the burden of a social purpose for their activities.  For example, Deputies who did not know what they were talking about referred last night to the reason for the turf burning stations.  They were initially established for mainly social purposes, to bring employment to areas where there was very little other prospect of employment.  It is clear that the large scale use of turf burning is impractical not only in an economic sense but also in its ecological consequences.</P>
    <P>There may be, as Deputy Carey has said, a case for retaining this capacity in a secondary role.  Most importantly if you want to speak about the impact of an economic decision you have to look at how realistic it is and ensure that you will be able to bring other jobs into existence in areas such as Rosmuck or areas in the hinterland of the Screeb turf burning station.  What is the evidence of alternative employment there?  Maybe the native entrepreneurs have got lost there. I know what native entrepreneurs are in that area but I will not upset the House by saying what I think they are involved in.  The fact is that alternative job creation possibilities, not only in that station but in several others, are very slim and that is a consideration that has to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>There are many points in the Minister's speech with which I agree but I do not understand his failure to refer to the Electricity Supply Board's general possibilities in the area of electronics.  I welcomed the Minister's reference to the ability of the ESB to sell consultancy services abroad.  The ESB have an <Col N="275" /> impressive record in that regard, beginning during a period when negotiations were going on between the ESB and the World Bank for a loan of £14.5 million to help finance the Turlough Hill project. At that stage the bank was impressed with the ESB's competence and technical expertise and invited them to take part in another project.  They have carried out projects in Bahrain, Egypt, India, Iran, Lesotho, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, Switzerland and so on.</P>
    <P>A good question to ask in relation to our industrial policy is what would be the job creation effect of properly financing semi-State companies and allowing, for example, the ESB to go into the electronics area, given the ESB's record?  The only alternative would be to consider a general indiscriminate industrial policy of grants for either foreign multinationals locating here or for native people who wish to get involved in electronics, and the relative job outturns from those two users of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that the capitalisation of the semi-State sector would have a far greater, faster, more secure job creation outturn than the present insdustrial policy.  Yet, why does that not happen?  It does not happen &mdash; and I will repeat it &mdash; because of ideological prejudice of the Right against the proper capitalisation of the State.  Just in case somebody might be able to make a penny in the private sector we must not fund State investment.  It is time the State sector hit back.  We should look at the facts as to where the State's money has been spent and what results it has got.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some brief points in relation to the sensitivity of the ESB. From time to time there is danger in an organisation in which the technical expertise has insisted on the hegemonic control of management.  They will make decisions without always taking political and social considerations into mind.  Certainly the controversy into which the ESB have plunged themselves by taking a contract without looking at the social and political implications in the Philippines <Col N="276" /> during the Marcos regime is an external example.  Internally, there has very often been the failure to respond sufficiently to some genuine ecological suggestions that have been made, although I note with great pleasure, from some of their publications, the efforts that the board have been making in recent times in contributing to knowledge about the flora and fauna of Ireland and so on.</P>
    <P>It would benefit the ESB and the other companies in the energy area if we had a clear articulation of Government policy on energy generally, domestic and industrial and that which projects the future availability of resources.  It is very important not to make the same mistakes that the Thatcher government are now making &mdash; for example, squandering the North Sea oil resources that the people of Britain imagined were theirs but which are now to be used to give tax breaks to millionaires.  That is the kind of progressive conservatism that prevails in Britain at present.  I would not like to see us going down that road.  I would like to see an energy policy in which the board could establish their future in relation to other energy companies and so on.  An interesting paper has been published in this regard.</P>
    <P>The last point I shall make about this is that in relation to environmental impact, the ESB at least could be accused of considerable insensitivity.  There have been whole villages, towns and so on that have made extraordinary efforts to make themselves attractive.  Yet, the greatest despoliation, let us say, of places like Roundstone &mdash; when one looks at photographs &mdash; are occasioned by these great cables traversing streets and so on.</P>
    <P>I worked in the ESB in 1960-61.  I grew to like a lot of the atmosphere and, to use a phrase of people on the Right, its ethos.  The rural electrification scheme was coming to an end, being displayed in the more peripheral areas only.  In different parts of those areas there would be switch-on celebrations when the electricity arrived but the great engineering challenge of the time was in bringing this energy source all over the country.  After that time the new considerations that now <Col N="277" /> prevail are that it is possible to do all of this in an engineering, competent way without, at the same time, having such an impact on the environment with ugly poles, cables and stations.  Even in city areas in relation to the ESB's small installations, they make little effort to locate them properly or in a way that will ensure they are not a hazard to children, sometimes dangerous and certainly unattractive. Very often they are placed in new housing estates on traditional rights-of-way blocking passage and so on.  Equally, and I shall finish with this point, the ESB must develop that linkage with other companies, with the other social and economic impacts of some of their activities.</P>
    <P>I know the point has been raised very often, I think by Deputy Richard Bruton, of whether the ESB are adequately accepting responsibility in relation to safety.  My memory tells me that it was Deputy Richard Bruton who asked the Minister for the Environment whether he was satisfied with the present arrangements for safety in relation to the installation of electricity in houses.  With respect to the Minister of State present, I must say that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, fudged the issue.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the ESB insist on a certificate being signed by somebody but they will not require that that person be qualified.  They will not require a register, as has been suggested by the association. When this was discussed in the House the Minister's response was something on the lines that the industry itself should establish a voluntary register.  However, that leaves the issue of public safety in houses entirely in a limbo.  It seems to me there is a great case, in terms of the avoidance of fire risk, of loss of life and so on, for using the opportunity of changing the basic Act in order to insert some section which would allow for the proper establishment of procedures and qualifications in everybody's interests.  There is a very different atmosphere prevailing now. When one thinks of the people who owned the electricity generating capacities in 1927 they were saying one thing <Col N="278" /> whereas the people involved in the electrical trade who were seeking the establishment of a register and safe procedures were interested in safety.  Obviously this would have a job creation effect but in the very correct area of ensuring safety.</P>
    <P>In principle the Labour Party will not be opposing this Bill on Second Stage but we are worried principally about sections 2 and 3 and the impact of the rather loose language of those sections in terms of the danger it could represent to some employment, particularly traditional employment not easily replaced.</P>
    <P>I noticed that Deputy Carey was having an each-way bet in some ways. On the one hand he wanted to protect some jobs in the existing coal industry in County Clare but he was recommending the establishment of spurs with road and rail transport arteries everywhere from County Clare.  That would solve the problems of County Clare but there is a bigger problem.  For example, there is a problem on the east coast in a number of ports and their is a problem in some of the ports in Limerick and Galway.  We must approach the overall problem.  I believe we can do so if we decide to address ourselves on Committee Stage to the problems posed by sections 2 and 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate over the past 24 hours it has struck me that the potential interpretation of what the provisions of this Bill purport to do is very wide-ranging.  I begin to question whether there are few meanings in what we are supposed to be examining and discussing.  Last evening Deputy John Bruton raised the point that this Bill allowed the ESB to be almost the National Development Corporation, mark II, in terms of some of its provisions, particularly those contained in section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing a major semi-State body such as the ESB it is only right that many questions be raised but it appears to me that there are more questions raised than answers given.  My initial examination of the provisions of the Bill led to a rather narrow interpretation.  I will quote from what the Minister had to <Col N="279" /> say in his introductory remarks as follows:</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to statutorily empower the ESB to promote, form, take part in, or acquire companies and to engage in the wholesale coal trade from Moneypoint and to regularise matters in relation to rates.</P>
    <P>Initially it was my view that the provisions of the Bill dealt specifically with that matter.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that the ESB should attempt to monopolise the whole of our coal industry market because its effects will be far-reaching in many areas, particularly that of employment.  Surely the Minister realises that one of the greatest areas of potential remaining in bulk cargo transportation worldwide today is to be found in the coal industry.  Equally, he must realise that many of our ports' main sources of activity in the bulk cargo field arise through the shipment of coal.  If, as the provisions of this Bill purport to do, all of the coal imported here is to come through one dock area &mdash; Moneypoint &mdash; that will spell the death knell for the remainder of our ports.  I do not accept for one moment that, once coal has arrived at Moneypoint, it will be trans-shipped around the country to other ports.  That will not happen.  It is more likely that coal suppliers will transport it by truck to various parts of the country when, ultimately, the whole system will begin to collapse.</P>
    <P>If what the Minister is endeavouring to do is to establish some kind of spot market at Moneypoint to compete with the port of, say, Rotterdam, certainly he will be unable to do so on the back of the coal industry only.  However, if he is serious in that attempt, why not pursue the full range of possibilities at Moneypoint? Why concentrate on the coal industry only if there is to be a serious element of competition?  I am sure the Minister is well aware that there is no conceivable way Moneypoint could compete with any of the major ports &mdash; Rotterdam being the one that springs to mind <Col N="280" /> immediately &mdash; in relation to one product, coal.  I cannot understand why he should stop short at the whole range of options open to him.</P>
    <P>I know what are and have been the problems encountered in the port of Waterford in my constituency over the past seven years where there has been an appalling, soul-destroying dispute.  That port is now close to getting back to work in the near future, the latest agreement having been reached with the unions, dockers and all involved.  The shipment of coal to that port would be a tremendous boost for the whole area because Waterford was and can be a major port.  It is my opinion that the one product that would help to re-establish the viability of that port is coal.  How then can we, in the circumstances of the provisions of this Bill, give a total monopoly to the ESB in terms of being the sole supplier of coal in this country?  I am opposed to monopolies whether in the private sector or in the public sector.  If the ESB are the sole suppliers of energy and a strike is called, as has often happened in regard to the supply of electricity, will the supply of energy to the domestic market, which is mainly in the coal business, although the oil end of the business will probably be the next area the ESB will move into, be affected?  I am opposed to the monopolisation of the coal market and to Moneypoint developing in that area. Such development would put us at the mercy of the company in terms of energy generally.</P>
    <P>Unlike what Deputy Higgins may interpret, I have no hang-ups about public sector companies getting involved in private sector enterprises if they see fit.  In fact I would encourage that.  If moneys and companies are available to them I do not think there is any reason they should not do this on a rolling basis but what I am opposed to is, that having done that and having made a success of it, the assets and the whole business have to remain forever in public sector hands instead of the State adopting an attitude of investing on a rolling basis in certain industries and realising a substantial sum of money from the sale of them.  They <Col N="281" /> could reinvest in other projects.  They could be thinking in those terms in the case of a company the size of the ESB. If they are serious with regard to Moneypoint they should look at the question of shipping as it is today on a worldwide basis.  With the advent particularly of 1992 and the Single European Market there may be some serious possibilities for a port which has the deepsea capacity that Moneypoint has.  If that is what they want to do I would encourage them to do so.  They should look at that whole question and not simply confine themselves to what I believe is a simple way of getting total control of the coal market to the detriment of everybody else and so that they can charge what they like on the domestic and industrial markets. That is wrong but they could look at the other question.</P>
    <P>The ESB, as has been said here, are involved in the consultancy business both in this country and on a worldwide basis. That is to be welcomed.  If they are the experts in the development of businesses specifically related to the electricity business, which is their core business, the business in which they have the expertise, there is absolutely nothing wrong with their making money out of that end of the business on a worldwide basis.  What I do not understand, and this was mentioned by the Minister in his speech, is that in 1986 the consultancy activities brought in some £7.5 million and that this was barely better than a break-even on this kind of return.  I should like to ask the Minister why they are only barely able to break even on that kind of activity?  I suspect, and I may be wrong in this, that there is cross-subsidisation from the core business of the ESB in what they are charging for electricity in that they are subsidising that other end of the business.  I should like to hear an answer to that question because if that is the case, there is something fundamentally wrong.  It is not that they are wrong to be in the consultancy business but I question on what basis they are in it and what the return to the company is in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are huge opportunities for a company like the ESB to be involved in <Col N="282" /> the consultancy business on an international basis but I believe their future lies in consultancy in their core business.  I do not see why they should be expanding into other areas which are not directly concerned with their own business.  The Minister in his speech mentioned, with regard to the Customs House Docks development, that the ESB were involved in project management as well as in management servicing contracts.  I am not sure what the Minister meant by that.  Am I to take it that the ESB are involved in the funding or overall construction of that development in some way other than directly related to the technical electrical end of what is needed to set that venture in motion?  I wonder what specifically is going on there.</P>
    <P>If one looks at all the international and multinational businesses around the world, one finds that all of them are shedding businesses that are not related to their core business.  They have found that it is wrong and unmanageable and that not alone are the businesses which are not directly inter-related suffering but that their core businesses are suffering as a result of those activities.  That situation should be looked at extremely carefully by the ESB when other companies such as Waterford Crystal are cutting back and cutting away from businesses which are not directly related to what they call their &ldquo;table top&rdquo; business.  Why should the ESB all of a sudden start to diversify all over the place?  The Bill potentially gives them the opportunity to do that.  The Bill is very wide ranging.  I should not like it to be as wide ranging as it is without some specific guidelines as to where the company should be going and what the management strategy should be in this area.  I should like to restate that I would give them every encouragement in relation to their core business and to investment.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provision in the Bill whereby the ESB can lend money for the setting up of companies. The big question to be asked &mdash; and this was pointed out here yesterday &mdash; is at what sort of interest rates these companies will be able to borrow money from <Col N="283" /> the ESB, money which by the way is State guaranteed.  If I had an idea for a company and the ESB were interested in it, I would be delighted to go to them and, hopefully, at the end of the day get a better rate of interest than I could from any of the commercial bodies.  Deputy John Bruton asked where the profits will go but I should like to know what would happen if a number of these companies started to lose money.  I do not believe that the guy in the private sector should get that kind of assistance from the State, with a State guarantee, to try ventures which may be totally unrelated to the ESB's business.  An essential question which has been generated by this Bill is what direction, definitions and management strategies are being evolved for the future development of the ESB, or for the private sector companies or other companies they may set up.  I want to know from the Minister if there is a five-year or ten-year strategy plan in mind and, if not, will this proceed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis?  If it does, the consequences do not have to be spelt out by me, but serious mistakes will be made.  I am not questioning the ESB just because they are a public sector company.  I would say the same thing about any private company if that is the way they operated.  Many of them are littered with examples of mistakes that were made in that area.</P>
    <P>A question which must be dealt with is the high cost of industrial electricity here. The Minister referred to this briefly in his speech when he said:</P>
    <P>The high cost of industrial electricity prices here has often been cited as a reason for the uncompetitiveness of Irish industry.  Deputies will be aware of the most recent 5 per cent reduction in electricity prices announced in the budget speech of 27 January.  While there was in the budget an imposition of a 5 per cent VAT rate on electricity the reduction which I have mentioned means that there will not be any change in the price paid by domestic customers, but it will result in a real reduction of 5 per cent for industrial <Col N="284" /> and most commercial customers who can reclaim their VAT payments.</P>
    <P>This reduction has brought Irish industrial prices much more into line with the European average and will greatly assist industry in its cost containment efforts.</P>
    <P>I want to question if this is the main reference in this Bill to what is the ESB's core business.  Any Minister with any responsibility for the industrial sector, commerce or agriculture will know that one of the crippling factors that continually raises its head is the price of electricity here today.  Over the past number of years that has had a ferocious impact on the end cost of goods out of this country. Should the ESB not deal with that aspect rather than expand in all sorts of other directions which will not have the real effect of lowering the cost of electricity and could well have the effect of electricity prices subsidising some of these ventures?</P>
    <P>What are we talking about here?  The Minister seems to think that even to get near the EC average is some kind of achievement.  We are an island off Europe and our costs are always going to be far higher than average.  It is in our interests that not alone do ESB electricity and energy prices in general come down to EC average, but that they go much below it.  This is to give us a competitive edge on the European, and indeed world markets.  That is what we should be discussing with the ESB.  That is what the core business of the ESB is.  That is the one area above all others in which they must be on a secure footing and going in a positive direction.  I have not seen evidence in real terms that that will continue over the next five years, but if it were to happen it would be possible then for the ESB in their present format to look at alternative areas.</P>
    <P>References have been made here this morning and last night to privatising aspects of the ESB business, to selling generating stations to the private sector and having a feedback into the grid which <Col N="285" /> would be controlled by the ESB.  I question that simplistic view.  I cannot see, with the overcapacity available in generating stations and with control of the grid left in the hands of the ESB, how the private sector would be interested in buying any of these items because they would be totally at the mercy of the ESB. Because of overcapacity in the generating stations, the price would, of course be kept down.  They would all have to compete and the ESB literally, would have a fierce grab on any company within the private sector.</P>
    <P>There has been privatisation of electricity in other countries, not just with reference to generating stations.  They have gone into the whole question of how the electricity is going to be supplied into the grid.  It would be far more realistic to look at the whole area rather than piecemeal, involving aspects of the business. There may be potential in this area and there may not.  I want to see a company that will continue to be run well and give the cheapest possible electricity and if that can be achieved in the public sector, I have no aversion to its remaining in the public sector.  If that cannot be done in the public sector but it can be shown that it could be done in other ways, that must be considered.  The expertise within the company may well be able to achieve that.  The parameters must be set down.</P>
    <P>Another area the ESB have constantly been in is the supply of appliances in their own shops.  We know only too well that in this whole area there have been losses consistently over a long number of years. I do not understand why the ESB still feel the need to maintain their interest in this area.  The only conceivable answer that could be given is that they see this as their only direct marketing forum to the public and are prepared to run this end of the business at a loss simply to keep the public in tune with using electricity as opposed to gas and so forth. There may be some certain logic in that approach.  However, the ESB should not be involved in this end of the business because it has become an extremely competitive business and there are out in the <Col N="286" /> market-place businesses quite capable of supplying the demand.  On balance, the aspect of the direct marketing forum would not have weight.</P>
    <P>The ESB should cut their losses in the area of the sale of appliances.  This happens continually in the private sector. Why can it not be done in the public sector?  This is where I fundamentally disagree with Deputy M. Higgins.  He, together with very many people, seems to think that you can never shed yourself of anything in the public sector, even if it is a huge loss-maker in an area where other approaches would be preferable.  I do not subscribe to that view; I have an open mind.  If the public sector can make a profit, good luck to it and it should be encouraged to do so.  If the sector is losing money in a specific area well covered by other businesses, why should it be in that business at all?</P>
    <P>As we head into the last year of the eighties and into the nineties there is a great opportunity for building a strong public sector, but it must be done in the light of the scarce Government resources available to it.  We are not advocating a ranting, ideology of privatisation of everything for the sake of privatisation. There is room for balance.  There must come forth from the public sector a much more realistic approach and there must not be this ideological fear of things being radically changed in businesses such as CIE and B &amp; I.  Things can be improved and it is time we started to look at that aspect.  Interestingly, this Bill is saying the same thing.  We can potentially interpret it along those lines, of giving the ESB the opportunity seriously to go into private enterprise.  I am not opposed to that, but I want to know how and by whom it will be funded and guaranteed, although the State seem to be guaranteeing it.  I want to know the type of businesses the ESB are going into.  Those questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>The ESB can produce many by-products. If there is a market demand for any by-product they should be able to form a company and sell such by-products and they should be encouraged to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> This is true of any by-product and agriculture is an obvious example of not getting the best out of the products of that industry.  We are shipping out too many items on the hoof and not getting the added value.</P>
    <P>What I dislike about the Bill is that it is very unclear as to what we are going to allow the ESB to do.  The one thing that is absolutely clear is that we are proposing to give the ESB a monopoly for the importation of coal.  I am totally opposed to that.  I do not want to see that happen in any circumstances because of the detrimental effects it would have on many other ports around the country and because there would also be huge job losses.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are opposed to the Bill because the Minister's intentions are not clear.  I should like a different kind of debate which would include an overall discussion and in-depth analysis of where the ESB should go from here.  Those questions have not been answered, there is a very unclear direction, but that will keep for another day. We are opposed to coal importation at Moneypoint, and indeed to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief and will confine my remarks to one point, while noting the caveats and reservations which have been expressed here by my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the provisions in the Bill should contribute substantially to the profitability of the ESB, namely, enabling the ESB to promote, form, to take part in or to acquire companies and to sell and to distribute by sea any product or substance, including coal.  I strongly feel that any such profits accruing to the ESB as a result of the passage of this legislation should be invested immediately in applying the best available technology to the emission stacks at Moneypoint.  To date, for various reasons, the ESB &mdash; and indeed successive Governments &mdash; have claimed that the financial resources were not there to apply the best available technology in terms of the most up-to-date scrubbers needed in the emission stacks <Col N="288" /> at Moneypoint.  They have cried that they have provided the best practical means under given circumstances.  This point and the fact that Moneypoint has the potential, notwithstanding the ongoing monitoring by different bodies, to cause serious environmental pollution has meant that we have been unable over the years to ratify the relevant EC directive on the control of such emissions.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to give an assurance to this House, in replying to Second Stage, that any profits which will accrue to the ESB, particularly in regard to Moneypoint, will be reinvested directly in bringing us up to date with the requirements of the necessary technology in relation to the emission stacks at Moneypoint.  I recognise the important contribution that Moneypoint makes to the economic, industrial, commercial and domestic life of the country in the provision of much needed energy but this whole aspect of allowing the ESB to provide less than satisfactory emission procedures for Moneypoint should now be rectified.  Perhaps this Bill, through the profits that should accrue to the ESB as a result of its passage, will rectify that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I await, with interest, the Minister's response and his guarantees that in return for support of this Bill he will direct the ESB to invest any such profits in resolving the potential environmental difficulties that may occur as a result of the operations at Moneypoint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to confine my remarks to two aspects of the Bill, the provision to allow the ESB to set up a company for the development of commercial fisheries and the provision for the distribution and sale of coal and other products from Moneypoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company concerned with the development of commercial fisheries will be known as Solmara which is now a going concern having taken over existing ESB commercial fisheries.  Its functions will include the development of ESB hatcheries for the production of salmon smolts for ESB farms and for sale to private farms.  They will also set up new <Col N="289" /> fish farms along the western seaboard as joint ventures with local, private and co-operative interests.  They will also be involved in various other aspects of ESB commercial fisheries programmes such as salmon processing for export, eel fishing and various other fish marketing projects.</P>
    <P>I welcome this provision as the ESB have a very fine record in restocking rivers and lakes.  I am sure their expertise will be a major boost to the fishing industry. We can learn from successful efforts and developments along the western coastal regions of Scotland and get examples of how successful they have been in promoting mariculture and fish farming in different forms.  The west could benefit enormously through an extra input from the ESB and I welcome the assignment of a role to them in the future.  I have total confidence in their expertise to further boost our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The main provision in the Bill is the extension of the role of Moneypoint to the wholesale coal business.  I welcome any activity that will generate further interest in the Shannon region.  I am sure that if there is increased shipping activity into Moneypoint it will give rise to further interest in the natural assets of the region as a whole.  It could also lead to further industries coming into the area.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary has been forgotten by successive Governments and indeed by the IDA.  I should like to briefly refer to the proposal to sell 500 acres of prime industrial location land on the Ballylongford side of the estuary.  This means abandoning the area.  However, the provision to allow Moneypoint to import coal for wholesale purposes must be welcomed because it could bring further interests to the area.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary is a natural and a national asset and it has the capacity to allow ships of up to 400,000 tonnes to come in if a small dredging operation was carried out.  A study commissioned by the Limerick Harbour Commissioners a few years ago pointed out that if £4 million was spent in dredging the mouth of the estuary, ships of up to 400,000 tonnes <Col N="290" /> could pass through it.  The Livence report made those recommendations.</P>
    <P>Moneypoint has the facilities to cater for very big ships but at present it is not being utilised to the full.  This Bill will rectify that.  The wording of subsection (2) of section 3 has given rise to some concern.  It has been discussed here previously by another speaker so I will not dwell on it for too long.  The word &ldquo;initially&rdquo; seems to imply that the ESB will import coal initially for trans-shipment but they could decide to use the roads to take coal and extend into the retail business.  The word &ldquo;initially&rdquo; was probably unfortunate but the people in Foynes Harbour Commission and in Fenit are very worried about what it really means.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;ship&rdquo; has also given rise to some confusion and I think that should be redefined as &ldquo;cargo ship&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister &mdash; and perhaps it has been suggested already &mdash; to amend subsection (2) of section 3 as follows: &ldquo;Where for the purposes of such distribution or sale within the State, the transportation of any such substance or product from the board's property at Moneypoint, in the county of Clare, is required, the substance or product shall&rdquo;&mdash; and instead of &ldquo;initially&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;at all times be transported therefrom by a cargo ship&rdquo;&mdash; instead of the word &ldquo;ship&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;to an existing port or harbour in the State&rdquo;.  That would do much to allay the fears of the people in Foynes and Fenit.  They are concerned that this Bill would have the effect of taking business away from their own ports.  The only business which Fenit have coming through their port is coal and oil. There are only two operators involved and they are concerned that their business will be wiped out entirely, especially in relation to coal.  If they were confident that coal would only be trans-shipped from Moneypoint in the future, then I am sure it could be trans-shipped very easily from Moneypoint to Fenit and it would probably benefit them in the future because coal would probably be brought in cheaper.</P>
    <P>In relation to Moneypoint, the jetty there is one of the finest in Europe.  The <Col N="291" /> jetty is the only Irish facility capable of handling Panamax vessels of 60,000-80,000 tonnes and Cape size vessels of 110,000-160,000 tonnes and it has all the modern unloading facilities of any port in Europe.  It is ranked among the three top ports in Europe.</P>
    <P>The coal unloading facility at the jetty is capable of handling volumes in excess of the present requirements of the power station.  Its under-utilisation at present is not desirable in view of the £40 million which was spent on the jetty originally. Further utilisation of the port in the nation's interest must be welcomed.  The three sets at Moneypoint are now in full production and they have the capacity for the use of some two million tonnes of coal per annum.  This factor gives the ESB a considerable coal market presence and purchasing muscle.  Now they can go out on the world market and bargain and they will be recognised as a very big customer and thereby will be in a better bargaining position to get cheaper coal. They should lead to benefits for the consumer and eventually for industry.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the view expressed by Deputy Doyle that any extra profit created should go to installing scrubbers in Moneypoint.  I think that the profits created should benefit the consumer and industry and should ensure that energy is produced at a cheaper rate.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to installing scrubbers at Moneypoint, I was in the Seanad when the Air Pollution Bill was going through and I said that scrubbers should be installed.  The pollution effect of Moneypoint should be continuously monitored and if it was shown that it was a big polluter, then consideration should be given to the installation of scrubbers.  Not only should the taxpayers in this country be involved but provision should be made for some form of EC grant towards the installation of scrubbers if they have ever to be installed in the future.  The main advantage from this would be cheaper fuel for the consumer and cheaper energy costs which at present are crippling industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> I would like to point out that the quality of coal used in Moneypoint is inferior and it is a low grade coal.  For consumer purposes I suggest that the ESB would consider importing anthracite which is a clean fuel and which burns very well in enclosed boilers.  Because of the low grade fuel used it is expected that it will be a polluter.  Moneypoint has not been commissioned for long enough to assess the full pollution effects but the coal used there at present could add to the problem in the future.  I suggest that we look at the quality of coal being used at Moneypoint. At present the ESB and Moneypoint import most of their coal from Colombia, the USA and Australia but it is recognised that Polish coal is the best for domestic use.  The market is tied up by existing operators and the ESB will have to break into that market to get a better quality coal.</P>
    <P>The Moneypoint location has potential for use as a trans-shipment centre for coal supply to European consumers.  That has been mentioned in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  Moneypoint could be used to transfer coal, or other bulk commodities, from large bulk carriers to smaller vessels for trans-shipment not only to Irish destinations but also to European destinations.  The Shannon estuary was considered on a number of occasions for trans-shipment and this is an opportunity for the estuary to get into this field.</P>
    <P>If coal can be trans-shipped from Moneypoint, and from the Shannon estuary, I cannot see why other products will not follow.  It is important that Moneypoint should import a better quality coal. Fears have been expressed by people of neighbouring ports that a monopoly will be created which will affect their business. If the ESB monopolise the importation of coal into Ireland, in the event of industrial action would both the consumer and industry suffer as a result?  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this Bill and it is welcome.  Any extra utilisation of Moneypoint must be welcomed.  The <Col N="293" /> interest which will be created in the Shannon estuary should lead to the development of further industries in the area.  I welcome also the further extension of the ESB brief regarding fishing.  It is very important that we carry out an immediate restocking policy in the major fishing rivers in Ireland.  I know there is a concerted move to curb pollution from farms and industry.  This is not enough.  The fishing season so far has been a disaster because the rivers have not been restocked to the required extent during the past few years.  This is an area where the ESB could play a major role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally accepted by the IDA, the Irish Goods Council and various other bodies involved in the promotion and setting up of industry that companies which have a proven track record in established markets are in the ideal position to set up new companies or subsidiaries.  These have a better chance of success than a small unknown entity starting off from scratch.  I welcome the proposal to give these extended powers to the ESB.</P>
      <P>The ESB have been in an unenviable position in having a monopoly on the provision of electricity.  A monopoly is always inclined to give a one-sided view or impression of the health of a particular company simply because the consumer has to carry the burden of responsibility by way of charges.  We have considerably higher electricity charges here than in most other European countries.  This puts our domestic consumer at something of a disadvantage but there is a great need to recognise the fact that high energy costs contribute very significantly to placing Irish manufacturers at a disadvantage. I am not blaming the ESB for this situation but it is worth pointing out that it has existed and will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted in the context of this legislation that the new companies which may be set up could involve the ESB with one or more loss-making enterprises.  In such cases the ESB might be compelled to pass on increased charges to their domestic and industrial consumers in order to <Col N="294" /> preserve the health of the overall company. I hope that will not be the case and that as a result of this Bill the cutting edge of the ESB will be sharpened considerably and that they will broaden their horizons and their marketing techniques. They must realise that our customers at home are most important when it comes to the competitiveness of Irish industry. I do not refer solely to the electricity industry itself but to the downstream industries which are served by electricity.</P>
    <P>Some reservations have been expressed by coal importers regarding the ESB's proposed importation and distribution of coal.  I fully recognise that a difficulty could arise due to the fact that the ESB are a powerful and successful enterprise.  They will have considerable clout within the market-place which might be to the disadvantage of those already in the business.  The purpose of this Bill is not to give the ESB a further monopoly but to improve the efficiency of the distribution service to the domestic and industrial consumer.  Such consumers form a very large portion of the base for our industrial exports.  If it is found that other companies are being placed at a disadvantage, the Minister will have to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I compliment the ESB on their work in relation to the preservation of the environment and the conservation and improvement of fish stocks.  They have already become involved in improving fish stocks in the main rivers but their involvement does not extend to tributary rivers.  Obviously there is considerable scope for restocking and improving these rivers.  I will not be parochial but I can think of a number of such rivers in my own constituency where this would be of great benefit to the general recreational facilities of the community at large and to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>The closure of a number of ESB turf-burning generating stations has been mooted.  Some are to close in the near future and others within the next ten years.  Allenwood has been mentioned on a number of occasions and there have been various scares over the past few years about its possible closure.  There is <Col N="295" /> a moral responsibility on the ESB, in conjunction with the IDA and other job-promoting agencies, to involve themselves seriously in determining what replacement industries will follow after the closure of some of these turf-burning generating stations.  In the case of Allenwood not only will the jobs in the station be lost to the community but also the downstream jobs with Bord na Móna and the private turf producers will be lost. This will have a seriously detrimental effect on the local economy.  All these points have been made to various Ministers over the past ten years.  It is not a problem which has appeared on the horizon within the past few weeks or months.  Very little has been done to rectify the situation, despite the fact that we all know we will reach the juncture at which those stations will have to close.</P>
    <P>Remarkably little has been done in laying the groundwork for an alternative industry.  The ESB are uniquely qualified to lay that groundwork now so as to ensure that the people in that area will be provided for after the life of the turf-burning generating stations has expired. It is particularly relevant in the context of this Bill that they should do so.  When considering the other areas into which they can diversify under the headings of this Bill, I would ask them to pay serious attention to the needs of the people in areas where generating stations are to close.  They should be in a position to put in place the necessary arrangements for the setting up of an alternative industry. Under this Bill they will be uniquely qualified for that role.</P>
    <P>I have to say that the Allenwood catchment area has had a very high employment level over the past number of years. The people of that community were unique in the sense that they were completely independent and self-sufficient.  They never sought any help or assistance from the State and they are always willing and anxious to help themselves and look after their own interests.  They were a self-sufficient community.  For that reason I ask that particular note be taken of their situation and that we also recognise that <Col N="296" /> other interests have closed down or have reduced dramatically their involvement in the area over the past five or six years. As a result there is now an urgent need for replacements and I implore the Minister to use his influence with the ESB to ensure that that alternative is brought forward with a clearly set out schedule so that people will know exactly what we are doing.</P>
    <P>I compliment the ESB for the consultancy work they are doing in the Middle East and elsewhere.  Obviously that is to the benefit of the economy but we should not forget our own domestic and commercial users either, from whom the ESB generated the revenue which has made them a healthy company and from whom they draw their strength.  I hope that has been taken account of.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the section in the Bill which removes any doubts concerning the amounts payable by the ESB in lieu of rates.  Here I have to sound a word of warning.  At budget time Ministers for Finance are inclined to look around at various areas where revenue can be raised and I would not like to see a Minister for Finance suddenly deciding because of the health of a particular company, in this case the ESB, that that company was capable of bearing an increased burden which would have the result of the rates burden getting greater and greater.  Obviously somebody will have to pay for this and, again, this will be the consumer.  Ultimately, those higher costs will be passed on to the consumer in one form or another.</P>
    <P>While I accept rates are payable I would point out that there should not be a never-ending cycle of increases which could prove detrimental as far as the finances of the ESB are concerned.  The local authorities in the areas concerned have a real need for some of these finances also.  It should be recognised that ESB generating stations and other industrial outlets generate extra traffic and, as a result, extra pressure will be placed on the local roads network.  Greater recognition should be given to that fact while keeping in mind the proposal to remove <Col N="297" /> any doubts concerning the amounts payable by the ESB.  While doubts may be removed, they may also be created in other areas and they may not be to the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that the ESB have made a major contribution to the economy over a long number of years and recognition should be given to that fact.  Equally, it should also be recognised that they are probably in one of the best positions to spearhead the formation of new companies either in distribution or manufacturing.  They have established worldwide contacts and they should be able to utilise those contacts to their own best advantage but more particularly to the best advantage of this economy.  If that is the way matters proceed, then this Bill will have proved to have been both constructive and useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief and to the point because I am aware the House is anxious to conclude Second Stage of this Bill.  Furthermore, I am aware that the implications of this Bill have been well aired in the House.  One of the characteristic features of this debate has been the marked divergence of views expressed, particularly from this side of the House, in regard to the advisability or otherwise of proceeding with this measure.  Some people are vehemently opposed to this measure and the greatly widened powers it proposes to give to the ESB.  Others have been markedly supportive while there are others, like myself, who would give questioning support to this measure.  The geographical location of some of the Deputies influenced the views they expressed in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very supportive of the thesis that the ESB have done a magnificent job.  As one of the enterprises in the semi-State sector it has been one of the proudest flag bearers of the semi-State concept.  I concur with the tributes which have been paid to the ESB for the marvellous work they have done in supplying domestic and commercial electricity.  It is only on very rare occasions in times of dispute when we find ourselves in zones A,B or C that <Col N="298" /> we realise the full extent of our dependency on the ESB.  Again, I want to fully identify with the words of praise for the ESB for diversifying into areas which up to now have not been catered for, such as development of the salmon industry, and for the entrepreneurial spirit they have shown in going abroad to sell their high tech expertise which has given this nation an elite status in the field of high tech industrial development in other countries.  We are very proud of the ESB and I have no objection to the ESB going down the road of further diversification if it is in areas which are not already catered for.</P>
    <P>The name of the company is not the Coal Distribution and Supply Board but rather the Electricity Supply Board.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Enright in relation to the developmental role proposed for the ESB in this Bill in areas which are already well catered for in this country.  We have an excellent private coal importing and distribution system which now has to be conscious of pollution control.  We have kept tabs on and monitored the degree of scientific advance in this area and we welcome the moves which have been made by coal distributors to fulfil their social and economic obligations in regard to pollution control by using new technology in the control of emissions or in the removal of sulphur from the atmosphere. We know that given time and a enough scope eventually they will bring the pollution cloud that hangs over this city in particular under control and minimise the level of acid rain.</P>
    <P>While it is another step in the area of diversification by the ESB there is no doubt that in terms of overall benefit to the economy it is difficult to see any real results.  What we are talking about is in fact a transfer of jobs from one company to another or from one end of the country to another.  I have not yet been treated to facts and figures showing that there will be any increase in job numbers in the coal industry as a result of this proposal. I share the general consensus, in view of the fact that the ESB are a semi-State organisation that they are in a privileged <Col N="299" /> position when dealing with competition from the private sector.  It is a bad day for the taxpayer if the money paid by them is to be used to give the ESB an unfair advantage in the coal industry. Seeing that the consensus in this House is in favour of widening the powers of the ESB, there should be some commitment to the House that the money would be used to reduce the level of electricity costs to the consumer and towards controlling the level of pollution from the Moneypoint plant.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was a member of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which three or four years visited the Moneypoint plant.  We were unanimous in our recognition of the marvellous facility which we saw.  We lauded the ESB in achieving such a high level of technical competence, but the whole genesis of this measure is that the Moneypoint plant is being under-utilised at present and that the docking and berthing facilities are way beyond the present level of utilisation.  In order to take up the slack facilities in Moneypoint, the ESB have now decided to go into the importation and distribution of coal.  The point has been validly made that when profits accrue from this, they should be used towards controlling the level of emissions from the Moneypoint plant.  On our visit we were shown compelling statistics to indicate that at national level there would not be any fall-out in terms of acid rain and that the monitoring stations were keeping an eye on the situation. However, it is generally accepted that what goes up must come down.  In the case of Moneypoint, because of the high altitude of the chimney stacks and the prevailing winds, we are exporting our soot and sulphur rain to other countries. It is widely accepted that when Moneypoint is at full capacity, the likely victim from our emissions will be Scandinavia. I fully agree with the point made by Deputy Doyle in this House that any profits from this development should be used to put in scrubbers into the chimney stacks in Moneypoint so that we comply <Col N="300" /> with the directive from the EC which demands that any new development in this area must have the necessary pollution controls.</P>
    <P>The oil crisis in the seventies brought us to our senses and made us realise that carbon fuels were not inexhaustible.  I am not talking about nuclear energy, but despite the oil crisis I am always amazed that the ESB with all their expertise do not have a long hard look at developing alternative energy forms.  I am talking about wave and wind power.  Given the potential of wave and wind power, especially along the Atlantic coast, it should not be outside the scope of the ESB to pioneer work in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to assure the House that the profits from this measure will be used for pollution control, particularly in Moneypoint.  We in this country are very quick to adjust our haloes when it comes to Chernobyl or Sellafield.  The fact that up to now this country has not had any fall-out from Moneypoint does not mean that when the other stack comes into operation or when the Scandinavians begin to monitor the increase in acid rain there, that there is no obligation on this country.</P>
    <P>I give a cautious welcome to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their detailed and interesting contributions. As is often the case in this House, the contributions ranged over a very wide field, and contained fairly diverse views, and we had opposite considerations not only between parties but within parties.  It will not be possible to deal with all of the points raised but I assure that the House that every consideration will be given to the matters raised between now and Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned earlier, each State-sponsored body has been asked under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for practical proposals to create jobs.  Based on experience and success in recent times a threefold expansion of turnover in overseas consultancies by State agencies within five years has been targeted.  Since <Col N="301" /> the mid-seventies, the ESB have been very successful in securing consultancy contracts abroad and a low risk, low investment approach was adopted.  Traditionally the ESB concentrated their efforts in the Middle East but markets have contracted there and competition is intense.  For strategic business reasons and if they are to meet the targets set for themselves under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the ESB must look elsewhere for work.  They are now promoting their services not only in Africa and the Far East, but in Europe and the United States as well.  I am told and I accept that the ability to form subsidiary companies and to enter joint ventures abroad by participation in companies formed for that purpose will be of significant benefit to the ESB.  That is why they have been provided with these powers.  Deputies will share my concern that the export of services, and goods to go with them where possible, can be a source of badly needed employment.  We need to follow and develop every potential source of such employment and exports.  Every company and every State enterprise should see this as a desirable role, The ESB have been valuable pioneers in the export of services and I want to give them added assistance.  If the ESB are to be successful in breaking into new markets they must enjoy similar commercial freedom to private companies. This Bill gives them the necessary freedom while limiting the liability of the electricity consumer.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill have provoked comment and I will reiterate the reasons why the ESB are being allowed to enter the coal business at this time. No one has anything to fear from this proposal.  Import cost reduction is the aim.  At Moneypoint we have one of the finest ports in Europe and facilities costing tens of millions of pounds.  We must exploit this facility to the full.  Each year the ESB import approximately 2 million tons of coal.  This coal is purchased on the world market at a very competitive price and it can be brought into Moneypoint in cargo lots five times or more <Col N="302" /> larger than to anywhere else on our coasts.  The vast bulk of this coal is in the form of slack but there is a large volume of singles or small lumps in this grade and use of this for the solid fuel market has clear economic benefit.  Not only will this pass on to the consumer the benefits of the ESB's ability to import large consignments of coal at competitive prices, but it will also serve to reduce processing costs.  I am aware coal imports represent a considerable amount of the business of other Irish ports and, in order that ESB involvement in coal trading will not affect these ports adversely, the Bill provides for the distribution of coal by sea only from Moneypoint.  The intention is that any coal, whether it be moved by the ESB themselves or by a purchaser of coal, must be moved from Moneypoint by sea.  In that way the concerns of other ports have been met in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This development will augment and diversify our energy supply, assist the balance of payments and reduce consumer costs.  Overall, in addition to the coal provision, I see the Bill sending a renewed message to companies and State bodies to explore any worthwhile development ideas.  In this Bill the Government show a willingness to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with some of the points raised by Deputies in the debate. I have to remind them that we were told that the ESB were in a monopoly situation, they should be fully commercial, they should reduce energy costs and, at the same time, they should maintain uneconomic activity operations, they should be confined to their core business and should be precluded from becoming involved in extraneous business areas. Therefore, I have some difficulty in endeavouring to deal with the queries raised and in particular to find a consensus from which we can go forward. Clearly, there is majority support for the measures introduced in this Bill and I will do my best to remove the doubts held by other Deputies with regard to particular provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton raised a question on fiscal and financial points.  I say <Col N="303" /> to him that the question of VAT and excise duty has been elaborated on in the budget debate.  The Government have a clear policy on the reduction of electricity tariffs and, in all, a 19 per cent reduction has been achieved in the past two years. The consumer has benefited to that extent, and there will be a further 5 per cent reduction for industrial electricity.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the Jakobsen report, particularly on cost cutting and increased productivity, continue to be pressed forward and the Minister for Energy expects that further economies should be possible on these and other fronts.  Against this scenario is a proposal for a 16 per cent increase for energy costs in a neighbouring country, so it is clear we are making substantial progress on this front.  I recognise that the cost of energy in this country has been for long a major problem in relation to industrial expansion, but I think nobody can doubt that very significant progress has been made in dealing with that matter in recent times.</P>
    <P>As to the potential for domestic coal price reduction &mdash; this is central to this debate &mdash; I can assure Deputy Bruton and Deputy O'Malley that the potential exists.  House coal import prices to this country have been largely unaffected by changes in world coal prices.  The Irish house coal import prices have not fallen in recent times despite a drop in dollar terms of between 30 and 35 per cent in the past two or three years.  Therefore, it is clear that house coal imports have not shown a corresponding fall during the same period.  It should be clear to Deputies that introducing further competition into this area should bring about a significant reduction and bring prices of imported coal into line with what is happening on the world scene.  The scope indicated by Deputy Bruton is largely correct.  There is up to 62 per cent at the moment between the cost of importation and cost to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley need have no fears about the prices in ESB contracts.  I am assured they are very effective and enough flexibility exists to cater for spot <Col N="304" /> coal price reduction.  However, Deputy O'Malley and others concentrated for a considerable time on this aspect of ESB operations.  It is not one in which this House can become deeply involved.  It is in the commercial range of activity for the ESB, but I want to deal with some of the accusations made and levelled against the ESB in the context of their contracts for the importation of coal.</P>
    <P>The present ESB requirement in this area is about two million tonnes per annum.  This is purchased in two ways. First, long-term contracts are entered into for guaranteed delivery of a basic quantity of coal.  These contracts contain renegotiation clauses and are up for constant review depending on price fluctuations. Already the ESB have renegotiated these contracts, the last of which took place a few months ago. These contracts are effective and necessary and give a security of supply.  Secondly, the ESB buy on the spot market which enables the board to source considerable parts of their requirements at absolutely rock bottom prices.  Anyone who suggests it is possible to have a guaranteed supply of huge amounts of coal without combining these two systems of purchasing arrangements just is not facing reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to his worries on the environment side.  I am assured there is and will continue to be the greatest of vigilance in this area.  In no way can or will we accept an unacceptable sulphur content.  I assure the House and Deputy Spring that the ESB will continue to monitor this situation and pledge that they will give this matter their fullest consideration.  However, on a more philosophic concept, I cannot agree that the opportunities for the ESB to become involved in the use of Moneypoint in the way that has been suggested in this Bill should be foregone.  The jetty had to be built to take 150,000 to 300,000 tonnes of cargoes with maximum freight and contract prices that go with this, and the issue now is the further economic use of this facility with major benefits for the economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring and Deputy O'Malley <Col N="305" /> raised the matter of electricity installation safety.  I am aware of the work of the ETCI, a sub-branch of EOLAS, to provide for standards in this area. However, the ESB do not have a statutory duty to police wiring and installations but they do so on a voluntary basis to a very large extent.  It is a matter for the electrical contractor to ensure that the highest standards prevail when these installations are made.  However, if any evidence is available which would indicate that there should be ministerial intervention or further diagnosis of problems of this kind, the Minister for Energy will, no doubt, be prepared to study that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring raised the question of cheaper tariffs for industries in the west. The ESB Acts prohibit discriminatory rating of the ESB to customers anywhere in the country and, since the ESB are statutorily debarred from doing this, obviously that type of proposal is unacceptable. In any event the IDA and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, provide a more appropriate means of helping industries in the west.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan asked whether Irish registered ships could be used and said that this should be an absolute requirement in the Bill.  It would not be possible under EC requirements to make a provision like this, but since small coastal ships will be used, much of the traffic involved should be Irish or Irish crewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question of city smog and pressed for smokeless fuel.  The Minister for the Environment is fully conscious of this problem and the EC has prescribed norms by regulation. Minister Flynn is embarking on a pilot scheme in an area here in Dublin.  Electricity and gas use and the use of smokeless fuels and low sulphur dioxide fuels such as peat are part of the solution. Obviously more efficient coal combustion is another.  There is, however, no necessary contradiction between cheaper coal imports and smog reduction measures. It may be said that more coal would be used but no one would suggest that price should be used as a weapon.  In <Col N="306" /> London, for instance, there are compulsory smokeless zones and it is likely that we will have developments like that here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright wondered about the impact of the provisions in this Bill on Bord na Móna operations.  Bord na Móna have to contend with the importation of oil and natural gas as other energy products. Peat is a low-sulphur dioxide product and it will be up to Bord na Móna to try to promote the value of that product against other competing considerations. Obviously avoiding lower cost imports is not a justifiable method.</P>
    <P>In the general area of pollution control and Deputies' fears in relation to problems of this kind I want to state that Ireland's total contribution to sulphur dioxide emissions is below 2 per cent of Europe's total; we are playing our full part in the EC environmental measures and this has been acknowledged both at home and abroad.  I would also like to say that in regard to the types of coal imported, and to deal with some of the accusations levelled against the ESB in the context of poor-quality coal and coal that would probably cause greater environmental problems than would otherwise be the case, here again Deputies are straying away from the facts because the coal which is purchased by the ESB from Colombia, for instance, contains 0.7 per cent sulphur by weight; coal from Australia contains 0.8 per cent and coal from Poland contains 0.6 per cent which is considerably below the EC requirement in this regard.  Clearly with an eye to the environmental and pollution requirements of the future and with the public awareness and the desirability of this development for the future, the ESB will continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Deputy Kavanagh inquired about the reference in the Minister's speech with regard to a 20 per cent reduction in the <Col N="307" /> price of domestic coal.  That is the Minister's estimate of the potential effect of the ESB's activity on domestic coal prices as sold to the householder arising from this potential development at Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies were worried about the use of the word &ldquo;initially&rdquo; in section 3(2).  The reason for the use of this word in the first instance was to try to ensure that where haulage was necessary away from sea points there would be freedom to do that.  However, having listened to the views put forward by Members and having had discussions with the parliamentary draftsman on these sections, I can tell the House that a redraft of this section will be made before Committee Stage and that we will ensure that all coal will always have to be trans-shipped from Moneypoint.  The word &ldquo;initially&rdquo; will be dropped.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton said that the ESB's assets were over-valued.  The gross asset value of the ESB is about £1.5 billion. These are just book values.  The replacement value of the assets of the ESB is probably closer to £3 billion or £4 billion.  However, I wonder about the point Deputy Bruton made in that context because he seemed to be suggesting that the ESB would dispose of some of their assets.  For a generally commercially-minded Deputy to, at the same time, suggest that the assets of the ESB are over-valued, is not a commercial way to approach that.  It would be very rare for somebody who intends to dispose of something to say that it was over-valued.</P>

      <P>What I mean to say is that when one talks about asset value and the network the ESB have, there are many areas of low density of population where electricity has been provided at a fairly substantial cost to the company but where this is very necessary so far as the public at large are concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy John Bruton and other Deputies referred to the fact that the ESB are engaged in businesses which are nonprofitable and particular reference was made to the area of appliances.  Here again I have a little news for Deputies in that the ESB will, for the first time, be showing a clear profit in this area this very year.  So this would not be the time to decide to pull out of that line of business.</P>

      <P>The ESB have improved their operations in that area, but I do not mind telling Deputies that a few years ago when it was proposed to disengage from this business there was opposition from the trade itself, which seems to put a slightly different complexion on that whole matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as helpful as I can.  The fact still remains that Deputies put on the record of this House that this is an area from which the ESB should disengage because they are losing money but the opposite is the case and we should at least acknowledge improvement where it is made.  That does not belie the fact that mistakes were made in the past or that loose arrangements may have been made.  If they have been tidied up and if the ESB are now profitable that is a new situation and we should acknowledge it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle wants the Minister for Energy to give an assurance that the profits which will arise from new developments at Moneypoint will be used exclusively for new technology to prevent emissions from Moneypoint.  Like all Deputies in this House, I share Deputy Doyle's concern for environmental matters generally but I do not think it would be right to commit profits which have yet to be made for a purpose which has not been proven.  The Minister for Energy's predecessor gave an assurance that there will be independent monitoring of the emissions from Moneypoint.  This is being done and will continue to be done in the future.  The best advice available to us is that it is not a problem at present but obviously the emissions have to be constantly monitored.  As I have said, to commit unearned profits, under this Bill, for the use of new technology where the requirement has not been proven would be unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Avril Doyle also stated that this Government were prevented from signing a draft directive because of the problem of emissions from Moneypoint or because of other atmospheric pollution problems in the country.  That is not true. There is a draft directive before the Council of Environment Ministers in the EC and several countries have objections to the provisions in that directive because they consider that they are too onerous. It is somewhat less than fair to choose the situation at Moneypoint to highlight <Col N="310" /> the fact that this Government have not yet signed that directive.  We, like many other countries, are afraid that the provisions in that directive are too onerous. Our contribution to pollution in a European context is absolutely minimal.  We are not in the same league as the Germans and other countries.  That is not to say that because we have a relatively free environment in this context we should be negligent.  I want to put that in context. There is no way this Government are precluded from signing that directive because of Moneypoint or other problems. It is a wider issue altogether.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude with a few general points in relation to Moneypoint because that seems to be the one area where Deputies had doubts as far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned.  There was fairly widespread support for the ESB having the freedom and the flexibility to engage in consultancy services in any part of the world and for the removal of the difficulties the ESB have had up to now in gaining contracts.  The main area for contention was in relation to opening up the possibility to the ESB for the importation of coal to Moneypoint for uses other than ESB generation.</P>
    <P>Moneypoint belongs to the nation.  It has a considerable unused capacity and if it can be used to import cheaper coal into this country &mdash; it is clear that it can &mdash; by all means let us facilitate this necessary development.  It is clear from the experience gained by the ESB already that it will be possible to achieve this aim.  The argument has been made in the debate that the ESB have entered into unfavourable contracts for coal importation.  I think I have demonstrated on a general basis that this is not true.  Even if we were to accept that contention, then the ESB's involvement in this new enterprise in Moneypoint is not a threat to anybody.  If you are supporting the notion that other people involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What about the electricity consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the coal importing <Col N="311" /> business are being affected by this non-commercial organisation that has made all these mistakes, you should have no worries.  I do not think you can argue that the ESB will have an unfair advantage over other coal importers if, at the same time, you are charging that organisation of having paid too much for the product in the first place.</P>
      <P>To prove that point a little more, individual coal importers have beaten a path to the ESB seeking preferential treatment and looking for exclusive arrangements. Why are they doing that? Obviously, they see that the ESB will have a facility for importing coal at a lower price than is the case at present and they want preferential treatment. The ESB will give preferential treatment to no one.  They will not be engaged in the retail business; they will merely be importing the coal at rock bottom prices and the people engaged in the retail and distribution ends of that business are free to buy from the ESB.  The ESB will not be engaged in disposing of the coal directly.</P>
      <P>The country is entitled to free trade in coal and not to have it cornered by one particular group.  The ESB will not be getting into the distribution of coal and have no interest in retailing it.  Deputies, in some cases, fail to realise that the aim here is to effectively reduce the cost of importing coal and to transfer this benefit to the consumer.  The present system allows for an excessive write up in the coal market by the industry and it will certainly be no harm to bring a more competitive edge into the market. However, there is a wider aspect to sections 3 and 4 of this Bill.  By comparison with the capacity of Moneypoint, the total Irish market for coal has small potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that Deputies in the debate on this Bill confined themselves to the sort of narrow margins that would exist for Moneypoint development if it is confined to domestic trade.  The aim is to try to open up this facility as a highly developed, international trans-shipment port.  I am glad to tell the House that <Col N="312" /> there has been fairly widespread international interest in this facility and one significant proposal put to the ESB for its use &mdash; a long way from this country with an eye to the European market.</P>
    <P>I want to allay Deputies' fears in relation to this matter and to confirm that we are talking about a wider front than that presented on the domestic scene. We have an international developed port with facilities to be found in very few places around Europe.  We are opening up the possibility of its usage, at the same time helping to reduce the cost of importation of coal, with a consequent beneficial effect for the consumer while being fair to existing importers, confining the operation to Moneypoint and the product being moved by sea from there.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that Deputies' doubts in relation to the introduction of these measures are without foundation.  I want to ask them to reconsider their position, to give the measures full support, aimed not only at improving our domestic position and reducing costs at home but also at opening up the possibilities for international activities on a wide scale at Moneypoint.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In anticipation of getting to Committee Stage today I am circulating a very small amendment to the last line of the Bill.  It concerns the commencement date in the Bill of 1 March which of course is now past and the amendment merely seeks to delete &ldquo;March&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;September&rdquo;. I take it that when we come to Committee Stage that will be acceptable. I wanted to give the House full notice of it before I started my Second Stage reading.</P>
      <P>On 16 June last I informed this House that I hoped to present to it legislation extending the breadth of Irish territorial waters from three to 12 nautical miles. Accordingly, it is with great satisfaction that I now address the House on the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which gives effect to this proposal.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will notice, the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is a very short piece of legislation containing only three sections but this fact should not be allowed to take from its importance. Let me, therefore, explain to the House the purpose and effects of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, Deputies should be aware of what this legislation does not affect.  It does not affect the coastal State's exclusive sovereign rights over the natural <Col N="314" /> resources of the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas known as the continental shelf.  That should clarify the matter for the House.  This is a natural feature, being a prolongation of the land under the sea out from the Irish coast namely, the Atlantic ocean.  Its outer limits are irregular, but Ireland is fortunate to have the extensive shelf which can stretch in some areas up to approximately 450 miles from our coast.</P>
    <P>Ireland's sovereignty in respect of any minerals to be found on the continental shelf and the exploration and exploitation of them, has already been established in accordance with international law to the outer limit of the continental margin, so that any increase in the national territory will not affect the State's entitlement to these rights.  The processes used for the recovery of such natural resources, for example, offshore installations, are governed by the Minerals Development Act, 1940, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, and likewise will not be affected by the Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to living resources, Deputies will be aware that the fisheries regime is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy within the Community.  An extension of the national territory will not affect that regime.  Irish fishing vessels will continue to have exclusive rights within six miles from the baseline or shore.  Voisinage arrangements, that is, a reciprocal sharing with close neighbours, in respect of Northern Ireland fishermen will continue to be applied, and the rights of other Community countries in areas beyond six miles and up to 200 miles from the coast will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>Deputies are probably conversant with the current fisheries regime.  Five of our EC partners are entitled to fish in our six to 12 mile area.  However, they may only fish for certain species, for example, mackerel and herring.  This was most recently laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No.  170/83 of 25 January 1983. Meanwhile, in the 12 to 200 mile area all fishing is governed by the Common <Col N="315" /> Fisheries Policy and the regulations made under it.  Within the framework of these regulations the total allowable catches &mdash; tacs &mdash; and quotas of each member state are reviewed annually on the basis of the best available scientific advice and evidence.  Again, this remains unaffected.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for patrolling up to 200 miles, which is the extent of the Irish exclusive fishery zone, rests with the Irish naval service.  It will continue to perform this task.</P>
    <P>Neither does this legislation deal with or affect the State's right under international law to an exclusive economic zone.  Such a zone, a new concept under international law, will give extensive jurisdiction not only over living and nonliving resources, but over all matters relating to the sea within 200 nautical miles from the coast.  This zone is to be distinguished from the continental shelf which gives the coastal State sovereign rights over the natural resources it contains, particularly minerals, and the exclusive fishery zone which grants the coastal State extensive jurisdiction over living resources in the waters up to 200 nautical miles from the coast.  Separate legislation will probably be required to establish an exclusive economic zone and to protect and advance our interests therein.  Again, this is a matter to be distinguished from the current legislation before the House which extends the breadth of the territorial seas.</P>
    <P>A fourth issue not affected in any way by the current legislation is the position of the State with respect to the national territory.  The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the breadth of the territorial seas from three to 12 nautical miles.  In doing so, this legislation is subject to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and, therefore, will not in any way affect the State's position under the Constitution in respect of Northern Ireland and the waters off its coast.</P>
    <P>Having indicated the areas not affected by the present legislation, I now come to <Col N="316" /> consider the concept of the &ldquo;territorial sea&rdquo; and the matters that come within its ambit.  The law governing the uses of the sea and its resources is a complicated and difficult subject, as it is made up of a number of different principles which may, on occasion, even appear contradictory.</P>
    <P>The most long-standing, fundamental and, until recent times, over-riding principle is that of the freedom of the high seas, which has been jealously guarded for centuries against attempts to erode it. Nevertheless, it could never be regarded as an absolute freedom.  Coastal states, in the interest of their own sovereignty and security, succeeded in placing limits on this concept by the introduction, as early as the seventeenth century, of an entitlement to an area of coastal waters. Therefore, it is now an accepted principle of international law that the sovereignty of a state extends beyond its land territory and its internal waters to a belt of sea adjacent to its coast.  That belt of sea is described as the territorial sea.</P>
    <P>This principle was recognised by Ireland and incorporated into Article 2 of the Constitution, which states that &ldquo;The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas&rdquo;.  Within this belt the coastal State is entitled to exercise sovereign rights.  Thus, as Deputies will note, there appears to be a contradiction between, on the one hand, the freedom of the seas for all states and, on the other, the right of all coastal states to a territorial sea. These conflicting rights are partly reconciled in the right of innocent passage for all ships in the territorial sea.</P>
    <P>The question of the breadth of the territorial sea has exercised the minds of international lawyers for quite some time.  By the end of the 18th century, a territorial sea of three nautical miles was generally accepted and applied by most states.  This is often referred to as the &ldquo;cannon shot rule&rdquo;, based on the premise that the range of a cannon fired from the coast was approximately three nautical miles.</P>
    <P>However, within the last hundred years a small number of coastal states <Col N="317" /> began to claim territorial seas of greater and differing breadths.  The difference in practice gave rise to many concerns with respect to the coastal state's jurisdiction and the rights of other states which were consequently affected.  Since the beginning of this century, numerous international conferences have been held in an attempt to rationalise and codify these unilateral actions by states.  There was considerable resistance to the claims of coastal states in respect of the breadth of their territorial seas.  Much of this resistance came from those states with large seafaring commercial enterprises and interests.  In fact, this lack of agreement persisted to the extent that as late as 1958, at the first UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, sharp differences were revealed between those states which sought to secure maintenance of the three mile limit and those which desired wider limits.  In the event, the Geneva Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone, 1958, is silent on the breadth of the territorial sea.</P>
    <P>Many efforts were made since 1958, at Law of the Sea Conferences, to achieve agreement based on the practice of states in this regard.  These conferences also had as their ultimate objective the creation of an international legal regime to govern the sea in all its aspects and to thus clarify the rights and duties of all states.  It was not until very recently, 1982 in fact, that a Convention was finally concluded which codifies the general practice of states in respect of the breadth of their territorial sea and includes a large number of provisions covering a wide range of issues relating to the sea and its resources.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was the result of the lengthy third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, was adopted in 1982 and signed by 155 states, including Ireland.  Although not yet in force (it has been ratified by 34 states and requires 60 ratifications to bring it into force), it is now generally regarded by the international community as incorporating the international law governing the seas and, in particular, as codifying, <i>inter alia,</i> the breadth of the territorial sea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> Article 3 of the Convention provides that &ldquo;every State has the right to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not exceeding 12 nautical miles . . . &rdquo;.  By November 1987, 103 states had established a territorial sea taking advantage of this rule.  Of the European Community's 11 coastal states, only one other (Denmark) still adheres to the traditional three nautical mile territorial sea, Belgium being our most recent Community partner to extend its territorial sea to 12 nautical miles.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill at present before the House is to give effect to this international law and practice.  As a consequence, it is necessary to amend the Principal Act in this area, the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959, which states in section 3 that the breadth of the territorial seas shall be three nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. Section 2 (1) of the Bill proposes that the 1959 Act be amended so that the breadth of the territorial seas shall now be 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline.</P>
    <P>The normal baseline, in accordance with international law, is the low water line along the coast of the mainland, or of any island or on any low tide elevation situated wholly or partly at a distance not exceeding the breadth of the territorial sea from the mainland or an island. Where the coastline is deeply indented as it is off our southern, western and north-western coasts, straight baselines may be drawn, joining appropriate points along the coast.  Section 4 of the 1959 Act reflects this rule and provides that the Government may, by order, prescribe straight baselines.  The Maritime Jurisdiction Act (Straight Baselines) Order, 1959, accordingly established straight baselines for Ireland from Carnsore Point around to Malin Head.  It is now necessary to amend section 4 of the 1959 Act to ensure that it corresponds with the proposed extension of the breadth of the territorial seas.  This is done in section 2 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) of the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is designed to ensure that for the purposes <Col N="319" /> of all legislation, both pre-and post-1959, the territorial seas shall be taken to be 12 nautical miles from baselines.</P>
    <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Bill, it is proposed that this legislation will come into effect on a particular date in 1988.  The international community and, in particular, those navigating in our waters can thus be made aware in advance of this most important step by Ireland.  As Deputies will note, it is necessary to amend section 3 (3) to provide for a later date than the section currently proposes.  I have circulated an amendment to this date at 1 September of this year, instead of March as in the draft Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>This legislation will, of course, have far-reaching consequences.  The immediate effect of the extension of the breadth of the territorial sea is to increase the national territory.  Such an extension of state sovereignty also includes the air space over the territorial sea, as well as its bed and subsoil.  As a result, the area of application and effect of all legislation is also correspondingly increased.</P>
    <P>With the enactment of this legislation, Ireland's customs, fiscal, sanitary and immigration laws and regulations will extend to a 12 nautical mile territorial sea.  It must be noted, however, that all states operate within the international community &mdash; a central aspect of which is the need for co-operation and interdependence among all states &mdash; and states must therefore conduct their relations in accordance with international law.  Consequently, while a state has extensive rights over its territorial sea, these rights are subject to corresponding duties.</P>
    <P>Under international law, the ships of all States are entitled to innocent passage through the territorial sea.  Passage is innocent so long as it is &ldquo;not prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of a coastal state&rdquo;.  The coastal state is under a duty not to hamper innocent passage through its territorial sea.</P>
    <P>Foreign ships exercising the right also have certain duties; for example, laws and regulations enacted by the coastal <Col N="320" /> state in the interests of safety of navigation must be complied with.  Where passage is considered to be non-innocent, the coastal state is entitled to take the necessary steps in its territorial sea to prevent such passage.  The coastal state is also entitled to suspend innocent passage temporarily in specified areas of its territorial sea where it is essential for the protection of its security.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may recall, I mentioned earlier that the ships of all states are entitled to innocent passage through the territorial sea.  This includes both warships and submarines, but the law also requires that submarines and other underwater vessels navigate on the surface and show their flag.  Further, submarines and warships must stow all weapons and comply with such other laws and regulations of the coastal state concerning passage through the territorial sea, as are in compliance with international law.  If a warship or submarine fails to comply, the coastal state may require it to leave its territorial sea immediately.</P>
    <P>All states have the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment.  In this respect, all states are required firstly to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment when exercising their sovereign rights to exploit their natural resources.  Secondly, the coastal state has the exclusive right to permit, regulate and control dumping in its territorial sea.  Consequently, no dumping may take place without its express prior approval.  Thirdly, the coastal state is entitled to require all vessels to comply with its laws and regulations on the prevention of marine pollution. Fourthly, all states are required to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment from or through the atmosphere and from land based sources. As Deputies will be aware, in respect of these last three points, Ireland has ratified the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources, 1974, the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and <Col N="321" /> Aircraft, 1972, and the London Dumping Convention, 1972.  The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, gives effect to the provisions of the London and Oslo Conventions. The Water Pollution Act, 1977, and the Air Pollution Act, 1987, give effect to the Paris Convention.</P>
    <P>An important part of the duty of a state in this respect is to co-operate with and notify other states of any imminent or actual danger and further, in coming to any decision, states must take due consideration of the views of any states which may be adversely affected by reason of their geographical position.</P>
    <P>On the question of marine scientific research, coastal states have the exclusive right to regulate, authorise and conduct marine scientific research in their territorial sea.  Any such marine scientific research can be conducted only with the express consent of and under the conditions set forth by the coastal state.  If a foreign ship engages in any research or survey activities in the territorial sea without such consent, it is in breach of the law in this regard and can be required to stop such activities immediately and to leave the territorial sea.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to stress that Ireland has always been willing to play its part in the international community, and will continue to do so.  In this instance, the Bill at present before the House gives effect to a very important aspect of international law which, at the same time, is of immense benefit to Ireland.  It gives effect to a right which can be claimed by every coastal state &mdash; a right to extend the state's sovereignty throughout a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles.  This step has already been taken by a large number of states on all five continents of the world.  This Bill proposes that Ireland do likewise.</P>
    <P>Let me recall briefly to this House the effects of this legislation.  It extends the breadth of Ireland's territorial seas from three to 12 nautical miles, and accordingly extends the national territory.  It gives Ireland increased sovereignty and increased control over the sea that surrounds her, which is one of our most important natural resources from the <Col N="322" /> economic, tourist, scientific and security points of view.  This House will appreciate that by giving effect to this aspect of international law, the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Bill, 1987, is increasing the options and benefits, and ultimately the sovereign control, of this State.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My party support this Bill but I should like to ask a few questions. Of course, we will accept the Minister's amendment on Committee Stage to change the commencement date of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This is an interesting Bill because it shows how international law is evolving for the benefit of all states.  The Minister referred to cannon shot rule which indicated the extent of the territorial waters because that was as far as states could legitimately claim to be able to defend. That became part of international law and was recognised by various coastal states.  It meant that colleague states had exclusive rights up to three miles, which also applied in this country.  Now, as a result of very difficult and complex negotiations over a quarter of a century to try to bring some order into the use of the most valuable resource in the world &mdash; the sea &mdash; changes will take place.  These changes will apply to the rights of coastal states and to the rights of people who have no waters at all, for example, inland countries, in relation to free passage.  All these matters are now discussed at conferences which, unfortunately, have not been able to reach satisfactory conclusions even though they have been subscribed to by most countries in the world.</P>

    <P>Conferences in regard to the international law of the sea commenced about 15 years ago and, although they reached conclusions, ratification to give effect to these conclusions has not been passed by all the countries who signed it.  However, it is still a very worthy effort in this most important area and perhaps it was only in this century that progress has been made, especially in the seventies and early eighties, to try to bring some order <Col N="323" /> to the use of the sea.  We are now extending our exclusive rights from three miles to 12 miles from our coast.  This confers rights and obligations and one of the obligations is to maintain that area as a pollution free zone.  We are also obliged to ensure that friendly neighbouring states and others have the right of free passage through the 12 mile zone as well as the existing three mile zone.  We should not, for arbitrary reasons, exclude states, because we will want to benefit from similar rights in regard to states in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Last year, the United Kingdom extended their territorial rights from three to 12 miles.  As far as I understand it, the Constitution allows us to claim the island of Ireland and all the waters surrounding it.  There is no such claim for the waters surrounding Northern Ireland. Last year the United Kingdom extended their territorial rights from three to 12 miles.  As I understand it our Constitution gives us claims to the island of Ireland &mdash; and the Minister quoted that from our Constitution &mdash; and all the waters surrounding it.  I understand also that there is no such claim for the waters surrounding Northern Ireland and at least our <i>de jure</i> claim to the waters around the Six Counties stand.  If that is so and if we extend our rights from three to 12 miles &mdash; the United Kingdom have already extended theirs from three to 12 miles off the coast of Scotland &mdash; then there will be an overlapping in a certain passage of water between Scotland and Northern Ireland. If that is so and if I am correct in that assumption, whose rights are exercised within that overlapping zone, which is probably two or three miles?  That is not a facile or trick question to catch the Minister but it is quite an important question for us.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years a number of trawlers sank in unexplained circumstances in the Irish Sea.  One was dragged underneath by a submerged submarine, the probability is that others were also dragged underneath by submarines.  In the Irish Sea and up through that narrow passage between Scotland and Northern <Col N="324" /> Ireland frequently nuclear submarines are submerged and, depending on which side of the ideological divide they are from, are being shadowed by submarines from the other side.  We are led to believe that because of their nature these are very secretive operations and you will not read about them in the newspapers nor will you be told if you ask questions about them, no confirmation or denial will be offered, whether such a submarine passed.</P>
    <P>If nuclear submarines are travelling up the Irish Sea and if they go through the narrow passage and if they are shadowed by Warsaw pact submarines or <i>vice versa</i>, can we insist that these submarines should surface and should fly a flag, which we have the right to do at present in our three mile territorial waters?  We can insist that no submarine can pass.  The laws which at present exist controlling what happens within our three mile limit will now apply to our 12 mile limit.  Can we now say that submarines going through these territorial waters, where there is an overlap between Scotland and Ireland, should now surface as we insist on in our three mile zone?  That is probably a legal point which the Minister may be able to answer; I will understand if he cannot.  I am sure it is very complex legislation and if he can provide a response to that at some other time, outside the context of this Bill, I would be grateful.</P>
    <P>Extending the zone from three to 12 miles in regard to submarines does not cure the problem, but efforts were made during the last few years to find some international forum where rules could be drawn up for the safety of fishermen who were pursuing their trade in waters used by submerged vessels.  The nature of these vessels is such that they can stay submerged for much longer.  They are much bigger and are more silent.  The trawlers are very much bigger with many miles of net thrown out behind them and the possibility of accidents with the submarines dragging &mdash; as happened on at least two occasions in the Irish Sea &mdash; fishing vessels down sternwise will become much more frequent in the <Col N="325" /> future.  We made an effort to find some international forum where rules could be drawn up to prevent that happening.  The results of our efforts were not as successful as we would have wished.</P>
    <P>We can now say to Irish fishermen that we have a further nine miles where they will be safe and where submarines will have to surface if they are travelling within our 12 mile territorial waters and will have to identify themselves if called upon to do so.  That is one direct and positive benefit which the passing of this legislation will give to Irish fishermen. Unfortunately it does not give them any benefits outside the 12 mile zone because submarines will still be able to sail under water and not identify themselves, even if detected in that area, because they will not be under our control.</P>
    <P>The control of these waters will be of great benefit to us.  I hope we can make a better job of controlling the pollution in the 12 mile zone than we are at present doing in the three mile zone.  A horrific report was produced recently concerning pollution on our beaches.  For a country that, on the one hand, prides itself on its clean air and has established a very effective tourist board to sell the benefit of our clear air and water to continentals who are not blessed with this in the same quantities as we have, it is very damaging for us to have this report published last week about the pollution of virtually all the popular beaches on the east coast of Ireland.  That is a great tragedy and it is not as if we can blame any external force. The blame for that lies with ourselves because it is we who have polluted those beaches.  It was not the British, the Germans, the Americans or anybody else but the Irish people who polluted those either by commission or omission; by commission in the pumping of sewage too close to good beaches in towns along the coast and by omission by not foreseeing the contradiction between the selling of this country as a relatively pollution free zone and the fact that we have not introduced the legislation to control the pollution of these beaches.  If we want to expand our tourist industry and we do not want to have Bord Fáilte telling lies <Col N="326" /> about the cleanliness of our beaches, our sea and our air, then we will have to grapple with this problem of pollution very quickly.</P>
    <P>Earlier this morning we were dealing with a Bill permitting the ESB to import and sell coal to coal merchants around the country.  Coal is one of the major air pollutants in this country.  Its effect in the city of Dublin and in the city of Cork is becoming increasingly obvious.  I know it will cost money &mdash; and too well I know the state of the national finances &mdash; but if we do not overcome the problem of air and sea pollution and particularly beach pollution the problem of money will become even more grievous and we will be able to do less and less for people.  In this island and the surrounding waters of 12 miles we must preserve them as the clean part of Europe, clean in air, clean in land and clean around the sea.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said what the provisions of this Bill will not affect, one being the Common Fisheries Policy.  That is right in that the common fisheries policy is now governed by Europe, a policy agreed between the 12 member states of the EC.  We have the responsibility of protecting the fishery interests of all countries in Europe inside the waters assigned to us, just as we have the responsibility for anything that happens inside the 12 mile territorial waters.  That will be our responsibility under the provisions of this Bill.  That is something we should do but if we have not got the weapons to do it then the whole thing is rather pointless.  We constantly read &mdash; and there are rows in this House almost on a weekly basis &mdash; in the Donegal, Galway, Kerry and other newspapers from the south coast, accounts of battles between non-Irish trawlers and Irish trawlers over the rights to fish.</P>
    <P>The reason for that is that we have not got the ability to protect our fishery rights and we have not got sufficient naval resources to patrol and to protect the fishery rights of all member states within those areas but particularly the rights of the Irish fishermen.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate the up-to-date position on an application which I understand is with <Col N="327" /> the European Commission to help finance two other fishery protection vessels to replace the two minesweepers which the Department of Defence are presently disposing of.</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation in regard to section 2 (3) which states:</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 14 (which provides for the adaptation of enactments) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertions in subsection (1) after &ldquo;three miles&rdquo; of &ldquo;, three nautical miles&rdquo; and the said subsection (1), as so amended, is set out in Part III of the Table to this section.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why &ldquo;three miles&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;three nautical miles&rdquo;.  Is there a difference between the two?  The Minister might give me an explanation just to satisfy my curiosity.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a move in the right direction.  It will have the minimal benefit that the submarines that are endangering fishermen in the Irish Sea will, for a further nine miles, have to surface and be made visible to those whose lives they are endangering.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes merely to extend the existing three-mile limit of Ireland's territorial jurisdiction to 12 miles.  The Progressive Democrats are supporting the Bill and the amendment proposed by the Minister which was circulated just before the debate, subject to clarification on some important implications of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am a little disappointed at the limited course of action which the Minister is proposing because it postpones once again consideration of the ambiguous constitutional and legal position of this State vis-à-vis our disputed rights on the North Channel, our disputed ownership of the island of Rockall and, by implication, how far our exploration rights may extend in the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to amend the principal Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 which, together with the base lines provided by statutory instruments made <Col N="328" /> under it, sets a limit on the physical boundary of our domestic law both criminal and civil.  This Act and the Bill which proposes to amend it today must be distinguished from the Continental Shelf Act, 1968 which is often confused with the Maritime Jurisdiction Act.  The Continental Shelf Act gives to the Government the power to authorise the exploitation of mineral and hydrocarbon resources lying on the seabed outside our territorial waters.  It has a bearing indirectly on the Bill we are discussing today.</P>
    <P>Within this context the Government have been rather negligent, given the importance of what I would term our territorial disputes in the seas, in delaying for a full year before bringing this Bill into the House.  The British passed their corresponding legislation, the Territorial Sea Act, 1987, to extend the limit of their territorial seas from three to 12 miles.  It was passed through the House of Commons a full year ago.  A number of important issues raised in the British Act could have far-reaching implications for this country.  I will refer to one or two of them.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the British Territorial Sea Act, 1987 does not merely replace the three-mile limit by a 12-mile-limit but goes further by extending the Act to cover Northern Ireland by virtue of section 4 (3) and thus gives the British Government the authority to claim what is known as the North Channel.  This is the entire sea area between Larne and Stranraer.  It is the territorial waters off the coasts of Antrim, Derry and Down and has implications for the loughs at Carlingford and Foyle.  The Minister might say whether the Government have taken steps in the intervening year to clarify whether the British now consider the North Channel to be either an inland waterway through the setting of a base line permitted by their Act or a territorial sea.  Do the Government have any reservations in regard to this alteration of the established legal position as we would see it?</P>
    <P>On a number of previous occassions in <Col N="329" /> the House some effort was made to draw attention to the legal background which may entitle the State to jurisdiction of those waters.  A good summary of the Irish position was given by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, during an Adjournment debate on 29 February 1972 as reported at column 675, Volume 259 of the Official Report.  He stated:</P>
    <P>. . . we claim that the territorial waters around the whole island of Ireland are ours and our claim to the territorial waters around Northern Ireland is based on the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.  This Act is so referred to in the 1921 Treaty that the Northern Ireland which withdrew from the Irish Free State is identical with the Northern Ireland defined in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, and defined as consisting of named counties and boroughs.  It is, I think, common case between us that in English law the counties do not include adjacent territorial waters and, therefore, according to our claim these territorial waters were retained by the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>This position was again spelled out by the then and current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Lenihan, during a debate in this House on 21 March 1981.</P>
    <P>Ireland claims under the existing Constitution that the national territory covers the island of Ireland and its territorial seas and until such time as the Progressive Democrats are in a position to change these Articles in the Constitution I would expect the Government to assert them. The Minister when replying might tell the House whether any step has been taken in the year since the British extended their limit to 12 miles in the North Channel to assert whatever claim Ireland may have to those waters.</P>
    <P>The second important implication of this Bill before the House &mdash; and the British Act of a year ago &mdash; is its effects on our claim to the ownership of Rockall. The question of the delimitation of the Continental Shelf between Ireland and <Col N="330" /> Britain has been the subject of negotiations since 1964.  Though usually mentioned in connection with the island of Rockall, these negotiations involve much more.  The Government have agreed to an <i>ad hoc</i> arbitration of the entire extent of the Continental Shelf contiguous to the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Dáil on 25 March 1982, as in the Official Report, Volume 333, column 555:</P>
    <P>It is not concerned solely with the delimitation of the Rockall plateau or exclusively with any single feature in isolation, such as Rockall, but involves the whole shelf in the north-west and in the Irish and Celtic sea areas in so far as it is the natural prolongation of the land-mass of two neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when replying to this debate, to give an up-to-date report to the House on the progress being made in this arbitration.  When can an outcome of this dispute be expected?</P>
    <P>Again, I would ask the Minister to address this question.  Have the British, by introducing their Territorial Sea Act a year before us, been attempting to assert their claim to Rockall?  If this is the case, why have we waited a full year to put in a counter-claim by means of legislation?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that this amending Bill is extremely important.  It could have an effect, indirectly, on the way that divisions of mineral rights will be carved up between ourselves and our near neighbour, Britain.  I repeat my question to the Minister: why have we waited one full year to make a counter-claim to the British to assert a twelve-mile limit around the Irish and Celtic seas?</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats are willing to support this Bill, subject to clarification on the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This very short Bill is one of the most significant pieces of legislation concerning maritime affairs to come before this House.  The Bill seeks to extend the limit of Irish territorial waters beyond the present limit of three nautical miles to 12 nautical miles.  It comes hot on the heels of similar legislation which <Col N="331" /> was passed in Britain last year when they pushed the limit of their territorial waters to the 12-mile zone.  While the British extension of territorial waters may pose some access difficulties for Ireland, particularly in that strip of water between Scotland and Northern Ireland, our own extension will help to preserve the security of Irish waters for fishermen and all users of the Irish Sea.  However, it must be said that passing legislation to extend territorial waters around the Irish coast will not of itself be immediately effective.</P>
      <P>At the moment our three-mile zone is being traversed by submarines of British, United States and Soviet origin.  These vessels have been responsible for a huge number of accidents involving fishing trawlers and on every occasion the submarines left the scene of the accident leaving behind them damage to the tune of thousands of pounds.  On several occasions they have been responsible for loss of life.  At no time have the offending countries come forward to claim responsibility or indeed to compensate the families of the victims.  Therefore, to imagine that these same sea pirates will take heed of this Bill would at best be naive.  If they have flagrantly ignored the three mile zone, sailing regularly across the mouth of Dublin bay, we will have to do more than pass a Bill in this House to ensure that our coastal waters and coastline are protected from these nuclear vessels.</P>

      <P>I wonder why the Taoiseach has not answered the question which was asked specifically, that was whether there is in fact any Article, besides Article 4, in which the Government believe they do not have an initiating role and in particular if they believe that they should take an initiative under the Article in the agreement which relates to the parliamentary tier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing is to interpret the agreement and to decide what the agreement says or envisages and the second thing is to decide from time to time whether in any particular area the Government should take an initiative. Regardless of whether the Government take an initiative it would not in my view be confined exclusively to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Initiatives might be taken in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, or initiatives might be taken through the normal diplomatic process. Therefore, what I am saying is that there is a difference between what the agreement says, what the agreement empowers us to do and what the agreement compels us to do and the Government taking initiatives in any particular area.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's total non-answer to the original question and to the supplementary which I asked, would he not agree that at best somebody listening to this exchange would have to assume there was no great enthusiasm on the part of the Government for the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in particular would he answer the question in regard to the Article on the parliamentary tier which I would have thought, and I ask the Taoiseach if he would agree, is important now and in respect of which an initiative should be taken?</P>

      <P>I must say that I regard <Col N="333" /> the statement made by the Deputy about enthusiasm or the lack of it for the Anglo-Irish Agreement as irresponsible and mischievous.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are initiatives which the Government could take under the terms of the agreement which would not otherwise be open to us.

The main thing the agreement does in that context is to create the machinery and a secretariat which can be used for specific purposes and which, despite Deputy Barry's continual sniping in this regard, this Government use to the full.  Before we came into office we gave as our view that if the secretariat process could be used to improve the situation of the Nationalist people of <Col N="335" /> Northern Ireland, or indeed of the people of Northern Ireland generally in any way, it would be wrong not to avail of it for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I am not familiar with the news media reports to which the Deputy refers but I assure the Deputy that like every other section of the community members of the Defence Forces would be eligible for family income supplement. This would be mainly applicable to people with short service or people in the lower ranks with large families.  The number in receipt of FIS is very small, in the region of 30 out of a total of 11,700.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of pilot officers in the Air Corps is 76.  The total number of <Col N="339" /> operationally active pilot officers is 61. Applications for permission to retire from the Permanent Defence Force from 12 of these officers &mdash; four of whom are helicopter pilots &mdash; are under consideration. This represents 20 per cent of operationally active pilot officers.  There have been no applications to resign from the Air Corps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not said whether he is concerned or whether the Air Corps are concerned about this brain drain, or flight from the Air Corps.  It should be a matter of concern to the Minister.  Has the Minister considered whether the pay levels are at a sufficient rate to keep the pilots in the Air Corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The remuneration of all members of the Permanent Defence Force, including pilots, has been kept in line with wage and salary movements in the public service generally.  The Minister is satisfied with the level of morale in the Permanent Defence Force.  As the Deputy is probably aware, permission is required from the Minister for an officer to retire.  The applications I have already mentioned are at present under consideration by the Minister.  The Minister is satisfied with morale in the Permanent Defence Force and is satisfied that salary and remuneration in the Permanent Defence Force, including pilots, is kept in line with movements in wages and salaries in the public service generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that forcing pilots to remain in the Air Corps against their will will not make for happy relations in the Air Corps and that it must be damaging to morale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Since January 1983 to date, 13 pilot officers have been granted permission to retire.  One pilot officer retired on age grounds and there have been no resignations.  In reaching decisions on these applications the Minister takes into account the position of the service. Deputies will be aware that most of the <Col N="340" /> officers hold important appointments in relation to ministerial air transport service, rescue service and maritime patrol service.  All these things have to be taken into account before any decision can be taken on an individual application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Defence Act, 1984, sets out very clearly that an officer must have the permission of the Minister to retire and the Minister takes all these things into consideration before making a decision.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the reply.  I accept that the traditional parade would probably be too great a burden on the Army at this time but could the Minister indicate his attitude to commemorating the 1916 Rising in some special way during the Millennium Year?</P>

      <P>The organisation of an event like this causes some considerable dislocation in the Army.  It should be noted that approximately 2,500 troops are required to mount a worthwhile parade, not to mention transport, equipment and so on.  I appreciate the Deputy's point of view and I will bring it to the attention of the Minister and see if anything can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the 2,500 troops and so on, could some ceremony on a much smaller scale be considered that would not involve serious dislocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to examine that but, as I pointed out, it would call for very heavy commitments <Col N="345" /> and demands on the forces.  The Minister's view at this time is that concentrated efforts should be on the commemoration that the Oireachtas all-party committee recommended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason women are excluded from the Army Apprentice School; if his attention has been drawn to the criticism of this practice recently expressed by the Chief Executive of the Employment Equality Agency; if it is intended to open the Army Apprentice School to women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Apprentices in the Permanent Defence Force are required to live in barracks and due to lack of suitable accommodation it has not been found possible to date to provide for an intake of female apprentices.  The question of the provision of such accommodation continues to be considered in the context of competing demands on scarce resources.  A recent letter from the Employment Equality Agency in relation to this matter is currently under consideration by the Department and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <P>That reply is extraordinary. Is the Minister aware that I have previously asked questions here about the recruitment of women in the Army and the fact that it has ceased completely in the past few years?  In those cases the reply was that women could be recruited only to non-combat positions and reference was made to lack of accommodation. Would the Minister now agree that the apprentice school is totally a non-combat area quite suitable for the recruitment of women and that there appears to be discrimination against women in the refusal to allow women into the apprentice school?  I am sure the Minister is aware that the facilities which would be available to women for training in engineering and various other skills are <Col N="346" /> being denied to them at present by this discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This question applies to apprentices in the Permanent Defence Force.  The Minister would like to point out that it has not been found possible to date to provide suitable accommodation for female apprentices in the Army Apprentice School in Naas or in the Air Corps Apprentice School in Baldonnell. At this time the question of provision of accommodation continues to be considered in the context of competing demands on scarce resources.  In relation to female apprentices, it has not been possible to date to provide suitable accommodation for them in the apprentice schools.</P>

Why not all females and make accommodation available elsewhere for males?  That is not a suitable answer.  Accommodation is available.

      <P>In view of the representations made by the Chief Executive of the Employment Equality Agency, will the Minister call on the Minister for Defence to look at the whole equality provisions in the Defence Forces in so far as no female cadets have been recruited and females who went through the identical training course as officers are not being considered for posting in Lebanon, <Col N="347" /> for example?  Now the apprentice school is, so to speak, another breach of equality in the Defence Forces.  Will the Minister undertake to ask his colleague to look at the general question of equality in the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but the question refers to apprentices in the Army Apprentice School.  As the Deputy is aware, the Employment Equality Act does not apply to employment in the Defence Forces. Nevertheless, the policy of successive Governments has been to provide access by women to membership of the Permanent Defence Force to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the financial constraints and to the roles in which women can be employed in the Defence Forces.  In this regard, since 1980 24 female cadets, 40 females, other rank, seven female medical officers and one female dentist have joined the Permanent Defence Force.  The Minister has already got the communication from the Employment Equality Agency, and I <Col N="348" /> will draw the attention of the Deputies interested in this to the Minister's attention and he will deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>The strength of the Permanent Defence Force is reviewed from time to time in the light of current strengths and commitments.  Because of the non-combatant role of female personnel, enlistment has had to be confined to male personnel in recent times.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the next intake of recruits for general service will take place.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if the new Dauphin Air Corps helicopters are equipped with de-icing equipment to enable them to fly at sub-zero temperatures; if not, the provision which is being made for helicopter facilities for rescue operations at sub-zero temperatures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Dauphin helicopters are fitted with engine anti-icing equipment meeting the requirements of transport category helicopters, heated windscreens and ice detectors; they are not equipped with airframe de-icing equipment.  Ice on helicopters, in common with other aircraft, occurs only when there is a combination of visible moisture, such as cloud, and a particularly low temperature range.  Sub-zero temperatures do not, of themselves, produce conditions which inhibit the flying of the Dauphin helicopters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

      <P>The Minister has just listed another in the litany of disasters of these Dauphin helicopters. These helicopters were purchased almost two years ago, on 25 June 1986.  Is the Minister now saying that we do not have clouds and low temperatures which are precisely the conditions which he has outlined would cause icing on helicopters? Low temperatures alone would not cause it, but low temperatures with cloud formation will, something which we have no lack of.  In fact, they are almost a permanent feature on our horizon.</P>
      <P>The Minister previously agreed that these machines cannot fly in the dark. Now is the Minister saying they cannot fly in the cold and that no matter what training pilots get they will not be able to fly in the winter time?  Is that not the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said already, the Dauphin helicopters are fitted with engine anti-icing equipment, meeting the requirements in this regard.  The air <Col N="352" /> frame de-icing system is a system which is designed for larger helicopters.  I want to get this clear because there may be some misapprehensions about it.  The air frame de-icing systems which the Deputy refers to are designed for larger helicopters. They are not available for helicopters weighing less than 5,700 kilogrammes.  The Dauphin helicopter weighs less than that and the system is not suitable for it.  The unavailability of the system that the Deputy has in mind will not inhibit the helicopter's performance. In fact, it has not failed to effect a rescue because of icing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Minister for Defence, at the time of purchase, aware of the fact that this particular size of helicopter was not equipped with de-icing equipment?  Was the Minister also aware that icing could occur in cloudy and sub-zero conditions combined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information. I presume they were aware.  This technology is developing all the time.  Let me point out that the Sea King search and rescue helicopters operated by the British Air Force and which have done many rescue operations here do not have this de-icing equipment fitted and the equipment, as I have said already, is not available for the smaller helicopters.  In fact this equipment would reduce the range in the lifting capacity of these helicopters and could inhibit them in other ways.  On balance, it was a reasonable decision to purchase these and I do not think this will in any way inhibit the airsea rescue service.</P>

At this stage it is not proposed to add to what was stated on that occasion beyond saying that an interim report is not visualised and that, because of the security implications, publication of the report as such is not envisaged.</P>
      <P>Submissions were not specifically invited but a small number of submissions has, in fact, been received.  The review has received a fair share of publicity and it has been clearly indicated that outside groups or individuals are free to make submissions which would be taken into account in the review process.  Each will be treated as confidential and will not be published by the Department.</P>

      <P>As the review body is being set up, I would ask what are its terms of reference and do they include operation of procurement policy, personnel policy and administration policy? As the morale in the Defence Forces is very low at this time, would the Minister agree that it would be important to expedite the findings of this review, and can he say if there will be a White Paper on the matter?</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply to a question of mine a few months ago, I understood that the Minister for Defence said that the review committee's report was likely to be completed by the end of 1988.  If one is to judge by the Minister's reply here this afternoon, it appears to be an on going thing.  Is there any degree of finality about it?  While I certainly would not agree that it should not be published, at least the Minister could let us know when it is decided to complete the review as such. That is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 23 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service has five off-shore patrol vessels at its disposal including <i>L.E. Eithne</i> which is a helicopter-carrying ship.  Two maritime Dauphin helicopters are available for use in conjunction with <i>L.E. Eithne</i> and two Beech King aircraft are devoted exclusively to fisheries surveillance duties.  The full integration of the maritime Dauphin helicopter with <i>L.E. Eithne</i> will greatly enhance the fisheries surveillance capability.</P>
      <P>The off-shore patrol vessels have a limited capacity for inshore patrolling.  This is utilised to the fullest extent practicable and will be enhanced when the Dauphins have been worked up to a full operational capacity later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capability of the Naval Service and the Air Corps to carry out fisheries surveillance operations is kept under constant review.  The question of increasing that capability is under active consideration at present in which connection <Col N="356" /> an application to the European Commission for financial support will be presented to the Commission in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply &mdash; and this ties in with his own Ministry of the Marine &mdash; is he satisfied with the number of patrol boats for fishery protection which we have at present, particularly when we take into account the international boats that might be plundering our fishing areas?  I want to put on record that my understanding is that we have only three such boats because the others are being serviced while those three are out on patrol, and that they patrol an area only once every 21 days.  Is that an accurate account of our capabilities of patrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We would endeavour to have the maximum possible surveillance in operation to secure our fishing interests.  Some of the questions refer to the inshore area.  Some of these boats, the ones that are out of commission now, are not suitable for that kind of inshore patrol work.  I am aware from my own Department's involvement in this area that there was a necessity for some inshore patrol vessels, and some of these have been provided recently, separately from the Naval Service, by the regional fisheries boards, one in the south-west and another in the north-west.  We would endeavour to secure the maximum financial support possible from the European Communities to enhance our fishery protection service.  As I have said already, that matter is under active consideration at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the Bill before the House at present which refers to the extension of the territorial jurisdiction from three nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, is the Minister satisfied that, when this Bill is enacted, we will be able to enforce it with the naval resources available to us at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation is not an issue on this question, but we are satisfied <Col N="357" /> that it is possible to provide an adequate level of surveillance and protection service within the resources available to us at present.  Naturally we would like to enhance and improve the service where it is possible to do so.  The Air Corps have at their disposal two Beech King aircraft for fishery surveillance, two maritime Dauphin helicopters for use with the <i>Eithne</i> and the other patrol vessels which were already mentioned.  As I have said, this matter is under active discussion at present in my Department, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs, who are putting together a formulated scheme for submission for Community funding for further surveillance equipment.  The immediate requirement in this context would be the replacement of the minesweepers. Taking the overall situation into context and the fact that we have acquired some new patrol vessels, especially for inshore protection which is of some concern also, I am reasonably satisfied that the situation is under control.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the policy he is pursuing is that of running down the naval arm of the Defence Forces?  Arising from my question about the two minesweepers, <i>Fola</i> and <i>Gráinne</i> which are the only two minesweepers that could provide proper inshore patrol and minehunting facilities, is it his intention to replace the <i>Fola</i> and <i>Gráinne</i>?  What is the Minister's intention for the Verolme Cork Dockyard?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to inshore protection which some Deputies are concerned about and to which the Deputy's question refers, I would suggest to the Deputy that inshore protection was not served to the best possible extent by the type of vessels he spoke about.  In fact, one of the inhibiting factors of protecting the inshore areas was that these vessels were not suitable for that type of work. I am aware of this not from the Minister for Defence's point of view but from the fisheries point of view for which I have responsibility.  To a large extent that type of surveillance equipment would have to be provided by bodies such as the regional fisheries boards who have responsibility in inshore areas.  Smaller vessels such as the ones the Deputy has in mind are necessary in these areas.  As I have already pointed out, the Naval Service have the <i>Eithne</i> which can carry two helicopters for this type of service, the <i>Deirdre</i>, the <i>Emer</i>, the <i>Aoife</i> and the <i>Aisling.</i> I am reasonably satisfied that within the resources and the equipment available to us we can adequately protect our fisheries service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the naval surveillance vessels, is it true that several fishermen do not see one of those patrol vessels for three weeks?  Can the Minister honestly tell the House that, as <Col N="359" /> far as the illegal importation of guns and drugs is concerned and foreign fishery boats fishing off our shores, we can even remotely be in a position to have a good surveillance service?  How sincere are we in our efforts to get EC funding to change the matter because not alone is this a problem for us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>As the record shows, we have already received substantial funding from Community funds for this type of surveillance equipment and that is what made it possible to purchase the <i>Eithne</i> and other vessels.  I am satisfied that, within the resources and the equipment available to us, there is an adequate level of service to protect our fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">

      <P>I do not have information about submarines.  If the Deputy puts down a separate question about the effect of submarines in this area I am sure the Minister will reply directly to him in that regard.  From my experience I wish to put on the record the excellent contribution that the Naval Service have made to the protection of our fisheries.  The evidence is there for anyone who cares to examine it that the Naval Service have been very successful in surveillance and in the control of our fisheries limits.  Anybody who has been following what has been happening will know that the naval service in particular have been successful in a <Col N="360" /> number of apprehensions and convictions in recent years for breaches of fisheries regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say arising from the Minister's reply is so much for regionalisation, something which the Government and the Minister are very much to the fore with.  I cannot understand how it is not possible, particularly after a number of accidents and incidents on the western seaboard &mdash; and I am not talking about Galway but about the whole north western seaboard &mdash; that there cannot be a manageable working arrangement whereby a helicopter could be placed at the new airport in Galway city.  Surely it would make good sense for a variety of reasons to regionalise the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital cost of establishing a base in a green field in the west would be in the region of £3 million.  It has been pointed out already that this would necessitate further back-up services which would be necessary to have an effective and reliable service there.  It is not possible to provide that kind of capital investment for that development at this time.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about providing a new airport as such. There is a new up-to-date airport at Carnmore outside Galway city.  Admittedly it is a commercial airport but surely an arrangement could be entered into by the military authorities and the commercial interests involved to allow it to be be based there.  They have all the facilities that one has to have for aircraft. The problems in the western part of the country were clearly signposted recently due to the lack of that type of helicopter being on the spot.  The idea that £3 million would be required to establish a base in a green field is not sensible in any shape or form.</P>

      <P>In order to guarantee availability all year round, a single aircraft would not suffice in any area.  Three helicopters would have to be assigned to the task to allow for one on routine maintenance and one of the other two helicopters developing a fault or anything like that.  It is not a question of basing one helicopter there.  One would have to put in a back-up of two other helicopters and it would also mean moving some of the existing Air Corps squadrons, together with supporting technical and administrative personnel, to that location.  In addition, hangars and stores would have to be provided in order to guarantee serviceability. The sources for this type of service are not available at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment I was making the point that the three mile zone had been flagrantly ignored and violated in the past with instances of nuclear submarines passing across the mouth of Dublin Bay.  I also made the point that we would have to do more than pass a Bill in this House to ensure that our coastal waters and our coastline are protected from these nuclear vessels.</P>
      <P>To go some way towards making the legislation more effective, the Government must declare our territorial waters a nuclear free zone.  The Ministers for Defence, Foreign Affairs and the Marine must combine resources and political clout to take this message to the nations responsible for the nuclear piracy of the Irish Sea and insist that our national territory and domestic legislation be taken seriously.  A nuclear free zone means that no vessel carrying nuclear weapons or dangerous chemical substances should travel within the 12-mile territorial limit. In addition, nuclear propelled submarines should identify themselves and travel above water while travelling within the exclusion zone.  This nuclear free zone must be declared on the enactment of this legislation.  If this is not done the legislation will not be effective.  It will be by-passed by the NATO and Soviet authorities in much the same way as they have by-passed the 1959 Act which declared a three-mile exclusion zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are not attempting to prohibit innocent passage of seagoing vessels but we regard the declaration of a nuclear free zone as a vital component of the legislation.  In addition we, like <Col N="406" /> other environmental groups, view the use of our waters by these military vessels with growing concern.  We would like to see the Government take the initiative in making this declaration, not alone for our own safety but also to give leadership to other European countries who are concerned about the nuclear threat.  New Zealand has already declared its territorial waters a nuclear free zone and Iceland has insisted on a 200-mile exclusion zone because it, too, was alarmed at the abuse to its coastal waters.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not alone in its concern about nuclear submarines but it would be a first within the European Community if we took a final stand to protect the lives of our fishermen and people against the nuclear threat which stalks our coastline daily.  Following the enactment of this legislation, together with our declaration of a nuclear free zone, the Government should move on to initiate legislation within the EC and through the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>To identify the magnitude of the problem to this House, I should like to give some brief details about the risks which pertain in particular to Ireland.  Since 1981 at least 36 fishermen have died in submarine related accidents.  No country claimed responsibility.  At present, there are 17 nuclear submarines based permanently on the Clyde estuary &mdash; ten American and seven British.  Supporting them are two Dutch and three British conventional diesel-driven submarines whose responsibility it is to patrol the Irish Sea and Clyde approaches in order to detect intruding Soviet submarines. The Soviet submarines tend to shadow the NATO submarines but there is no known figure to tell us how many might be passing through Irish waters.</P>
    <P>Clyde-based missile submarines spend about two months at sea.  It is estimated by environmental and marine scientists that between rotation of shifts the submarines make more than 100 two-way journeys through the Irish Sea every year.  It is about a ten hour trip between Scotland and the Tuskar Rock and from there they go deep into the ocean.  The <Col N="407" /> majority of the submarines carry American Poseidon missiles.  Four British submarines carry 16 missiles with six independent Chevaline warheads.  Each of these 96 nuclear bombs has an explosive force of 40 kiltons, which is about four times the size of the bombs which devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  It is a long way from the cannon shot rule referred to in the Minister's speech.  It is perhaps nothing less than a miracle that there has not been a major nuclear catastrophe off our coastline over the last 20 years, although there have been at least 17 known accidents, involving submarines, and the details have been documented by marine scientists.</P>
    <P>What is most startling about these nuclear vessels is that we have no knowledge of where they are at any given time. We can only guess at their cargo and we have no possible protection should any of them have a major nuclear accident. Unlike land-based nuclear reactors, submarines do not have any containment area, so a nuclear accident would have far reaching coastal and land repercussions. Once again, we can only guess at the possible outcome, but a useful yardstick is the Chernobyl reactor which had a containment area which held back about 95 per cent of the nuclear contamination. The remaining 5 per cent escaped to do untold damage to crops and cattle across Europe.  This example gives some small indication of what might happen if the nuclear carrying submarines should run into serious problems beneath our coastline. There would be no containment and these islands would become a wasteland for decades, maybe centuries.</P>
    <P>It is not alarmist to point to the reality of the facts.  These submarines pose a growing threat to Ireland.  We need to bring it home to the military powers responsible that Ireland will not tolerate their negligent use of our waters.  The Irish Sea is narrow and shallow &mdash; a most unsuitable area for such heavy military arsenal.  There is nothing quite like this nuclear traffic, with its close proximity to land, in any other waterway in the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Two weeks ago we discussed Committee Stage of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill when Deputies highlighted the dangers posed to our environment from oil spillages from tankers.  That Bill attempts to come some way towards ensuring compensation for Ireland.  In relation to the Bill before us today, it must be pointed out that there is no insurance whatsoever on these submarines, even though the risk of accident is greater and the possible consequences more damaging.  However, the point could also be made that the potential damage is perhaps uninsurable.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bill gives no commitment to increase the naval or air operations around our waters to monitor the seas for incursions by foreign vessels. Indeed, if I could refer the House to the Estimates for Defence for the last two years, there has been a substantial cutback in allocations for ships and naval stores, also for marine pollution control measures.  It is not possible to implement legislation of this nature without providing the backup naval or air personnel, equipped with the technological radar to detect underwater vessels.  I understand that there is quite an inexpensive piece of sounding equipment which can be attached to light aircraft to detect submarines and eventually force them to surface. Perhaps the Minister might refer to this technology, which is in use in Britain at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would urge the Minister that this legislation be accompanied by a declaration of nuclear-free status for the Irish territorial waters.  Only such a declaration, followed by international legislation will guarantee that our waters will not be used by nuclear carrying vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all those Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  As has been said on several occasions, although it is a small Bill it is a very important one because it extends our national sovereignty further into areas which will certainly be of importance in the future.  All the indications are that the seas will be the source of <Col N="409" /> development in the future, looking ahead over a long period, so it is important from the point of view of coastal states that they have the maximum degree of territorial sovereignty, fishing rights and seabed rights in regard to exploration and exploitation and development generally and economic rights over as wide an area as possible.</P>
      <P>Here, nature has put us in a reasonably good position as we are on the periphery of Europe and we happen to be a coastal State which is in a position to maximise benefits under the various headings to the greatest possible extent, particularly off our north-western, western, south-western and southern coasts.</P>
      <P>The main legal problems remaining are, first, to do with the Irish Sea.  This problem will have to be resolved fully with our neighbour on a bilateral basis. Deputy Barry, in particular, raised the question of Northern Ireland waters and that stretch of water as between Antrim and Scotland where there is an overlap. In general, in the Irish Sea as between Britain and Ireland the matter has not been resolved by the courts or otherwise. As we know, Ireland is in a <i>de jure</i> position with regard to these seas off the Northern Ireland coast and Britain is in a <i>de facto</i> position.  How that can be tested fully, or whether it would be better that some arrangement be entered into, if possible, remains for the future.  As of now, the position is undetermined, as it were.  We have our claim, which is written into our Constitution.  The British have their claim to 12 miles from their coast, also.  That position applies to all the waters in the Irish Sea.  With a greater immediacy it applies to the area to which Deputy Barry has referred.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the passage of potentially dangerous ships at sea, such as nuclear submarines, enters into the equation in a very practical way.  We each have our position under our respective legislation, the United Kingdom and ourselves. Our position is enshrined in the Constitution and the matter remains unresolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the other matter concerning <Col N="410" /> Carlingford Lough, which is still unresolved in the legal sense.  We claim full jurisdiction over all the waters in that lough and have always acted accordingly. I suggest that these are matters for resolution between ourselves and the British. To that extent it is less complex than the legal position concerning Rockall and the north-western part of the seas outside the territorial waters.  In this respect I particularly refer to Rockall and at present the waters in that area are the subject of ongoing discussions between the British and ourselves.</P>
    <P>We are trying to work out a number of preliminary issues prior to the commencement of any arbitration on an appropriate delimitation as far as Britain and Ireland are concerned in the north-west Atlantic and Rockall areas.  We wish to protect our rights to a 200 miles economic zone also.  The British claim refers to some islands off the Hebrides. However, the matter is further complicated by the fact that Iceland and Denmark sought to establish claims based on the Faroe Islands.  There are two indeterminate and unresolved legal areas between the British and ourselves, that is regarding the Irish Sea, especially the waters off the north-eastern coast and a claim also in regard to the north-western part coming towards Rockall between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are no difficulties regarding the continental shelf opposite our south and south-west coasts.  Our rights under the various jurisdictions are safeguarded. The only difficulty that might arise in the future is probably in the area coming towards Rockall off the north-west coast but that matter is under discussion with the British at the moment.</P>
    <P>Some matters are not very clear but at least under this legislation we have clarified our position in regard to our territorial seas and soveriegnty.  There the matter stands and it is essential, in the national interest, to put forward in the Bill our position under the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very complex legislation.  There have been numerous conferences and people have spent months seeking to resolve the problems. At least, in this legislation there is one example of all nations coming together to agree on a single concept of the 12 miles territorial seas sovereignty for every country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry also raised the question of the extension of the patrolling capacity of the Irish Navy in terms of fishery protection. An application has been made to the Community in that respect.  As Deputy Barry and the House are aware, on a previous occasion we got substantial allocations from EC funds for the initiative of our fisheries protection fleet when we decided to put our Navy virtually wholetime on fisheries protection, on which they have been now for some years.  The grants from the EC were as high as 70 per cent of the cost in the late seventies to the mid-eighties.  There is a precedent for it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the application lodged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the date but I will send it to the Deputy.  The grants from the EC covered the existing fleet.  The money has all been spent and we are now talking about replacements for two of the boats.  We would, naturally, like to get the necessary funds as boats of this kind are very expensive; the cost ranges from £30 million to £50 million per boat.  That is what is involved if we want an efficient patrol boat which can cover 200 miles from the coast and equipped with the latest technology.  The last boat for which we got a grant has a helicopter pad which means that the helicopter can operate in conjunction with the boat which adds to its effectiveness. That is the only sensible way to think in terms of fisheries protection. Two of the boats needing replacement <Col N="412" /> are minesweepers which were not originally intended for this purpose but which did the job very well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy raised the question of the north-east coast, to which I already referred, and she also asked about Rockall.  Rockall is really outside the terms of this legislation.  The British, under the law relating to the sea, cannot base any economic zone or continental shelf on what they claim in regard to Rockall. Such claims to ownership of the rock by the British Government are not acknowledged or agreed to by us but they cannot, in any event, on the basis of that, get any extension into the economic zone of 200 miles or for exploration or exploitation purposes.  That is already decided by the Law of the Sea Conference.  The question of her territorial claim is another day's work.  We maintain, and have maintained, the position under the discussions so far that Rockall should not form such a basis as it is not an island within the meaning of international law on which rights, zones or jurisdiction or sovereignty of any kind can be founded. There is the pragmatic question of interpretation, when does a rock become an island sufficient to justify rights being based upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the normally accepted criteria which Deputy Barry has referred to.  It is a matter for further negotiation and possibly ultimate arbitration. Our case, as of now is that one cannot base any rights on such a rock. That is where we stand in the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy inquired about the state of arbitration with regard to Rockall. Regular discussions continue to take place on a number of preliminary issues which can best be resolved prior to arbitration. It is complicated by two additional countries which showed an interest in the area along with Britain and Ireland.  We are still a long way from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison and also Deputy <Col N="413" /> Barry raised the nuclear issue and submarines and the dangers flowing from nuclear submarines.  At least, the extension to 12 miles means that vessels must be on surface within the 12 miles.  Control existed for the three miles and now it exists for 12 miles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you satisfied that it was honoured in regard to the three miles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the three miles there was ample passage outside the three mile zone which constituted the normal passageway.  In fact it is outside the 12 miles if you take a median line up the Irish Sea apart from the area referred to by Deputy Barry off the north-east coast where there is overlapping.  There is no real channel within the three miles at all and apart from straying, any of the accidents that happened <i>vis-à-vis</i> fishing nets, fishing materials or fishing boats happened outside the three miles.  The 12 miles limit imposes a more difficult onus as far as submarines are concerned, particularly off our north-east coast and that is a matter we will have to pursue. The strict meaning of that legislation, once it becomes law, is that such vessels must surface within 12 miles from our coast and be displayed as such on the surface of the sea.</P>
      <P>The concern shown by Deputy Pattison is valid.  I do not want to elaborate on what would happen if a nuclear submarine went wrong in any adjacent area. The practical aspects of pollution and the nuclear submarines are two important practical aspects to which we will have to address ourselves particularly in the Irish Sea corridor.  The position is shown quite clearly in the Bill and it is a matter for us to devise the appropriate regulations and the appropriate patrolling capacity to ensure that the legislation is given effect by way of proper regulation, direction, control and supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other important points were made here during the debate to which I have already referred, including pollution of the sea.  I would like to assure Deputies that dumping at sea is a matter <Col N="414" /> that raises very important issues for any coastal state especially as far as we are concerned on the south-eastern, eastern and north-eastern coasts.  Our regulations in that respect are very important and if they require to be stiffened they will be.</P>
    <P>We have an advantage here with the 12 nautical miles that we have a broader area where we can exclusively prevent anybody from engaging in any form of dumping of any materials whatever. There must be an express prior approval of the coastal state to any such dumping. In other words, it cannot be done by anybody if we do not approve.  To that extent there is a considerable enhancement under the law of our sovereignty and of our rights to control pollution or in particular the dumping of waste and nuclear waste in the area of our territorial seas.</P>
    <P>Deputies can rest assured that I am certain that no Irish Government would permit anything in that area which would be detrimental in any way to the interests of this country.  As far as this Government are concerned &mdash; and I think I can speak for all Governments of the future &mdash; we would not permit the dumping of any hazardous or deleterious material whatever from whatever source within our territorial seas.</P>
    <P>The only other matter that arises is the question of innocent passage.  That is a matter which, on the other side of the coin, has to be allowed because of trade and commerce and so on.  It is welcome to have such innocent passage and that will always be an essential part of any law of the sea between civilised nations.</P>
    <P>As indicated by all sides of the House there is no objection to the commencement date being 1 September which requires an amendment to the legislation.  Optimistically I had put in 1 March as the operative date.  I would like it to be 1 September because that is about right in terms of giving due notice to other countries; it will enable us to put our house in order regarding patrolling or control regulations which may be necessary, and at the same time it is sufficiently soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> In reply to Deputy Geraldine Kennedy we have acted swiftly in this matter, and throughout the whole progress of the Law of the Sea negotiations have taken a very active part and have had very fruitful results.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to successive Governments in this respect because this has been a long-standing, almost torturous series of negotiations.  It was a very difficult and complex task to bring landlocked countries and coastal countries with such diverse interests together. Some landlocked countries are more concerned with using the sea as a highway and coastal countries are more concerned about the exploration and exploitation of the sea.  To bring them together within an overall umbrella was a very difficult task.</P>
    <P>This Bill implements part of a series of recommendations.  I hope to be in a position &mdash; or if I am not here, somebody else &mdash; to bring in legislation dealing with the delineation of an economic zone ranging out for 200 miles.  The territorial seas legislation is now in place, as is our fisheries legislation.  We also have legislation relating to the continental shelf.  All that will be required following today's Bill is legislation delineating the economic zone of 200 miles.</P>
    <P>Apart from the various Ministers for Foreign Affairs who were involved directly in the preparation of Ireland's case and its successful conclusion, I should like to thank the officials who participated in these very difficult and complex matters, which are very difficult to explain.  Although I may not have fully elucidated or clarified, I may say that the brains of important international lawyers have been kept fully occupied over a long period in dealing with these matters.  That their deliberations are reaching some finality is to be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express serious concern about the development of a monopoly in construction products, road materials and tar industries.  There is evidence that Cement Roadstone Holdings are engaged in tactics designed to squeeze out small competitors throughout Ireland.  The tactics employed with a view to creating a monopoly in these industries would appear to include below-cost selling and overpricing. A subsidiary of Cement Roadstone Holdings, John A.  Woods Limited, is understood to have offered road-making materials to Kerry County Council in mid and south Kerry for £1.25 per <Col N="418" /> cubic yard, including VAT, whereas the normal price is £3 per cubic yard inclusive of VAT.  Another subsidiary of Cement Roadstone Holdings, Irish Cement Limited, sells cement to smaller competitors of the group at £52 per metric tonne ex their Limerick and Drogheda works, but exports cement for between £38 and £39 per metric tonne from the same outlets. There is considerable evidence to suggest that John A. Woods Limited succeeded in 1983 in taking over one of their major competitors in Kerry, Ardfert Quarries, by adopting similar tactics.</P>
      <P>It is now in the public interest that an immediate inquiry be held into the tactics in respect of which Cement Roadstone Holdings and their subsidiaries stand accused.  There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that there is a blatant attempt to create a monopoly in the industries to which I have referred, which would ultimately give Cement Roadstone Holdings the power to do what they wish with prices and orders.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry, for example, the only distributor of ground limestone is Ardfert Quarries in which Cement Roadstone Holdings now have a substantial interest and the price per tonne is £12.50.  This is a higher price than is charged in other areas where there is competition.  There have been suggestions that Cement Roadstone Holdings are using much of their estimated profit of £46 million last year to purchase smaller companies outside the country.  Smaller competitors are now being forced to purchase cement abroad and this has obvious implications for the economy.  It is important that this stranglehold be broken.  It is quite clear that Cement Roadstone Holdings have a vested interest in keeping up the price of cement for competitors.  In view of the implications for the entire construction industry, I call on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to take urgent steps to prevent the creation of an undesirable monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer in general terms to the state of the construction industry.  Falling interest rates are an obvious benefit to the construction industry. There are other tangible ways in <Col N="419" /> which the construction industry can be assisted without putting a drain on the public finances which are so limited at present.  In the short term with a view to assisting the construction industry I propose that the Government should give consideration to extending section 23 reliefs to the public sector as this would kill two birds with the one stone.  First of all, it would allow the continuation of the local authority housing programme by private builders who could then lease back the houses they would construct to the local authorities.  This would have the effect of creating employment in the construction industry while, at the same time, providing local authority housing throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would now like to move on to deal with fisheries.  It is quite clear and has been for a number of years that the obvious solution to the problems facing the fishing industry is for the country to get involved in high quality consumer packs. At present the concentration is on primary processing.  There are difficulties, of course, in getting involved in high quality consumer packs and they include the fact that our onshore facilities are very poor. For example, Valentia Harbour which is possibly the best deepwater harbour in the country is in a deplorable state and, as a result, very often fishermen are unable to land large catches there.  Dingle Harbour which is another important harbour on the west coast is silted up and I was very gald to hear that there is now a proposal to develop this harbour.  One of the very best shellfish and mussel industries is based in Cromane outside Killorglin, County Kerry, and one of the difficulties there is that there is no pier. Therefore, we have a major problem with infrastructure and this certainly needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in regard to location due to the fact that we are so far from the markets.  Of course, there are also factors such as time and the cost of transportation but while these are major factors undoubtedly the biggest item militating against the secondary processing of fish is marketing.  It is true that fish <Col N="420" /> and consumer products from this country have never been properly marketed on the international stage.  It is quite clear the industry should be encouraged to produce better quality products but even if the industry was to do this the problem of marketing would remain.</P>
    <P>Small processing industries set up throughout the country do not have the necessary finance to market on a professional basis.  Accordingly, it is clear that we need to get professional marketing people and, in effect, allow the industry to be market led.  I believe the majority of customers for Irish processed fish are, in fact, the same customers in the agricultural industry to whom we export. Accordingly, the argument for utilising An Bord Bainne for marketing our fish and fish products must be very strong.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to learn that a task force on tourism set up by the Government have presented their case and that tourism is now being treated with the seriousness it undoubtedly deserves.  In this regard the work of the task force has to be highly commended.  It is clear that one of the greatest ways of attracting tourists is to have in one's country a major international occasion and I believe with the building of the new indoor sports centre in Dublin efforts should be made as a matter of urgency to seek an international sports event for the centre.</P>
    <P>The allocation this year to Cork/Kerry Tourism amounts to only 37 per cent of its total budget.  Cork-Kerry Tourism have in the past raised by way of local funding 51 per cent of its total budget. The Cork-Kerry region has the highest number of registered bedrooms in the country and it is unfair of Bord Fáilte to allocate to Cork-Kerry Tourism only 37 per cent of its budget as this, in effect, penalises them for their excellent performance in raising funds at a local level over the past number of years.  I believe they should reconsider this because of the importance of the region.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the horticultural industry and to commend the Minister for setting up An Bord Glas and for the tremendous strides he has made.  However, it has become clear that <Col N="421" /> there is a need to introduce legislation to prevent below-cost selling in the vegetable, fruit and potato markets.  It has become quite clear since the passing of recent legislation relating to other goods preventing below-cost selling that cheap foreign vegetables, fruit and potatoes are being dumped on the Irish market and being sold in Irish supermarkets as an attraction, very often at below cost.  I believe it is necessary to introduce restrictive practices legislation in this area in order to protect home grown vegetables, fruit and potatoes.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to the question of excise duty on alcoholic drink.  As we all know, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland proposed that VAT be levied at the point of purchase.  They explained this would have the advantage of avoiding a build-up of arrears in VAT, would allow the Revenue Commissioners to catch up with those who will not pay and would streamline the collection process. While this idea was very good I understand it had to be rejected under EC regulations.  I propose that the Government reduce the rate of VAT on alcoholic drink from 25 per cent to 10 per cent and compensate for the loss of revenue by increasing excise duty <i>pro rata.</i> This would have a number of considerable benefits not just for those in the licensed trade but also for the Government and the Exchequer.  In such a situation the arrears would be less and those who are at present not paying VAT would have to pay the 15 per cent excise duty. A rebate could be given to those who are below the VAT threshold and it would also mean that off-sales and on-sales could compete on a more equal footing, thereby hitting below-cost selling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the budget.  It might be considered that it is a bit late in the day to speak on the budget but I do not accept that.  It is important to have continuing discussion on a budget which sets targets for perhaps five or ten years. In this House there should be regular updating announcements as to how targets are being met.  In good management, <Col N="422" /> middle and senior management come together regularly to discuss the projections set at the beginning of the year, to see how targets are being met and if targets are not being met changes are made.  If we find after two or three months that certain targets set in the budget are not being met, changes must be made in this House.</P>
      <P>The people who should first be made aware of progress are the Deputies involved in discussions leading up to the budget.  If a team is not doing well an astute manager will make changes and he can turn a losing team into a winning team.  But those changes will not be made five minutes before full time.  They will be made earlier on, perhaps when the game has just started when he sees a weakness.  In this House we should set aside one day every month so that we can be informed as to the progress of the country and as to whether budget targets are being met.  A 12 hour day from 10 in the morning until 10 at night should be set aside once a month for that purpose. We on this side of the House have as much of an input as the Government, especially in a minority government situation. The decisions we make as to support or otherwise will be tempered by the facts put before us in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a preacher of doom and gloom.  I believe in people doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.  About 90 per cent of our people are anxious to do that.  Young people are very keen and because of our economic difficulties it is sad that so many find it necessary to leave the country.  This will only change if we admit the facts.  The recent announcement made, referred to the updating of the western package. From listening to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Fianna Fáil MEPs in Brussels one would think that this was a new western package with increased moneys and major benefits. That is not the truth.  I object that the facts are not being placed fairly in front of people.  This is not a new western package; it is an updated western package.  In fact less money is being spread over a wider area.  I pay tribute to the Ministers <Col N="423" /> in that the red tape that snarled up the last western package to such an extent that farmers became totally frustrated with it, has been removed.  Off farm income has been removed, and the necessity to draw up a farm plan has been removed.  What we want is buildings and systems to prevent pollution.  When a farmer with his ACOT adviser or farm development adviser has a plan that is accepted by the Department, an assessment is put on that plan to define what amount of grant he will get; then the farmer does the work and he gets paid for it.  That is the right road.  There is no point in saying that there is extra money. There is not extra money but there is money available.  There will be a tremendous take-up in this area and the people should get out there and apply immediately because the money will not last for long.</P>
    <P>In relation to health I would be the first to acknowledge the decision of the Government when they realised that their earlier decision was wrong.  We must always realise that we can make mistakes and that none of us is infallible. If we are not prepared to acknowledge mistakes and come in here and correct them, we will not make progress.  I refer here to the decision to allow all of the benefits available to people suffering from long term illness.  It was wrong in the first instance to even think of removing those benefits.  I am sure every Member of the House has the height of admiration for handicapped people and for those suffering from long-term illness because of the manner in which they face their problems.  The least we can do is to give whatever support we can.  I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health for reintroducing those aids to them.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health reconsider the transfer of the excise and VAT duties from the Revenue Commissioners to the Department of Health.  That scheme will not work.  The health boards will not be in a position to organise this scheme which worked satisfactorily under the Revenue <Col N="424" /> Commissioners.  Until now a handicapped person got a licence to drive an especially adapted car, got a note from his doctor as to his handicap, and then applied to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund of excise duty and VAT. Since 1973 the State made that refund.  It was a gesture to those people who were making a tremendous effort to go out into the world.  It is unfair to say that there were abuses as there would only have been minimal abuse.  Is there a scheme where there are not abuses?</P>
    <P>That was not a sufficient reason to transfer the scheme to the Department of Health and then to the health boards. There will be different standards in different health boards and where health boards are short of cash those people will suffer.  All Members of the House are concerned about this change of attitude and there is general consensus that that scheme should be returned to the Revenue Commissioners and left to them to operate with modifications.  The Irish Wheelchair Association, the Spina Bifida Association and the Disabled Drivers Association are all prepared to talk to the Minister and put their views forward. I know that the scheme can be reorganised if necessary.</P>
    <P>An aspect raised is that a car could be changed after two years.  I accept that this is unnecessary.  If a disabled person's car breaks down he cannot get out to thumb a lift nor can he tinker with it to see if he can get it going.  A disabled person needs a reasonably good car but it will not be necessary to change the car every two years.  The car could be used for three or four years.  The mileage would not be excessive in any one year.  As regards the size of car there are different views.  On seeing a handicapped person driving a BMW or maybe a Mercedes one might ask if less would do but that might not be so.  If the handicapped person's arms are weak he will need power steering and therefore will need a car with that type of mechanism which is not available in smaller cars.  That is the only reason a handicapped person would consider a car which might seem to be in excess of his needs.  Such people do not usually abuse <Col N="425" /> schemes.  In regard to this financial motion this matter should be left as it has been for years past.</P>
    <P>Regarding health, we have a problem in Cavan in the county clinic with regard to orthodontic treatment.  Where there is a waiting list, going back five or six years, of young people, boys and girls, needing corrective treatment for dental problems. I am asking the Minister to make extra funds available for this.  This is a very serious time in a young person's development when, if corrective measures are not taken, problems could manifest themselves in adulthood and probably eventually the defects could not be corrected. Even though we know funds are scarce it is important that these young people at this critical stage in their development &mdash; this trouble could affect their outlook on life if they are embarassed at the condition of their teeth &mdash; receive appropriate treatment.  If the Minister cannot make funds available for this I ask him to consider giving a certificate to the parents to enable those young people to be treated by a private practitioner.  If he cannot get a person qualified in this area to work for the North Eastern Health Board I believe that, rather than finance, is the answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>We have a new regional general hospital in Cavan.  The handing over ceremony took place some months ago.  It is a magnificent building and it is only right that I pay tribute to the people who brought it to Cavan, namely Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick and Senator Andy O'Brien. They played a major role in ensuring that that hospital was built in Cavan, not for the Cavan people merely but for the region surrounding the county, taking in Monaghan, parts of Leitrim, Meath, Westmeath and Longford.  The hospital is now completed and much of the more expensive equipment is in place in it but the general furnishing has now to be done before the hospital can finally be opened. That will cost something in the region of £2 million.  I want to pay tribute to the builders, Sisks, a firm well known here and internationally, who did a magnificent job in record time and, most <Col N="426" /> unusual in these times, from the date work on that hospital started until it was completed there was not a single strike. That is a tribute to the Sisk team, their management and the people who came to work there.  This bears out what I have said, that people are prepared to respond if there is an initiative and obviously the initiative there was they were well paid for doing an honest day's work.  We have invested £25 million in that hospital.  It will be detrimental if it is not equipped and opened immediately.  I am alarmed at talk of a phased opening.  That would be disastrous for this major hospital in Cavan.  With a phased opening you have partial services.  You may have one surgeon, one doctor and one anaesthetist. This hospital was built to give a 24 hour service with all services readily available. Partial opening would be the hospital's deathknell.  It might be an embarrassment to the Minister for Health, coming as he does from the Cavan Monaghan constituency, that he could be running into difficulties, but that would not be a good enough reason for not opening Cavan Regional General Hospital fully before this year is out.  I make this appeal to the Minister in the interest of health care and of good management of scarce resources and finances.</P>
    <P>The hospital is being heated and that is necessary to ensure that the building is kept in good care until it is finally open, but does it make sense to heat a hospital of that extent while the surgical hospital and the Lisdarn hospital in Cavan are also being heated and maintained?  That is not good economic sense.  In the interest of economic sense and good medical practice the surgical hospital and Lisdarn hospital should be closed down and all the resources moved in to the new hospital, under the one roof, thereby bringing about a saving in terms of the cost of heating these other two hospitals which are totally inadequate for the needs of the people.  Again I appeal to the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government not to renege on their responsibilities in regard to this hospital at this time.  That would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The environment can present another <Col N="427" /> major problem with regard to funds for local authorities.  In Cavan we are no worse off than anywhere else.  We have a problem with regard to county roads. This came about through the removal of rates on houses and of tax on cars.  Here I am speaking on a national problem. Local councils found themselves starved of much needed capital.  Funds previously supplied from rates and car tax were to be made good from central funds by VAT increases on various items.  That did not come about and the amounts of money local authorities received were decreasing at a time of rapid inflation.  There were some slight increases in 1984 and 1985.  Last year Cavan County Council's allocation was reduced and this year it was reduced further.</P>
    <P>Activity in County Cavan at county council level is well nigh at a standstill. County roads are a major problem.  I am not talking about the national primaries or secondaries.  I am moving into the heartland of the county where the roads are impassable in many cases.  They are totally broken down and the council have not got the funds to repair them.  This is not good enough for rural Ireland or for the people who have to use the roads daily, be they farmers going to and from their farms and creameries or bringing their children to school, or private house-holders, many of whom have moved out from towns and villages and built bungalows because they like the freedom of the country.  Now they find that was a costly venture because their motoring expenses have risen dramatically as a result of the condition of those roads.  More important, the condition of those roads will not attract tourists into the area for sightseeing, an area in which we have a great deal to offer.  We have many lakes and rivers which are unique.  We can boast of a lake for every day in the year, 365.  Sad to relate, many of them are inaccessible because of the condition of the roads. The blame lies first with Cavan County Council but it must be taken from them and passed on to the Government who have not made sufficient funds available for repair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to come into this House immediately and announce a county roads policy. This problem can be allowed to go on no longer.  In the town of Arva 400 people turned up to a meeting to organise themselves to campaign and the campaign will finish in this House.  They will be seeking a meeting with the Minister for the Environment. They have made representations to me and the other Deputies in the county and constituency. They came to Cavan County Council last Tuesday to make their presence felt outside the council chamber.  They have sought a meeting with the councillors and they hope to meet them on the first Tuesday in April when the Cavan County Council meeting takes place.  They will be then coming to Leinster House to meet the Minister and impress upon him the urgency of having these roads brought up to standard.</P>
    <P>It is not a good book-keeping exercise to allow a situation like that to develop. It is like letting the slates fall off one's house and not repairing them; we all know the consequences of that policy. The old saying about a stitch in time holds true.  If a slate is replaced immediately after a wind storm no further damage is done but if it is left the timbers will rot and suddenly it is a major job.  That is what is happening with the roads in this country.  I may be seen here as very parochial but I cannot help that.  I must voice the problems and difficulties in the Border region.  Even if the same situation exists in regard to county roads on the other side of the country, I make no apology for saying that priority should be given to the Cavan-Monaghan area because our difficulties are greater than those in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Tenders were sought for 11 rural cottages in County Cavan.  It is wonderful to see people still anxious to live in the rural parts of the county rather than in the towns and villages as was the policy down through the years.  We need life in the rural areas.  Tenders have been sought and agreed and were sent to the Department of the Environment over eight months ago for sanction.  That sanction <Col N="429" /> has not been forthcoming to this day and I cannot get information from the Minister as to what stage it is at.  Housing is always important but rural cottages are more important.  I know practically all of the 11 families in this case because they have made representations to me.  I know their conditions are deplorable.  They are living in prefabricated houses and some are living in caravans.  The roofs are leaking, the floors rotting and the council are saying there is no point in doing repairs as they are going to build new cottages. Yet, the sanction is not forthcoming.  It is a Catch-22 situation.  The Minister is the man who can give the sanction and I am appealing to him, on behalf of those 11 families, to immediately give that sanction.  This is a development in the right direction and any help would be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>Finance is a wide-ranging subject I could discuss for a long time, aspects of which affect my own region.  We would all agree that the PAYE sector are overburdened with tax.  People who want to do an honest day's work should get an honest day's pay, but when they open their pay packet and get the slip that goes along with it and see all the deductions they become very disheartened.  People should have more control over the money they earn.  We should be looking at introducing indirect taxation so that people will have the money in their pocket and will not be treated like school children who get so much to spend, with the Government keeping the rest.  The money should be given to them and they should be trusted.  However, if we are to reduce taxation in that area we must raise it some other way, on a broader base of indirect taxation.  That sounds simple.  I know it is not that simple but it is a possibility we should be looking at.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned to me by people who are crucified in regard to PAYE and who have large families that there is no allowance for the children of PAYE workers.  Yet people on social welfare have an allowance for each child.  I am not slating people on social welfare. Many are dependent on social welfare because they cannot get work.  Some are <Col N="430" /> unemployable and are just not anxious to work, but these are a small minority.  At the same time, it must be recognised that when one goes on social welfare, every child in the house is taken into consideration and there is an allowance, but when one goes back into the PAYE sector the allowance is immediately dropped. If the child of the social welfare worker is taken into account, surely recognition should be given to the children of the PAYE worker?</P>
    <P>VAT and all its implications takes me back to the Border area.  We have a major problem with regard to cross-Border traffic and shopping.  I make no apology for raising this again.  I will keep harping on it until we get the message home and there is a major problem in that area of the country and I want action taken on it.  Much was expected of the present Government.  By wink and nod Fianna Fáil Deputies implied that if Fianna Fáil got back into power they would change the situation as it was under the previous Government, that they had a trump card up their sleeve.</P>
    <P>We now have two Ministers in this constituency and people thought we would have four or five Christmases in the year.  Christmas has not come.  The trump card was the 48-hour imposition on people crossing the Border and was of no benefit to the immediate Border region.  It certainly stopped the coach tours from Dublin, Galway and as far afield as Cork but these people were out more for a sightseeing trip or a day's outing.  I welcome the fact that they travelled north of the Border.  It is a good exercise that people should travel between North and South and it is sad we have to create this barrier because of the wholesale one-way traffic.  What we need is more integration between North and South but this will only be achieved when we bring our costs down so that we can compete with the business people north of the Border by offering goods at the same price or almost the same price. People are not that pushed when it comes to 10p or 15p per item but when one is talking about 50p or 75p per item then one is talking about a large amount of <Col N="431" /> money for the ordinary household shopping basket.</P>
    <P>The 8p per gallon on petrol was the death knell of any hope we had.  I attended a number of meetings in Monaghan with Border traders who have now organised themselves into a group.  They were hoping before the budget when petrol was about 53p per gallon less in the North, that there would be some slight reduction to bring the difference below the 50p barrier where there would not be all that much difference but, lo and behold, instead of a reduction, we have a substantial increase that pushed it over 60p and again the traffic began.</P>
    <P>Petrol is the main reason people travel north and when they travel north to fill their car with petrol they also do their shopping. For the benefit of Deputies who do not live in that area or have not travelled to it, from Clones back to the Border and outside of Redhills, on every half mile of the road there is a petrol pump and a supermarket.  One man paid over £40,000 for a two-acre site and is surely spending another £80,000 on the development there.  Obviously these people see that this business is going to last.  It is sad, it is serious, and it will have to be dealt with in this House.  It is not good enough to say when taxation levels in the country as a whole are brought down that the Border region will be all right.  It cannot be left that long.  Nor can it be left until 1992 when we are talking about equalisation of our taxation system and a single market.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat McCartan has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the non-enforcement of the law in respect of gaming and amusement halls in areas, especially in and around Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="432" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity of raising this very important matter on the Adjournment.  I am also appreciative of the attendance of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to listen to the few words I have to say on this matter.  It is appreciated that he is, to some extent, deputising for the Minister for Justice who is abroad at present.  For too long this service of gaming machines has been called an industry and it has certain implications for any Minister concerned in that area.</P>
      <P>The basic problem arises out of the legal mire in which the law, under the 1956 Act, now finds itself.  It is worth looking at the history surrounding that Act.  Prior to 1956 the fundamental law of our State was that all gaming and gambling was illegal and unlawful and could only be made legal or lawful when a Statute of the Oireachtas deemed it to be so. The 1956 Act provided for each local authority directly concerned with this area, understanding the conditions that apply in each area and recognising the regional and local differences that can apply, to pass a motion bringing the law into play and allowing for gaming in its area.  This was done by Dublin Corporation in May 1956.  That situation pertained in the city until January 1986 when, on the unanimous vote of a council of upwards of 50 members, a decision was taken that the situation in Dublin had deteriorated to such an extent that it was now time to rescind Part III of the Act.  The unanimous view of the council at the time was that this service or industry had got out of control and had abused its authority in the previous years under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This view was held by the Supreme Court who, in November 1985, in passing a judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legal limits of the wager and the return from the machines, indicated its disapproval of the fact that in the intervening years since the constitutional action was undertaken and indeed in years prior to it when a certain amount of confusion appeared to have <Col N="433" /> been contrived in the law, the law as it stood since 1956 had not been enforced. It laid down a very severe censure not only of the gaming managers and the hall owners but to some degree of the Garda Síochána for not implementing and policing the law as it stood.</P>
    <P>What has happened since the January 1986 resolution is even more disturbing, because since then it appears that there has been no restriction on the wantonness of this industry, particularly in the city of Dublin.  At that time there were 76 existing valid licences all of which were involved in litigation that had been standing over until the Supreme Court passed its judgment.  In early 1986 they reverted back to court to conclude their business that had been hanging there since 1983, 1984 and 1985, long in advance of the passing of the resolution of the city council. They reactivated their appeals in the District Court and the Circuit Court and as a result, by reason of section 18 (3) of the Act, were allowed to continue trading.</P>
    <P>The point has to be made that some good has come from the passing of the resolution of the City Council in Dublin in January 1986 to the extent that no new halls have opened up and no new licences or certificates have issued.  All of us will recall that at that time sometimes as many applications as two a week were received by Dublin City Council for planning permission to open up these premises.  This was a feature of the whole affair that worried the council so much.  Those 76 premises, being extant, appealed.  By reason of section 18 (3), a provision that allows the licence subsist until the appeal is ultimately determined, those halls could continue operating.  Their appeals were taken from the District Court to the Circuit Court, by way of case stated from the District Court to the High Court and by way of case stated from the Circuit Court to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The situation has fallen into a legal mire but at the back of it all it is nothing more than a legal filibuster because the <Col N="434" /> gaming proprietors know that as long as they maintain legal action under the guise of appeal and case stated in the various courts, then their premises can remain open and this is their last hope.  The profit is so great that they are prepared to pay lawyers to spend considerable time in the courts as a device to keep their premises open.  It is interesting, in the context of this filibuster, that a central case was heard by Mr. Justice Barrington in the High Court in March this year.  Unfortunately, his judgment was not delivered in our favour until December &mdash; it took nine months to reach a conclusion.  It is worth mentioning the absolute technicality that took the courts almost a year to determine the case.  The gaming-amusement hall lawyers had argued that the circulation of the motion for the 1986 resolution had not been properly carried out.  Mr. Justice Barrington, to his credit, indicated that he did not think that was a valid point and ruled against the proprietors of the amusement hall.  That took almost a year and the case is now under appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I will be asking the Minister to urgently convey to the Chief Justice the view of this House and of the Government, as the City Council have done, on the urgency of this issue and to ask that an early hearing of the matter will take place in the Supreme Court.  That is a legitimate representation that can be made and it is not interfering with the case in any way.  It is appreciated by judges of the courts that they can alter their lists to respond to a matter that is of urgent public importance.  I ask the Minister that he and his Department would consider making that communication.</P>
    <P>The second area of non-enforcement of the law relates to the policing of the Act as it stands at present.  The current limits upheld by constitutional decision of the Supreme Court in November 1985 fixes rigidly the maximum wager at 2½p and the maximum delivery of a win at 50p, but it is common knowledge to anyone in Dublin that these are not the <Col N="435" /> facts in reality.  There are widespread abuses of the limits of the law and these are continuing despite the Supreme Court censure, despite the council's resolution and despite the unfortunate events of the last few weeks when a young man took his own life in desperation because of his addiction to those machines.  This will continue unless the Garda Síochána take urgent action to implement the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>The devices that are used are central switches to cut back the electronic control of the wager as soon as an investigator appears on the premises.  They include switches on the doors to impair entry on to the premises for the purpose of investigation and the employment of cynical notices above poker machines in Dublin saying: &ldquo;This is a machine of amusement and not of gambling&rdquo;.  I am reminded of an event at the Coin-op, the show held recently in Dublin, where a TV investigation crew arrived to talk about the poker machines that were there, geared and on sale and over the legal limits as prescribed by our law. Questions were asked about this, and within minutes, a sign was produced carrying the words at the top &ldquo;export only&rdquo;.  Clearly these machines are not for export.  They are for use in the streets of Dublin, in our amusement arcades in blatant breach of the law.  Gaming is no longer welcome in Dublin.  The city fathers, in a unanimous voice, have said so.  There is a public outcry to see an end to this industry or, if it is to continue, then that it must operate within the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>The question must be posed as to why prosecutions are not being brought in Dublin.  In this respect one looks to what can be done by the Garda.  In an investigation carried out by the staff of The Workers' Party <i>Irish People</i> weekly newspaper a report was delivered to the Garda in Waterford in January last when we gave them facts and figures in relation to four premises in that city.  For example <Col N="436" /> one mid-afternoon there were 60 people found on one of those premises, onethird being comprised of school children, some as young as 8 years of age.  Furthermore, it was found that the limits allowed there, in one instance, went up to 40 pence.  The Garda who acted in response to that probe established that he could bet up to 34p and that the delivery was much greater than the legal limit of 50p.  Prosecutions were brought, the central device switch located and exposed with fines of £300 imposed and machines confiscated under the provisions of section 47 of the Act.  An interesting aside to all of this is that not alone can confiscation of machines take place but the State can then sell the machine and take the money into its coffers.  Therefore, if the Government are short of money here or there, there is a way to make it &mdash; prosecute these illegal gaming hall owners, confiscate their machines and convert those ugly devices into hard money for use in other needy areas.</P>
    <P>The important point that must be made in all of this is that the provisions of the law can be enforced.  In similar investigations carried out by the staff of the <i>Irish People</i> in December last they reported on breaches of the law in Cork and Dublin.  We are advised by the Garda that there are investigations under way but the attendant prosecutions are not being brought before the courts.  For example, in Waterford two more prosecutions are pending.  If there is the will and determination the provisions of the law can be enforced, and to very good purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the problems encountered by the Garda is that the switches on the front doors render it impossible for them &mdash; with their surveillance camera in tandem &mdash; to surprise owners of premises, to enter and catch people or to engage in the activity themselves.  As soon as a gaming hall owner realises that the Garda, an investigator, or somebody not familiar to them, has arrived at the door they can delay them sufficiently long <Col N="437" /> to depress a central switch inside the building and revert the machines, all electronically operated, to the normal rate.</P>
    <P>Under section 38 of the Act there is a provision that says that the Garda should have open and free access to such premises. It is quite clear that the use of electronically controlled devices on entry to these premises is in breach of the provisions of that section and prosecutions should be brought under the same provisions. In laying the ground for bringing such-prosecutions I would ask the Minister and his Department to consider the issue of a circular by the Department, by the Superintendent in the Dublin area, or indeed those throughout the country to the proprietors of such premises advising them of their obligation to provide free and easy access to their premises by members of the Garda Síochána, under the provisions of section 38, and that any device, electronic or otherwise, deployed will be considered to be in breach of the provisions of that section and render them liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House will be well aware of the public outcry in this matter.  I might make a number of suggestions to the Minister and his Department for urgent consideration.  I would ask, first, that representation be made to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, on behalf of the Chief Justice, to consider appeals pending as a result of the Judge Barrington ruling as a matter of public importance, seeking an early date for such hearing.  Second, I would ask the Government to consider, as a matter of urgency, the repeal of section 18 (3) of the 1956 Act.  That subsection contains the unusual provision that, while appeals are pending, a gaming hall can remain open.  I contend that constitutes an incitement or invitation to delay the process. In the constitutional action it is quite clear that these people know all about delay and how to exploit the mechanisms of the courts.  What is happening is that a district or circuit court rules that an applicant is unfit, as a person &mdash; for whatever <Col N="438" /> reasons &mdash; to engage in a gaming hall activity.  Then the applicant appeals. This means that, under censure of a court that they are unfit, so long as they can delay the court procedure, they can continue their gaming activities.  That appears to me to be a ridiculous position but it can be rectified by repealing the provisions of section 18 (3).  I have no doubt that, after the Supreme Court ruling on the issue in relation to the Barrington judgment &mdash; whether or not the circular was properly issued to councillors &mdash; when we revert to the District or Circuit Court in relation to that ruling we will find another legal issue being drawn out of the pile with new appeals being sent back to the High Court and Supreme Court.  We will find that process being repeated so that years rather than months will be involved.  One way to defeat the purpose, after the Supreme Court ruling, will be to leave such people no recourse to the provisions of section 18 (3), no right to carry on uninhibited.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government to convey to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána the wish of this House for the rigorous implementation of the wager limits laid down under the provisions of the 1956 Act.  I would ask that consultation take place with the Garda in Waterford if the Garda in Dublin need advice as to how to implement the law.  It can be done; it takes will and endeavour but will reap good results.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the necessity for having the provisions of section 38 with regard to free access to these premises enforced, with a circular being issued advising these people that if they contrive in the future to delay entry on to their premises that will be considered a prosecutable offence.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that the Government consider issuing a memorandum to the Judiciary advising them of the importance of that point.  I understand this is a practice engaged in time and again by the Department of Justice, for example, with <Col N="439" /> regard to prison facilities, enforcement or administration of the law, when letters are sent to the President of the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and to the Chief Justice.  That practice can be engaged in here in order to impress on them the need for strict implementation of the law, as it stands, indeed reminding them that the sanction of imprisonment obtains.  After the Supreme Court ruling no gaming hall manager will be able to contend that there is any confusion whatsoever.  The law is absolute and clear.  It must be obeyed and these people must be made realise that if they breach the law they will be placed at the risk of its full sanctions, including imprisonment.  That has never happened.  It is now time for us to consider locking up these people.  They are peddling in misery, they are not an asset to our community, we do not want them any longer in Dublin and we need the help of the Government to ensure that the law is upheld and respected.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the whole question of addiction and possible addiction to gambling machines has been highlighted in recent times by the tragic death of the 18 year old Shane Finn.  I am sure the House and Members present would wish to join me in offering our sympathy to his parents and family, a young boy who left a note to the effect that, as a result of his addiction to gambling machines, he had been driven to taking his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter brought before the House by Deputy McCartan about the non-enforcement of the law in relation to illegal gaming in amusement halls, particularly in the Dublin area, the first point I need to make in relation to this subject is that there is no question but that the Garda are enforcing the gaming laws in an active and dedicated fashion. The existing legislation governing the use of gaming machines is contained in the <Col N="440" /> Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979. Detections of breaches of these Acts during the past three years &mdash; I do not yet have the figures for 1987 &mdash; are as follows: in 1984 there were 816 breaches, in 1985, 678 breaches and in 1986, 868 breaches.</P>
    <P>The main Act, the 1956 Act, places severe restrictions on the nature and extent of gaming that may be carried on within the State.  The main features in this regard are as follows: the District Court may grant a certificate authorising the issue of a licence permitting gaming at an amusement hall or funfair and the Revenue Commissioners grant a licence on foot of the certificate; the stake and pay-out in any game shall not exceed 2½p and 50p respectively; no person under 16 years of age may engage in gaming and a certificate may not be granted by the District Court for a premises in any area where the relevant local authority have not adopted by resolution Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Such a resolution allows gaming to be carried on within their administrative area.</P>
    <P>Various aspects of these Acts are currently, and have been over the years, the subject of court challenges, most of which have sought to lessen the restrictions imposed by the Acts.  The challenges have served to hinder the Garda in their efforts to enforce the law.  An important example relates to the decision, as referred to by Deputy McCartan, taken by Dublin City Council on 28 January 1986 to rescind their previous adoption of Part III of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, the effect of which was to prohibit gaming in amusement halls.  The intention behind this decision has yet to be effected because of a number of court challenges &mdash; which have been outlined already in this debate &mdash; which have had the effect of allowing gaming still to be carried on in the city.  The Deputy knows that in relation to appeals this is the law and that while an appeal is taking place, not alone in this area but in many other areas also, the same situation applies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> In one of these cases entitled &ldquo;Inspector Richard Kelly <i>versus</i> District Justice Oliver Macklin and his Honour Judge Gerard Buchanan (Playland Amusements Ltd.)&rdquo; the State is appealing a decision by the Dublin Circuit Court to grant gaming licences to a number of applicants following the rescission of Part III of the 1956 Act by Dublin Corporation. This case is still pending and gaming licences are continuing in force. In another instance, there is a case entitled &ldquo;In Re Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 and In Re Application of Murphy (52 Upper Dorset Street)&rdquo; pending in the Supreme Court in relation to the procedure followed by Dublin Corporation in reaching its decision to rescind its original adoption of Part III of the 1956 Act.  In this regard, section 18 (3) of the 1956 Act is the relevant provision. Pending an appeal against the refusal of a licence by the District Court an existing licence continues to be valid.  I would point out, however, that this does not prevent the Garda from investigating and, where necessary, prosecuting in cases where breaches of the law are suspected. I might also mention the Supreme Court decision in June 1986 in the case DPP <i>versus</i> Peter McMahon, Seamus McMeel, James Wright which held that the Garda, before entering a licensed premises for the purpose of detecting possible offences under the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1979, should have in their possession a search warrant issued under section 39 of the 1956 Act.  This decision has had a particular effect in respect of the most common form of gaming instrument &mdash; the poker machine.  Proprietors of premises, particularly premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor, contend that such machines are for amusement only and that, consequently, their use is not in contravention of the Act.  To gather evidence to prove otherwise poses particular problems for the Garda in the light of this decision.</P>
    <P>Difficulties also arise because of the <Col N="442" /> system used by some operators whereby machines operating stakes and payouts in excess of the legal limits connected to a remote control radio system can be instantly readjusted to a legal usage when a Garda inspection appears imminent.  A recent successful prosecution in Waterford District Court involving such a system has thrown up a number of legal points on which advice has been sought by the Garda from the law officers.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding such legal difficulties encountered by the Garda, most of which I assume will be resolved in the courts in time, the Garda are making, and will continue to make, every effort to enforce the law in this regard.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is not their policy to refrain from prosecutions under the Gaming and Lotteries Acts where a relevant court challenge in another case is pending.  They take the approach that, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the State (Llewellyn) <i>versus</i> Ua Donnchadha [1973], Irish Reports 151 proceedings should be initiated promptly in all cases where the evidence and circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>We will certainly give full consideration to the suggestion made here by Deputy McCartan in relation to representations. The Department of Justice and the Minister, on his return, will give full consideration to it.  We shall also look at the other points made by Deputy McCartan in relation to the problems he highlighted in Waterford.  It is only fair to point out that the cases under appeal will have a bearing on the amendment of any Act to be brought in.  The likelihood of a single Act to amend a particular section would have extreme difficulty in getting through the House in view of all the cases that are pending.  Nevertheless, we appreciate the anxiety and public concern.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I have witnessed the addiction of some people to gaming machines.  When the first gaming hall was opened in Longford the local <Col N="443" /> urban district council reversed an earlier decision and banned it so we do not have that addiction and problem in Longford town.</P>

      <P>Detailed arrangements on the operation of visual display units (VDU) in the Civil Service were agreed with staff interests in 1983 and circulated to all Departments for implementation.  The arrangements cover all health and safety aspects of operation and monitoring including eye tests, breaks from continuous viewing and ergonomic factors such as equipment, working environment and design of workplace.  The national guidelines on the safe operation of VDUs produced by <Col N="371" /> the Department of Labour in 1986 were sent to all Departments.  My Department monitors international research studies on the operation of VDUs while individual Departments are responsible for the application of the agreement on VDU operation.  I am satisfied that the agreed monitoring arrangements are adequate and effective.</P>

      <P>I would not agree that pre-movement testing for the domestic trade has failed to identify disease problems and to protect purchasers of livestock. On the contrary, since its introduction in 1978 the pre-movement test has been an essential element in the fight against bovine TB and brucellosis.  Not alone has it identified hundreds of diseased herds and animals annually but it has also prevented disease spread to many more herds, thereby avoiding severe hardship for the herdowners concerned.  In common with all other arrangements under the disease eradication schemes, the role of the pre-movement tests is kept under continual review.</P>

    <P>I am aware of the difficulties that the <Col N="377" /> quota system presents for certain producers. I have already sought to assist these farmers within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations.  I understand that the deductions from milk payments now being made by certain co-ops or dairies are regarded as essential by them in order to cover possible levy payments due and to prevent those producers over quota from incurring even higher levy bills.</P>
    <P>As regards the re-apportionment of quotas, this would only be possible if the original division of Ireland's quota among co-ops and dairies were altered.  That distribution was on the basis of more favourable allocations to smaller scale producers throughout the country.  I have no plans to make any such changes at this stage, but I am keeping the situation under review.</P>

However, payment had to be suspended on 16 January 1988 as no certificate had been received since November 1987.  A certificate for February 1988 was forwarded by the claimant and payment due to 3 February 1988 was issued on 8 February 1988.</P>
      <P>On all claims commencing prior to 6 April 1987, one of the conditions for claiming disability benefit is that the person concerned must have a minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the contribution year which governs his claim.  According to the records of the Department the claimant had less than 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1986-87 contribution year which governed his claim from 4 February 1988 and was therefore not entitled to receive benefit from that date.</P>
      <P>However, following inquiries it was established that he had sufficient contributions paid and credited in the 1986-87 contribution year.  This enabled him to continue receiving disability benefit beyond 4 February 1988 at the maximum rate appropriate to a married man with an adult dependant and three child dependants.</P>
      <P>All benefit due to the person concerned for the period from 4 February 1988 to 19 March 1988 was issued on 11 March 1988, less the total amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him by the health board.  Further payments will issue to him weekly on receipt of monthly medical certificates for as long as he remains incapable of work.</P>

He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance of £100.75 weekly, being the appropriate maximum rate payable in his case of £125.30 less means of £24.55.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 22 February 1988 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  The claimant appealed against the disallowance and arrangements are being made to have her examined by a different medical referee at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her entitlement to payment of further disability benefit will be urgently reviewed in the light of the medical referee's report following the examination. The person concerned also claimed disablement benefit under the occupational <Col N="382" /> injuries scheme on 10 August 1987 in respect of an alleged accident at work on 26 December 1983.</P>
    <P>Injury benefit had not been claimed after the accident and it was necessary therefore to investigate the claim circumstances from the beginning.  A form of inquiry which was issued to the employer to confirm details of the accident was returned to the Department undelivered.  It was reissued, without response, on 12 November 1987 to the latest address.  The matter has been referred for investigation to a social welfare officer who has been asked to expedite his inquiries.  When his report is to hand a decision will be made without delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the determination of entitlement to an allowance is a matter for the health board.  It is understood from the Eastern Health Board that there are no arrears due in this case.  The board have, however, been asked to supply the person concerned with a detailed summary of her claim, setting out the payments made.</P>
      <P>It has been confirmed from the Eastern Health Board that she was in receipt of assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme up to the week ended 19 December 1987 and that at that stage she had been receiving £34 weekly. This was being paid as an urgent needs payment in order to avoid hardship.  She ceased claiming it in December, 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understood that at that stage, when she did not collect a cheque at the health centre, the community welfare officer phoned her at her home and she informed him that she no longer wished to claim the allowance because she had other means at her disposal.  She called to the <Col N="384" /> health centre in mid-January 1988 to inquire about another matter and she was asked if she wished to apply for supplementary welfare allowance but declined to complete an application form.</P>
    <P>In subsequent contacts with the health board, she also declined to fully discuss her circumstances and to submit a new claim.  However, she made a claim for supplementary welfare allowance on 15 March 1988 and, while the claim is being considered, she has been awarded an urgent need payment of £35.  This payment will be given to her to-day.  The health board will also inform her that the summary of her previous payments is being prepared.</P>

RTE advise that they have one current complaint of interference to television reception in the areas in question. Their investigations into the complaint are continuing but to date they have found no evidence of direct interference to RTE television reception.  They have found that the main complaint relates to reception of UK television transmissions which are of the weak fringe variety. They are therefore vulnerable to interference from authorised users of the frequency spectrum and other sources.  RTE will investigate specific cases of reception difficulties on receipt of the names and addresses concerned.</P>

      <P>The allegations in this case relate to the supply of incontinence wear to the mother of the person concerned.  A public health nurse with specialist knowledge of incontinence requisites made specific recommendations regarding the needs of this patient.  The Eastern Health Board was at all times prepared to supply incontinence materials in accordance with these professional recommendations.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the person concerned declined to provide public health nursing staff with access to her mother. She did, however, accept receipt of the incontinence materials supplied by the health board, arising from the professional recommendations referred to. Due to the refusal of the person to admit the board's nursing staff to the family residence, it was decided that the person could arrange to collect the incontinence materials for her mother at the local health centre, which is close to the family residence.  She agreed with this suggestion and secured incontinence materials accordingly.</P>
      <P>A senior public health nurse kept in close communication with the family general practitioner with a view to monitoring the needs of the patient.  The case was therefore kept under continual review.</P>

      <P>The number of national school teachers in County Kilkenny has decreased from 433 in January 1987 to 420 at present.  It would not be possible to quantify any resultant reduction in cost to the State without the expenditure of an inordinate amount of staff time.</P>
      <P>A total of 40 national teachers in County Kilkenny have applied for the voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties which have arisen with parents of prospective pupils of St. Martin de Porres national school, Aylesbury, Tallaght, Dublin 24 which has been instructed by her Department not to allow its numbers to exceed 639 in the school year commencing September, 1988 which is only one more than the current enrolment number; that there are 101 applicants for places this September but that there will be only 38 vacancies if her instructions are to be observed; that this would mean in many cases younger brothers and sisters of existing pupils not being placed in this school and having to go to schools elsewhere, causing enormous difficulty for parents but this also means first children of families actually living on the same road as the school not being admitted as in a case (details supplied); if, in these circumstances, she will approve the application by the school for semi-permanent extensions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The general position is that the excess of demand over places available in a school should be catered for in any school within a reasonable distance in which sufficient suitable accommodation is available.  Where enrolment is to be restricted, it is for the board of management to decide what pupils or category of pupil will be admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, the enrolment of pupils at St. Martin de Porres national school is in excess of its permanent accommodation of 16 classrooms together with its ancillary accommodation, the temporary use of which as classrooms is also involved. In these circumstances, the school was advised in March 1987 to restrict its intake of new pupils for the school year <Col N="402" /> beginning 1 September 1987 to that appropriate to its permanent accommodation and to divert any additional pupils to nearby schools, with particular reference to St. Maelruans national school, a school with available accommodation and only a half mile away.</P>
    <P>In September 1987, St. Martins admitted pupils in excess of the number advised by the Department and the school was asked in November 1987 for an explanation. This was not received until 14 March 1988; it is now being examined and a further letter will issue to the school in due course.  There can be no question, however, of any additional accommodation being provided at St. Martins national school as there is sufficient available classroom accommodation within a reasonable distance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to computerising the activities of the examinations branch of my Department at the earliest opportunity.  The funding of an operation of this kind was not intended to come within the objectives for which the national lottery was launched, which were mainly in the area of sport, youth, arts and culture.  In the interim I am pressing ahead with the necessary preparation for computerisation so that when <Col N="404" /> the funds required become available the way will be clear for the process of computerisation to be introduced quickly and without undue disruption.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, however, that there has been inordinate delay in issuing the results of the leaving certificate examination, nor that many young people are thereby precluded from obtaining places in English colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total provision for inservice training for 1988 for primary teachers is £143,000.  Of this only a very small proportion will be allocated to courses dealing only with the teaching of the Irish language, but a sum of the order of £36,000 will be used for a series of seminars on the theme &ldquo;the teaching and use of the two languages Irish and English in the context of the primary curriculum.&rdquo; Continental languages do not form part of the approved curriculum for primary schools.</P>
      <P>The provision of inservice courses in Subhead J of the Vote for Second Level and Further Education for the year 1988 is £218,000 &mdash; the same as for 1987.  The provision planned for Irish inservice courses accounts for 3 per cent, German and Spanish 6 per cent; information technology 5.5 per cent and preliminary courses related to the introduction of a new course in technology 2 per cent, respectively, of the total allocation in Subhead J.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead J provides for the cost of <Col N="405" /> organising the courses and the travel and subsistence costs of secondary teachers attending them but not the travel and subsistence costs of vocational and community-comprehensive teachers which are met by the VECs and the communitycomprehensive schools out of their own budgets.</P>
