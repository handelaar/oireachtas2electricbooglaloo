Announcements were made in the British Houses of Parliament yesterday about certain steps to be taken by the British Government during the course of their coming parliamentary session.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 15:</P>
    <P>In page 7, to delete lines 8 to 21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I commenced speaking to this amendment and had expressed my surprise and consternation at the attempt to delete, by this amendment, one of the most positive supports for couples coping in the first year of their married life together with the stresses and strains that we all know are attached to the first months of marriage.  I had said that there is a wise saying, &ldquo;if you want to know me come and live with me.&rdquo;  No other kind of relationship can prepare one adequately for the long term commitment of marriage.</P>
      <P>The overriding factor for the electorate in the divorce referendum was the importance to be attached to the long term commitment of marriage and the fear that that might, in some way, be destabilised or come under pressure.  If this amendment is deleted we will be going against the very factor that operated so strongly in the voting behaviour of people during the divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have any commitment to allowing people to develop and adapt within their <Col N="1451" /> marriage before rushing into the definite conclusion that a judicial separation would bring, it is essential that section 7 of the Bill remain.  It is ludicrous to suggest otherwise.  Like other speakers I fail to see how Fianna Fáil are helping couples in the best way possible.  The deletion of this section most certainly would not help.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy O'Donoghue's fears that a woman might find herself under a severe threat of violence or other abuse in marriage and not be able to do anything within a judicial separation situation, that is clearly looked after in section 7 (2) which proposes to allow for the issuing of an application for judicial separation on the ground that where the marital difficulties experienced by the applicant are of such a serious and exceptional nature it would be unreasonable and unjust to delay the issuing of such application. I put it to this House that nobody in a civilised society would suggest that the battering or abuse of a wife would not be seen as serious and exceptional.  It would not be seen to be unreasonable and unjust to delay the issuing of such application in such circumstances.  It is perfectly well covered under that section.</P>
    <P>Couples, worldwide, have difficulties in the early months of marriage, but there are particular factors in our society that bring pressures to bear on young people coming together in marriage here.  In an oral submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown the psychologist, Jack Dominion, said that if he had his way he would add to the three Rs in our primary and secondary school education systems a fourth R, education in relationships.  He talked about the need for us to prepare our young people for stable relationships within marriage, to teach them communication skills for understanding and acceptance of the gender differences to allow long term, stable and loving relationships to continue. Our educational system fails dismally to do that.  We have single sex education.  We segregate our boys and our girls and our young men and women into single sex schools on the whole so <Col N="1452" /> that they do not even have an opportunity to sit and share and study together, and that is almost unique to Ireland.  We have not yet introduced living skills and education for marriage and long term relationships into any of our curricula yet.  It is all the more astonishing therefore that, in the vulnerable position in which our educational system leaves young people, we would attempt to remove a section that would ensure that they could cope, in the first year of marriage, with the pressures of living together and sharing together and coming together in a very foreign situation.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Deputy consider giving me the two minutes that are left to reply to the debate on my amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course.  I would ask the Minister to take that seriously into consideration in replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very thankful to the Deputy for being so gracious as to give me the chance to reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>My amendment, No. 15, is consequential on my amendments Nos. 1 and 3.  I would not be pressing this amendment if section 3 (1) (f) had remained in the Bill.  In our view the real and only reason behind the inclusion of section 7 in the Bill was section 3 (1) (f).  Neither the Law Reform Commission nor the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown recommended a section along the lines of section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important not to lose sight of the fact that the proposed one year bar would now, following the deletion of section 3 (1) (f) only be of relevance where the ground of application for a decree is either adultery or unreasonable behaviour which, essentially, is the old ground of cruelty whether mental or physical, and unnatural practices.  We are not therefore talking about the situation envisaged by Deputy Colley or Deputy Barnes of people who, in their first year of marriage, may be finding it difficult to come to terms with their new situation. <Col N="1453" /> There is no question that they could come into court seeking a judicial separation now that section 3 (1) (f) is no longer in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 7 allows an application to be made within a year where serious marital difficulties have arisen but what more serious marital difficulty could one have than adultery or cruelty on the part of one of the spouses? In my view there is no necessity for this provision.  Its enactment, if the experience in the UK is anything to go by, would only increase the bitterness and distress and the humiliation of what happened in the marriage.  Contrary to what Deputy Shatter said, this type of provision does not apply in other jurisdictions in relation to proceedings for <Col N="1454" /> judicial separation.  It does not apply at present under our law and I am not aware that the absence of such a provision has given rise to any difficulties.  I believe we should not create a problem where none exists at present by enacting this section, particularly subsection (2).</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the speakers opposite seem to forget that in sections 5, 6 and 8 of the Bill there are already adequate safeguards to prevent hasty applications for judicial separation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 27 to 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these amendments were discussed in the earlier days, at the time we were in Special Committee, a certain amount of effort was made to push them aside rather speedily as if they were of no consequence.  Deputy Shatter said that the amendments rearranged his provisions in different language, that his provisions were fully and properly drafted. He said I was creating an impression that I was doing something new.  He said, and I quote from the Special Committee <Col N="1457" /> report, No. 10 of 22 September 1988, at column 360:</P>
    <P>I do not know why we have to waste time going through amending provisions that are already adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>I would hope that all Members of the House would appreciate that there are good and valid reasons for most Bills, including Deputy Shatter's, requiring careful consideration and amendment before enactment.  There are procedures in this House to enable that process be carried through.  Without wishing in any way to denigrate Private Members' Bills, I have no hesitation in reintroducing these amendments now.  They are mainly of a technical nature and the arguments advanced against them in the Special Committee, in my view, were less than convincing.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 17 to 21, inclusive, concern the deletion of the words &ldquo;an interim&rdquo; where they apply respectively to a barring or protection order, a custody or access order or orders for the protection of the family home or contents made after the application of a decree of judicial separation is issued but prior to the determination of the application by the court.  The reasons for these amendments are fairly straight forward.  The Bill presupposes that interim orders, so-called, are available under the law at present.  However, none of the statutes concerned &mdash; namely, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act of 1981, the Guardianship of Infants Act of 1964 and the Family Home Protection Act of 1976 provides for the making of such orders.  There can be no arguments about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter stated on Committee Stage that the position in practice is that there is no doubt that interim orders are applied for and are made in all of these cases except where a barring order is concerned.  He states further that the interim orders in question are applied for on notice of motion but that there are exceptional cases where, for example, a child has been kidnapped, when a notice of motion may not have been made <Col N="1458" /> because of the urgency involved and the court will accept that a motion can be made later.</P>
    <P>As regards barring orders, he mentioned that there is a need to provide for interim orders to cover the case where it is obvious that if an order is not made immediately a spouse will be subject to more violence in the family home.  My answer is that there is no need to make special provision in the Bill for interim orders in the kind of circumstances he mentions because the present law is adequate.  Not only that, but the way in which interim orders are introduced in the Bill is confusing and in some cases misleading.</P>
    <P>First, let me say that I am in full agreement with section 13, which provides that the court may make various orders as to custody and access without separate proceedings having been instituted. There is nothing new in that; the present law makes similar provision.  The confusion resulting from the use of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; in section 12 (b) to (e) inclusive was evident in the course of the deliverations of the Special Committee. Some Deputies foresaw a danger that it could mean that each of the orders in question could be applied for and granted on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, that is, without notice to the other side.  After some discussion it became evident, on the basis of the examples given by Deputy Shatter I mentioned earlier, that he was endeavouring to cater for certain extreme cases. Those cases are covered already by the present law and the use of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; will do nothing new.  Unfortunately, it could have a hearing on the normal kind of case, that is, in cases where <i>ex parte</i> applications might not be at all appropriate.</P>
    <P>I shall illustrate the points I have made by dealing with each of the orders in question and referred to in section 12 (b) to (c) inclusive.  The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, empowers the court, pending the making of a barring order, to make an order for the protection of a spouse or child whose safety or welfare so requires. A protection order is an injunction-type <Col N="1459" /> order.  The court may make the order on <i>ex parte</i> application.  It may be made even though a summons has not been served on the spouse against whom the barring order is being sought.  It takes effect when the spouse against whom it is directed is notified of its making but oral notification to that spouse, by or on behalf of the spouse in whose favour the order is made, is taken to be sufficient notice of the making of the order.  The Act makes no reference to an interim protection order. Clearly, in the light of the provisions of the Act as it stands, there is no need whatever to refer in the Bill to an interim protection order.  The 1981 Act makes special provision as regards the hearing of applications for a barring order.  It authorises the making of rules of court providing for the expeditious hearing of barring order cases and allowing the service of documents otherwise than in accordance with existing procedures. Appropriate rules have been made for such expeditious hearings by the court and <i>ex parte</i> applications have been granted in some cases.  Again, the provision in the Bill for interim barring orders, as such, is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The provision with regard to custody and access orders under the Guardianship of Infant Act, 1964, is that the orders are normally made by notice of motion.  In extreme cases referred to by Deputy Shatter, where a parent fears that the other parent may seek to remove a child from the jurisdiction, that parent can, in proceedings under the 1964 Act, obtain an order prohibiting the other spouse from removing the child from the jurisdiction.  The court may also require the spouse to hand over any passport issued in respect of the child.  If a parent has already kidnapped a child an <i>ex parte</i> application can be made to the court seeking an immediate order forbidding the removal of the child from the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Family Home Protection Act, 1976, specifically provides for circumstances in which matrimonial proceedings have been instituted and a spouse wishes to have an order of the <Col N="1460" /> court restricting the disposal of household chattels until the matrimonial proceedings have been determined.  In that sense the Act caters for interim type orders.  In addition, the Act gives wide discretionary powers to the court to protect the family home and in some cases <i>ex parte</i> applications have been granted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 provides for the deletion of paragraph (a) of section 12 concerning interim maintenance. However, amendment No. 23 concerning maintenance pending suit would substitute a more comprehensive provision. Paragraph (a) empowers the court to make interim maintenance orders under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, pending the determination of an application for a decree of judicial separation.  Section 7 of the 1976 Act already provides for interim maintenance orders.  Therefore, there is no difficulty about the use of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; as such.  The difficulty with the provision is that it would cater only for cases where there has been failure to maintain.  That would not be the case in all separation proceedings.  The Bill undoubtedly is faulty in this respect. However, the argument advanced by Deputy Shatter in its favour is a distortion of the facts.  His argument simply is that proof of failure to maintain is not necessary to obtain an order for interim maintenance. What he failed to say is that before a spouse is granted an interim order by the court under the provisions of section 7 of the 1976 Act an application for a maintenance order must first be made under section 5 of the Act.  Clearly that is made on the basis that there has been a failure to maintain.  Thereafter the process is that the court prior to determining the matter may, on the application of a spouse, make an interim order as it thinks proper.  Therefore, it is quite wrong to suggest that an application under section 7 of the 1976 Act would cover all cases in separation proceedings where maintenance is required as an interim measure.</P>
    <P>There are two approaches one can take to this obvious defect in the Bill.  One approach might be to retain paragraph <Col N="1461" /> (a) as it stands and insert an amendment providing, in addition, for maintenance pending suit which would not necessarily be dependent on a failure to maintain. That is the approach taken in England, but the experience has been that the provision based on failure to maintain is not availed of and dependent spouses apply instead for maintenance pending suit.</P>
    <P>The other approach &mdash; and it is the one that I favour &mdash; is that paragraph (a) should be deleted on the basis that a provision for maintenance pending suit would in any event cover all eventualities. It would also have the merit in that separation proceedings might on that basis start off on a less acrimonious basis.  No allegation of failure to maintain would have to be made and perhaps it would help in some way towards the conciliation process provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23, regarding maintenance pending suit, is framed so as to give the court a wide and unfettered discretion to make such interim periodical payments to a spouse and any dependent children as it considers proper.  The maintenance pending suit may be ordered to be paid retrospectively from the date of the institution of the separation proceedings and the court would at the outset of the proceedings for separation be able in all cases to give attention to the immediate financial position and the needs of the spouse and children of the family that would not necessarily be possible if paragraph (a) of section 12 is retained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter disputes that the maintenance pending suit could be backdated to the date of the application to the court. He claims that the court would apply the order from the date of the court hearing. That is not what the amendment provides. It is clear that backdating is a feature of my amendment.  That is the position in our neighbouring jurisdictions which have similar provisions.</P>

Initially what I want to say on these amendments is the same as what I said on Committee Stage.  Despite what the Minister has said it seems that none of the amendments he is now proposing to section 12 is required or necessary but rather they appear to be part of the approach that he has adopted which is to try to find holes to pick in this Bill where there are no holes to pick and to produce spurious arguments for reconstructing portions of the Bill.  I do not want to waste the time of the House in our having a row as to whether a particular approach should be phrased in a certain way.  If I am satisfied that an amendment the Minister tables would have an identical effect as something contained in this Bill already I do not believe that we should delay the House in arguing over semantics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the comments the Minister made.  As happened yesterday, they indicate a total lack of understanding of what happens within our court structures when marriages break down and they indicate a total lack of understanding of the problems which exist under the current legislation which the Judiciary have tried to <Col N="1463" /> overcome on a pragmatic basis without legislation being enacted by the Oireachtas.  Section 12 is designed to do a very simple thing.  It is designed to ensure, when a person brings a judicial separation action and requires urgent court assistance, that that urgent assistance can be obtained in dealing with a variety of family problems in the context of the judicial separation proceedings which are issued.</P>
    <P>If a wife seeks an interim maintenance order for the support of herself and her children not only does she have to bring separation proceedings, she also has to bring a separate maintenance action. This Bill under section 13 which the Minister says does not achieve anything, cuts out the necessity for the duplication of litigation and for the wife having to bring a separate action.  That provision is contained in paragraph (a) of section 12. What the Minister said is inaccurate, because in practical terms there is probably going to be no difference in operation between section 12, paragraph (a), and amendment No. 23, which the Minister wants to insert in the Bill.  Both contain provisions designed to allow the court make interim maintenance orders where they are required.  The Minister uses the term &ldquo;maintenance pending suit&rdquo; whereas I use the term &ldquo;interim maintenance orders&rdquo;, but in practical terms I do not believe it greatly matters whether we accept amendment No. 23 or whether we accept what is contained in section 12, paragraph (a).</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that the Minister wants to remove from the Bill section 12.  If he was suggesting that we take out paragraph (a) and replace it with amendment No. 23 I would simply say that that is fine, that we have no problem about that and let us agree to that; but the reasons which the Minister gives as to why the section he is proposing is a better one than the one contained in the original draft are nonsensical and legally <Col N="1464" /> inaccurate.  He said that in order to get an interim maintenance order under the law as it stands at present one has to prove failure to maintain.  That is not what is contained in the relevant section, section 7, of the 1976 Act which states very simply and I quote:</P>
      <P>On an application to the Court for a maintenance order, the Court, before deciding whether to make or refuse to make the order, may, if it appears to the Court proper to do so having regard to the needs of the persons for whose support the maintenance order is sought and the other circumstances of the case, make an order (in this Act referred to as an interim order) for the payment to the applicant by the maintenance debtor, for a definite period specified in the order or until the application is ajudicated upon by the Court, of such periodical sum as, in the opinion of the Court, is proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, what the court needs to do is to look at what the needs of the spouse and her dependent children are, to see if they are being met, and if they are not being met &mdash; and we will presume that it is the wife who is looking for maintenance &mdash; even though she is receiving some funds the court can make an interim maintenance order.  One does not have to prove failure to maintain as is required under section 5 of the Act to make a full order as this is an interim remedy.  I assume from what the Minister has said that the court under amendment No. 23 would have to do exactly the same thing. It is worth pointing out that the Minister does not state what maintenance pending suit is supposed to mean or what test the courts would have to apply in determining whether to order maintenance pending suit.  One could argue that the interim maintenance order procedure which has been well tried and which has been used since 1976 gives the court clear guidance as to how they should calculate what interim maintenance is required whereas the Minister's amendment gives no such guidance.  In this context guidance is not probably essential because at <Col N="1465" /> this stage the Judiciary would know how to approach that issue.</P>
    <P>What is more of importance are the other amendments which the Minister wants to make to section 12.  He wants to get rid of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e).  I suspect that what he wants to achieve is the same as what I want to achieve.  What I want to achieve is that where a wife is subjected to violence she can get immediate court protection where necessary by way of an interim barring order without having to wait for a full court contest as to whether a judicial separation decree should or should not be granted, taking the grounds the Minister has outlined, on the basis of allegations that her husband's behaviour is unreasonable.  The difficulty &mdash; and the Minister referred to this briefly in a different way &mdash; is that our barring order legislation at present expressly allows the court to make interim protection orders &mdash; an order saying to a husband that he can continue to live with his wife in the home but he must not assault her &mdash; without expressly allowing the court to make interim barring orders, that is, allowing the courts to order out of the family home a spouse who has been violent in the interim pending a court hearing.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Minister's approach to this Bill is that there might be a theoretical knowledge in the context of the advice he is being given but there is not the practical knowledge.  The problem here is that some judges will grant interim barring orders but some judges will not because they take the view that currently the only interim order that can be made pending a court hearing to determine whether someone should be put out of the family home because of allegations of violence is an interim protection order. There are wives who are subjected to violence who are so terrified of their husbands that an interim protection order provides no security or peace of mind in the intervening period between the time when court proceedings are initiated and finally concluded.</P>
    <P>The reference in section 12 (b) to interim barring orders was very specific <Col N="1466" /> so as to make it quite clear that the courts can make an interim barring order to provide immediate protection for a wife who is battered.  Under section 12 (d), the court can make orders for the protection of the family home only under section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act normally in a full court hearing, though one can, by notice of motion, look for interim orders.  Because courts in practice are making interim orders, this section was designed to make it clear that when this Bill becomes law the courts have express statutory jurisdiction to make these orders in so far as is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am concerned as to why the Minister wants to delete the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo;.  By deleting the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; from the barring order procedure I believe the Minister is not removing a confusion but creating a confusion and leaving it to the Judiciary to adopt a pragmatic approach to determine whether in particular circumstances they can make interim orders.  In the context of judicial separation proceedings there is not currently a precedent for the courts, in separation proceedings, to make interim barring orders, interim orders to protect the family or interim custody orders because one has to bring separate custody proceedings. The Bill wanted to make it very clear that the court can make interim orders.  With regard to the custody issue, the Minister, by deleting the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo;, is suggesting that pending a full court hearing it might be open to the courts to make a full custody order under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, rather than an order of an interim nature.  That could result in a duplication of litigation and ongoing lengthy court proceedings between a husband and wife whose marriage has collapsed. I do not think that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to paragraph (a) of section 12 being replaced by section 23 because I think in practical terms it will not make any difference.  However, I am concerned that taking the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; out of paragraph (b) might, in fact, take away a protection for wives who are at risk of serious violence which the Bill <Col N="1467" /> expressly says the courts can provide.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.  Ultimately it may be that a pragmatic judiciary, many of whom have a good deal more insight into how to deal with family law problems than the Minister has, will adapt these provisions to apply them in a sensible way.  I asked the Minister if he was moving amendment No. 64 in the context of these amendments.  Before I say anything on this amendment, perhaps the Minister might clarify the position because I do not want to unnecessarily delay the House in dealing with it now.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 64, if amendment No. 23 is accepted there will be no need for section 19 because, as I have already stated, amendment No. 23 provides for the backdating of maintenance orders to the date of the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If amendment No. 23 is accepted it will confer on the courts a discretion to make a maintenance order which can be backdated to the date of the application but it does not require the courts to so backdate a maintenance order.  In the context of section 19, I want to make it clear to the Minister that if amendment No. 23 is accepted section 19 will not automatically fall.  Section 19 will still remain part of the Bill.  Section 19 is designed to allow the courts, when a family law judicial separation case has been determined and where a wife has lost out in the context of maintenance payments, to make an order by way of backdating.  This is different to what the Minister is proposing and I want to explain the manner in which it would operate differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interim maintenance order might be made by the courts on an emergency application to require a husband to pay to a wife, for the support of herself and three children, for example, £100 a week <Col N="1468" /> on the basis of limited information available to the court for an interim hearing. Four or six months later the full court hearing could take place and in the full court hearing it might become very clear to the court that a husband might have sought to conceal his true assets and income and that an appropriate maintenance order should be £160 or £170 a week.  During the period which elapsed between the interim order and the full order the wife and the children may have suffered serious financial difficulties. They may have incurred bills and expenses which they cannot meet and they may have had to live at a standard of living far below that to which they would have been entitled if the court had had full information about the husband's earnings.</P>
    <P>Section 19 allows the court to backdate, in a sense, the final maintenance order which was made and in so far as there would be a discrepancy between the interim payment ordered and the full payment ordered, the husband could be required to pay the difference to his wife. Section 19 is designed to ensure that there is not an incentive on the part of husbands who are failing in their obligations to their families to conceal the true nature of their earnings for as long as they can before there is a full court hearing and to string out the date before a case finally comes to hearing in the courts on the basis of knowing that the longer it takes for the court to be heard and the more delay they create, the more money they will save because they may be aware that a full maintenance order will be for a larger figure than the interim order.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides an essential protection to ensure that an order can have a retrospective impact, can provide protection for a dependent wife, can act as a disincentive to a recalcitrant husband if he is the main income earner concealing his earnings and can act as a disincentive to a recalcitrant husband who allows his family to live in poor circumstances by deliberately delaying the hearing of a judicial separation action because as each week passes he is gaining financially by paying a lesser sum by way of support <Col N="1469" /> payments.  In that context I hope the Minister reconsiders his approach in seeking to have section 19 set aside.  If the Minister is willing to allow section 19 to remain in the Bill it might be possible for us not to have a division in the context of the proposals he has made.  I want the Minister to give us very clear assurances that not only will he allow section 19 to remain in the Bill but also to give us very clear assurances about the problems of a wife who is subject to assault and who needs an immediate interim barring order as opposed to the lesser protection that is provided by way of protection orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be quite brief.  On Committee Stage I said I did not see the reasoning behind the ministerial amendments on these issues, that is, deleting the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; and also provision for interim maintenance orders and substituting &ldquo;maintenance pending suit&rdquo;.  It is desirable to look at what we are trying to achieve here.  It could be agreed that we are trying to minimise the difficulties facing parties who are applying for a separation, difficulties which they face before a full separation order has been made dealing with the various areas allowed for in the Bill.  If the ministerial <Col N="1470" /> amendments are agreed to, we will be returning to the point where orders under the various Acts referred to in this Bill will be sought and they will be sought on the basis of the Acts as they stand at present.  There is no reference in these to interim orders.  Therefore we can assume that in order to obtain an order the spouses must go to something akin to a full hearing, despite the fact that proceedings need not be separately initiated. They can be initiated together with the application for an order for separation but the hearings, effectively, will be akin to a full hearing for each of these orders. Prior to such hearing, it would seem that if we are referring to custody orders, barring orders, or protection orders it requires that the routine will be followed before that hearing.  That includes the giving of notice to the other side and so on.  This defeats the whole purpose of these provisions in section 12, which is to shorten the delay involved when there is an urgent matter to be decided.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust is to follow the precedent of interim injunctions whereby it is without prejudice to the final hearing and final decision that an interim order is made, simply on the basis that the greater good is served by making an order on such basis.  That is very much applicable to the situation facing a couple who cannot decide, between themselves, on how to resolve, for instance, the question of the custody of the children or maintenance, before the final separation order is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have regard to what is attempted to be achieved.  I believe that he also is concerned that some spouses will face real difficulties. He refers to the possibility of a protection order already being there before a full barring order is made.  That is a solution that many spouses have felt to be absolutely inadequate.  A protection order does not in many cases protect the spouse and children when what is really required is a barring order.  That is an example of the difficulties faced by spouses who cannot obtain interim orders as under this Bill.  Would the Minister consider what he is trying to achieve?  Is he in agreement <Col N="1471" /> with the idea that some spouses need extra protection pending the final order being made?  If that is the case, how does he believe that it will be achieved under his amendments?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it will be achievable, simply because he maintains that we must keep to existing legislation and the existing legislation demands certain routine procedures to be followed before the granting of an order.  It demands that a hearing be carried out, which means hearing both sides necessarily.  I am not against both sides being heard but in an emergency sometimes that is not possible and certainly with an interim injunction it is understood that one side comes in on an urgent basis and says that an order is needed pending the final order.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter's reference to section 19 and retrospection.  It is quite important to be able to make up a shortfall in maintenance, particularly when the amount of money that is available has been deliberately clouded by one party or the other in the earlier part of the hearing.  Whatever way the amendments stand, we should have regard to that issue of retrospection on the full maintenance order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I misunderstood the net issue of what is being debated here, it is a question of whether these orders can or should be made without notice to the other spouse pending final hearing of the application.  If that is so, why can we not be more clear and specific about it?  The Minister seeks to delete the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo;.  Interim when used in injunction terms refers to an application which is made by one party without any notice to the other, in a case of extreme emergency.  If that is the parallel situation here &mdash; and it seems to be &mdash; the Minister deletes that word thereby, in effect, providing that notice must be given to the other spouse, albeit short notice perhaps, but notice must be given before the person would be barred from the house, before the protection, custody or access order would be given and so on.  Why do we have to be bogged down and why can <Col N="1472" /> we not have our legislation in a more simplified form, literally spelt out?</P>
      <P>What we ought to be providing is that in the ordinary way, when the application is issued for the judicial separation and certain matters cannot wait the final determination of that hearing, there should then be two categories of situations in which a spouse may make an application in the meantime.  If it is not urgent he or she gives, say, two, three or four days' notice to the other spouse and the matter comes before the court for determination.  One could visualise an emergency arising, an actual assault or threat thereof where one could not wait those few days, in which case an emergency order is obtained to bar the spouse, or protect, or give custody or whatever. Why do we not spell that out if that is what we are on about here, rather than have the legalistic complications following on the use of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; and all that that may or may not import? Would the Minister consider looking into this matter at a later stage of the Bill, in the other House or whatever, to see if the sensible thing, from a draftsmanship point of view, might not be simply to provide that it is open to either spouse to make an application, let us say, on three days' notice, while the main action is still pending, to provide for relief under one or other of these headings but that in an emergency an application can be made without any notice at all?  That would apply only for a very short period so that the other spouse could then come in and perhaps answer the application and give his or her side of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To leave it in the form in which the Minister's amendment would leave it at the end of the day, unless I am misreading it, would mean that it would not be possible to bring an emergency application under this Act, that some notice would be required, although the Bill does not even spell out what notice would be required, if one of these interim orders were to be sought pending suit.  At the very least, I would have thought it should prescribe the number of days' notice required to be given to the other party. <Col N="1473" /> It would be much better if this was all amplified and spelled out more clearly.</P>
    <P>With regard to retrospection, I had understood the Minister to say he thought that his amendment, No. 23, would be adequate to provide for retrospection, but perhaps I took him up wrongly.  I have looked at this rather closely, but I do not see how that amendment would provide for a retrospective order to be made at the final determination of the application.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 is a good amendment and is well amplified so far as it goes.  It provides that an interim maintenance order can be made covering the period from the date of the application to the date of the determination of the application by the court.  However, power is not given in that amendment under which the court at the hearing of the action could review and increase the amount of the interim order.  If one wanted to provide for that situation &mdash; and quite clearly it should be provided for &mdash; an additional section would be required to enable the court, if it was so minded, to increase the amount of the interim payments that had been made between the period the application was issued and the time it was eventually disposed of.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with ancillary orders. Under subsection (1) (a) power is given to the court to make the actual payments of maintenance.  Perhaps it could be argued that under that provision the court could take account of retrospection, for example, by ordering that for the first four to eight weeks of the payment the sum should be £200 a week to take account of the reduced figure that applied in the interim.  The sum could then be reduced after eight weeks to balance out the payments.  It is possible that the court has power to do that under section 14 (1) (a), but it would be safer to have a specific section giving the court that power.  I do not envisage that this would arise in a great number of cases but in the cases that it would arise, a separate section making it quite clear that the court had that power would not do any great harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the meaning of an interim application is not fully spelled out in the Bill.  The Minister's explanation is that the imposition of this fairly sweeping amendment of a vast array of existing legislation may possibly lead us into a situation where we cannot predict the effects of this wide ranging amendment on the legislation.  If one is to use the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo;, in this context the legislation should spell out specifically that an <i>ex-parte</i> application can be made.  The words &ldquo;interim application&rdquo; are used in the Planning Act, 1976.</P>

From my experience, there is a vast variation of treatment by judges of interim applications, whether they be in family law cases or in civil cases.  The evil which Deputy Shatter might seek to remedy is not adequately remedied, nor possibly not dealt with at all by this sweeping amendment of existing legislation.  It is better to have the certainty of existing law in practice, which this legislation will inherit if the Minister's amendment is accepted, rather than have the uncertainty which will result from the proposals in the Bill at present.</P>

      <P>I understood that the thrust of the Minister's remarks in promoting the amendment was to suggest there were grammatical problems and tidying up difficulties surrounding the section as it stands.  Having listened to Deputy Abbot's contribution I get the view there is something wrong in principle with the idea contained in section 12.  Fianna Fáil should get their act together.  If they are to come in here and <Col N="1476" /> dance us around in this willy-nilly way, at least they should come in with one voice and with one direction.  Amendment No. 23 does not settle the issue of whether the application for maintenance pending suit is on notice to the other party.  Even if we concede that &ldquo;interim&rdquo; means <i>&ldquo;ex-parte&rdquo;</i> and is designed to be a swift remedy, let it be so to deal with the interim period before the full hearing. The courts readily recognise that that is done in circumstances where it is proper to do so and where it understands that matters can be put right ultimately at the full hearing.  If sweeping facts are put out which colour the <i>ex parte</i> case, a court is capable of putting that right.  If Deputy Abbott's argument were to be pursued, there would be no process of interim application in any area, be it in planning, contract or whatever else on the civil side. It is a well established process.  I cannot understand Fianna Fáil's worry about the term &ldquo;interim&rdquo;, since it is a well-established concept.  Their worry is only with regard to maintenance, which they feel should be dealt with differently.  They have no difficulty about leaving other orders such as barring orders, custody orders and protection of the family home in section 12.</P>
      <P>The section provides that after an application for a decree of judicial separation has been issued, the court can make orders.  The fact that they are called interim orders does not make a damn bit of difference.  One could argue that it is repetitive.  Fianna Fáil are speaking with two voices.  The Minister said he was in agreement in principle with orders being made before the full action.  His worry is about what they should be called.  Deputy Abbott said that this is giving over to frivolous and scandalous applications and he would seem to be against the whole idea <i>ab initio.</i> Fianna Fáil's approach is that special provision should be made for maintenance through orders pending suit.  Why do we not have orders pending suit with regard to custody, orders pending suit with regard to the protection of the home and also barring orders pending suit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have not thought out their <Col N="1477" /> position clearly.  I suspect Deputy Shatter is correct in saying they are picking holes in the legislation.  The Bill has been well drafted using and borrowing from existing terminologies which are well understood. It is drafted to deal with the practicalities of the operation of the law as it stands.  The Minister talked about a barring order and suggested that the issue of a protection order is adequate.  It is not an adequate defence.  He made the point that custody and the protection of the family home are provided for under separate legislation, but we are trying to bring under one Act a scheme available to litigants who are seeking judicial separation which will avoid a multiplicity of proceedings.  The Minister is suggesting that because these remedies exist under other Acts, the parties can issue separate proceedings.  We are attempting to provide for a unified process where ancillary orders would cover a whole range of remedies in the interim until the final determinations are made.</P>

      <P>The inclusion of the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) is technically incorrect.  Worse still, its inclusion could be misleading.  The present law is fully adequate on the matter.  Paragraph (a) as it stands will not protect a dependent spouse and children adequately.  My provision in amendment No. 23 concerning maintenance pending suit is more comprehensive and is a standard provision in other jurisdictions.  I had thought there would be no disagreement on this matter.  If I understood <Col N="1478" /> Deputy Shatter correctly, he made a proposal that if I agree not to move amendment No. 64 he will accept my amendments Nos. 16 to 21, inclusive, and amendment No. 23.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>If while a decree of judicial separation is in force either of the spouses dies the surviving spouse shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of the other spouse as a legal right or on intestacy.</P>
      <P>A spouse has substantial rights under our law to succeed to the estate of a deceased spouse whether or not a will is made.  The rights under the Succession Act, 1965, are the legal right to a one half share or one third share of the estate of the other spouse, depending on whether or not there are children, where a will is made and a two third's share or the full estate, depending again on whether or not there are children, where no will is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position following the granting of a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is that the spouse against whom the decree is granted automatically loses <Col N="1480" /> rights of succession to the other spouse's estate.  That spouse is necessarily one who has committed adultery or is guilty of cruelty or unnatural practices.  However, the person against whom a decree is granted following the enactment of this Bill will not necessarily be a &ldquo;guilty spouse&rdquo; or &ldquo;unworthy to succeed&rdquo; as is the case under the present law.</P>
    <P>The other important difference between the new and the old law will be that the court will, on the granting of a decree, have very wide powers to protect the financial position of the dependent spouse.  The court will be able to order transfers of property, settlements of property, lump sum payments, and secured maintenance in addition to maintenance or alimony, as it is called at present.  It is in that context that the question has to be dealt with as to what should be the position regarding the succession rights of both spouses after a decree is granted.</P>
    <P>There is no argument about the fact that the present law on succession rights in separation proceedings has to be amended in some way.  The problem is how best to tackle the matter.  No solution can be perfect.  The main considerations, therefore, are the financial needs of the dependent spouse and whether one or both spouses should or should not have succession rights following the judicial separation.  In my view, the Bill's approach in this matter is faulty and in certain respects may cause undue and unnecessary hardship for dependent spouses.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 (1) (g) and 16 of the Bill empower the court, after a decree of judicial separation has been granted, to extinguish or reduce the succession rights of a spouse if, at the same time, it makes a lump sum or property order in favour of that spouse.  Section 14 (4) is also relevant because it specifies that the court can on one occasion only make property or property settlement orders in favour of a dependent spouse following the granting of a decree.  There are a series of objections to those provisions.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Bill offers a choice to the court to make property or lump sum <Col N="1481" /> orders or, in the alternative, to leave the succession rights unaffected.  In other words, the court would have a discretion to refuse to make a property order or lump sum order even where there is property available for distribution on separation and instead to stake all on the basis that the wife, who will usually be the dependent spouse, would have a right to share in the husband's estate on his death.  That kind of provision is wrong in principle and if operated in that way could leave a wife in a most uncertain position.</P>
    <P>Not only would she have to hope that she outlives her husband but also that his estate is intact when he dies.  In either case there is no guarantee whatever that she would eventually benefit.  And even if she were to benefit on his death the chances are that it has come too late in life.  She should be able to live out her life with more certainty and security when it matters most and my amendments aim to achieve that.</P>
    <P>My second main objection is this. While the wife's succession rights may be extinguished or reduced, those of the husband would rarely be affected.  He would almost always retain the right to share in his deceased wife's estate.  Let me explain why under the Bill as it is now drafted that will happen.  Section 14 (1) (g) of the Bill provides that a court on granting a decree of judicial separation may make an order extinguishing or reducing the succession rights of either spouse.  However, section 16 puts a limit on that power.  It provides that the court shall only make an order extinguishing or reducing succession rights of a spouse if at the same time it makes a lump sum or property order in favour of that spouse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the husband will not normally have a lump sum or property order made in his favour, it would normally be only the wife's succession rights that will be affected.  This is the opposite to what happens now when a wife brings a successful application in separation proceedings.</P>
      <P>In extreme cases only may a spouse under the Bill lose succession rights where no lump sum or property order has been made, and that is in the case, provided for in section 16, where the spouse is guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct. Incidentally, the words &ldquo;gross matrimonial misconduct&rdquo; are not defined in the Bill and allegations of such behaviour would have to be pleaded by counsel and decided on by the court in each case. As a result of this provision, therefore, and contrary to the statements made by Deputy Shatter that under his Bill spouses would not have to make allegations against one another, wives would inevitably be encouraged to blacken the husband's character as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Yet another difficulty with the Bill is that if a husband, say, has little property at the time of the granting of a decree of separation and the court following consideration of the matter declines to make any property order in favour of the wife, the court is then precluded from making property orders at any time in the future even if at a subsequent date the husband comes into property.  This is because section 14 (4) provides that the court shall only on one occasion consider and determine whether it should make a property settlement or transfer order. This provision would place an undue restriction on the court and on the operation of the financial provisions in the Bill and is entirely unwarranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To recognise their full effect it is important to look at my amendments in context. My amendment No. 22 proposes <Col N="1483" /> that while a decree of judicial separation is in force neither spouse would have succession rights to the other's estate. However, subsection (2) (g) in amendment No. 49 provides that the court must, when making maintenance and property orders, take account of loss of succession rights.  This would effectively mean that when a separation decree is granted a dependent spouse would, if property is available, always gain maximum benefit at the time when she needs it most.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and others in opposing my amendments on Committee Stage laid great emphasis on the case where a husband, say, has no property or capital at the time of the granting of a decree but does acquire either or both of those at a later stage.  The argument they advanced in favour of the Bill was that the dependent wife would, on the death of her husband in that case, gain a measure of security.  What they have failed to acknowledge is that where circumstances have changed a spouse may seek a variation in maintenance from the court or indeed payment of a lump sum in lieu &mdash; she would not have to wait until the husband's death and it is absurd to imply otherwise.  Moreover, the court could secure the payment of maintenance on any property or capital sum in favour of the wife and that maintenance would continue to be payable even after the death of the husband.</P>
    <P>The other point, of course, is that my amendment No. 24 has no express restriction, as there is under the Bill, on the court making a property transfer order in favour of a wife at any time following a decree of separation &mdash; that is to say, an order be made in relation to property that is acquired on or after the separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Shatter and others went so far as to suggest that as a result of my amendment a wife would be left destitute when her husband dies. That is nothing more than scaremongering of the worst kind.  As I have already pointed out, a wife under my amendments would be able to go back to court at a future date to seek a variation <Col N="1484" /> upwards in a maintenance order or secured maintenance or if at a later stage the husband came into property to seek a property transfer order &mdash; something, as I have said, she might not be able to do under the Bill as it stands.  There would, therefore, be no question that under my amendments a wife could be left destitute. Indeed, it is the fear that that would be more likely to happen under the Bill than has motivated me to bring in this and certain other amendments.</P>
    <P>The emphasis which Deputy Shatter has placed on the need to make provision for a dependent wife in the event of the other spouse's death is difficult to reconcile with the plain fact that husbands can, and do so at present, settle or dissipate their assets in a way that ensures the other spouse will in effect be disinherited. This is one of the main reasons a properly drawn deed of separation provides for waiver of succession rights. What the dependent wife inevitably aims for are property and financial arrangements in lieu of rights of succession &mdash; rights that may be jeopardised or perhaps never materalise.  At the same time, she will, of course, ensure that any maintenance payable can be reviewed from time to time to take account of any change in circumstances.  Under this Bill, if it is amended as I propose, she will achieve that security.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill regarding succession rights would be an open invitation to litigate and so to incur unnecessary additional legal costs.  They depart fundamentally from the long standing fixed rules policy regarding inheritance that is enshrined in our succession law and would give rights of succession for the first time to a spouse whose conduct has resulted in a decree being granted.  Not only that, but the provisions of the Bill in regard to succession openly discriminate against wives in favour of husbands in that in most cases under the Bill the wife will lose her succession rights while the husband will retain his.  The result will be that wives with decrees of judicial separation will not be able to will their property on death as they see fit.  Furthermore, the provisions in the Bill are <Col N="1485" /> misleading.  While they provide that the court can preserve succession rights, both testate and intestate, the fact of the matter is that any order of the court preserving intestate succession rights, which to the wife are the most advantageous, can be set at nought the following day by the husband drawing up a will.</P>
    <P>In most cases we are talking about a possible one third share in the husband's estate as an alternative to ensuring that full and proper provision is made for the wife when she arguably needs it most. We require provisions in the Bill which are not objectionable and which are workable in practice.</P>
    <P>My amendments follow the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and of the previous Government in their statement of intention in 1986, which was published after the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown made their report.  I urge Deputies to give careful consideration to the wide differences of approach in the Bill as against my amendments and to appreciate the reasons for my concern which has resulted in the amendments now being put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If this issue was not so serious one would congratulate the Minister on the extraordinary piece of fiction he has just perpetrated on the House. This is an issue I take very seriously and it is the kernel of the Bill.  Last night the House limited the help this Bill can provide in the area of marital breakdown. It will also have the impact of ensuring that much of the acrimony the legal system exacerbates in marriage breakdown will remain when this Bill is enacted.  Nevertheless, the changes made to the Bill last night, although of a fundamental nature, still result in the law being improved if it remains within its current framework.  What the Minister has now brought before the House I regard as such a fundamental attack on the intent and framework of the Bill as to raise serious issues as to whether, if the Minister is successful with his amendment, the Bill should continue its passage <Col N="1486" /> in the House.  The Minister is now proposing a direct attack on dependent wives, battered wives and deserted wives if they dare to use our court system to seek protection when their marriages break down.  The Minister's proposal is unprecedented in the context of any of our pre-existing law.  This Bill was designed to bring our family law out of the 18th century and &mdash; possibly optimistically &mdash; into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal in the area of inheritance rights is designed to bring us back to the 12th century.  What he seeks to include in the Bill now could so fundamentally distort the operation of this legislation as to bring about a result that, rather than providing help and assistance to dependent spouses, dependent husbands or wives, battered spouses, battered husbands or wives or deserted husbands and wives, it could be seen as mean legislation designed to cause them the maximum difficulties in their future lives.</P>
      <P>I want to explain why I say this. Because the issue is technical and difficult and because the Minister has made a number of misleading statements, it is necessary to clarify the current legal position and the impact of the Minister's proposal. The current legal position is that since 1870, when the High Court inherited a jurisdiction exercised by the ecclesiastical courts of the Church of Ireland for many centuries previously, the law in this country has been that you can get a decree of judicial separation, or divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> as it is known, if you can prove your spouse to be guilty of cruelty, adultery or unnatural practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, if a battered wife goes to court and looks for a separation decree and the court finds that her husband is guilty of cruelty, the effect is that the husband who is guilty of cruelty automatically loses his inheritance rights to his wife's estate.  That is expressly provided for under section 120 (2) of the Succession Act, 1965.  However, the battered wife who gets the court separation decree retains her inheritance rights.  The battered wife who needs the protection <Col N="1487" /> and help of the court to effect a separation is not deprived, even under our current anachronistic laws, of her entitlement to some share of her husband's estate in the event of his death.  If he dies without making a will and if there are no children, she will get all her husband's estate.  If he dies without making a will and there are children she gets two-thirds of her husband's estate.  If he dies having made a will which leaves nothing to his wife and there are no children she will get half his estate and if he dies making a will leaving nothing to his wife and there are children, she will get the minimum of one third of his estate.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now proposing that a wife who goes into our courts and gets a separation decree &mdash; on the Minister's grounds &mdash; on proof of adultery, desertion or unreasonable behaviour, which is the equivalent ground to the current ground of cruelty, will automatically lose her inheritance rights.  We are not talking about the deserting spouse, the wife batterer or the husband batterer, we are not talking about the spouse who is engaging in an ongoing adulterous relationship, losing his or her inheritance rights, we are talking about the innocent spouse.  It would mean that the battered wife and the wife who discovers that her husband has been having an affair for years of which she was unaware will be automatically disinherited.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not confuse the issue by talking about the fact that under the Bill and under his amendments the courts, nevertheless, will be able to make a variety of different court orders in respect of maintenance or property transfer orders or lump sum payment orders. Under the Bill as originally drafted, the courts are given all those powers and the Minister is not conferring anything new on them in the context of those powers. This Bill, based on the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, provides extensive powers to the courts to make property transfer orders, lump sum payment orders, secured maintenance payment <Col N="1488" /> orders and ordinary maintenance payment orders for the protection of dependent spouses who in most instances will be wives who depend on their husband's earnings to maintain a reasonable standard of living for themselves and their children.  The Minister is not offering anything new, but under the existing Bill the battered wife, the deserted wife and the wife whose husband is committing adultry will not automatically lose their inheritance rights.  Under the existing Bill the wife whose marriage has broken down in such circumstances may retain her inheritance rights.  Under the existing Bill the courts can make a property transfer order, a secured maintenance payment order and an ordinary maintenance payment order, if necessary, and still provide that the wife will retain her inheritance rights.  The only provison in the Bill as regards inheritance rights confers a discretion in circumstances in which a wife has been given proper, long term financial security which will fully, properly and adequately meet her needs.  It confers a discretion, and only a discretion, on the courts to bring inheritance rights to an end.  That is designed in such a way as to extend to a wife who wishes to seek it the maximum possible security for the future, during the lifetime of her husband, without having to worry as to whether he may or may not leave her something by will.  That is only a discretion. Where the husband is wealthy the courts will be in a position to provide for property to be transferred to the wife, to provide for maintenance and to provide that the wife will retain her inheritance rights where it is proper that they are so provided.</P>
    <P>Let there be no illusions about what the Minister is proposing.  He is proposing that every wife who goes into court and gets a separation decree will be disinherited whether or not the court makes a lump sum payment order or a property transfer order.  That is the net effect of what the Minister is saying.  He is not saying to the courts that a wife can only be disinherited if a property transfer order or a maintenance lump sum order is made.  He is saying that by virtue of <Col N="1489" /> granting a separation decree they will automatically disinherit the battered wife or the battered husband who seeks that decree regardless of whether they are in a position to provide any financial compensation for the benefit of that wife, or husband if he happens to be the dependant which is unusual, but it happens on occasions.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the impact of this.  The Minister has said that if the wife is disinherited and if there is no property that the court can give her at the time of the court proceedings, she can come along, maybe two years, ten years or 20 years later, and ask for a property transfer order to be made if the husband acquires property.  That brings us back to what other Deputies very ably referred to, and what I think could be summed up as the schizophrenic approach of Fianna Fáil in the context of this Bill.  On the one side there are people with one point of view and on the opposite side there are people with diametrically opposite views.  The Minister is saying that if the wife is automatically disinherited, even though she gets no property and no lump sum, and if the husband acquires property at a later stage she can claim it.  In the same breath the Minister told us that the wife's inheritance rights are not worth very much anyway because the husband can always enter into arrangements whereby there is nothing for the wife to inherit. Where the couple have gone to war in the courts and a separation decree has been granted, which is what the amendments which were introduced into this Bill last night will not only require but will make compulsory in a large number of cases of marriage breakdown, where the husband realises that as a result of that decree of separation his wife is being disinherited, can the Minister imagine that husband purchasing property in future years without taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that his wife could not at a later stage go into court and make a claim?  Would that property, in the case of a husband committing adultery, not be purchased in the name of the woman whom he is living with?</P>
    <P>If it was the wife who was the wealthy <Col N="1490" /> person and was acquiring property, would she not acquire the property, if she was committing adultery, in the name of the man she was living with?  In that way there would be no possibility of the wife who had lost her inheritance rights going to court, making a claim and getting a property transfer order.  Is the Minister not encouraging couples in those circumstances, following the granting of a separation decree, to ensure that no matter what business they run or what property they acquire they set up elaborate trust arrangements and buy properties in the names of other people or possibly have them hidden in companies that are incorporated in the Isle of Man, Jersey or the Cayman Islands so that there will be no possibility of suggesting ownership of property?  Is the Minister not encouraging people, as was mentioned in the context of other aspects of this Bill &mdash; on occasion criticism arises from his colleagues &mdash; to spend elaborate amounts of money to get expert legal advice to conceal the true nature of their assets?</P>
    <P>I have tabled an amendment, and the Minister has tabled a similar amendment, which contains a provision to ensure that pending the hearing of judicial separation proceedings people will not try to conceal or dispose of their assets before property transfer orders have been made.  You cannot enact legislation that ensures that any property that an estranged spouse may purchase for the remainder of his or her life after a separation decree has been granted will be put into their name and will not be held in trusts or concealed or purchased in the names of other people.</P>
    <P>Let us not mince words about this.  Let us be very clear about what is now being proposed.  The Minister is saying that the wife who, under existing law, could go into the courts and get a separation decree on the grounds of adultery and cruelty and retain her inheritance rights, will as a result of the amendment which he is now proposing, be disinherited with no guarantee of any financial protection whatsoever being made available to her. It is correct to say that under the Bill and under the Minister's amendments, in <Col N="1491" /> determining what financial orders should be made the courts will have to look at the overall financial circumstances and property ownerships of the couple.  The Minister's amendment, in disinheriting the wife, gives no guarantee that she will be given future security.  The Minister made a great play in talking about legal certainty.  There will be only one legal certainty which is that every dependent wife who gets a separation decree will be told that she will be disinherited.  If she goes to court she will be told by her lawyers that they cannot guarantee that she will get a property transfer order or a lump sum payment order but they can guarantee that she will be disinherited. They can also give her the guarantee that unless she has sufficient financial backing through her own work, through family help or from the State, if her husband dies before her she will be left destitute. That is an extraordinary amendment for anyone to propose to legislation that this House is considering towards the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his address on this amendment referred to the Law Reform Commission and their recommendations. I reiterate that the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission as regards reforming the law on judicial separation were examined in minute detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown and in a number of respects were rejected because they were perceived by members of that committee either as being out of touch with the reality of the social problems of marriage breakdown or as not providing adequate and sufficient protection for dependent wives.  It was not unusual for the Law Reform Commission, as it was previously constituted and as opposed to the current commission whose members have a more realistic view of some of the problems involved in the marriage breakdown area, to have their reports in areas of marriage and family law rejected.  That commission proposed that we should retain within our law the action of criminal conversation rather than abolish it.  It was the Minister's Government <Col N="1492" /> in 1981 who very sensibly rejected that recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in the area of inheritance rights was considered by the joint Oireachtas committee.  I will quote from page 51 of the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  That report stated what is the current law and then went on to deal with the issue of inheritance rights, having previously referred to the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. I quote:</P>
    <P>The Committee feels that the courts should be empowered to vary or discharge a spouse's rights of succession following the grant of a decree of Judicial Separation having regard to the circumstances of the parties, in the context of determining what orders, if any, should be made for the division or transfer of property between spouses.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Oireachtas Joint Committee said that in determining whether inheritance rights should be varied the court should only do it looking at the overall financial circumstances. The Joint Committee did not say, and were very clear and careful not to say, that they endorsed the approach of the Law Reform Commission, because that approach is leaving battered wives, deserted wives and spouses whose marital partners are committing adultery with the Hobson's choice of going to court to seek the court's protection by getting a judicial separation and some of the orders which are available such as barring orders and maintenance orders, with the possibility of being disinherited and in their later life left destitute, or remaining living in the family home and ignoring the fact that they are being battered or their spouses deserted them or are committing adultery, to ensure that in their later life there is no possibility of their being left destitute.  That is an extraordinary choice to present to any wife or any dependent husband who is locked into marital breakdown and marital conflict.</P>
    <P>The provision contained in the Bill as <Col N="1493" /> currently drafted deals very carefully with inheritance rights.  Firstly, it reflects the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that, generally speaking, a spouse should retain her inheritance rights when getting a separation decree unless other adequate financial protections are provided to guarantee the future security of that spouse.  The Bill in the relevant sections lays down a whole series of criteria that the courts must have regard to.  Section 17 in particular lists a whole variety of matters the courts must pay very careful regard to in determining what property orders could or should be made and in determining the issue of inheritance rights.  It is very clear from the Bill that where no property orders or lump sum orders can be made a wife will retain her inheritance rights.  It is equally clear that, where a husband's financial circumstances are such that it is reasonable for property orders to be made but still reasonable that a wife retain her inheritance rights, she will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It was anticipated that the objection would be made to this Bill that purely on the basis of making financial or property orders and providing for future security, and only on that basis, inheritance rights could be lost; it would be extremely inequitable because under the current law the person who is guilty of cruelty and battering his wife automatically loses his inheritance rights when a separation decree is granted.  Therefore, an extra leg was put on to that provision which allows the courts to provide that where someone has been guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct that person can be disinherited without the courts having to make property orders or lump sum payment orders. It was envisaged clearly under the current legal system where someone is found guilty of cruelty and a decree of separation is granted because that person has been seriously assaulting his or her spouse or engaging in other appalling behaviour that comes within the definition of mental cruelty, that the person who is guilty of such behaviour loses his or her inheritance rights.  The concept <Col N="1494" /> of matrimonial misconduct was used to extend to the courts the possibility of excluding from inheritance rights someone who is unworthy to succeed or to inherit.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, more often the wife is the victim rather than the husband.  It is unfortunate that there ever has to be a victim, but more often in the familial area the wife, not the husband, is the victim, though on occasions the husband is the victim.  Let us look at it from the perspective of the wife making the application. It is quite clear that the wife who gets a separation decree can, in circumstances where husbands are currently disinherited, bring about that result without having herself in effect disinherited and cut off from an inheritance entitlement. I find it quite extraordinary that we should come back to dealing with this invidious and dangerous amendment, having teased it out and discussed it on Committee Stage.  Again, I want to express my thanks to other Deputies and other parties in this House for their support on these issues.  Some of them more ably than I spelt out on Committee Stage why this proposal should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue said that no solution can be perfect in the context of providing a legal framework to deal with the problems of marriage breakdown. This is not merely an imperfect solution; it is an invidious and dangerous proposal which could in effect result in this legislation, rather than extending additional assistance, turning the legal clock back by a number of centuries.  As on Committee Stage, I urge the Minister to rethink what is now proposed.</P>
    <P>How many people have urged on him that this amendment will deprive battered and deserted wives of their inheritance rights?  How many people have made representations to him to deprive wives locked into that appalling family situation of their inheritance rights?  How many organisations concerned with marriage breakdown have been on to him making representations &mdash; we all receive representations about different aspects of legislation &mdash; saying that the battered wife or the deserted wife if she goes into <Col N="1495" /> court to get a separation decree should be disinherited?  Have any religious group reflecting any majority or minority grouping made any representations to him suggesting that the battered wife and the deserted wife should automatically be disinherited?  Have his own solicitors, who work in the law centres established to provide free legal assistance to people who have not the means to afford legal help when their marriages break down, been making representations to him in support of this provision, or have they been making representations opposed to this provision to his officials?</P>
    <P>It is a most extraordinary measure.  All the amendments we have had to deal with on this Bill, even in the context of what we dealt with last night, pale into insignificance under the extraordinary impact this provision could have on current law and on undermining the fundamental philosophy behind this Bill, which is designed to help people, not to penalise them, if they seek and require court assistance in dealing with their marriage problems.  It is worth spending time on this because of the fundamental impact this provision and the amendments could have.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked about the need for certainty.  We had the spurious suggestion that even the wife who is disinherited and left with no property and no financial capital could years later come to court and look for a property order. The Minister made that comment, but later he talked about the need for legal certainty.  Surely a good law dealing with the problems of marital breakdown should provide mechanisms to enable husbands and wives to sort out their lives for the future without having to be engaged in an ongoing matrimonial war of legal attrition through our courts.  The format the Minister is suggesting is ludicrous. Property which does not exist at the date of court proceedings certainly will not be purchased by wealthy husbands subsequent to the court proceedings in the hope that their wives will come to court and look for a greater share.  Even if we take that possibility at <Col N="1496" /> face value and if we take also at face value the fact that under this Bill not just the wife can seek property transfer orders but that the husband can as well, the proposal the Minister is now making is a recipe for chaos in the lives of every husband and wife who use our court system to get a separation decree.  If there is going to be a facility to make ongoing repetitive applications for transfer orders, the wife who purchases a property ten years after her husband has deserted her will be subject to the husband coming to court, if he wants to engage in a matrimonial war of attrition, and asking the courts to transfer some ownership rights in the wife's house to him.  The husband who acquires property of any nature ten or 15 years later, who even involves himself in building up a successful business &mdash; and it might be in the interests of the wife that he does so because that might entitle her to additional maintenance &mdash; would know, as he built up the business, that it would be an ongoing target for the possibility of a court action, in circumstances where he and his wife separated not through any fault on either side but because they were simply incompatible. What deserted or separated spouse could build up any business in those circumstances?  Would they ever get a loan from any bank to build up a business, because of that property, for ever more, being open to attack in the context of a family law action?</P>
    <P>The scheme that the Minister is now proposing is a lawyer's goldmine, and I have heard this said on occasion on the other side of the House in circumstances which are not merely inappropriate but which are designed to be implicitly insulting to lawyers on this side of the House. It will mean that no couple who are parties to a marriage that has collapsed will ever be able to say that they have finally come to the end of legal controversy.  No couple will be able to say that at last the litigation is at an end because the courts have made decisions about financial arrangements and property in the future and they can now both get on with their lives.  Each spouse will for ever more be <Col N="1497" /> liable not simply to having maintenance reviewed, as it should be in changed financial circumstances, but to ongoing applications about property, if what the Minister is saying is taken seriously and if the Minister's intent is serious.  Of course, the reality is that arrangements will be made to ensure that property is held in ownerships other than those identifiable as being vested in the spouse.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister, in so far as he is prepared to listen, and listen with any degree of credibility to anything that is being said from this side of the House on this Bill, to seriously reconsider the formula he is now proposing.  I would urge him to withdraw it and to do so in the context of us at least being seen in this House not to be engaging in some sort of political pointscoring exercise with the casualties of broken marriages being the pawns caught in the middle.  In the context of an assumption that what we are all about here is trying to improve the legal framework that is available to provide help and assistance to couples whose marriages collapse.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw this amendment. I would ask him to consider very seriously the great harm that this amendment will do and to very seriously consider, particularly in the context of women, the great danger this amendment poses.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is saying in effect is that judicial separation action in future will become an action that can be availed of, in a sense, by the wealthy only, because the only wife who will be able to go to court with any degree of equanimity to get a decree will be the one who knows her husband is so wealthy that it is inevitable some type of property order will be made in her favour, even though she will not be able to predict exactly in advance as to the nature of the order.  The majority of battered and deserted wives will look at this provision and regard it as erecting a legal barrier to them obtaining the assistance that the law should fully and properly provide for them in a humane and compassionate society.</P>
    <P>I want to nail another fallacy on this. The Minister referred to this briefly, as <Col N="1498" /> did his colleagues.  I refer to separation agreements.  For people who are not familiar with separation agreements, a couple whose marriage has broken down and who can work out future financial and property arrangements between them without having to get involved in conflict and court contests may conclude a separation agreement.  That agreement records the fact that they are going to live apart, and would normally set out in some detail future arrangements about custody and access to children and about property, who is to live in the home, who is to move out of it and how much maintenance a wife is to get, etc.</P>
    <P>The point has been made, in the context of the Minister's approach, although he did not make it as explicitly today as we heard it on Committee Stage, that in practically all separation agreements husbands and wives waive inheritance rights.  That is simply not true.  The perception that that is the case could only be a perception derived from people who have very little experience of dealing with the large number of couples whose marriages have collapsed.  On occasions it is true.  In some separation agreements husbands and wives waive inheritance rights.  A wife will normally only be advised to waive her inheritance rights if, within the context of the separation agreement, there is adequate provision made for her future financial security.  She might waive her inheritance rights, for example, where the family home is being transferred from her husband's name into her sole name and there is also a guarantee that there is some life insurance policy in existence that, upon the husband's death, would ensure that she gets a large lump sum payment to provide for the future.  In a large number of separation agreements where there is only a limited amount of property, a family home in joint names that has fairly limited value, say, £40,000 with a mortgage of £30,000, the separation agreement might contain a provision which requires the husband to pay the mortgage and maintenance payments.  That husband's total capital wealth might be £10,000.  In those circumstances it is quite normal and usual <Col N="1499" /> for a wife to retain her inheritance rights. In those circumstances, too, that wife who goes to court will lose her inheritance rights and there will be little capital value that the courts would be able to transfer to her.  It is worth taking that example because that is what happens in the financial and property background of the typical couple whose marriage collapses. There is one home there; there is a large mortgage on it; it has a small capital value and there is little the wife can get in practical terms in return for a waiver of inheritance rights, so she retains her inheritance rights.</P>
    <P>From my own experience in over 15 years I would say that in about 70 per cent of deeds of separation concluded there is no waiver of inheritance rights. In about 30 per cent there is.  Inheritance rights are only waived where there is adequate provision.  If there are lawyers the Minister knows of who are advising wives in such circumstances to waive inheritance rights, all I can say is God help the wives who are doing it in the context of the nature of the legal advice they are getting.  It is important to pin that.  It is a reality.  The Minister should go and talk to the lawyers in the law centres who are dealing on a daily basis with couples who do not have the financial means to get legal advice when their marriages collapse.  The Minister should ask them, before we have to have a vote on this, rather than his officials in the Department of Justice who have a theoretical but not a practical knowledge of what happens on the ground.  The Minister has talked about certainty, and in correspondence that he got his Departmental Secretary to initiate through the columns of the <i>The Irish Times</i> we have had paraded before us the spectacle of the deserting husband&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the spectacle of the deserting husband who 20 years after he had disappeared emerges from the twilight to claim inheritance rights.  We have the provisions in the Succession Act paraded before us on the basis that the current law provides a great deal of certainty in this area and ensures that a deserted wife can leave property by will without the deserting husband making a claim to it.  I should like to nail that. If Deputy Andrews, and other Deputies across the floor, have any practical experience in this area of this happening I would be interested in hearing of it. There is a specific provision in the Succession Act, 1965 which says that where a <Col N="1502" /> spouse has been guilty of desertion which has continued for two years or more up to the death of a deceased spouse that spouse shall be precluded from inheriting. It has been suggested that this has resulted in many deserted wives being able to leave their property by will without fear of claim being made by deserting husbands but that is untrue.  There have been hardly any cases before our courts since 1965 when this provision was enacted which have been successful and resulted in a spouse in desertion being excluded for inheritance entitlement.  I challenge Deputies opposite to produce the many judgments they believe have been handed down on this issue.</P>
      <P>There is a reason why this section in practice does not work.  If a wife who believes she has been deserted dies and makes a will leaving property to, for example, her children, and if the spouse whom she believes was in desertion makes a Succession Act claim, who is to determine what happened in that marriage? If the spouse alleged to be in desertion goes to court and says that 20 years ago the marriage was a disaster and they agreed to live apart, separated by agreement &mdash; they did not go to see lawyers or conclude any legal arrangement &mdash; and there was no question of desertion, in most instances nobody could provide evidence to the contrary.  The children might have been four or five years of age and 20 years later they could not give evidence as to the circumstances that gave rise to the collapse of the personal relationship between their mother and their father.  If the husband who is truly in desertion learns that his wife is ill and moves back into the family home for some months before she dies, the continuous period of two years referred to in the 1965 Act no longer applies and a Succession Act claim can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very interesting to contrast the many judgments, now in the region of 100 written decisions, delivered by our courts under section 117 of the Succession Act, 1965 where claims were made to shares in an estate by children who had not been provided for, with the lack of such written judgments and decisions by <Col N="1503" /> our courts in proceedings brought by the surviving relations of a deserted wife trying to prove that a surviving husband was in desertion and excluded from inheritance by virtue of the provisions in section 120 of the Succession Act.  The reality is that the current protection provided for the estate of deserted wives under existing law is notional.  It is like so much in Irish law, it is theoretically a protection but it is a protection that in reality has very little effect or provides very little real help.</P>
    <P>The benefit of section 16 is that a wife who has been deserted can use the provision that allows a court to make orders to reduce succession rights.  That can be used by a wife to bring a degree of certainty to her position that is not available to her under the current law.  She can allege that her husband has been guilty of matrimonial misconduct by virtue of his desertion and as a result should be disinherited.  It has been suggested that currently there is a protection that in some way is being taken away but the reality is that the Bill provides a real protection as opposed to the notional protection that exists under current law.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that even that notional protection remains in force, there is a provision in the Bill to retain it for a minimum period of five years.  Any wife who is deserted will have time, if she wishes to exclude her husband from inheritance, to seek a separation decree by establishing that he is in desertion.  As I have only one opportunity to make a contribution on this issue I felt it important to try to clarify all the problems that arise in the area of inheritance in response to the Minister.  At the end of the day, cutting through all the technicalities and the different approaches to the making of financial and property orders, we are left with the Minister's naked proposal which I do not believe could have support from any person outside the House other than members of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

I urge the Minister to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I do not agree with the Minister's amendment, No. 22.  The Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, requires the court to make some allocation before reducing or extinguishing succession rights unless there is a case of gross matrimonial misconduct.  Unfortunately, the Minister's amendment is without compromise and does not allow an opportunity for a court to exercise its own discretion.  It requires that the separated spouse be precluded from sharing in the estate of the other spouse if a decree of judicial separation is in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have some sympathy for that amendment if alongside it some effort was made to allow the court some discretion. The Bill, as drafted, allows the court some discretion and reasonably so. There is no way at this vantage point we can decide that there will be no cases in which it would be justified that a spouse should retain succession rights.  I believe there will be cases where succession rights should not be extinguished.  The difficulty I see arising from the Minister's amendment &mdash; and this will be the position in the majority of cases of judicial separation orders &mdash; is that the sole property remaining will be the family home. If the Minister's amendment is included in the Bill we will have the situation where &mdash; because there is no legal right to succeed &mdash; the spouse, and particularly the wife, who retains custody of children will be forced to have a property order made concerning the family home.  That in itself will have a knock-on effect of perhaps causing that family home to be sold.  As Deputy Shatter has pointed out, <Col N="1505" /> in most cases the amount of capital that will arise from the sale will be negligible, certainly will not improve the position of either spouse and will be severely detrimental to the spouse who retains custody of the children because the family home is presumably an inherent part of maintaining a family together.</P>
    <P>There is no reason we should have a finite and definite bar to succeed without taking into account other circumstances. On an earlier amendment the Minister spoke of certainty and the fact that he wished to include certainty in the provisions of this Bill.  In the next breath, on the following amendment, he referred to the fact that he was allowing for spouses to return to court where there has been an accumulation of property on the part of the other spouse.  In his amendment he is allowing for spouses to apply further to the court to vary the orders pertaining to property.  I see that as a backward step. It will remove the element of certainty that drives most couples into separating. Many couples who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage and who are contemplating separation will tell you that the very reason they are separating is because they want to end the uncertainty. They want to get some kind of peace into their lives and to remove the tension.  The one thing that will prevent them doing that is if they have to face the fact that for the rest of their lives they will possibly have to defend cases in court, taken by the other spouse, if their financial circumstances vary to that extent.</P>
    <P>There are many cases of separated wives who have gone into business on their own or who have taken up some kind of occupation which has allowed them an independence.  Are we now to face the situation where the husband who has separated &mdash; and whose marriage is now the subject of a judicial separation order under the Bill &mdash; may return to court every couple of years, every five years, or whatever, and demand a share in that property?  That is wholly against the idea of what people want when they separate.  They want to end the relationship and to have the property that is to be settled on decided at that time and <Col N="1506" /> they want to know what their succession rights are.  They do not necessarily want to extinguish those succession rights for the other spouse even in the worst of circumstances.  That is not necessarily something that each spouse wants.  There may be a great deal of acrimony leading up to a separation but it may stop short of denying the other spouse succession rights because there are certain orders made relating to property, maintenance or custody.  It is detrimental to the thrust of this Bill to insist, as the Minister is doing, that if there is a decree of judicial separation there should be no legal right to inherit.</P>
    <P>There is no such effect on spouses who enter into a separation agreement, there is no requirement that that be the case. If there is to be certainty in our law I cannot understand why the Minister should decide that in the case of decrees of judicial separation there should be one law and in the case where couples agree to separate and enter into a deed of separation, that should not be the case.  What is the Minister saying is the desirable situation?  I agree with a point made by Deputy Shatter, that not every separation deed entered into has a clause in it that extinguishes succession rights; certainly many of them do, but there are many that do not.  It is part of the standard separation deed but it is not always agreed to and, therefore, it is one of the variables.  What is the situation that the Minister wishes to have?  Is he saying that it is only right that those who separate should not share in the inheritance rights of their spouse in the future or is he saying that the situation regarding the separation deeds should prevail?  The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party have not thought this through and have come forward with an unfortunate amendment which, if it had some degree of judicial discretion, I would have been willing to consider because I can see the reasoning behind the amendment to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about spouses being disinherited by the dissipation of assets over a number of years.  That is and has been a problem over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" /> As I said on Committee Stage, I do not believe there is an ideal solution to that. It is not the answer to go to the other extreme, to disinherit completely, spouses who are separating, whether or not there is a property settlement, bearing in mind that the vast majority of couples who separate do not have effectively disposable property.</P>
    <P>Many spouses who separate may be in local authority accommodation where there is no question of property, where there are no assets.  What then is to be the position of the spouse who retains the tenancy?  Is he or she not to retain any rights to succession in the future?  That is a retrograde step and it is not in line with the movement in this legislation towards achieving some kind of evenhandedness as between the parties.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister if he would consider some change in this amendment which would allow some judicial discretion because, as it stands, it is going to the other extreme.  It is not addressing the main problem he complains about and will make for further difficulties in the future.</P>

      <P>From listening to some of the contributions one would think that the bulk of cases of judicial separation that arise are those involving vast sums of money with millions being salted away in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda and elsewhere.  In actual fact the overwhelming bulk of cases concern little or no property and the problems are not those of tracing assets or coming back again.  There are very different kinds of real problems where, for example, a court will order that a house be transferred into the wife's name and there may be difficulty in getting the consent of the county council to transfer a mortgage or there may be a difficulty in getting the consent of the Irish Permanent Building Society to transfer the mortgage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting in context the overwhelming bulk of the difficulties that <Col N="1508" /> can arise.  Those that involve very substantial sums of money always had ways of organising their affairs even before this Bill.  They could always get their judicial separations.  They never had a problem. If you had money up to now you could get a separation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 1, 2, 20, 21, 26, 30, 33 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 11 (ii) of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> refers to the market-oriented and technological development of indigenous manufacturing industry with particular reference to the expansion and growth of selected Irish companies firmly rooted in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This objective is being promoted through a more selective approach on the <Col N="1510" /> part of the State agencies involved in industrial development.  Moreover, the appointment of Ministers with specific responsibility for trade and marketing and science and technology is designed to focus more clearly the national effort in strengthening industry's capabilities in these areas.  At present, the principal instrument at the level of the individual firm for furthering the objective is the company development programme, operated by IDA in close association with CTT and EOLAS.</P>
    <P>Following publication of the White Paper on Industrial Policy in July 1984 the company development programme became an integral part of the IDA's operations in 1985.  Under the programme the IDA and the other agencies work with firms as a catalyst to draw up strategic development plans which are designed to lead to substantial growth in terms of output and jobs.</P>
    <P>Selection for participation in the programme is a joint process between the company and the State agencies and is based on the company's potential for substantial growth and a willingness to make a significant commitment to the success of the programme.</P>
    <P>By end 1987, 200 companies, of which three-quarters are Irish-owned, had undertaken formal company development programmes.  Up to 40 companies normally participate in the programme at any one time.  For reasons of commercial confidentiality, the identity and details of participating companies are released only when the development plan comes to fruition. Participating firms range across all manufacturing sectors.  The natural resources area predominates but there is a good representation by companies in electronics, engineering and consumer products.</P>
    <P>All companies receiving assistance from the State are treated equally.  The level of time and resources devoted to any one firm is related specifically to that firm's needs and potential.</P>
    <P>With effect from this year the IDA have made extensive changes to their priorities and structure to meet the <Col N="1511" /> employment objectives set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> A completely new Irish industry directorate has been set up to bring a more creative and specialist approach to the challenge of securing more investment, exports and jobs from mainstream Irish industry. Within the directorate a separate division has been established to focus exclusively on the company development programme.</P>
    <P>The IDA's 1988 annual employment survey is being compiled at present.  The results will point to the progress being achieved by the company development programme and other measures to enhance industrial development.</P>
    <P>Regular progress reports on the work of the CDP are provided to my Department. The programme was considered in some detail in the context of the review of industrial performance 1986 and will be considered again by my Department when a similar review takes place in 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows quite well from his previous experience as <Col N="1514" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce that there is not the exact detail he is seeking available in regard to the sectoral jobs.  I appreciate his reason for tabling such a question.  I will give the total of jobs created when replying to later questions. The Deputy knows as well as I do that such detail is not available and, if it were, I would be the first to supply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are doing here is asking questions about 200 firms which had been specifically selected by the IDA on the direction of the Government. What I would like to know is how many jobs have been created and how many jobs have been lost in those firms?  Are more people employed now in those firms than there were when the programme was initiated?  That is a very simple and legitimate question to ask which even the Minister in his present preoccupied state might find it in his heart to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; because the Deputy knows as well as I do that that kind of information is not available and is never tabulated in the form he outlined in his question.  Secondly, the question to which the Deputy is trying to get an answer does not appear on the Order Paper.  The Deputy is asking how many jobs have been created and how many have been lost but no such questions to that effect appear on the Order Paper. The Deputy in his question asks if I would give any indication of its impact on the source of new job creation but as the Deputy is aware in a three year company development plan the results will not become apparent for a number of years afterwards.  An overall assessment was carried out under the review of the industrial performance and this will be repeated in the same exercise next year. That is when the information will become available.  The Deputy knows this better than I do.</P>

An audit is carried out on the technological base of the company and the capabilities of the company of moving towards a higher technological base.  This audit is carried out by EOLAS.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 15 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> specifies as an objective of policy for the manufacturing and international services sectors the creation of 20,000 extra jobs on average per year over the next ten years, the actual provision accelerating as the programme's policies take effect. In relation to job losses, the programme says clearly that the offsetting trend in job losses in these sectors cannot be foreseen accurately.  I am confident that the major improvement in the overall business climate and the specific policy initiatives being taken under the programme to further the development of the indigenous industrial sector will be such as to make existing jobs more secure.</P>
      <P>Statements in relation to job creation developments under the programme relate to performance against the targets set under the programme.  The Labour Force Survey for mid April 1988 showed no decrease in manufacturing employment compared with the corresponding figure for 1987 while an increase of 10,000 jobs was recorded in services.  Pending the completion of the IDA's 1988 employment survey, there are no figures available on job losses in individual manufacturing sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the only relevant and meaningful figure is the one for the net increase in employment in any given sector and that to attempt to use the figure for the gross increase while not taking into account the figure for job losses is misleading to use a polite word?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme stated quite clearly that it was not possible to <Col N="1519" /> estimate accurately how many job losses there would be but let me give the Deputy the up to date figures so as to provide the full picture and so that he can make an overall judgment.  On the basis of the surveys which had been carried out, the position is, up until September of this year, that 12,500 jobs had been created by the IDA; 1,958 in the SFADCo territories and 485 in the Gaeltacht territories, giving a total of 14,950.  Let me also refer the Deputy to the figure for notified redundancies to the Department of Labour in the manufacturing sector which totalled 7,738.  Therefore, it is quite clear that the rate of closures and job losses has been stabilised and that there has been a net increase.  All of the surveys show this trend quite clearly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. FitzGerald Mr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the only jobs lost are through redundancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that when the IDA publish the results of the annual survey the Deputy will get the full picture.  I have given the Deputy the total number of new jobs created at 14,950 and I have also given him the figure for the number of redundancies in the manufacturing sector as notified to the Department of Labour.  I can only give the statistics and figures which are available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that the Minister is not suggesting that that is the figure for total job losses which I believe is much higher?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This trend is very clear from the surveys.  I am talking about jobs in the manufacturing sector and I have <Col N="1520" /> given the number of redundancies in that sector.  We can clearly see what the position is.  There has been a net increase which is in contrast with the position we had to deal with over the last number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My final point is that the fall in unemployment began in 1985 and the decline in unemployment is due to the policies of the previous Government.  We have been in the process of restabilisation and growth in employment since 1985, not, as the Minister would seem to be suggesting, since 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister turn his attention to Question No. 4 on today's Order Paper?  Would he agree that the Government set targets for agencies in regard to the number of new jobs to be created only, while ignoring the number of jobs lost, with the result that agencies such as the IDA and SFADCo devote a disproportionate amount of their time to the problems of new and expanding firms and little or no time to firms where the task is to maintain existing jobs rather than to create jobs?  If the Government were to change their targets and set them in terms of net job increases in particular sectors to take account of both job losses and job gains, would the Minister agree that this would lead to a more balanced work practice by the agencies concerned?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to the Deputy's question.  What the Deputy is really asking is this: will you set targets for job losses?  The aim of this Government is to set targets to increase net employment and not to set targets for job losses.  The Deputy and everybody in this House know full well that jobs were lost in this country over a number of years because of the uncompetitive position of the Irish economy. That is an established fact of life and nobody will deny it.  It is also an established fact of life that, since this economy was pulled together, since inflation has been brought down to under 2 per cent &mdash; and incidentally inflation across the water is two-and-a-half times greater than it is here and rising &mdash; and since inflation rates have come down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there are five percentage points between here and the UK and since the Government, various Ministers and I took firm decisions to push down industrial costs, jobs have been saved.  That is why we now have stabilisation in the economy and are beginning to move in an upward trend. That is the reality of the situation.  I have no intention of setting job loss targets because my target is to make sure that there are no job losses if at all possible.</P>

    <P>As the Authority are responsible for the day-to-day implementation of industrial policy it was felt that they would be in the best position to determine the most appropriate sites for disposal on a national basis and to decide whether such disposals should be carried out by way of public auction, public tender or private treaty in individual cases.  I understand that the majority of sales to date have, in fact, been by way of auction or public tender.  Since January of this year the authority have disposed of 27 sites &mdash; 816 acres &mdash; and two factories which have raised a total of £2.4 million.  Additional revenues will be raised between now and <Col N="1525" /> year end on the basis of further property sales which have not yet been finalised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, regulations to give effect to the provisions of Council Directive 85/577 relating to the protections of consumers in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises are at an advanced stage of drafting.  Draft regulations will be circulated to interested parties shortly and I would hope to be in a position to make them by early 1989. The regulations will, <i>inter alia,</i> allow consumers who enter into contracts of this nature a &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; period of not less than seven days in which to consider their <Col N="1530" /> position and to cancel the contract if they wish.</P>
    <P>I have recently received a notification from the EC Commission under Article 169 of the EC Treaty relating to the non-implementation of the Directive and I propose to notify the Commission shortly of my proposals in this regard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a survey conducted on behalf of the European Commission's Consumer Services Division which showed that consumers in the Irish Republic pay up to 20 per cent more for groceries and up to 70 per cent more for soft drinks than consumers in Northern Ireland; if he intends to hold any investigations into the reasons for this price disparity; if he intends to take any action to have prices in the Republic reduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the survey of cross-Border prices, commissioned by DG XI of the EC Commission and undertaken by the Consumers Association of Ireland in association with the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland, was published on Thursday, 6 October 1988.  The findings of the survey showed that, based on a comparison of median prices, substantial price differences existed in favour <Col N="1531" /> of the North in almost all product categories surveyed.  However, further analysis of the results showed that, with reference to actual prices, in two out of every three products surveyed the lowest price here was less than the highest in the North.  By shopping around here, consumers may find that the cost of goods varies very little from the cost in the North.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that in January of this year I published a report from the Restrictive Practices Commission, now Fair Trade Commission, on alleged differences in retail grocery prices between here and the UK, including particularly Northern Ireland.  This report found that most of the price differences were accounted for by differences in taxes, movements in currency rates and by monetary compensatory amounts which are known as MCAs on certain products. When these factors are excluded, the differences were comparatively small &mdash; generally from less than 2 per cent to about 6 per cent.  I do not believe that a further investigation is warranted at this time.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in unnecessary intervention in the marketplace and I have no intention of re-introducing comprehensive price control.</P>

      <P>I have already told the House about all the surveys that we have carried out.  If you want to pick one particular product from a range of supermarket prices and compare it with elsewhere you will always find a differential. Even in supermarkets belonging to the same group you will find different prices obtaining in different towns throughout the country.  We must have our survey on an across the board basis, comparing like with like, not just picking one particular item, as the Deputy suggests, and trying to base a whole conclusion on that.  That is not what we do.  We are constantly keeping the question of distortion of prices under review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that much of the disparity occurs in the area of what is called the short price, which is the price without any duties added?  Even manufactures within this country are able to sell out of the factory before the item reaches the retailer at a lower price in the North of Ireland than that at which they are supplying into the market here.  Would the Minister agree that there is a need to look at this area before we look at disparity between taxes, which we all accept there is?  The area being missed is the short price one and there is a big problem there.  There are many manufacturers coming into Ireland and leaving goods within this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We must look into every aspect.  If you take a loss leader price in any given place and compare it with the normal price somewhere else you will find a differential.  Advertising is being used to very good effect to try to confuse the consumer as to where the best value lies.  The huge distortion about which we hear as between North and South in reality does not exist when you compare like with like across the same range of products and do not take one product and a different one elsewhere.  If you take the same product over a given period and make sure that you are including loss leaders in one place and in another, you will make a satisfactory comparison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Unless you compare like with like, you will not get the true result.  As I have said, there is a differential.  I have listened to Deputy Cullen's comments, but I wish to say it is part of our continuing monitoring of information in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if there was any connection between the decision of the IDA to close down the National Software Centre and the fact that one of the first trading houses to receive a licence from his Department is operating in the software centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 11, 27 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a question in this House on 31 May 1988, the decision to close the National Software Centre was taken by the Industrial Development Authority.  I am informed that 11 people <Col N="1535" /> were employed in the centre prior to its closure.</P>
    <P>I have already discussed in this House the reasons for the closure of the centre. I refer Deputies to cols. 636 to 639, vol. 381 of the Official Report for 31 May 1988 but I would like to add that there was no connection between the IDA's decision to close the centre and the issue of licences to trading houses.</P>
    <P>Since the closure of the centre, the various State industrial development agencies, in providing a wide range of supports for software companies to assist in their growth and development, have, for the greater part, maintained the activities of the centre.  These supports were tailored to address all the principal needs of software firms in terms of marketing, financial resources and consultancy services.</P>
    <P>Two areas where, perhaps, the activities of the centre were not specifically substituted for by the services of the industrial development agencies were in the direct selling of software on behalf of firms and in undertaking international research contracts for overseas customers.</P>
    <P>In one of these areas &mdash; namely, the selling of software from firms within the sector &mdash; the licensing of the first trading house under the Government's trading house initiative may well serve to offer opportunities for increased exports of Irish software.  I am not aware of what other ways private sector interests may currently be involved in providing any other services.</P>
    <P>Finally, my views on the actual and potential value to Ireland of the software sector are already well documented.  This was further underlined by my announcement yesterday at the launch of the study of the sector by the Information and Computing Services Association that I intend to appoint a committee to devise a strategy for the development of the software sector.  The strategy will aim to develop a framework within which the sector can maximise output and employment and compete effectively in international markets.  It will also take account <Col N="1536" /> of the likely developments for and within the sector arising from the Single European Market in 1992.  The committee will consist of representatives from industry, including the software sector itself, from the main industrial promotion agencies which have a continuing involvement with the sector and from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Its brief will be to complete the preparation of the strategy within three months.</P>
    <P>I had in fact, in consultation with the industry, been holding back my plans for the appointment of a committee until I received this report because I had always considered that the report would be an important input to the formulation of a strategy for the sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that his decision to appoint a committee to prepare a strategy for the software centre is an indication that the IDA decision, taken with his knowledge and support, to do away with the pre-existing National Software Centre was in fact a mistake?  With regard to the direct selling of software, would he further indicate that it is the case that we have a private trading house taking over at least one of the functions formerly performed by the National Software Centre?  Could the Minister say definitely that there is no connection between those two events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>None whatsoever, I am surprised the Deputy is being so facetious as to suggest such a thing.  The Deputy knows that selling software is only part of the centre's function and that the other activities are not being carried out by any trading house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I remind the Deputy that when the National Software Centre was set up &mdash; the Deputy should remember things of the past before starting to talk about them &mdash; it was set up with a target of self-sufficiency.  By no means was that target achievable in 1987.  It was a subsidiary of the IDA and the former Minister knows full well that the IDA cannot keep an insolvent company in place, unless it decides to put in more money. The future of the centre was clearly in <Col N="1537" /> doubt when the former Minister was leaving the Department and I am surprised that he has bothered to raise the issue here because like me he does not keep white elephants around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan in question is an interim development plan for all of the south east region.  It is a central feature of the work <Col N="1538" /> of the team set up to manage the pilot programme which I launched in July 1987 for the development of science and technology within the region.  The plan is also being prepared in anticipation of the approval by the European Commission of its projected new programme for the development of science and technology at regional level.  This programme is to be known as &ldquo;STRIDE&rdquo;.  In its present form the plan proposes an integrated strategy for technological development in the region, and outlines a number of projects.</P>
      <P>Copies of the interim plan have been circulated for consideration and comments to all local authorities, to chambers of commerce and to other interest groups in the region.  When the views of all those consulted are available, and any further necessary research has been undertaken I expect to receive the plan in final form.</P>
      <P>It would thus be premature at this stage to discuss the implementation in full of this plan.  As the Deputy may be aware, a number of the projects referred to in it are already at various stages of development and are being funded through my Department.</P>
      <P>Successful implementation of the more ambitious projects proposed in the plan would depend on adequate funding for them being forthcoming under the &ldquo;STRIDE&rdquo; programme when approved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that all the interested bodies in the south east have made umpteen submissions and that the result of most of this information is contained in the interim plan?  The south east has been designated for the pilot technology programme.  One of the main features of the recommendations of the plan is for the upgrading of regional colleges to at least NIHE or technological university level.  Does the Minister agree that this is a central pillar of the plan, but that if that does not turn out to be the case the possibilities of other things happening are limited?  What recommendations is the Minister making to Government on that specific issue?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is <Col N="1539" /> aware, we thought it appropriate that local authorities and chambers of commerce and other interest groups would have an input into the final plan which would then be put for my consideration. The plan has not yet been submitted to me in final form.  I hope to have the report in its final form by the end of February 1989.  As the Deputy is aware there are many exciting projects being proposed within the plan, which is now being considered by the local authorities, including the one referred to by the Deputy.  When the plan is submitted to me in its final form, we will then consider the implementation of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what is happening to the plan at present? Second, the Minister has failed to answer my question with regard to upgrading regional technical colleges to NIHE or technological university level.  What is the position with regard to the decentralisation of the Department to the south east and to Waterford specifically which has been promised for so long?  Is it not the position that it has been postponed again though decentralisation is going ahead in far smaller regions?  Would the Minister outline what he is doing to have his end of the plan implemented?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the second part of Deputy Cullen's question first.  If the Deputy had put down an appropriate question with regard to decentralisation to the appropriate Minister, I have no doubt it would have been answered.  Since he has not done so I have no intention of answering.  If he puts down a question, I have no doubt it will be answered.  A number of very exciting programmes are already underway which will be continued.  We have appointed industrial liaison officers in the regional colleges at Waterford and Carlow.  Since they took up their positions a number of co-operative agreements between the colleges and local authorities have been signed.  Technology audits are currently in hand in several firms in the region and to date some ten firms in the region have <Col N="1540" /> been subsidised by the Sertec programme to have technology audits carried out.  We have a business information technology centre located in Carlow Regional Technical College and this is designed to serve both as an incubation centre and as a focus for information and other services for small firms and start-ups.  These projects have already been placed there.  We have a strawberry demonstration project which involved mechanising an existing technique for growing strawberries and the machine is based at the Teagasc Clonroche station in County Wexford.  It is being used on the farms of local growers for demonstration purposes and thereafter it will be a commercial service available to strawberry growers in the locality. We have a newsletter called <i>Sertec Update</i> which will be published every two months and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 16, 19, 29, 34, 36, 49 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In announcements of industrial projects the jobs mentioned in each case refer to posts which the companies expect to fill as their projects develop.  Where <Col N="1543" /> some of the jobs connected with a new project or expansion have been filled prior to the announcement, a reference to this fact is made in the announcement in so far as this is possible.  This policy will continue in the case of future announcements.</P>
    <P>In the past year I have made eight announcements of packages of industrial projects.  In such cases I distinguished, where appropriate, between jobs already filled and those remaining to be filled. The total jobs announced were 5,840, of which 1,385 were clearly announced as having been already filled.  In the case of wide-ranging announcements on small industry projects it is sometimes impractical to indicate accurately where jobs are filled on a firm-by-firm basis and this gave rise to the report referred to in the question by Deputy Barnes.  The last package of international services projects which I announced on 15 November indicated in respect of each of the 38 projects involved the total number of jobs and the number already recruited,</P>

In one case the firm told the disappointed unemployed person that this announcement was five or six months old. Would the Minister agree that this kind of announcement by him brings the Industrial Development Authority and himself into poor repute and that it is important that he should only announce jobs which are genuinely new and not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of the Single European Market should create significant opportunities to attract new overseas companies to Ireland.  An important factor in the decision by many overseas firms, especially US firms, to locate here in the past has been the ease of access to EC markets.  There are, however, indications that we failed to secure certain industrial projects in the past, because of industrialists' fears that non-tariff barriers would be used to discourage exports to other EC countries should the projects locate here.  The removal of such barriers and national discriminatory practices must, therefore, make Ireland a more attractive proposition for US companies seeking to penetrate the EC market.  The completion of the internal market in 1992 will enhance Ireland's claim as a suitable location for overseas investment.  Significant opportunities will result from the <Col N="1547" /> standardisation of technical specifications which will lead to new opportunities in public procurement not at present available, due to restrictive trade practices; the removal of customs barriers and movement towards excise and VAT harmonisation which will make it easier to service all of Europe from an Irish base and the scale of the single market which will drive down operating costs and increase profit potential.</P>
    <P>Ireland already enjoys advantages over our competitors in attracting new projects to Europe to exploit the single market and in maintaining existing overseas investment in Ireland.  We have an abundance of people with skills which is becoming an increasingly rare commodity in Europe; a competitive cost base and consistently Europe's most profitable location for US investment; an economic environment which, as a result of the Government's policies, is performing better than our main competitors; an English speaking population; a competitive incentive package including support for international financial services projects; and excellent communications.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they have identified six countries outside the EC as their main target for overseas investment. These are the United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Sweden and Finland. The principal target sectors are electronics, pharmaceuticals and health care and financial services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many American industrialists &mdash; I met a number of them in recent months &mdash; are wrongly concerned that the Single European Market may become a protective market against products emanating from outside which may operate to the detriment of firms owned by non-European parents?  It is particularly important to put that misunderstanding right.  Is the Minister worried by the fact that the French authorities were able to stop Nissan cars being manufactured in Britain because it was alleged that they <Col N="1548" /> contained too much Japanese material? Is he worried that that principle might be extended and that American firms located here and importing raw materials from America could find the European market closed to them because of an extension of the decision by the French authorities to other areas?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in relation to the perspectives that many industrialists in the United States, Japan and other countries have in relation to the position after 1992.  I have continually pointed out in my visits to these countries &mdash; the IDA and CTT have done the same &mdash; the advantages of 1992 in so far as Ireland is concerned.  Certainly it is seen as &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; in many countries but there are 350 US companies here and it is clear, especially with the opening up of the public procurement policy, that there are significant opportunities available in pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications and the services area. Up to now in these areas national Governments in each EC member state were in favour of local producers.  When that changes and public procurement is opened, you are talking about an annual purchasing budget of £300 billion per annum which represents 15 per cent of the GDP of Europe.  That in itself, to an industrialist or businessman looking at opportunities in Europe, denotes that there must be opportunities there and that it is a question of where they should locate.  The population structure in Germany and many other European states has become totally unbalanced.  We have an advantage in having a skilled workforce and 1992 will certainly open up a range of opportunities for us because we have very few trade barriers.  We have been entering into free trade for the last 30 years or so.  In relation to the French Government, Japanese cars, certificates of origin and local content, undoubtedly the action to which the Deputy referred causes concern.  However, the Deputy will be aware, from his experience in the Department, that there is an on going policy in relation to dumping and changes in the basis for issuing certificates of <Col N="1549" /> origin in relation to the percentage of local production.  In regard to America, we want to see free trade as our economy depends on it.  We export almost two-thirds of what we produce and it is better, from our trading position, to have few barriers and open markets.</P>

      <P>I agree with the changes the Minister outlined in that companies who came to this country years ago will now come for different reasons.  With the perspective that other countries may have of what the market is doing, will the Minister agree that we should emphasise equality of cost, access and distribution for locating in this country?  The Minister recently made an announcement in relation to 300 jobs in Bausch and Lomb. The reason is that they can get a more highly skilled workforce here as opposed to other countries.  Have the IDA latched on to this development because it applies to many companies?  Is that consideration being used in the change of emphasis as to why companies should come here?. How successful has their policy been in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cullen in relation to Bausch and Lomb. The level of skills in the workforce is one of the major factors in selling this country.  Of course, there are other factors and that is why it is important to keep costs competitive.  Over the past 18 months we have been pushing that factor very strongly.  There are still areas in which we are out of line compared with our European competitors but we have to keep working at it.  We are seen as a country with low inflation and which can stand alone in relation to interest rates. The skills and numbers available is a very good package to sell around the world for 1992.  However, there are other negative indications in relation to the legislation in the United States.  In the world we live <Col N="1550" /> in we have to put the pluses and minuses together and get the best out of it.</P>

Are there any US or Japanese owned companies in Ireland using material imported from outside the EC who would be vulnerable to a decision similar to that taken by the French Government in the Nissan case?  Is he aware that one of the major endeavours of 1992 as indicated by the European Commission is to promote mergers between European companies and have a much smaller number of large European companies in particular sectors? In that context is he not fearful that some of the American companies here in Ireland may be too small in a European context to survive among the giants it is the purpose of industrial policy in Europe to create as large Euro companies?</P>

      <P>In regard to the PFICS legislation I spent a whole day in Washington doing political lobbying and got an admission from many of the senior politicians there that the repercussions in regard to Ireland were never intended or were not even noticed at the time the PFICS was introduced.  I spoke to the senior political leaders on both sides, Democrats and Republicans.  The result of my visit that day is that since then a group of politicians have issued a bill of intent to have the matter brought forward in relation to the 1989 Tax Bill which will be dealt with under the Ways and Means Committee.  I had meetings with the Chairman of that committee, with Senator Dole, Senator Kennedy and Congressmen Donnelly and Coyne.  On both sides people who did not realise the implications of this legislation when it was going through have committed themselves and published a Bill and they are going to tackle the matter in the 1989 legislation.</P>

      <P>We know the problems. Inquiries are continuing in the Commission about certificates of origin and amount of content.  We have seen anti-dumping levies brought in at various times.  I thought the Deputy might be referring to that.  We are taking up the concerns in Europe in relation to it.</P>
      <P>Regarding 1992 and post 1992, the view of many European countries is that companies will tend to go for larger slices of the market and move towards economy of scale, and that is possible.  On a recent trip to the US I spoke to representatives of some American firms here, and the reverse is going to take place according to some of the people I have met, in that they have pharmaceutical companies in other jurisdictions and other member states which they put there for one reason only, that they would be unable to get business from the national governments or the national buying agencies because of the way public procurement was locked up.  Their corporate plans and strategic forward planning suggest to them that when that changes, here is the place where the high skilled labour Deputy Cullen spoke about is available and here is the place to rationalise into, rather than the reverse, to rationalise out as some people might think.  It is an area we have to watch and we can always keep an eye on it.  I advise Irish business and Irish industry to look at partnerships, licensing arrangements and distribution arrangements and position themselves correctly in the marketplace so they know what they have to face up to in 1992.</P>

    <Title>Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987: Report Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 10, before line 1, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> .&mdash;If while a decree of judicial separation is in force either of the spouses dies the surviving spouse shall be precluded from taking any share in the estate of the other spouse as a legal right or on intestacy.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Justice.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the luncheon recess I was making the point that the overwhelming bulk of judicial separation cases that will arise would either involve no property at all or very limited property. The number of cases that would involve large amounts of assets and manipulations and companies to do down spouses and so on would be very few and far between.  It is invidious in a sense to pick out one classic example of a typical case, and that has been done by both Deputy Shatter and the Minister.  The range of possible cases that can arise in this regard is so various and vast that it is extremely difficult to encompass all the different possibilities that could arise. Everybody else has taken the liberty of quoting examples of one type of case, so I will indulge myself by quoting one type, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider the case of a family where the sole asset consists of a modest family home.  The husband is in an average type job earning £150 or £200 a week or whatever. The house is in his name alone, as many such are, and there is an appreciable mortgage due on the house.  If a family in that category come into a judicial separation position the question of a lump sum order would not and could not arise because the husband would not have the finanical resources to make a lump sum payment.  The question of a property order dealing with the family home might arise, but there could be great difficulties about it because the county council or the building society who have the loan on the house would not in all probability give their consent to the transfer of that house into the wife's name even if the court directed that that was to be done.  The judge is left with no alternative then but to give <Col N="1612" /> the decree for judicial separation without any property order and without any lump sum payment order.  Therefore, he makes the order and provides for maintenance of whatever the appropriate amount would be.  In this case, then, the wife would lose her succession rights.  Admittedly, the Minister's amendments incorporate provisions under which she could bring an application at a later date for a lump sum order or for a property transfer order, but that would not help either because nothing much would change over a five, ten or 15 year period.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the nub of the point I want to make about this, which is that the possible variations and permutations of cases that can arise on these applications is so vast that it is really impossible for practical purposes to encompass every type of case.  Therein lies the difficulty in the Minister's proposal.  I see the thinking behind his proposal.  It would be desirable that there should be a final break once and for all and that all financial matters would be taken account of at the point at which the final judicial separation order is made.  But the difficulty is that one cannot encompass all thd different kinds of cases in this.  That is why it is essential that the ultimate discretion in each case is left in the hands of the court.  One cannot provide for every case.  The judge will consider each case as it comes before him.  He will consider what property is there, what the sources of it were, what the incomes were, and then he will decide whether it is appropriate to do what the Minister says must be done &mdash; in other words, take away the succession rights and deal with the matter by a lump sum payment or by way of a property transfer order.  He may decide not to do that.</P>
    <P>The advantage of the Bill as drawn is that it leaves open both possibilities; it does not shut off any possibility that the court may consider appropriate when the time comes.  It is not a question of the Minister saying that the succession rights are taken away in all cases and the Bill saying the succession rights stay in all cases.  The Bill does not say that.  The Bill makes adequate provision and quite <Col N="1613" /> clearly envisages that in very many cases the succession rights will be taken away. The Bill provides for that specifically.  In many cases, by reason of the particular family circumstances, the court will make an order taking away the succession rights from that spouse and in many cases that would be the correct thing to do.  Provision entitling the court to do that is clearly given in the Bill.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is saying is different. He is removing that discretion from the court and providing that in every case in which a decree of judicial separation is made and is in force the legal and intestacy rights of the spouse are gone.  That is the difficulty.  It may well be right in some cases but it is not right in all cases. There could be other cases arising where that would be entirely the wrong thing to do, depending on the particular facts of a family and its property situation.  The alternatives that can arise are so various and complex that it must surely be safer to leave the issue within the powers of the court and not to over tie the hands of the court and so limit the court that it may not wish to take advantage of the opportunity of either taking away the succession rights and compensating by means of a lump sum payment or property order or not doing so.  Because the complexities that can arise it is essential that that be done.</P>
    <P>Many references have been made as to whether the practices in separation agreements provides for the taking away of these rights or not.  My own experience, which is not all that great in this area, is that in most separation agreements the parties mutually agree to renounce their rights under the Succession Act.  In this context the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown includes, in one of the appendices at the back what it calls typical separation agreement, and it is interesting to see that at clause 8 of this typical legal separation agreement the husband and wife mutually surrender and renounce their rights under the Succession Act.  Apparently, the joint committee did take the view that so far as separation agreements were concerned it was typical that there would <Col N="1614" /> be a mutual renunciation of rights under the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>I do not think the question of a separation agreement can be compared to the situation that arises when one comes before a court for a decree of judicial separation.  In the first instance, in the case of the agreement the parties have negotiated over a more prolonged period, they have had time with their advisers to discuss and assess their situations, present and future, and to put that clause in if they can consider it safe and appropriate to do so.  When the adversarial situation arises before a court on an application for a decree, different considerations apply.  I feel that one should leave open all options to the court to assess the situation based on the particular positions of the family concerned, its assets and the source of those assets, and not tie the hands of the court.  I accept to an appreciable extent the force of the Minister's argument.  There may well be very many cases where the succession rights will be removed and compensating orders made and the Bill itself provides for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be appropriate at this stage to restate what Deputy Shatter is proposing in these sections.  He wants to empower the court to vary and discharge the statutory succession rights, and the court can only do so if at the same time it makes a property transfer or settlement or lump sum order in favour of the spouse.  He went on to say that a court could, however be empowered to vary or discharge succession rights if the spouse was guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct.  He said that the court should only be able to consider the question of a transfer on one occasion.  That represents a radical change in our succession law.  It completely changes the relevant provision relating to desertion in the Succession Act, 1965, and in decrease <i>a mensa et thoro.</i> The present position is that following the granting of a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> the spouse against whom the decree is granted automatically <Col N="1615" /> loses rights to succession of the other spouse's estate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>No research has been done on whether or not all separation agreements contain a waiver of inheritance rights but it is the experience of virtually every legal practitioner I have met that the vast majority of deeds of separation include a waiver of inheritance rights.  That may not be the case with Deputy Shatter but it happens to be the case with most legal practitioners. Deputy Taylor has said so and it is my experience, and the experience of most legal practitioners I know.</P>
      <P>It should be pointed out that the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown contained what was said to be a typical separation agreement and it included a waiver of inheritance rights.  Should Deputy Shatter wish to see it, he can find it at Appendix D, paragrpah 8, of the report.  The evidence appears to be irrefutable that in most cases the position is as I have outlined. Deputy Shatter may advise differently in his capacity as a solicitor, and I am sure he is a very good one, but he must accept that he does not have, and cannot expect to have, a monopoly of wisdom on the issue.</P>
      <P>We are discussing whether or not a spouse should lose his or her inheritance rights on the making of a decree of judicial separation.  I am not going to be so arrogant as to suggest that I have the perfect answer to that, but on balance the experience has been that parties to a separation agreement have waived their succession rights.  That is not an easy area; it is a most complex and difficult one.  In my view, there is no perfect answer and all the House can do is suggest what it considers to be the best answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been acknowledged that certainty in the law is desirable whenever it can be achieved and legislators, from Montesquieu down, have acknowledged that certainty in the law is the most desirable option when faced with the choice <Col N="1616" /> of certainty or uncertainty.  In his amendment the Minister proposes that the court on issuing a decree of judicial separation would at that stage decide on how property should be transferred and what lump sums should be paid to the other spouse. He went on to say that in the event, for example, of a wife learning that her husband had obtained additional property, or had additional property at the date of the application, she could go to court to vary the transfer or payment of a lump sum.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter says that, if a husband was to come in to property at a later stage, a wife would not be able to get at that property because the husband may purchase it in the names of other people. That may be correct and, perhaps, a husband would purchase it in the names of other people; but the crucial point which Deputy Shatter has missed, or chosen to miss, is that the individual acquiring the property would have had to receive the moneys with which to purchase it from the separated spouse or the spouse who was trying to deprive the other of the assets.  Accordingly, I take the view that in that event it would be open to the spouse that does not have the property to apply for a variation or a review.</P>

      <P>There is no question that Deputy Shatter, when he said this morning that if a husband comes into property at a later stage a wife would not be able to get at that property because the husband may purchase it in the names of other people, failed to acknowledge that if it was the husband's assets which purchased the assets he was referring to the wife would have a remedy, according <Col N="1617" /> to the Minister's amendment, in relation to variation.

      <P>If one were to accept Deputy Shatter's argument &mdash; a logical case has been put against it now &mdash; the same argument would apply to his provisions. If, for example, a wife is granted a one-third share of a husband's estate, will he not do the same thing and ensure that there will be no estate against which his wife may claim when he dies?  The crucial issue is whether it is accepted that in the event of a wife's succession rights being retained, and the court saying that it would not transfer property or that it would not make a lump sum award in favour of the wife but that it would retain her succesion rights, the way is clearly open for a husband to dissipate the estate and leave nothing for his wife.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the House in the case of a judicial separation to ensure that the woman is protected in the best possible way that the House can and that the children of the union are protected in the best possible way.  The best possible way in which a court can protect a wife, and the children of a union, is by making a decision on the date of the separation as to how the property should or should not be disposed of, what should happen to the family home and what should happen to the moneys which the husband will have.  In that way, we have certainty and everybody knows where they stand after the judicial separation decree has been granted.</P>

I accept that.  I believe that is the position which is realistic: it is down to earth, it is practical and it makes common sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pose a question at this stage in relation to section 3 (1) (d) of the Bill, where it is provided that the parties to the marriage have lived separately and apart from each other for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the presentation of the application and the respondent consents to a decree of judicial separation being granted.  If two people want to separate and if there is a no fault provision <Col N="1619" /> in this Bill, then I contend it is right here in what the Minister has suggested and, indeed, in what Deputy Shatter has suggested, except that he wanted to add in the circumstances of irretrievable breakdown. Let us say that under this provision a wife and a husband decide to separate because there is a difficulty in the marriage which they do not want made public and which they want kept between themselves. This is an ordinary everyday occurrence which they do not want the people to know about.  The separation itself will not worry them but what does worry them is the fact that their private lives may be discussed in public and they decide to separate under this section of the Bill.  For the sake of argument let us say the husband then emigrates &mdash; there are children of the union &mdash; and about 20 years later the wife dies and the husband returns.  Under Deputy Shatter's Bill the husband can return even though he may well have been the one privately at fault for the breakdown of the marriage and he can claim a share in his wife's estate to the detriment of the children of the union.  The question I want to pose is this: is that in those circumstances morally fair?  Is it fair that a person who was responsible for the breakdown of the union could return many years later and claim a share in his wife's estate to the detriment of the children of the union?</P>

      <P>In this kind of a situation it becomes clear that the position is unfair.  It smacks of unfairness because a person who has caused the breakdown of the marriage is now entitled to come back many years later to the disadvantage of the children of the union.  Deputy Shatter goes a little further in relation to gross misconduct and he says that the courts would take that into account in relation to succession rights.  If we are going to speak in a court about gross misconduct we are now into the area of fault in a big way because one spouse will have to accuse the other spouse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of gross misconduct under the proposals in relation to inheritance in Deputy Shatter's Bill. Deputy Shatter stated at an earlier stage that what he was introducing was no fault judicial separation.  How can the Deputy speak about no fault judicial separation when at the very kernel of the issue, in relation to property there is a provision <Col N="1621" /> which asks whether or not there was gross misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view that in that kind of situation we have never gone deeper into the issue of fault.  There is no provision in any section of the Bill which introduces fault more into judicial separation law as proposed.  In my view there is an introduction of fault even where the parties separate by consent.  If the parties separate by consent after one year and if there is an argument about succession rights under the provisions as set out by Deputy Shatter, the court must not have regard just to the fact that the two people concerned separated by consent after one year of living apart; the court must now inquire as to whether there was gross misconduct on the part of the husband.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the areas where we have come closest and established that we can have no fault judicial separation, Deputy Shatter brings it in the back door by providing for gross misconduct in questions about inheritance or succession.  He cannot deny that because that is the position.  I do not believe that if people consent to part from one another, having lived separate and apart from one another for one year, they should have brought into their lives, by this provision the question of whether there was not just fault but gross misconduct.  Neither should this provision in relation to gross misconduct be introduced when the parties have been separated, not for one but for three years.  Section 3 (1) (e) provides that in an application for a decree of judicial separation to establish that a marriage has broken down irretrievably, which is now gone, an applicant must prove to the satisfaction of the court that the parties to the marriage have lived separate and apart for a continuous period of three years immediately preceding the presentation of the application. Therefore, parties who have lived <Col N="1622" /> separate and apart for three years, who certainly do not want the privacy of their marriage gone into in a courtroom under the provisions relating to succession in Deputy Shatter's Bill, will now have to have regard to whether one or other party was guilty of gross misconduct.  I repeat, not fault but gross misconduct, perhaps greater than fault &mdash;&ldquo;gross&rdquo; being the word implying it to be greater.  Where stands the no fault concept now?  Where now stands the Utopia for which I too would have wished &mdash; a no fault system when the Deputy attacks that system himself by introducing fault into the one provision in the Bill where there had been none?  I do not believe that argument stands up.  I do not believe fault should be introduced in a case where people have lived apart for three years.  Neither do I believe that fault should be introduced in circumstances in which parties have lived separate and apart for one year and agree to leave one another.  The Deputy has introduced fault into the inheritance and succession legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It now becomes apparent that Deputy Shatter, having attempted to introduce a no fault system of judicial separation, when it comes to dealing with the very sensitive issues of inheritance and succession, introduces the concept of gross misconduct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy Shatter is asking a court to decide in circumstances in which two people have agreed to leave one another.  I do not consider that the Deputy should come into this House or anywhere else and <Col N="1623" /> pretend that the legislation provides for a no fault system when he himself introduces the gravest of faults when the issue of succession or inheritance arises.  To say the least, it is unfair to the spouses concerned.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister's provisions, which, if you like, maintain the <i>status quo</i> in relation to inheritance and succession on issues of separation, provisions which obtain already in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, provisions which exist in the Succession Act, 1965, have withstood the test of time.  I will not pretend for a moment that they constitute an ideal solution, but certainly they are preferable to the uncertainty, ambiguous and fault-ridden provisions of the inheritance legislation Deputy Shatter would have the House pass.  I believe there would be dissipation of assets if a husband were allowed to hold on to his property if the wife's succession rights were maintained. That would be unfair to the wives of a broken marriage, indeed not just unfair to them but also to their children, who certainly were not at fault in the breakdown of the marriage.</P>
      <P>While certainty in the law is a good thing, undoubtedly we should take into account the fact that, following a breakdown of marriage, there is great emotional trauma.  By including a fault concept in the provisions of this Bill dealing with inheritance, as Deputy Shatter proposes, he is adding to the anguish, trauma&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent days and months, when we debated this Bill in Special Committee, I have tried to find some thread of thought running consistently through the minds of the Fianna <Col N="1624" /> Fáil Party in opposing the Bill in Committee and, now, in attempting to dismantle it systematically on Report Stage. I think I have at last found it &mdash; the great golden thread steering the illogical minds of our friends on the Fianna Fáil side of the House is this unbelievable principle of certainty: in the cause of certainty so much has to be sacrificed.  They are prepared to throw out the concept of irretrievable breakdown as constituting the sole ground, advocated unanimously by a Special Committee that sat and deliberated for two years, that received so many submissions and heard and conducted so many oral hearings &mdash; the cause of certainty dictates that it must be thrown aside because the Fianna Fáil Party contend we must keep the grounds clear, certain and restricted.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate here today other good and worthwhile provisions were cast out of this comprehensive Bill.  I have to say to Deputy O'Donoghue and the Fianna Fáil Party that, whatever de Montesquieu had to do with it, fairness, equity and protection of the vulnerable spouse in matrimonial law in Ireland is what should guide us in this legislation and to hell with certainty.</P>
      <P>Hypotheses have been proposed on both sides here with regard to what might happen <i>vis-à-vis</i> our legislation.  On the one hand we have the instance of the woman, absolutely in need of judicial separation, faced with the prospect of being disinherited entirely on the part of the promoters of the legislation.  The hypothesis advanced from the other side is the prospect of the blackguard who forces the position requiring judicial separation, emigrates somewhere and appears out of the clouds 20 years later to pick up all under the succession laws and ride off with his or her pockets full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to base our argument on hypotheses let us advance it somewhat further.  Let us ask each other, then: on balance where does the moral right lie that Deputy O'Donoghue so vehemently argues?  I contend it lies where the numerical argument wins.  I pose the question to those who propose this hypothetical argument: how many more <Col N="1625" /> women, battered, brutalised in a marital situation, will be forced out of the courts, away from legal remedy, because of what the Minister is doing here today by way of this amendment?  I contend we will then have the blackguards riding out of the clouds, picking up whatever is to be picked up and heading off again.  On the numerical side the Minister is doing far more damage by way of his proposal.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to introduce the ridiculous instances about which he has talked, then I ask him to tell me in now many cases practitioners &mdash; and there are sufficient of them on the Government side to invoke their practical experience here &mdash; have come across the recalcitrant spouse returning years later out of the blue saying: &ldquo;Give me what I am entitled to under the law and let me get on with my blackguarding way of life&rdquo;?  And do not let Deputies on the Government side look puzzlingly at me.  The fact of the matter is that this is a rare occurrence and if it occurs, well and good because what we are legislating for in this legislation is far more important and essential, the protection of vulnerable spouses in a marriage.  We should ensure that we encourage them in every way possible to avail of the remedies we are seeking to introduce in this legislation.  The approach of the Government is condemnable because of their intractable position.  They are seeking an absolute law.  Another adage that de Montesquieu penned is that absolute laws do not fit justice fairly.  We, as legislators, and as people who profess to have some concern have to sit down to try to devise a system which would in some way tackle the problems as we know them or profess to know them in Irish society today.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed in these sections of the Bill is, like in all other areas of the Bill, comprehensive.  It equally recognises that there will be cases best left to the courts to adjudicate on. To lay down absolute rules in this instance does not serve the cause of justice. It has been suggested here that what is proposed in the Bill amounts to a radical departure.  I say it is not.  I say it is couched in the principles of the 1963 Act <Col N="1626" /> and of the judicial precedents which have emanated since the implementation of the 1963 Act.  What we are doing here is borrowing on existing law and developing it in the best way we can as legislators.  To say that what we are trying to introduce amounts to a radical departure is misleading and it ill behoves a party so admirably represented by such a bevy of lawyers to say so.</P>
    <P>This Bill is based on the principles of the 1963 Act.  I listened to the Minister for Justice indicate here last week how revolutionary the 1963 Act was and how it has been recognised internationally. That legislation was introduced by the present Taoiseach who was then Minister for Justice.  It is on those principles that we are seeking to advance the entitlement of spouses under the law when marriages break down.  The Minister described that legislation as revolutionary for its time and maintained that it is respected across the world and that it has stood the test of time.  If that is so, let us take the principles of that legislation, develop and use them in this regard and allow the courts the opportunity to adjudicate.  To hell with the absolute rule in the cause of certainty. There is no place for it here.</P>
    <P>Let me borrow for a moment another one of the threads of so-called continuity which we have been told runs through the Government's approach to this legislation &mdash; that the provisions being promoted are more suited to a law on divorce.  If there ever was a provision best suited to a law on divorce it is the rule of absolute disentitlement to succession rights which the Minister is trying to introduce at this stage.  There is a provision that is best suited elsewhere and which should have no place in the legislation we are considering here today. Where in heaven's name are the Government going with this legislation?  I would like to dwell for a few moments on what has been said by them and on what they are doing in this regard.  We have to nail the Government firmly on this legislation and their so-called commitment to the law reform we heard so much about last week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> It is quite clear that what the Government are attempting to do is to protect the backwoods attitude that they so ably played to during the referendum campaign on the introduction of divorce.  One can imagine Deputy O'Donoghue on top of his ladder down in the depths of County Kerry outside the church on Sunday morning speaking to the smallholders whose wives are at home preparing the Sunday dinner and saying: &ldquo;remember men that it is certainty in the law we want.  We want you to hold on to the land, nothing will interfere with your grip on the land &mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what they are trying to do here.  That is the kind of backward, backwoods, top of the ladder, outside of the church on a Sunday morning remark that was made during the divorce campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not someone who looks back.  In fact, I continually try to press forward.  The message I have picked up from letters from women all over Ireland is that they have a fear of losing succession rights and of being disinherited. They fear that if they take legal action in order to get a legal solution to their problems in a very bad marriage, in which they are the victims, that they will with certainty be disinherited.  They fear that if they take legal action in order to get a legal solution to their problems in a very bad marriage, in which they are the victims, that they will with certainty be disinherited.  That is one threat which was used to frighten women during the divorce referendum campaign.  I do not refer to that issue lightly, I refer to it passionately.  One of the agonies is that we find ourselves here this afternoon, as we were on Committee Stage, being confronted with a proposal that would lead to the disinheritance of women. Regardless of what the outcome of the divorce referendum was, all sides of the House promised that legislation to protect the family and which women would feel comfortable with, would be introduced, legislation which would give them a status and a role and value them in a way which had never been done before. However, what all of us find in this legislation is the very nightmare which those women find most fearful.  It is the greatest injustice we could write into an Act and I do not understand the reason behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why we also continue to frighten women with the other monster which has been pacing the land recently &mdash; the threat of husbands who have grossly misconducted themselves in their marriage and who have deserted their wives, being allowed to come back after many years and make demands against a wife's will and take her inheritance. The present law deals with that situation.  Therefore, I believe the first concern which all of us should have in <Col N="1630" /> regard to legislation is that it is the very best, is flexible, gives as many choices as possible, that we do not write into it a rigidity which creates difficulties afterwards, particularly in emotional and traumatic situation &mdash; and Deputy O'Donoghue was correct in what he said about that &mdash; and, above all, that it should fulfil the expectations of thousands of spouses who expect from this Chamber and the Seanad legislation which will protect them and which will not disinherit them.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that, when we are talking about fault and dealing in as caring and as solid a way as possible with regard to marriage breakdown and the paramount importance of children's rights, the Minister and his colleagues should suggest that people should be on standby for the rest of their lives after a judicial separation to see if assets increase, thereby having to go into court once again.  I can tell the House when one is talking about land and property in Ireland that people will not fight it on a no fault basis.  I am reminded of what a certain farmer said sometime ago: That when it comes to land in Ireland a wife comes a poor second.</P>
    <P>That is what this legislation has to be about.  It has to be about giving protection to women who have none at present. Instead, this amendment would actually make the situation worse.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the implications of this legislation for women in desperate family situations who have been looking forward for so long to legislation which will strengthen their position and guarantee them security in a judicial separation. I believe this amendment will add to their disappointment and disillusionment in a way in which I do not like to think about. I certainly would not like to be involved in the enactment of any Bill which would do that.  We have promised to bring in legislation which will strengthen the position of these women but this amendment will do the opposite.  I wish to allow other people who are as outraged as I am to speak, but I want to say that it will be a bad day if this amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we are trying to put forward our argument as we see it.  Many people in this country have a problem in relation to succession rights and desertion and we are trying to put that argument forward.  We are trying to get the best solution for all people, including the people Deputy Barnes spoke about so eloquently.  This debate is degenerating and I would ask the Deputies on the other side of the House not to make the debate, as Deputy Andrews said yesterday, a case of the &ldquo;goodies and baddies&rdquo;.

      <Col N="1632" /> I am surprised at the attitude which has been adopted by the Fine Gael side in particular.  I have read their statement of intent and we on this side of the House are trying to do exactly what is stated in the Fine Gael <i>Statement of Government's Intention with Regard to Marriage, Separation and Divorce</i> which was published two years ago.  The statement says:</P>
    <P>Under existing law when a decree of judicial separation is given against a spouse that spouse loses succession rights.  At present also,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is for the information of Deputy Shatter who said that 70 per cent of separation agreements do not waive succession rights.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is common practice when couples enter into a formal separation agreement that each renounces his or her succession rights to the estate of the other.  Spouses will each lose succession rights to the other on divorce&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is the proposal that Fine Gael tried to bring in at that time.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the Court will have the obligation to make such orders as may be appropriate in the circumstances to ensure that the dependent spouse is adequately protected, and the legislation will be so framed to enable the court to take account of loss of succession rights arising from a divorce. The Court will be empowered to order that compensation be given where it is appropriate to do so.</P>

      <P>Many speakers have referred to the Succession Act, 1965, which to me and many more practitioners and the general public is one of the most enlightened pieces of legislation to come before the Dáil for many years.  I do not think that we will have better legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill as framed is trying to turn that upside down and I do not agree with that.  The Succession Act was a guarantee that people would have some certainty and finality in relation to their succession rights.  Under the Succession Act as it now stands anyone who <Col N="1634" /> neglects his or her duty does lose succession rights, but the problem now is that under Deputy Shatter's Bill this would be because of gross matrimonial misconduct.  This must be proved and, as Deputy O'Donoghue quite rightly pointed out, that brings a very divisive element into the whole issue of succession rights and of marital law.  He quite rightly points out that to say that the legislation as proposed originally does away with fault is misleading.</P>
      <P>Also, there is an aspect that worries me slightly in relation to the Family Home Protection Act of 1976.  As a legal practitioner I regard this as very badly drafted and hurried legislation.  However, the idea behind it was correct: to ensure that the family home could not be sold over the head of one of the spouses.  At the moment the spouse can sit tight in the knowledge that the house will not be sold over her head &mdash; in most cases it would be the female spouse who would be concerned. However, under the Bill as framed it is possible that the house could be sold over her head.  The Minister is trying to prevent that from happening, which is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Something which has not been addressed by the far side is that there is a distinct possibility that the Bill will encourage people to litigate.  It would encourage deserted spouses to apply to court for a judicial separation so as to ensure that the deserting husband, shall we say, will not later on claim his legal share under the Bill as framed.  If a deserted wife were to leave a will granting all the property to her children, the deserting spouse after her death could claim his legal share.  That is the problem that is not addressed in the Bill.  This would encourage certain spouses before they die to make sure that these legal rights are not claimed by the deserting husbands by applying for a judicial separation. That is not a valid reason for a judicial separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of succession rights <Col N="1635" /> is a very difficult one and it should be addressed properly.  Ultimately, as previous speakers have said, there must be certainty.  The certainty that was granted under the 1965 Act would be changed as a result of the passing of this section.  For that reason I would be against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few brief points on what we have been listening to this morning and afternoon. I feel that we have forgotten the main and principal purpose of this legislation.  My reading of it is that it is to provide an avenue down which people suffering from extreme marital difficulty could proceed in order to endeavour to sort out their problems.  I agree with the remarks of the previous speaker that what we are trying to do, and what our goal should be, is to provide the best solution for as many people as possible to avail of.  We are not doing that under the amendment as proffered by Fianna Fáil in this instance. We are ignoring the fact that over 50 per cent of our population are women and that many of these are in marriages that they cannot get out of by virtue of the law as it stands.  These people are waiting for us to present an answer and are going to be denied the remedy if this amendment is passed here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes as envisaged by amendment No. 22, with which we are dealing, are such as to get right to the heart of the Bill.  We are cutting out the kernel of it. If the Bill is ultimately enacted with the amendment from the Government, what would be the net worth of the legislation for those who are looking to us for a solution in the light of our discussions on this matter going back to the early eighties?  Is this the end remedy that we are going to provide for these people? Rather than providing remedies for those whose marriages may unfortunately have become difficult and unbearable, what we are doing with regard to the present amendment is that we are using the big stick on the women of Ireland who are in difficulty.  There will be a disincentive for them to go near the courts because it will be incumbent upon their legal advisers, <Col N="1636" /> and, indeed upon their social advisers, to tell them that if they go to court they are taking the ultimate of risks, that if they are successful in their application the risk is that they will be absolutely disinherited. The certainty spoken of by the Government side will give rise to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs as far as the legal practitioner is concerned and also the person suffering from marital difficulty.</P>
    <P>Society has ordained that the married woman is more often than not the dependant.  Rightly or wrongly, we can all have our views on that matter; but that is the reality.  We must protect the dependent spouse.  If we agree to the Minister's amendment we are not doing anything to protect her; we are using an approach that will give rise to extreme difficulty.  I do not want, in the few minutes available to me, to go back over arguments put forward in the course of referenda in the early and mid-eighties. However, I do recall property rights taking on a very fundamental importance in the course of that debate.  I recall the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil and that the Government of the day were castigated for advocating the scenario that the present Government are now advocating.  Where is the logic in that? Where is the continuity?</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we can be castigated for advocating disinheritance and this very amendment being brought forward by the Minister for Justice advocates the same.  We have heard so much about divorce type legislation from Deputy O'Donoghue, Deputy Ahern and other Deputies.  What the Minister is now advocating is as much part and parcel of divorce-type legislation as anything enacted in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, in the Bill we are dealing with a fundamental contradiction on the part of the Government. Over the past few minutes there has been a great deal of talk on the concept of fault, with some advocating no fault and other fault principles.  May I attract the Members' attention to the Government amendment dealing with the question of maintenance, amendment No. 18 (2) (k)? When people are talking about fault, let <Col N="1637" /> them read what the Government are putting forward.  Amendment No. 18 deals with the provision relating to maintenance, property and other orders. Paragraph (k) states:</P>
    <P>...the conduct of each of the spouses, if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it;</P>
    <P>Are we talking about fault in this case? I fail to see how that provision can be discussed without going into detail on the issue of fault.  It is not fair for one side of the House to engage in throwing comments about the concept of fault, blame or whatever when in fact it is contained in the provisions of a Government amendment.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion by Deputy Taylor and other speakers on deeds of separation.  It has been said that between 30 to 80 per cent of deeds of separation contain clauses where the parties voluntarily renounce their rights under the Succession Act.  I do not know whether this is true as I do not have statistics to that effect. However, the choice is available to either party when entering into such a deed to renounce such rights.  Under the provisions of the Minister's amendment that element of choice is gone simply because any party who is to be granted a decree of separation is automatically disinherited. That is the difference between a judicial approach and the approach by way of a voluntary deed and it is something which the Minister might consider.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Bill is being interferred with by this amendment.  It is unfortunate for the people who have looked to us to remedy the very many difficulties due to the unfortunate problem of marital breakdown.  Everybody accepts there is a problem, but I do not think that the passage of this amendment will help those unfortunate people in any way.  We are placing too great a weight on the shoulders of the applicant, to such an extent as to dissuade that person from issuing proceedings.  We are dissuading that person from seeking legal advice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> We are saying, to the women in particular, that they should put up or shut up but not seek a judicial separation because of the chances of being disinherited. This is unfortunate.  I do not think that this amendment was envisaged in any way by the members of the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Shatter in particular. This is interfering with the nub of the Bill and will have very grave consequences. I hope the Minister, in the few minutes remaining, would reconsider the entire amendment in view of its consequences on the legislation and, more importantly, for those seeking the remedy therein contained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>At present I do not intend to get involved in the succession debate, which has been well canvassed.  Regrettably, the debate has been very much concerned with abstract provisions and theoretical positions which are not greatly linked to the reality being put forward.</P>
      <P>I will examine the competing provisions in the Bill and in the amendment in the context of situations one is confronted with in the normal course of these unhappy family disputes.  Deputy Taylor investigated the position of the person with no great equity in their house, they have possibly a county council mortgage on their house and are heavily indebted and thus property is not an overriding consideration.  Under the Minister's amendment the court would make a property adjustment order in respect of the family home and if the wife was staying in the family home with the children she would be given overall ownership under an adjustment order.  That would be the reality in 90 per cent of situations. I am quite happy that that is the situation the general public would require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take another example in a more normal context, the farmer or small businessman in rural Ireland.  The businessman with the public house may well have a private house and I would imagine that the court would look to secure residence for the spouse, most likely the wife, in the family home and would make a property adjustment order <Col N="1639" /> in respect of the house.  But one finds that in many businesses there is a heavy element of debt encumbering the business, and in the case of a young married family, the business may be growing or depending on developing goodwill or on the flair of one or other of the spouses. If the court were to make a division of the property, under the provisions of the Bill, or order a sale of the property under what Deputy Shatter has referred to as the finality of the provisions of the Bill, then I think the court would be killing the goose that laid the golden egg for both parties to the dispute.</P>
    <P>I have found from my experience &mdash; and Deputy McCartan has appealed to this side of the House to look to their experience &mdash; when dealing with situations like that, whether in court or in negotiations outside, that when all the difficulties, the passion and the emotion is over, that both sides will eventually realise that it is in their interests that the little business would be kept going and that hopefully then the debt goes down and the business is built up very often by a husband who has a particular flair that there will be more maintenance for the wife and family.  That is the reality of many cases and this is particularly addressed by the Minister in the provision for the review of periodical payments. Anyone who would suggest that that is not a fair, reasonable and just way of approaching that problem is flying in the face of reality.</P>
    <P>I concede there is a great thirst for finality in litigation.  One of the most unfortunate aspects for legal practitioners and indeed the families engaged in the dispute is that there is of necessity a lack of finality.  It is one of the most sensitive areas of private life and of human relations between people, which of necessity do not admit to a final, neat solution.  This is the great dilemma of judges dealing with the case and of the lawyers advising the parties.</P>
    <P>It is a trifle naive of Deputy Shatter, as an experienced family practitioner and parliamentarian, to look at this stage for <Col N="1640" /> legislative provisions which would provide finality and certainty and get rid of the regrettable and unfortunate repetative applications which we have been used to.  If one accepts the general scheme of finality and certainty contained in the Bill's provisions, then the courts will have their own way of dealing with that finality and certainty by not making a final order, a final adjudication in relation to many of the facts, lest they close the door on the opportunities of litigants.  What Deputy Shatter looks to the finality will be the engine of confusion within the courts system as the judges' minds work out their own practical solutions to the straight jacket of this Bill. They will adjourn from court to court and from season to season decisions which if made would impose too much finality where people involved in business in developing situation look to the future, economically and in terms of their own relationship, for the solution of many of the problems they have as a family.  They may have differences in their marriage and emotional disagreements, but people do not lose their reason in relation to working out where their best economic and commercial interests lie.</P>
    <P>A lawyer might represent a wife in pretrial negotiations and advise that the best way to sort out the case it to split up the property by putting the whole thing up for sale and dividing the proceeds in some suitable proportion, usually vastly in favour of his client.  Negotiations can go on for days, weeks and months until eventually either the husband or wife decides that the solution to the problem is to change the equity in the property into cash.  In a moment of weakness I have seen spouses concede and tell the other spouse to sell out their business, which may be a pub which is struggling but has great potential.  It is decided to sell the business in a weak market, pay back the bank and split the £10,000 or £20,000 equity between the husband and wife.  All this is done for the sake of finality.  What does one find when this crisis is reached?  Very often the person who has sought this simple solution has <Col N="1641" /> been bluffing all along, as have the lawyers representing that person, and the negotiations take a turn back to reality. There will quickly be a meeting of minds because the bluff will be called.  The parties will suddenly realise that it is in both their interests to keep the business going and build up the trade.  The fact that family law proceedings are in train does not stop a husband or wife from doing their work and they will build up the trade in their own interest and the interest of the spouse with whom they have a dispute.  They know that the legal system as it is now constituted compels a spouse to pay maintenance and enforces it. There was a time when it was very difficult for a spouse entitled to maintenance to collect it.  That no longer obtains. There is a reasonable security for maintenance and the Minister's amendment provides even more provisions for the securing of maintenance and property. Very often in the heel of the hunt in these negotiations there is agreement that the business will continue and the dispute will be put in a holding situation, with the husband and wife agreeing not to cohabit, while one of the spouses runs the business and generates the income from which the maintenance is to be paid.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations.  A husband and wife might have worked for ten or 12 years building up a business.  They both see in that business the prospect of a future for their children in their own area rather than having to go to the city or town to get a job, not to mention the prospect of emigration to Britain, America or elsewhere.  That is a major consideration in edging away from the finality of the breakup of property.  It is not merely that a farmer would consider the farm first and the wife second, as Deputy Barnes so crudely put it.  It is a case of both husband and wife coming to the conclusion that in the little asset they have nutured for years lies their security for the future and they will work to protect it in spite of their differences, for their own sake and that of their children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter alleges that the amendments as proposed by the Minister would be a lawyer's goldmine in so far as they <Col N="1642" /> would give rise to more repetitive applications to the court.  I dispute that allegation.  I do not wish to get into hot controversy with Deputy Shatter or to invite any comment on it.  It is very much more in the lawyers' interest to have a property division followed by a sale out of court which would produce a lot of liquid cash on both sides, so that the lawyer can put in a bill which can be paid from the money obtained by the sale of the property.  The experience of lawyers in regard to payment in respect of maintenance suits and repetitive applications has not been so happy.  If I were to reflect the lawyers' preference, it would be for the property break up.  Contrary to allegations about the Minister's amendment being a goldmine for lawyers, Deputy Shatter's amendment will of necessity be very remunerative for lawyers, perhaps more than the Minister's.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about today is not what will remunerate lawyers more or less but legislation which is in the interest of spouses and their families and which will provide the requisite degree of loyalty. The Minister's provisions have enormous flexibility written into them.  At the same time we are talking about legislation which will provide for that flexibility without recourse to the type of witch-hunting which, belatedly, Deputy Shatter's Bill, in section 16, introduces in relation to the contest as to whether a husband or wife was guilty of a gross matrimonial offence.</P>
    <P>As someone who admires Deputy Shatter's fluency and volubility in relation to the production of this draft legislation, I am surprised that he did not define gross matrimonial misconduct in terms of the Bill.  When I first saw this provision in section 16, my immediate reaction was to turn to the back of the Bill &mdash; or to the middle, as sometimes definitions are inconveniently placed &mdash; to see if this term was defined.  One owes a great debt of gratitude to the Minister for pointing out that it is not defined and that it is a difficult definition, even having regard to any other code.  This deficiency in the Bill brings us to the evil to which I have <Col N="1643" /> already adverted, of leaving the legislative function to the courts.  The discretion which one would naturally leave to the courts does not extend as far as defining such a fundamental term and concept as &ldquo;gross matrimonial misconduct&rdquo; in the context of the Bill.  The basic requirement of a Bill is that lawyers with a modicum of legal attainment and training would be able to take up a Bill and advise clients where they stood without having to wait for two or three years before the courts would finalise the judicial interpretation of a particular provision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the emergence of a judicial interpretation of gross matrimonial misconduct, one would have to wait a considerably longer period because it relates to matters dealing with succession. When one deals with succession, one finds that the real disputes and the hotly argued cases will not arise for a considerable period because it ultimately depends on the dispute arising after the death of one or other of the spouses.  In the natural course of things, one would find it would take many years after the passing of this legislation to have enough cases in the courts to have this phrase defined with any degree of exactitude. There are further instances dealing with better off people with which I have not dealt already.  One could refer to them as the people who had paid off a very substantial degree of their mortgage, had two cars and led a happy and reasonably well off suburban existence.  There are many circumstances in which worries might be raised by the comments of the Opposition in relation to how the Minister's proposals might work out in regard to families such as that.</P>

Up to now the position was that irretrievable breakdown was supposed to be the kernel of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter said this morning that my proposals on inheritance rights were a direct attack on dependent, battered and deserted wives.  That type of attack creates a hype at which the Deputy seems to be expert.  It is presumably calculated to cloud the fact that when his proposals are subjected to close <Col N="1645" /> scrutiny they do not offer the protection to spouses which he claims.  He has not, in any instance, addressed himself to the difficulties and problems of his provisions as I see them.  To say, for example, that allowing a spouse who has obtained a decree on the grounds of cruelty to maintain her succession rights, would afford her security for the future is simply not true.  As Deputy Shatter acknowledged, a husband can dispose of his property in such a way as to render such rights useless. It is in recognition of that fact that I am proposing that the court be empowered to make appropriate orders during the lifetime of the husband.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter argued that a husband may conceal or otherwise dispose of his assets with a view to defeating a claim for relief.  I wish to draw attention to the fact that my amendment on Committee Stage &mdash; now section 25 of the Bill &mdash; was designed to deal with that situation.  The Bill as it stood made no such provision. Even, if in spite of section 25, a husband succeeded in putting his property out of reach of his wife, it would also be out of her reach when it came to succession rights.  Deputy Shatter charged that the effect of my amendment could be to leave a dependent spouse destitute.  That is a gross distortion of the facts and Deputy Shatter knows it.  I am aware that whatever we do in this area will not be a perfect solution but I am convinced that my overall proposals go further in protecting dependent spouses than the proposals in Deputy Shatter's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the court may vary or discharge succession rights but that is subject to a proviso, namely, that it can do so only where it at the same time makes a property transfer, settlement order or lump sum in favour of a spouse.  I will leave aside for a moment the case where there has been gross matrimonial misconduct.  Until now a court has had no power in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> proceedings to grant lump sums, to order the transfer or settlement of property or indeed to secure maintenance payments on property or capital. The intention must be that it will use <Col N="1646" /> those powers.  If the court grants a lump sum, makes a property transfer or settlement order, I have no doubt that in accordance with what must be the intention in the Bill, it will extinguish the succession rights of the spouse who will benefit from the order in question.</P>
    <P>I would not see the court merely reducing succession rights because in most cases what we are talking about is the legal right to a one-third share.  That is the case where a will is made and there are children of the marriage.  It is quite ludicrous to talk of the court making an order in regard to intestate succession rights as the Bill proposes because it has no way of knowing that there will not be a will made.  That is what I mean when I say the provision does not achieve what it sets out to achieve.  In other words, it is illusory.</P>
    <P>In the normal case the husband will not benefit from any financial provision order under the Bill so that his succession rights cannot be affected.  The Deputy has referred to the saver in section 18 which allows the court to reduce or extinguish statutory succession rights where there has been gross matrimonial misconduct. This has not been defined and therefore we do not know what will be covered and what will not be covered.  In particular we do not know whether desertion will be covered by that phrase.  It would not be covered in our neighbouring jurisdiction without additional wording.  The net result of this provision is that it would obviously discriminate against wives.</P>
    <P>Another objection I have to these provisions in the Bill is that the court is being given the choice to leave succession rights alone, even where there is property available for distribution.  I would hope that a court would never take that option, not least because of the grave uncertainty in which it would place a dependent wife.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 1 to 48, and in page 11, to delete lines 1 to 23 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>14.&mdash;(1)  On granting a decree of judicial separation or at any time thereafter the court may, on application to it by either spouse, make any one or more of the following orders&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a periodical payments order, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an order that either spouse shall make to the other spouse such periodical payments of such amount and at such times as may be specified in the order; or</P>
      <P>(ii) an order that either spouse shall make to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of a dependent child of the family such periodical payments of such amount and at such time as may be so specified;</P>

      <P>(c)  an order that either spouse shall pay to the other spouse such lump sum or sums of such amount and at such time or times as may be so specified;</P>
      <P>(d)  an order that a spouse shall pay to such person as may be specified for the benefit of a dependent child of the family such lump sum or sums of such amount and at such time or times as may be so specified.</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) (c) or (d) of this section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> (a)  an order under this section that a spouse shall pay a lump sum to the other spouse may be made for the purpose of enabling that other spouse to meet any liabilities or expenses reasonably incurred by him or her, before making an application for an order under this section in his or her favour, in maintaining himself or herself or any dependent child of the family;</P>
    <P>(b)  an order under this section for the payment of a lump sum for the benefit of a dependent child of the family may be made for the purpose of enabling any liabilities or expenses reasonably incurred by or for the benefit of that child before the making of an application for an order under this section in his favour to be met; and</P>
    <P>(c) an order under this section for the payment of a lump sum may provide for the payment of that sum by instalments of such amount as may be specified in the order and may require the payment of the instalments to be secured to the satisfaction of the court.</P>
    <P>15.&mdash;On granting a decree of judicial separation or at any time thereafter, the court may, on application to it by either spouse, make a property adjustment order, that is to say, any one or more of the following orders&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an order that a spouse shall transfer to the other spouse, to any dependent child of the family or to such person as may be specified in the order for the benefit of such a child such property as may be so specified, being property to which the first-mentioned spouse is entitled, either in possession or reversion;</P>
    <P>(b)  an order that a settlement of such property as may be so specified, being property to which a spouse is so entitled, be made to the satisfaction of the court for the benefit of <Col N="1652" /> the other spouse and of any dependent child of the family or any or all of those persons;</P>
    <P>(c)  an order varying for the benefit of the spouses and of any dependent child of the family or any or all of those persons any ante-nuptial or post-nuptial settlement (including such a settlement made by will or codicil) made on the spouses;</P>
    <P>(d)  an order extinguishing or reducing the interest of either of the spouses under any such settlement;</P>
    <P>(e)  an order conferring on one spouse either for life or for such other period (definite or contingent) as the court may specify the right to occupy the family home to the exclusion of the other spouse;</P>
    <P>(f)  an order under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, 1957, determining any dispute between the spouses as to the title to or possession of any property;</P>
    <P>(g)  an order under section 4, 5 or 9 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976;</P>
    <P>(h)  an order under section 2 or 3 of the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981;</P>
    <P>(i)  an order for the partition of property or under the Partition Acts 1868 and 1876;</P>
    <P>(j)  an order under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 concerning any dependent child of the family.</P>
    <P>16.&mdash;(1)  Where the court makes a secured periodical payments order, an order for the payment of a lump sum or a property adjustment order, then, on making that order or at any time thereafter, the court may make a further order for the sale of such property as may be specified in that order, being property in which or in the proceeds of sale of which either or both spouses has or have a beneficial interest, either in possession or reversion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> (2)  The power to make an order for sale in the case of a property adjustment order shall not be exercised so as to interfere with a right to occupy the family home conferred by that order.</P>
    <P>(3)  An order under subsection (1) of this section may contain such consequential or supplementary provisions as the court thinks fit and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision, may include&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) provision requiring the making of a payment out of the proceeds of sale of the property to which the order relates, and</P>
    <P>(b) provision requiring any such property to be offered for sale to a person, or class of persons, specified in the order.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an order is made under subsection (1) of this section, the court may direct that the order, or such provision thereof as the court may specify, shall not take effect until the occurrence of an event specified by the court or the expiration of a period so specified.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where an order under subsection (1) of this section contains a provision requiring the proceeds of sale of the property to which the order relates to be used to secure periodical payments to a spouse, the order shall cease to have effect on the death of that spouse.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where a spouse has a beneficial interest in any property, or in the proceeds of sale thereof, and some other person who is not one of the spouses also has a beneficial interest in that property or in the proceeds of sale thereof, then, before deciding whether to make an order under this section in relation to that property, it shall be the duty of the court to give that other person an opportunity to make representations with respect to the order; and any representations made by that other person shall be included among the circumstances to which the court is <Col N="1654" /> required to have regard under section 18.</P>
    <P>The powers of the court to make ancillary orders in divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> proceedings is limited.  It has no general legislative power to order the transfer of property between spouses.  It can award alimony to a wife but not a husband and it has no power to award a separate sum for the support of any children.  An application for maintenance can be made by either spouse under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 but the order that is made for the support of a spouse and any dependent children of the family is based on a failure to maintain and that circumstance may not of course exist in all separation proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill has none of those limitations.  The provisions, however, do not go far enough and amendment No. 24 which has three new sections covering respectively financial provision orders, i.e. periodical payments and lump sum orders, property adjustment orders and orders for sale or property are more comprehensive. The main changes under the amendment are that, first the court would be empowered to order the transfer of property for the benefit of dependent children, second, it could order the payment of a lump sum to a spouse and children by instalments and the securing of those payments, and third, it would have express powers to order the sale of property.  I note that Deputy Shatter has introduced an amendment to correct this latter omission.  I should like now to set out in detail the provisions in my amendments and to indicate where the changes arise.</P>
    <P>The new section 14 proposed in amendment No. 24 which provides for periodical payments and lump sum orders in respect of a dependent spouse and children comprends the existing provision in paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1) of section 14 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) of the new section would insert the additional power of the court to order payment of lump sums by instalments and to require those payments to be secured.  Subsections (2) (a) <Col N="1655" /> and (b) are also aimed at protecting better the position of a dependent spouse and children.  While section 19 of the Bill empowers the court to order maintenance payments to be made from the time of granting of a decree of judicial separation subsection (2) (a) and (b) would allow the court to order a spouse to meet any liabilities or expenses already incurred by the other spouse in maintaining herself or any child of the family. In that way the spouse could be compensated if the other spouse failed to provide proper maintenance even before the separation proceedings were launched or if it turned out that the order for maintenance pending suit was not adequate.</P>
    <P>My amendment does not of course include section 14 (1) (g) of the Bill which empowers the court to extinguish or reduce succession rights.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill empowers the court to order the securing of lump sums. However, since the power to secure payments is only appropriate in the case of periodical payments there would not appear to be any necessity to provide for that matter.  My amendment does of course provide for the securing of periodical payments as does the Bill and also the securing of a lump sum which is ordered to be paid by instalments.  The Bill, as I have said, makes no provision for the payment of a lump sum by instalments.</P>
    <P>My new section 15 has separate provisions in relation to orders that may be made in relation to the property of the spouses.  The section comprehends paragraphs (e), (f) and (m) of section 14 (1) of the Bill regarding property transfer orders, property settlement orders and orders conferring on one spouse an interest for life or other period in the family home.  The main change is that my amendment empowers the court to order the transfer of property to children if justice requires that to be done.  There is no reason provision for that should not be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>My new section 15 removes a number of other deficiencies from the Bill and <Col N="1656" /> makes some necessary changes and additions.  These are as follows:</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of section 14 of the Bill provides for orders to be made under the Partition Acts 1868 to 1876. However, since there is no collective citation for those Acts, the reference should be to the Partition Acts 1868 and 1876.  The main point of significance is that paragraph (e) would cater only for orders in separation proceedings for the sale of property that is held by the spouses jointly or in common whereas the corresponding provision in paragraph (i) of my new section 15 provides in addition for orders to be made for the partition of the property in those cases &mdash; which I would imagine will be very few &mdash; where actual physical partition would be the appropriate remedy.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (4) of section 14 of the Bill the court shall on one occasion only consider and determine whether a property transfer or settlement order should be made.  This would mean that if the husband, say, has little property at the time of the granting of a decree of judicial separation and the court, having considered the matter, decides not to make a property transfer order in favour of the wife, it would be precluded from making a property transfer order at any time in the future, even if at a subsequent date the husband comes into property. The new section 15 in my amendment has no restrictions as to the making of a property transfer order in favour of a wife at any time after the granting of a decree if the court considers that to make such an order is just and proper.</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with the new section 16 of my amendment No. 24 concerning orders for sale of property.  The need for this power arises particularly in the common case where the only substantial capital asset is the former matrimonial home.  The Bill confers no express power on the court to order a sale of the spouses' property except in the case of property held jointly or in common by the spouses although I notice that Deputy Shatter has tabled an amendment to remedy this <Col N="1657" /> defect in his Bill.  The new section 16 is framed so that power to order a sale of property would be available whenever the court makes a lump sum, transfer of property or secured periodical payments order, that is to say, whenever it makes an order which involves capital assets. Deputy Shatter in his amendment omits the case where the court has made a property transfer order.  I do not see any good reason for that omission.  The power to order a sale would therefore be consequential or ancillary power and not an independent one.  It would only be made where an order relating to the spouse's capital has already been made under Part II of the Bill.  Apart from this the court would have a wide discretion whether or not to order a sale.  However, subsection (2) of the amendment provides that the power to make an order for sale in the case of a property adjustment order shall not, however, be exercised so as to interfere with a right to occupy the family home conferred by that order.</P>
    <P>The next important amendment &mdash; No. 49 &mdash; in this package of amendments I am proposing concerns the matters set out in sections 17 and 18 of the Bill, that is the matters to be taken into account by the court when making orders in relation to maintenance and property.  Subsection (3) of my new section 18 would make desertion an absolute bar to both maintenance and property orders under Part II of the Bill.  The Bill contains a general provision in section 14 that the court may have regard to the conduct of the party seeking maintenance but not any other type of financial provision, where it would be repugnant to justice to require the other party to pay maintenance.  This in effect proposes that desertion would not prevent a spouse from claiming maintenance rights in separation proceedings. My amendment making desertion an absolute bar to maintenance in separation proceedings is in line with existing family law provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note also that section 33, which I am proposing in amendment No. 94 to delete, proposes that desertion should no longer be an absolute bar to obtaining maintenance under the Family <Col N="1658" /> Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  It would be a fundamental change in the law if we were to allow a person who repudiates a marriage by deserting to claim benefit from the resulting breakdown of the marriage and I am opposed to such a change.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill about a spouse's conduct being a matter for consideration by the court when making property or lump sum orders.  This is an extraordinary omission.  My amendment makes it clear that the rules of conduct which apply to maintenance awards, should apply also to orders in relation to property.  I am, in subsection (2) (k) of new section 18, providing that conduct should be a matter to be considered by the court in deciding whether to make financial or property orders, where the conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it.</P>
    <P>Another important provision in new section 18 is subsection (2) (g) which provides that the court would, in making orders in relation to both maintenance and property, have to take account of the value to each of the spouses of any share in the estate of the other spouse which a surviving spouse will be precluded from taking as a legal right or on intestacy.  I spoke about this important direction to the court when dealing with amendment No. 22 on succession rights.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of the new section 18, unlike the Bill, specifies separately from those matters to be taken into account in relation to spouses, the matters to be considered in the making of orders by the court in relation to children.  The Bill contains no separate guidelines for the court in making orders in relation to children.</P>
    <P>Apart from the matters mentioned, the amendment is in line with the other provisions in section 17 of the Bill.  In coming to its decision as to what orders to make, say, for a dependent wife, the court would be able to take into account that she has given up her job on marriage to take care of the home and rear children. If she is at a disadvantage career-wise <Col N="1659" /> through having done so, or where children still need full-time care, that will be relevant.  The court is being required generally to ensure that adequate and proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, is made for any spouse and dependent children.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope that Deputies will agree that the package of amendments I am proposing would retain the best features of the Bill while at the same time providing for important changes and additions which would make the Bill a better one for estranged spouses and dependent children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of amendments tabled by the Minister are primarily designed to reconstruct provisions already contained in the Bill and, in reality, add very little that is new.  In the context of the Minister, simply for the sake of satisfying himself that he has produced some of the provisions contained in the Bill, I have no great objection as to whose phraseology is used provided the impact of what is proposed remains the same.  Nevertheless, there are some aspects of the Minister's proposals that are quite different from provisions contained in the Bill.  There are others the meaning of which is completely unclear. We heard during the discussion on the preceding amendment Members on the opposite side of the House extolling the virtues of certainty regardless of whether that certainty created a certainty whereby a wife who got a decree of separation would know that she was to be disinherited. They did not care greatly about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of inheritance rights and other matters, Members opposite poured scorn on the idea that in determining whether one should or should not retain one's inheritance rights the courts should only debar someone from being entitled to inheritance rights if they were guilty of gross matrimonial misconduct or if other adequate financial provision was provided for their future security.  We had Deputy O'Donoghue, in the way he does it, waxing lyrical on his legislative <Col N="1660" /> soap box about gross matrimonial misconduct. To say that he uttered that phrase four dozen times is giving a conservative estimate of the number of occasions he used it.</P>
    <P>We have a Bill which does something substantially different from what the Bill originally did.  It says to a wife that if she gets a decree of separation based on cruelty, adultery or desertion she will be disinherited.  The Minister is saying that any wife who is disinherited will have adequate provision made for her under the terms of the measures that he is proposing. The Minister has proposed the same measures in his amendments that we proposed in the original Bill, the possibility to make lump sum orders, property transfer orders and so on. However, the kernel of this is the criteria that the Minister says the courts should have regard to in determining what type of maintenance order should be made, in determining whether or not a property order should be made, in determining whether or not a lump sum should be made.</P>
    <P>What do we find when we examine the Minister's criteria?  I presume that the Minister is referring to circumstances where property exists that can be divided up because in many instances, as Deputy Taylor correctly pointed out, there will not be a massive amount of property, there will either be a local authority house or a small semi-detached house worth £30,000 or £35,000 with a £20,000 mortgage. The reality is that the ownership of that house will be worth very little to a wife.  Indeed, it will not be transferred into her name because what the wife will want is the husband to continue to make the mortgage repayments and the building society will require that the husband retain an ownership right in it.  When there is property to transfer, what will the disinherited wife get?  How will the courts calculate her entitlement?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 18 (2) (g) of the Minister's amendment No. 48 there is a direction to the court.  What is that direction?  It says that in determining how to compensate a wife for loss of inheritance rights the court is to have regard to the value to <Col N="1661" /> each of the spouses of any share in the estate of the other spouse which a surviving spouse would be precluded from taking as a legal right or on intestacy.  I would love the Minister to explain what that means.  What are the courts to have regard to?  Are they to have regard to the fact that in the context of the wife the husband might die intestate and she might not, therefore, get the entire of his estate or two-thirds of it?  Is the court to predict that a husband will make a will and in the context of his making a will her entitlement to a legal right is one-third where there are children or one-half where there are none?  What does the provision mean?  What relevance does it have?  Where a wife has lost her inheritance rights and the husband has also lost his inheritance rights, albeit he has beaten his wife up for many years and she has got a decree based on his unreasonable conduct, will the court have to do a calculation working out what the husband has lost by losing his inheritance rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the value of notionally what the wife may have lost?</P>
    <P>Are we talking about the entire estate, half an estate or one-third of an estate? What is the time factor in this?  Is the court to look at what the potential value of the husband's estate could be if five minutes after he left the courtroom he was run over by a CIE bus?  Have they to project and get actuaries into court to work out that it was reasonable to expect that this particular husband would live for a further ten, 15 or 20 years and within that time it was reasonable to expect, depending on the tax system and his commitment to the work ethic, that he may or may not accumulate assets of a particular value.  This is a formula offered by the party of certainty, the party that believes that courts should have some direction from the Oireachtas as to what financial compensation, security or protection is now to be provided to those wives who are disinherited as a result of the Minister's amendment made to this Bill which produces the result that anyone who gets a separation decree, loses their inheritance rights.</P>
    <P>What does this subsection mean?  What <Col N="1662" /> guidance does it give?  I do not know what guidance it gives.  This subsection creates even greater uncertainty &mdash; if we want to use this now as the pinnacle of what we are trying to achieve &mdash; than any preceding provision could have created in this Bill.  What protection does this provision give to a wife?  I do not know.  No doubt Deputy O'Donoghue will tell me the basis upon which the courts will be able to calculate what substitute protection the wife will be provided with.  I would like if Deputy O'Donoghue would do that.  I would like to know, when he is wearing his lawyer's hat, whether he will hand over heart, without fear of being sued for negligence by his clients, be giving certain advice as to what will be achieved by the application of this section advice that will give clear and absolute guidance to the courts as to what it should do.  I do not believe that is there. Rather than providing protection for wives by taking away their inheritance rights &mdash; and indeed taking them away from dependent husbands, although they would be few in number in the context of the family problems that arrive in our courts &mdash; and by providing this vague sort of mish-mash guidance to the courts, there is no certainty, there is no protection, and there is the possibility of destitution.  The Minister has defied that that would be the case in the event of the poor unfortunate wife who gets the separation degree being faced by the prospect of her husband dying within a short time of the decree being granted or dying, perhaps, 15 or 20 years later, when she is still dependent on maintenance payments from him for her weekly support, with such payments ceasing on his death.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear Members of Fianna Fáil spelling out what particular specific, concise, concrete and certain guidance this provision is going to make in the context of helping the courts decide what transfer orders to make, what lump sum orders to make.  What else does this provision do?  Lo and behold, what do we find contained in this amendment?  In section 18 (2) (k) the court in deciding how much maintenance to order, what <Col N="1663" /> lump sum payment to provide, what property transfer order to make, is directed to have regard to the conduct of each of the spcuses, if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it. Deputy O'Donoghue regaled us with the problems of the couple who separate by agreement and in the context of succession rights where there was clear agreement between them the courts would be forced to look at the possibility of gross matrimonial misconduct.</P>
    <P>Under this provision a wife or a husband who wants to engage in a matrimonial war of attrition will be able to force the courts to examine every aspect of the marital relationship to see if there can be uncovered, under some stone somewhere in the history of the marriage, some conduct of some description which might try and influence a court to reduce the maintenance payment that a wife should get or in some way to reduce the security she should get in the family home or to desist from making a property transfer order or not to provide the lump sum payment, be it by way of a capital once-off payment or instalments.</P>
    <P>This provision brings the issue of conduct into every single application that comes before the courts in the marriage breakdown area regardless of how unimportant or how uninfluential the particular conduct was in the breakdown of the marriage.  The concept of gross matrimonial misconduct was introduced to ensure that it is only in those circumstances where there has been extreme conduct of a nature that clearly makes it inequitable that someone gains a benefit that that issue would be brought into the matrimonial arena within the courts system.</P>
    <P>This provision requires the court &mdash; it is not even an option &mdash; in deciding how much maintenance it should order to look at the conduct of each of the spouses. What will this mean to a wife?  Let us assume we have a wife who has been abandoned by her husband and he is conducting an adulterous relationship and has been living in that situation for some <Col N="1664" /> five or ten years.  Let us assume the wife has young children and that she gets one night off.  She goes off to a dance and she is seen &mdash; God save us &mdash; dancing with a man for a couple of hours.  The wife has to go to court to get maintenance.  Will the husband bring that issue into the courtroom because the wife had a night off and was seen dancing with someone? Would that be an aspect of the wife's conduct that could give rise to some form of judicial condemnation that would delimit the financial protections the court can provide for her?  I suspect it would. I suspect this provision is designed by Fianna Fáil to have exactly that effect. Instead of now introducing legislation to protect the position of women and to protect the position of dependent wives, as well as dependent husbands, we are in danger of producing legislation that will be used as a stick to beat every dependent wife into submission.  That is the invidious and insidious impact of what is contained in this legislation.  Let no Deputy suggest later that I am exaggerating.  Deputy O'Donoghue regaled us for half an hour as to how the courts should not have to look at gross misconduct.  We now see that the courts will, in every application have to examine conduct of every nature during the course of the marriage.  The judges will be required to pick over the bones of the broken marriage to see if there is something relating to conduct that indicates that a note of judicial condemnation should be sounded, even where the separation is obtained by consent and agreement after a year.  That was not something that would have happened or could happen under this Bill as originally drafted.</P>
    <P>What else do we see about conduct? There is a phobia about certainty.  There also seems to be a phobia about ensuring that any legislation that was passed over the last couple of decades is not amended. I wonder why there is this great affection and attachment to not amending legislation passed in the sixties or seventies? Is this something hidden deep in the bowels of the Department of Justice where people affectionately hold Statutes that were enacted through the Oireachtas <Col N="1665" /> as if they were tablets of stone handed over in the last two decades that should never be changed.</P>

      <P>They are a conservative party indeed.  They are the most conservative party in this State and let nobody forget that.  What do we have here in the area of conduct?  We have this great curiosity &mdash; desertion.  Apparently desertion is the reserved marital sin in the tablets of stone of the Fianna Fáil Party because, if it can be established that a spouse is in desertion, she will be cut off from maintenance, from the family home, from lump sum payments; she will be cut off from the possibility of property transfer orders and, of course, she will be disinherited as well.  But if a spouse has just committed cruelty, if a spouse has just beaten the hell out of the other spouse, that is not as great a sin as desertion because the cut-off is not automatic; that is just conduct to be considered. If a spouse has committed adultery, no matter how many times, that is not as great a reserved marital sin as is apparently desertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Justice have had a phobia about desertion.  It has a very peculiar historical background.  It derives from the fact that in 1886, 100 years ago, the Westminister Parliament passed a piece of legislation to allow deserted wives to get maintenance orders and wives who were not deserted could not, and wives who did desert could not.  That legislation remained unchanged until 1976 when we enacted the Family (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act. That Act made provision to allow wives who were not deserted to get maintenance orders, even wives who had committed adultery, or who were guilty of cruelty could get maintenance orders because there was a perception that perhaps someone in a difficult marriage might stray off the straight and narrow on one occasion and engage in a brief liaison, but that was not perceived as <Col N="1666" /> something that should leave them destitude. Therefore adultery was just one of the things the courts could consider under the 1976 Act.  But desertion had been inherited from the 1886 Act and that was the reserved sin.  If one were guilty of desertion, one was cut off from maintenance. That is the provision Fianna Fáil are now endeavouring to re-introduce into this Bill.</P>
    <P>Of course we have had the certainty of desertion, as Deputy O'Donoghue or the Minister would tell us, in the context not just of the 1976 Act but in the context of the Succession Act 1965.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with the certainty of desertion, in that very often it is difficult to know whether a husband or wife is in desertion.  Desertion is not a simple concept.  In most instances desertion is not the case of the happily married couple when, one morning, the husband rises from bed, looks out the window and reaches the conclusion that the time has come for him to go, or the wife does likewise and simply departs without any history whatsoever of any marital disharmony.</P>
    <P>In practice in our courts, at present desertion is raised in one set of circumstances. Wives go to court to look for maintenance orders.  They do so often in circumstances in which they have moved out of the family home.  In many instances they will have moved out of the family home and are living in great poverty, perhaps in one of the women's aid hostels; perhaps they will have managed to get local authority housing, often at the worst end of the available housing within the local authority system.  But they have moved out of the family home and have taken their children with them.  Their husbands are not supporting them, they go to court and look for maintenance.  The husband, as a defence &mdash; in order to avoid having to pay maintenance support payments to his wife &mdash; says: &ldquo;she is in desertion of me and I should not have to support her&rdquo;.  The wife will say to the court: &ldquo;I am not in desertion, our situation in the home was so appalling that, for the sake of my own wellbeing and sanity, I had no choice but to move out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> There may have been violence; there may not have been violence; there may have been simply a history of drunkenness and verbal abuse.  The court then has to ascertain whether that wife is regarded as being in desertion or whether she had a just reason for leaving the family home and, hence, is not in desertion.</P>
    <P>This wonderfully certain concept to which the Fianna Fáil Party is so emotionally attached, in reality, is not certain at all.  The reason it is not certain is that different judges take different views as to what is and what is not desertion.  Some judges take the view that, if there is not violence in the family home, that if the family are just very unhappy there is a great deal of verbal upset, with possibly some harassment, that that is the bed one has to lie on because one has to take the wear and tear of married life, that the wife who is under great strain and stress in those circumstances, who moves out of the family home, is not justified in doing so and should be regarded as being in desertion.  That wife is cut off from support payments under the existing law. Under this proposal she will be cut off not only from support payments and inheritance rights but from all the other so-called protections about which the Minister speaks.  However, some judges have a more compassionate approach. Some judges regard behaviour on the part of a husband or a wife that forces the other spouse out of the family home, that falls short of violence but which is difficult, as justifying a wife's or husband's departure from the family home. Anybody who has had any experience of the way in which our courts deal with this issue will know that there are some who regard wives as being in desertion in circumstances identical to other judges finding that the wife was justified in moving out of the family home.</P>
    <P>This provision, that makes desertion a bar, being re-introduced in this Bill, will mean that any wife who is forced out of the family home by her husband's behaviour, who moves out of the home before going to court &mdash; sometimes moving out on psychiatric advice for the sake of her <Col N="1668" /> sanity &mdash; will be putting herself at the risk of being left penniless and destitute.  In some instances a wife will be able to convince the court that the husband is guilty of constructive desertion; I grant that; in some cases she will; in others, she will not.  Often, whether or not she will be able to, will not be dependent on the factual background of the marriage but rather on the subjective assessments of individual members of the Judiciary who have to make that decision.</P>
    <P>Why is this provision about desertion here if the Minister is so desirous that the courts examine the issue of misconduct in the context of making maintenance orders?  At least, despite the peculiarity of the way it is dealt with in the Minister's amendment, it leaves the court with a discretion; at least the court can make a determination, even in the context of adultery or of assaults; it is left with a discretion to provide maintenance, financial security, or property orders.</P>
    <P>Desertion is the one area in which there is a degree of certainty, in the sense that, if a husband proves his wife is in desertion, she is automatically cut off; the courts are left with no discretion.  Therefore, wives will be engaging in a game of judicial roulette if they decide that, because the family circumstances are so difficult they must move out of the family home before heading into the courts. Wives will be told by their lawyers: you move out at your own peril; do not move out; institute proceedings; do not even move out to give yourself time and space to consider whether you should go to court.  In these circumstances some wives, due to the pressures they are under in the family home, would like to be free simply to move out of the home for a period while they consider and assess the position; free to move out in the hope that their husbands who are misbehaving in ways that are making life difficult, if not appalling, would, to use a non-legal phrase: &ldquo;cop themselves on&rdquo; to the reality of the family problems and change their ways.  A wife who moves out without the prior agreement of her husband places herself at risk of being held to be in desertion.  In the context of the impact <Col N="1669" /> of this Bill, as amended by the Minister, not only will she be placed at risk of being disinherited but she will be placed at risk of being left with nothing, no home, security, no capital sums, no maintenance.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Taylor's point, that in many cases there will not be a question of providing capital sums or properties but the question of maintenance will be there.  It is worth recording that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown took the view that desertion should not be singled out in the way the Minister is singling it out in his provision. It is a mean, unnecessary, artificial approach.  Certainly it is not an approach that gives rise to any degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>What about the other criteria?  What else is missing from this?  The Minister has lauded the fact that he is making provisions here that fill gaps in the original Bill which, of course, is not the case. He has his peculiar provisions in the context of what the courts should look at in determining whether to order these payments.  There are a couple of things notably absent from the criteria that the Minister laid down but which are in the original Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 17(g) of the original Bill directs the courts &mdash; when deciding what type of property transfer or lump sum orders to make &mdash; to have regard to the contribution made by each party, or spouse, to the income-earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other.  That provision is not listed among the Minister's criteria and I do not know why.  It is a provision that was designed to ensure that in determining a wife's entitlements the court would not only look at the contribution made by the wife working in the home in caring for her family but also that it would have some regard for and pay attention to the contribution husbands and wives make to each other's success in the business world, in earning income and to the back up and help that they provided.  Apparently this Minister believes that the courts need not have regard to this provision which reads &ldquo;the contribution made by each party to the income, earning capacity, property and <Col N="1670" /> financial resources of the other.&rdquo;  The Minister is concerned about future earning capacity.  That is an interesting provision and I will refer to it when I come to deal with paragraph (h) later for a very particular reason but for a moment let us deal with those who are better paid.</P>
    <P>What about the contribution the wife of a doctor makes in helping him, such as in the taking of phone calls?  What about the contribution the wife of a solicitor makes or the contribution the wife of a farmer makes on a daily basis such as in helping with the milking on a farm that is owned by her husband?  Farmers' wives in this country make a contribution that is rarely recognised and given little, if any, value.  This provision will give the work farmers' wives do a value and a recognition beyond that of their work as home keepers.  That is something which probably does not appeal to Deputy O'Donoghue in addressing his constituents as Deputy McCartan so graphically portrayed less than an hour ago. The contribution they make is important.</P>
    <P>What about the contributions that wives make in the context of helping their husbands' earn money.  What about the wife of a window cleaner or the wife of a milkman who gets up early in the morning on occasion to help her husband with his rounds?  They do not necessarily have to be the glamorous contributions.  Why should the contribution that a wife makes be disregarded and greater regard paid to the marital misconduct of the parties?</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to deal with paragraph (h) of section 17 of this Bill which read as follows:</P>
    <P>The effect on the earning capacity of each party to the marriage of the marital responsibilities assumed by each during the period when the parties cohabited together.</P>
    <P>A school teacher who gives up work to care for her husband and children for 10 or 15 years loses her increments and seniority.  If she goes back to work after her marriage has collapsed she will start at a far lower level than she would have been at if she had stayed at work.  No regard is to be had to that fact.  I could <Col N="1671" /> outline countless illustrations of the circumstances that provision was designed to tackle.  It was designed to give a value to the work done by the spouse in the home and to put a value on the loss suffered in financial terms, as this is about finance at the end of the day, by the wife who works in the home.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 17 of this Bill, in particular those contained in paragraphs (f), (g) and (h) taken together with paragraph (i) provide for the first time in our law a means whereby a value could be attached to the work done and to the contribution made by wives and mothers to Irish family life, to businesses, to profits made and assets accrued by their husbands.  The Minister has retained only one of those provisions. He only retains the provision which recognises the contribution made by the wife in looking after the home or caring for her family.  By taking away the planks provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) and indeed paragraph (i) which refers to the financial benefits accruing to either party as a result of the marriage and of their cohabiting together the Minister is putting substantially at risk the possibility of the disinherited wife getting real property or financial security as he seeks to take out of the Bill recognition of the value of different types of contribution made.  He has offered no explanation for this.  He gave no reason that those provisions should no longer be included in this Bill. Even if the Minister felt duty bound to include a reference to conduct and even if he had to stick with his hang-up on desertion and provide vague and rambling and totally unregulated provisions about the value of the possible loss of inheritance rights, there was nothing to stop him also including paragraphs (g), (h) and (i) but the reason they were not included is that the Fianna Fáil Party look on the women of this country who make up over 50 per cent of the population with a degree of contempt that is quite unparalleled.  They have no concept of the contribution which women, wives and mothers, have made to the life of this country.  They have no concept of the <Col N="1672" /> value of the contribution which has been made within the family home or within family businesses and it is a question of, &ldquo;God forbid that the role played by the farmer's wife on the farm should be given any recognition.&rdquo; That is an extraordinary approach.  It is even more noteworthy that the Minister deliberately omitted to make reference to these fundamental changes to the criteria laid down in this Bill which the court ought to have regard to in determining what type of financial or property order should be made.  What the Minister seeks to do is to take out of this Bill the secure structural foundation which was designed to provide protection, primarily for women, but also for the small number of husbands who work in the home and take on home duties while their wives are at work.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like the Minister to clarify.  The Minister told us that at the time a separation decree is granted a wife may not seek a property transfer order.  Perhaps a husband may not have any property but the wife could come back in five or ten years' time when he has acquired property.  I would like the Minister to put on the record of this House, as he did not do so in replying to the question on succession, the number of applications he believes any spouse can make to get a property transfer order? Under his provision does he believe that every couple of years a dependent wife, for example, would be able to go to court to find out what property or businesses her husband owns?  Is there going to be litigation every two or three years between husbands and wives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they going to litigate to the grave?  Will a wife keep on litigating for fear of destitution and in the hope that somewhere she will find a bit of property that will guarantee her some security on her husband's death?  Will she litigate her husband into the grave or will he litigate her into the grave?  This is the <Col N="1673" /> party of certainty, the party of compassion and the party that told the people of Ireland in 1986 not to vote for divorce because wives would be disinherited and left destitute.  How many of these applications can be made?  I would refer Deputies to the sections which the Minister proposes to insert under amendment No. 49 and preceding amendments.</P>
      <P>Let us look at those amendments, cut through the waffle and work out what is being talked about.  The new section 15 which the Minister wants to insert, which appears under the heading of amendment No. 24, states: &ldquo;On granting a decree of judicial separation, or at any time thereafter, the court may, on application to it by either spouse, make a property adjustment order...&rdquo;.  This can be done on the granting of a decree of separation or at any time thereafter.  That is a formula &mdash; and we have heard much about foreign divorce legislation here &mdash; that is in being in England in their divorce legislation. That is the phraseology used in the English Act and has been interpreted by the English courts as having the following effect.  When a divorce decree is granted, a wife does not have to immediately ask for a property transfer order or lump sum order to be made but she can, at a later stage, look for financial orders to be made, although more usually it is done between the granting of what is known as a decree of divorce <i>nisi</i> and a decree absolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view has been taken that once the court has heard one such application that that will end the matter.  When the application is made a determination will be reached and if that determination is that there is no property there to make a capital payment or property transfer order, that that is it.  It does not matter what the husband may acquire in five or ten years' time; that is it and one cannot &mdash; and this is a well known legal principle &mdash; keep on litigating the same issue.  It is what is known as <i>res judicata.</i> That is a phrase the Deputies opposite will have some familiarity with but members of the press may not be familiar with it.  It means that the issue has been dealt with by the <Col N="1674" /> courts and resolved and one cannot keep on opening it.</P>
    <P>Where in this provision does it say that a whole series of such applications can be made?  How many applications can be made?  With due respect to Deputies O'Donoghue, Ahern and Abbott, I have no interest in what their interpretation of what this provision is because they are defending the Minister's approach; it is the Minister who is bringing this amendment before the House and I want on the record of this House the number of occasions the Minister believes applications can be made for property transfer orders, or lump sum payment orders?  If a wife makes such an application immediately following the hearing of a separation action and she is given no property and no lump sum, I want the Minister to specifically tell us when she can next come to court and look for one. Can she keep on doing it?  Perhaps when he is replying to that question the Minister might clarify for us whether certainty is created by the possibility of this ongoing litigation which he promises us can take place.  That matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>There is a final point I want to deal with.  The difficulty with what we now have is that it is an attempt not merely to restructure the Bill but in some ways to dismantle it and fundamentally change its philosophy.  There is one matter I wish to refer to because it points to the utter lack of any policy or coherent approach from Members opposite.</P>
    <P>A great debate took place in England in the early eighties.  Wives whose husbands had to pay maintenance to them were described by husbands who objected to paying maintenance to their wives as &ldquo;alimony drones&rdquo;.  This concept developed on the basis of an assumption that when an English decree of divorce was granted a wife should not regard her husband as an ongoing meal ticket.  In other words it does not matter how long a marriage has lasted, 15 years, 20 years or 25 years, a wife should be put out to work regardless of her husband's financial background, regardless of the promises made and regardless of the <Col N="1675" /> contribution she had made over the years to his welfare and benefit and to bringing up their children.  Husbands in England who, following divorce decrees, were required to make ongoing maintenance payments objected and described their wives as &ldquo;alimony drones&rdquo; or &ldquo;maintenance drones&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A campaign was started in England to change their maintenance legislation.  It was done on the basis that many people who get English divorces remarry and that one should not have to support two families.  In 1984, new legislation was introduced by the Westminster Parliament to attack the &ldquo;alimony drone&rdquo;, the dependent wife.  That maintenance legislation sought to put a direct obligation on wives, no matter how long their marriage lasted for, no matter what trauma they suffered due to being battered during their relationships with their husbands, no matter the emotional impact on them that resulted from possibly being deserted or by husbands setting up a second home with someone else, to go out to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation amended the English maintenance divorce law. Deputy O'Donoghue and others have been waxing lyrical about irretrievable breakdown and divorce in a Bill to do with judicial separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we now have?  We have this very curious proposal from the Minister which, in the new section 18 (2) (h), introduces the amended English principle of the &ldquo;alimony drone&rdquo;.  Currently under Irish law marriages are supposed to be permanent and, as Deputy O'Donoghue has correctly reminded us, even a separation decree cannot bring a marriage to an end.  Wives are regarded within marriage as dependent and this Bill was designed to recognise that where there is dependency, adequate provision should be made for support.  What does this section provide?  Section 18 (2) (h) says that in determining what maintenance <Col N="1676" /> should be ordered, the court shall have to have regard to &ldquo;the degree to which the future earning capacity of a spouse is impaired by reason of having relinquished or foregone the opportunity of remunerative activity in order to look after the home or care for the family.&rdquo; That refers to future earning capacity and is not the way in which it was impaired previously.  It is reasonable that that should be taken into account.  However, the new section 18 (2) (i) refers to any income or benefits to which either spouse is entitled and there is a reference in the Bill which seeks to ensure that, in effect, there is an obligation imposed upon wives to go out to work.</P>
    <P>We have now introduced into Irish law the concept of the &ldquo;alimony drone&rdquo; and I find that very curious.  It is a slavish following on the part of Fianna Fáil of English divorce legislation.  God help us, is that not extraordinary?  The approach the Fianna Fáil Party have adopted to this Bill is not one, as has been presented by the Minister, designed to improve the Bill, to protect dependent spouses, who are mostly wives, or to ensure that injustice is not done.  It is an approach which is designed to fundamentally change the philosophy of the Bill, to undermine the financial security of wives, to maximise in some instances a wife's feeling of dependence and to seek to discourage people who genuinely need the help of the courts to extricate themselves from a broken marriage from seeking that help. Because the Minister has succeeded in having the amendment as regards inheritance rights made to the Bill I suspect that it is a futile act to try to prevent these amendments being made but I do not believe it is futile to highlight the idiosyncratic and inconsistent nature of the measures the Minister is now seeking to put before us to replace existing sections which, taking the Bill as a coherent whole, would have more than adequately provided the necessary protections.</P>

      <P>On looking at the ministerial amendments, one could be forgiven for presuming that they are simply restating in other phraseology what is in <Col N="1677" /> the Bill and apparently taking on board the provisions already in the Bill.  On closer examination, it is quite evident that there is a move in a direction different from that which the Bill has followed. This is unfortunate because the effect is to minimise for women in Ireland the value of the decisions of the court for the wives involved in a break-up of marriage. The Minister has introduced, in effect, very comprehensive new sections which deal with the periodic payments under lump sum orders and sale of property and the issues which the court must have regard to before deciding for these orders.  Again, it is unfortunate that the Minister has taken into account only to a small degree the shift which was evident in the Bill towards recognising the role of the woman who has stayed in the home, has taken care of the children and the home, something which is quite definitely recognised in the Bill, particularly in section 17.  The Minister's amendment No. 49 to a certain extent echoes that recognition, but does not go to the extent I would wish for.</P>
      <P>When it comes to his proposed section 18 (3) I have no sympathy with the move he has made, which is to refuse orders under the lump sum or property sale heading, etc.  where a spouse has deserted.  We face again the situation we faced in dealing with the last amendment. The Minister offers us a black and white option.  We can take it or leave it; there is no judicial discretion, no ultimate discretion left where cases and circumstances vary.  The court has no discretion to decide on what is the most suitable outcome in these cases.  I cannot understand why this subsection has been inserted in the Minister's amendment, or the reasoning behind it.  As must be well known in the Department of Justice and to the Minister and the Fianna Fáil members who are taking an interest in this Bill, the practical realities are that in many instances a spouse has been forced to leave and, as has been referred to here, there are times when it can be deemed to be constructive desertion but there are times when it will not be so.  It will be very difficult to prove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> Completely to cut off such a spouse, in a situation where an order for judicial separation is being made, from maintenance, from the making of lump sum payments, sale of property and division is simply unwarranted and unnecessary. The conduct of each of the spouses has already been taken into account under the proposed subsection of the Minister, 18 (2) (k), and that should cover the circumstances which, presumably, the Minister has in mind where a spouse has been guilty of misconduct.  It would be inequitable for the court to grant certain orders in such a case.  In paragraph (k) that is well taken care of.  I see no necessity for going further and specifying in an immovable and immutable way that where a spouse has deserted other orders simply cannot be made.</P>
    <P>I might add that I have put forward amendments which are related to some of the amendments under discussion here, particularly amendment No. 38.  I tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and withdrew it in order to resubmit it on Report Stage slightly varied.  I would like to address myself to that now. In section 14 (1) (m) of the Bill as drafted, I wish to insert after the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; words that would allow the parties to the marrige to decide whether they wished to divide the property and live separately within it.  The point was made on Committee Stage that there was a difficulty in the way that was phrased, in that it might allow the court to order that division.  I took that on board and have now redrafted the amendment to insert &ldquo;if the parties to the marriage so decide, an order for the division of the family home so as to allow both parties of the marriage to reside there separately on such conditions as the court deems proper could be made.&rdquo;  That is a reasonable insertion to make.  It would be used in a number of situations &mdash; a small number admittedly, but I know situations where it could be and has been used in the deeds of separation. At the time the Minister indicated that in principle he was willing to accept the amendment, as did Deputy Shatter, if it was to be slightly altered.  I <Col N="1679" /> would put it to the House that it might accept the amendment as tabled there.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52, which is also tabled in my name and which is being discussed at this stage, also refers to section 17.  That is the reference to matters to be considered by the court in making orders for maintenance and so on.  I am suggesting that the needs of people other than dependent children, who are referred to in the Bill, must be considered.  I have previously referred to the situation where there may be other dependent persons, whether they be foster children or elderly relatives, and that the family needs would include the needs of these dependent people.  Taking on board again remarks made on Committee Stage and the dangers that might be inherent in the amendment I have put forward there, that there could be produced constructively dependent people at any given time so as to reduce commitments on behalf of one or other spouse, my amendment as submitted now is more suitable and still covers a situation which I think will occur from time to time where there are other dependent people in the family besides children.</P>
    <P>I am not going to delay the House in discussing the ins and outs of the different sections the Minister has proposed as opposed to those in the Bill.  It comes down, in the end, to whether one wishes to cover the needs particularly of spouses, who have or have not remained in the home, in such a comprehensive manner that they are effectively taken care of.  I believe that the Bill as it stands does that more effectively.  The inclusion in the Minister's amendment of references to desertion being a bar to the making of certain orders is quite anathema and I see no reason whatsoever for this provision. We will be opposing the Minister's amendments at the vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was put forward by the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue that certainty was something to be regarded as essential in this branch of the law. Certainly, that is a line of argument, but <Col N="1680" /> when one looks at the spectrum of provisions submitted to the House one sees that the vagaries and flexibility accorded here to the courts is quite remarkable.  I do not know how one can reconcile these two propositions.  The Minister wants to provide that the court should do whatever may be regarded as adequate and reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  What more of a vagary could you have than that?  The Minister wants us to enact into law a provision in amendment No. 18 (2) (k) dealing with the conduct of spouses:</P>
      <P>the conduct of each of the spouses, if that conduct is such that in the opinion of the court it would be inequitable to disregard it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is a man who has a yen for legal history and quotes de Montesquieu and all the rest.  The Deputy may recall the description of equity: that it varies in accordance with the length of the Chancellor's foot.  Where is the certainty in that?  One wonders what might be regarded by the court as inequitable? This broad array of powers given to the courts covers the entire spectrum and leaves it to their complete discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had to listen to a lecture on the idea that certainty in the law was essential and that flexibility or discretion to the court was something not to be taken account of.  It is all very strange and puzzling that in the sections flexibility is given to the courts right across the spectrum in every respect but one.  The Minister has exercised his ingenuity to the full.  Property orders, maintenance orders secured maintenance orders, lump sum orders, you name it: everything you could think of is empowered to the court to be given with one exception, succession rights.  Succession rights are the only element excluded.  How could it be that the court could be given power right across the board in making provision for the spouse and children with the exception of succession rights?  Is this because the Minister takes the view that the spouse has no entitlement to succession rights?  Is it the Minister's view that in basic law, morality and justice that the <Col N="1681" /> question of succession rights is completely out and not to be considered as part of the equation.  Is that the reason this single item is excluded from the equation? That cannot be the answer because the Minister goes on to provide in the amendments &mdash; although he says it is a non-subject which must not be considered &mdash; that it must be taken into account by the court as one of the factors to be considered when the maintenance, lump sum and all the rest are being provided for by the court.  This is provided for in amendment No. 18 (2);</P>
    <P>the court shall in particular have regard to the following matters &mdash; (g) the value to each of the spouses of any share in the estate of the other spouse which a surviving spouse will be precluded from taking as a legal right or on intestacy;</P>
    <P>On the one hand the Minister is saying that succession rights are inappropriate and have no place and cannot be considered in the situation but then he goes on and tells the court that the court must take into account, in particular, along with the other items, that the spouse will be foregoing succession rights.  This is a glaring contradiction.  If one takes the view that the spouse is not entitled to succession rights one does not come along and direct the court, in particular, to take account when fixing the lump sums of the maintenance or the property transfers that the spouse is going to forego a legal right or intestacy.  When you say that you concede <i>ab initio</i> that the spouse does have a succession right, otherwise you would not be compensating the spouse for having foregone it.  One can only come to the conclusion that this kind of woolly reasoning has no basis in reason or logic.</P>
    <P>A number of strange factors are included in the amendments.  I have to agree with the previous speaker's views on desertion.  Of course, it may well be that in some circumstances desertion ought to be a bar to maintenance.  Even the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown recognises that fact.  However it does not put the case as <Col N="1682" /> strongly as the Minister has put it.  The Minister has taken it out from the other factors and has made a separate subsection of it which says that under no circumstances may the court grant maintenance or lump sums or whatever when desertion has taken place.  I think that is putting the matter altogether too strongly.  The provision ought to be in the Bill but it should be just one of the other factors to be taken into account and not categorised separately.  It is worthwhile looking at what the joint committee said on the subject.  Page 56, 7.4.18 of the report states:</P>
    <P>Desertion or adultery should be a discretionary bar to maintenance for the applicant spouse, unless the conduct of the defendant is or was such as to make it inappropriate and unfair that he or she should be entitled to rely on the applicant's desertion or adultery.</P>
    <P>There may well be cases where desertion took place, but the conduct of the respondent would be such that it would make it unfair and unjust for the respondent to seek to rely on that desertion.  The Minister has gone out of his way to preclude such a situation.  From what I know it is by no means uncommon and I do not think the rules of so-called constructive desertion adopted by the courts goes any way adequately towards meeting the needs of that kind of situation.</P>
    <P>I would have thought in modern and forward-looking legislation that one should have left open the possibility and not leave it to the courts to have to stretch themselves and turn themselves inside out to try to find bases for giving maintenance in appropriate cases, even though desertion took place.  The judges do their best in that regard.  But when we are enacting new legislation we should not put that burden on judges.  One should certainly make provision for desertion as a factor, but only a factor, but also take into account that the other spouse may have contributed to that in some way.  I do not see why we have to go into the court's interpretation of constructive desertion and why in new <Col N="1683" /> legislation this type of case could not be spelled out.  We leave too much in interpretation to the courts on important matters.  This Bill will prove to be one of the classic examples.</P>
    <P>There is one very strange section which I wonder if anybody has thought through. I refer to the Minister's new section 16 dealing with orders for sale of property. He seems to be casting his net incredibly wide in this respect and I wonder if he has gone over the top on this matter.  He is providing that the court may order the sale of property even though the spouse concerned may have only a very minor interest in it.  If a spouse has a one-tenth interest in a farm, which may have come by inheritance, and people not connected with this family own nine-tenths of the farm, the court is being given power to order the sale not of one-tenth but of the entire farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>It would happen anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not happen anyway because the partition Acts do not give a right of sale to a person who has only a one-tenth interest.  What will the person who owns nine-tenths of the farm say when he suddenly finds that the farm has to be sold because of the family situation of his junior partner who owns only one-tenth of it?  I wonder about the constitutionality of this provision, apart from other considerations.  Subsection (6) provides a purported but very inadequate safeguard by giving that outside person the right to make representations to the court on the issue.  This is inadequate and does not meet the needs of the situation. A man or women who runs a farm while owning nine-tenths of it may have no involvement in the family problem of the person who owns one-tenth, yet the person owning the major share of the farm could lose his or her livelihood, with great disruption to his or her family.  If we were talking about an appreciable interest amounting to a quarter, a third or a half it might be another matter, but to bring in that power for some fractional interest is a very far-reaching provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Some further consideration ought to be given to it.</P>
    <P>I agree that where a spouse has any interest of substance that factor must be taken into account in calculating maintenance and taking account of lump sum payments and property transfers.  It might be appropriate to order that person to transfer the one-tenth share into a pool or to the other spouse.  That would be acceptable because it would involve only the share of the spouse who was being made amenable in the judicial separation proceedings.  That is not what the section appears to say.  It seems to be half-baked and ill thought through.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Bill is now altered in direction.  It is becoming less like Deputy Shatter's Bill and more like the Minister's Bill.  That is to be regretted.  It has not helped what I had hoped we would be doing in this measure.  I suppose it will get worse since the legislation is becoming regressive as we go on.  The arguments being put forward are inconsistent and seem to be directed more to scoring points than having seriously at heart the benefit of spouses who find themselves in the unfortunate situation of a family dispute.</P>

      <P>The various amendments put down by the Minister do not go very far towards changing what is already in the Bill.  They extend it.  Most speakers would agree that we should have provision in the Bill of periodical payments, property adjustment orders and orders for sale of property.  In relation to orders for the sale of property, I am wondering if there would be a problem from a constitutional point of view in that the court may be able to order the sale of the property over the head of the person who owns it.  Perhaps the Bill as amended might have difficulties and might ultimately have to be referred to the Supreme Court for a decision.</P>

      <P>That aspect was addressed in the 1976 Family Home Protection Act which, although badly drafted, protected to a certain extent the innocent spouse.  I make no apology for referring to the &ldquo;innocent&rdquo; spouse because there is no doubt that a wife who finds that the husband has gone does not know how she is fixed in relation to the house.  There may be a difficulty if this Bill is passed either with the Minister's amendments or as presented by Deputy Shatter.  There does not appear to be much difference in the ideas behind the Bill and the amendments.  There is a number of areas where there is a dispute and we all have our own ideas on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be congratulated on the guidelines in subsection (4) of his proposed section 18 in relation to dependent children.  These provisions are not contained in the original Bill.  Everyone would agree that those should be in the Bill in order to protect the children who may be at a disadvantage as a result of a break-up between the spouses.</P>
      <P>The other area which causes some concern to the Opposition is that the Minister in the proposed section 18 (3) which refers to the fact that the court shall not make an order under any of those sections for the support of a spouse who has deserted, is in effect saying that desertion is an absolute bar to these orders.  Deputy Barnes and others were worried in this regard.</P>
      <P>It was mentioned that spouses would have problems when the deserting spouse had left.  The Minister is trying to ensure that the innocent spouse does not find herself in a situation where an order is made by a court subsequently transferring the property or making orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who deserted could, under Deputy Shatter's proposed legislation, obtain an order of the court to get portion of the property or a lump sum.  That is repugnant to me and should not be allowed.  The innocent party to the transaction should be protected at all times and the Minister's proposal in subsection (3) is correct.  As previous speakers said, giving rights of maintenance to people who have deserted is not contained in any legislation to date and it should not be allowed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 14 (4) states that the court shall only have power on one occasion to grant orders.  I am amazed at this as it would cause difficulty in the future.  Let us say that a court, on the granting of a judicial separation, decides that it will make no order in relation to the property rights, a lump sum payment or whatever, and that one of the spouses in a year's time comes into a lot of money &mdash; perhaps winning the national lottery &mdash; the other spouse, under this section, would not be entitled to come back to court to apply for an increase.  That would cause a great problem and Deputy Flanagan should know that solicitors are hounded by people telling them that they want their maintenance orders varied because their spouse has got an increase in wages or has got a job.  I give the example of the national lottery to illustrate what could happen.  When circumstances change in that way, people should be allowed to come into court a second time.  The Minister's provision is a better way of dealing with ancillary orders and section 18 sets out all the circumstances, including a reference to the children and guidelines for dealing with them, which is vitally important. No one could find fault with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to help Deputy Ahern in relation to the faults I find in the proposed amendments.  I understand that the order of the House provided that the amendments would be taken together, that we would be asked <Col N="1687" /> to vote on amendment No. 24 and that the others follow as a consequence.  The Workers' Party will be opposing the Minister's amendments so far as we practically and possibly can.  Alternatively, there may well be the prospect that the Minister might listen to some of the points made and undertake to look at some of the proposals.  As has been pointed out, they are towards the same ends, seeking to set down the regimen whereby the court can make orders with regard to maintenance, property and other rights. However, there are some very disturbing features and Deputy Taylor mentioned one with regard to the position of part beneficial owners.  Was the Minister even listening to him as he spoke?  To repeat the point, section 16 (6) is unsatisfactory and sloppy.  It should be looked at again.</P>
      <P>I am most concerned about the new section 18.  The point has already been made by previous speakers about the use of the term &ldquo;having regard to all circumstances of the case as contained in subsection (1)&rdquo;.  The ambiguity and wideness of that drafting provision is undesirable for all the reasons that have been advanced and I do not want to remind the House of the principles we have identified in the smog-laden room in which we are now asked to debate, from the Fianna Fáil point of view, in terms of the principles on which they are proceeding in relation to certainty, clarity and letting people know exactly where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am equally concerned about the formula used in subsections (a) and (b) which the Minister seeks to introduce when the court is asked to have regard to the circumstances of income and financial needs that a person or spouse has &mdash; or is likely to have &mdash; in the foreseeable future.  Will the Minister help us in relation to how he believes a court could have regard to those requirements?  Will a soothsayer be employed by the court to give some kind of a reasonable foresight as to where the parties will go financially in the future?  Will an actuary be called in to build on the present facts and circumstances? How does the Minister envisage a court deciding what will be available <Col N="1688" /> to either spouse in the foreseeable future, whatever that means in those circumstances? It is an unworkable formula and the Minister should seriously consider withdrawing them.</P>
    <P>The point has been made about the conduct aspect of subsection (k).  In fairness to Deputy Shatter and to put matters right &mdash; because I have no doubt that after I sit down we will have some form of rant from Fianna Fáil in relation to the question of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; and &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo;&mdash; I should say that on Committee Stage of the special committee to look into this situation, Deputy Shatter laid the ground very clearly from the point of view of the proponents of this legislation in regard to what was hoped to be achieved with regard to the elements of fault.  At Column 23 of No. 2 report he said that the overall ground of irretrievable breakdown is designed to take some of the conflict and the distress out of the matrimonial court proceedings. It was never maintained that what was being proposed by the proponents of the Bill was an absolute end to the fault concept and an end to the blame basis of the legislation.  However, if it was implemented it would go on a huge distance in taking out that element of contention and rancour.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in attempting to do down this legislation, to take it asunder piece by piece, have tried to point out here and there in the Bill elements that would still require a degree of litigation, rancour and debate.  That point has been well accepted.  One cannot legislate entirely for that situation.  If one is to have true regard to anything that was said by Deputy Shatter in proposing the Bill, the case was never made by its proponents that you could so legislate.  We are all trying to do something to minimise the element of rancour, dissension and unnecessary conflict.  After we had offered so much in that direction and though the Minister has torn it asunder, he came back here with paragraph (k). Whether it is by consent that the order is made and the parties go to court for a judicial separation or whether it is by fault or otherwise that they get as far as <Col N="1689" /> the court, the one inevitable issue that will have to be addressed is that of maintenance but here the Minister has ensured that in every case the element of rancour must be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an unbelievable proposition regarding the conduct of the parties, ill-defined though it is but clear in its intent.  The court will be asked to listen to submissions and evidence of what each of the parties has been up to or is likely to be up to in the foreseeable future if we are to use the Minister's earlier formulas in the section.  The court will be asked to measure out a penny for this, tuppence for that, a pound up or a pound down depending on the conduct of either side.  I would seriously urge the Minister to take that section out entirely. By doing so, his regimen of procedure otherwise contained will not be done any great harm.  He has provided for every other possibility that the court would need to have regard to.  This invidious and undesirable section should be removed from the legislation.  That would make the rest of the pill that much easier to swallow.</P>
    <P>My greatest concern about this whole section is the clear and unambiguous message that Fianna Fáil want to give to the battered wife, battered physically or psychologically &mdash; that is, that she can go to hell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain exactly what I am talking about and the Deputies will listen while I am on my feet.  What Fianna Fáil are saying to women in that position is, first, if they go to court and seek to separate from their husbands they may forget about their succession rights and, secondly, that if in the face of psychological or physical battering at home they leave the house in fear, trepidation or on medical advice they run the serious risk of not being entitled to any maintenance at all.  That is the message that is coming across from what Fianna Fáil are doing in regard to this legislation. It must be recognised that there is a very grave risk involved if a woman departs <Col N="1690" /> the family home in advance of seeking a barring order or making a judicial application which would warrant her to leave.  There must be grave risk that she will have difficulty subsequently in proving to the court that what she did was justified.  She may have been under psychological and physical threat from the bullying husband who is cute and clever enough to ensure that whatever physical injury is imposed does not show by way of detectable mark or otherwise. There are enough sadists and savages in Irish marriages to ensure that that can and will happen.  Fianna Fáil are saying that if these women leave home it is at their own risk, that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, once they leave the home and cannot satisfy the court that they had good reason for doing so they will not get one penny by way of maintenance.  That is a damnable feature of these amendments.</P>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Andrews asking people on this side not to be giggling and sniggering during the course of remarks.  Having listened to the guffaws of the Minister I can only presume that he has no intention of having regard to our concern that the section will stand. So far as the women at risk in Irish family life are concerned, Fianna Fáil want to ensure that nothing will be done for them in the context of marriage breakdown legislation and more particularly in the context of this legislation which they are slowly and systematically taking asunder. It is clear that what they want to put in place is ineffectual legislation that will be so unattractive to beleagured women that they will not want to have anything to do with it.  If they have the courage to take up the issues, go to court and look for consequential entitlements to maintenance, every piece of conduct and every event that has passed between themselves and their husbands will be thrown into the mill of the court in order to make some impact on the maintenance provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plot of Fianna Fáil becomes clearer and clearer.  In the beginning we understood that they had constructive and meaningful intents with regard to this <Col N="1691" /> legislation but that was a long time ago. What they have done since then is to systematically attempt, and indeed succeed in the last number of days, to dismantle this legislation and to render it effectively unworkable and unusable by reason of the amendments we have just passed and are now being asked to agree to in this section.</P>

      <P>I would like to think that the Deputies are not alone still here but are open to change and influence.  As we advance through this Bill it becomes a travesty of everything that was fundamental to it in the first place and, as I have already said, to our expectations regarding it.  It has also been, if I may borrow an adjective from Deputy McCartan, a damnable waste of time. Members of the special committee gave up a great number of hours and days to come in and seriously tackle and talk through the protections and the guarantees contained in the Bill and, thankfully, overrule the most dangerous parts of the amendments then presented to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would never take away from the democracy of this Chamber or of the procedures of the different Stages of legislation, it is quite remarkable, if not unique, that a Bill that has gone through such a thorough Committee Stage should actually be brought back with the exact same amendments which had been so thoroughly discussed and defeated.  It is as if we sat down and engaged in a game of charades and in doing so led people outside this House to believe that legislation would arise from it that would fulfil all the promises made from 1986 onwards which were needed from 1976 and before that.  I take Deputy Ahern's point when he said the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, was not as broad as we would have liked.  It was not as protective as we discovered <Col N="1692" /> it needed to be, particularly when finance agencies were able to force judgment mortgages and remove the protection so hard won by spouses in the home.</P>
    <P>When we talk about spouses in the home, particularly in the Irish context, we can take it that we are talking about women dependent economically and very often psychologically, but at least there was something to built on in the 1976 Act and it was built on slowly and painfully, the emphasis being on &ldquo;slow&rdquo;.  We managed to extend barring orders and attempted to give some weight to the lip service of the Constitution about the value of the work of women in the home, the base of good morality, without which society could not exist and which was so empty before we began to bring in family protection.  However, this Bill's attempt to bring in a sense of civilised behaviour and less acrimony was welcome, and Deputy Shatter referred to that as its planks, particularly for women.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill, particularly in subsections (f), (g), (h) and (i) for the very first time in the experience of women in this State acknowledged full and broadly their contribution, the sacrifices they had made, the cutbacks on their financial independence for the good of others, particularly their husbands and children who are the basic unit of a healthy society, and was accepted by women in the home.  That is why the meddling around with it, the defusing of it, the regressive steps made in it are a matter of such pain to me and other women. What was hard fought for now is being kicked right back by amendments that deflect from everything that was positively on offer at long last.</P>
    <P>Subsection (f) legally acknowledged for the first time &ldquo;the contribution made by each of the parties to the welfare of the family, including any contribution made by looking after the home and caring for the family&rdquo;.  We all have encountered numbers of angry women. A lasting impression of my experience with women in marriage breakdown is of the incredulity with which they realised painfully, where legal complications <Col N="1693" /> entered into marriage breakdown, that unless they had earned for themselves both the contents and the house, the property belonged legally to the breadwinner, the husband.  No value was put on the contributions and sacrifice of the women without whose contribution and sacrifice, we are told, this society could not continue to survive in a healthy and wholesome way.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (g) refers to &ldquo;the contribution made by each party to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other&rdquo;, again a recognition of sharing, a partnership which was never part of the marriage relationship in legal terms up to now. Paragraph (h) refers to &ldquo;the effect on the earning capacity of each of the parties to the marriage of the marital responsibilities assumed by each during the period when the parties cohabited together&rdquo;. That again is a recognition of the responsibilities and the value that could not be financially summed up previously.</P>
    <P>Now we look at the amendments here before us.  I cannot understand or cope with them.  If it was a matter of disagreeing with the wording or phraseology or attempting to improve the legal draftsmanship of the Bill there would be some reason why we should look at them and even attempt to accept them.  I come to one of the most basic worries and anxieties and a real fear that all of us on this side of the House are expressing.  I see, even through the gloom, three practitioners of law on the other side who have had experience of dealing with family law and marriage breakdown. They must understand the difficulties and the disaster if a woman cannot be assured that if she leaves her home she is not going to be accused of desertion.  What took years to build and have legally accepted was that in very difficult, almost life-threatening circumstances women and children could leave their home and have that action termed constructive desertion, but, alas, we never were able, in male courts with male perceptions of what female behaviour should be, to reassure women that mental cruelty, meanness, denial of maintenance within <Col N="1694" /> the home as the woman cohabited with her husband would be fully taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I have lists and letters and we have Irish novels by Irish women to prove that. Now all this that has been so slowly and painfully built up is going to be absolutely thrown over and women will again be forced into fearful &mdash; in its real sense &mdash; conditions of being forced to stay under a roof in the family home because of the threat of what will happen if it is seen or in any way legally prescribed that she has deserted.  I put it particularly to the practitioners of family law across the Chamber that they should take into consideration what they are doing to women again.  I am not into scaremongering.  I know the reality for women and those practitioners should also.  I implore the Minister and his officials to take into consideration the history of women in this country and how inadequate the whole area of desertion was and how devastatingly it is being put back by this attempted amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the subsections that have been proposed to be replaced, I am struck once again by the total lack of reality.  With regard to the opportunities for women, we have a tradition, with its advantages and disadvantages, of ensuring in every way possible that women are pressured to give up work, their own economic independence and their future prospect of earnings, which are totally impinged on when a woman makes that decision and goes into the home to be a good wife and mother. Unfortunately the traditional perception is that she is not rightly representing that role of motherhood, wifehood and housewife unless she gives all that up to become a full time house minder and child minder.  If I can gather anything from the remnants of the travesty of what is before us here, it is to tell women who have not yet given up their work and who have not yet sacrified their independence that they had better hold onto it because they are going to need it.</P>
    <P>However, let us look at the kind of work and the foreseeable earnings of women in the future in the light of <Col N="1695" /> decisions being made on the decree of judicial separation.  Like other speakers, I would like to know what section (b) really means when it speaks of the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the spouses has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future. That teams in very much with subsection (j) to which Deputy Shatter has already made reference.  This is in regard to any earning capacity or increase in earning capacity which it would be reasonable to expect a party to take steps to acquire. Reasonable in whose opinion?  As yet we have not got full acceptance of the concept of equality, much less its implementation.  Yet because it is there in law, if not in fact, it could be expected that women would have to take steps to acquire a job.  It might even go as far as projecting her earnings and her remuneration on the basis that there is equal pay and equal opportunity.  On the basis that the legislation is already here, that would be the logical thing for a judge to do; but the reality is that women's earnings, even those who stay in full time employment, are 60 per cent of men's.  The concept of equal opportunity is seen to be so alien as not to be applicable.  My fear is that all these subsections will be summarised and defined on the basis of similar earnings for men and women, and similar opportunity.  Are we expecting women in their fifties seeking judicial separations and having these subsections applied to them to go out and be assessed in the same way as a 52 or 53 year old man who has been in long term employment?  What concessions are going to be made to allow for the real situation of women?  Women are still in a double bind.  They would be expected to have remuneration of their own or to take steps to acquire it; yet every single structure and every tradition will work against that.</P>
    <P>Now I would like to come to subsection (k) which deserves some comment.  In assessing what shall or what shall not be conceded to each partner, the conduct of each of the spouses will be taken into account in the context of whether it is such that in the opinion of the court it <Col N="1696" /> would be inequitable to disregard it.  I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in saying that that is so wide open that one could drive a coach and eight horses through it.  There is another aspect, that is, that fault &mdash; because that is what we will be looking for and have to under this &mdash; will again be ascribed through very male perceptions.  I do not have to remind Deputies Shatter, Flanagan, Colley and McCartan who have dealt in their political and legal capacities with marriage breakdowns of the way women are treated in it.  I would appeal to the memories and the experience of the practitioners of law who deal with it as well in their areas, in their clinics and in their courts, to acknowledge that this is the third plank of this.  The other two have been pulled out leaving women dangling. This is the only one where women felt they had some sense of recognition and value and it is now being ripped apart.  In all sincerity I would ask Deputies O'Donoghue, Ahern and Abbott to remember the difficulties and the fears, psychological and otherwise that women are experiencing now, and not to add to them by pushing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to place before the House a scenario which I feel will indicate the disservice being done to Irish people, particularly Irish women, by virtue of tonight's amendment&mdash; a husband, say, deserted a wife ten years ago and moved to cohabit with somebody else; the wife, if she is lucky enough, remained in the family home.  Under the law as it stands she has the expectation of inheriting her entitlement to her husband's estate under the Succession Act. Since passing the Minister's amendment here this evening that innocent party has automatically become disinherited without having any hand, act or part in the issue of legal proceedings, without legal proceedings having been served on her because automatically, under the earlier section, if a spouse can show to the satisfaction of the court that he has been living apart from his wife for a period of three years he is then entitled to a decree of <Col N="1697" /> judicial separation.  This indicates a certain disservice that we as a House have engaged in here this evening.</P>
      <P>On the amendments before us particular reference was made by the Minister and previous speakers to section 14 (4) on the question of the court making a determination on property rights once and once only.  What are we saying now about this certainty?  What are we saying now about the need to have a decision and a clean break and to have matters provided for finally?  There is a fundamental contradiction underlying the basis of a number of these amendments which we have not been able in the course of the debate to adequately thrash out.  The Minister should address the question raised by Deputy Shatter, that of <i>res judicata.</i> Will it be open to a court or a member of the judiciary to say to an applicant and a respondent that a court of law has dealt with this matter one year ago, or ten years ago?  We could be tying the hands of the Judiciary in a very unfair way.  As time goes on and the law takes effect we could be going through a minefield in terms of repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we underline the changes the Minister has made in his new section 18 in the hope that it will be not too late to change some of the more questionable points in it.  Subsection (2) (a) deals with the income and earning capacity which each of the spouses is likely to have in the foreseeable future. Is that the type of provision we should be discussing in our courts?  Will it not mean that we will be placing an undue burden on the Judiciary by telling them that they must satisfy themselves as to the future earnings of a party in proceedings for judicial separation?  Will they have to resort to a clairvoyant or other means to get that information?  I hope the Minister will tell us how it is proposed to deal with such practical difficulties.  Subsection (2) (b) refers to the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the spouses has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future.  It will be very difficult to decide on that and it is dangerous to <Col N="1698" /> put such a burden on a judge at a family law court hearing.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (e) refers to the physical or mental disability of either spouse.  I wonder why the Minister has chosen to juggle around the words of that subsection. Let us thrash out the difference between that subsection and what is proposed by Deputy Shatter.  Deputy Shatter envisages that the age and physical and mental health of each of the parties to a marriage be taken into consideration but the Minister refers to any physical or mental disability of either spouse.  Is there a subtle and hidden meaning behind the words used by the Minister that indicates to those reading the provision that they must look for a disability?  Are we saying that they must look for a mental disability and make the point because it will give rise to a saving of a couple of bob per week on the maintenance payment?  Are we saying that in order to ascertain such information sufficient mud must be thrown at the other party?  There has been a subtle change in the wording and it should be reversed to its original form. If I am wrong and am too suspicious the Minister should tell me why he sought it necessary to change Deputy Shatter's provision.  Does it amount to a change for change sake?</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (g) is somewhat vague. It refers to the value to each of the spouses of any share in the estate of the other spouse which a surviving spouse will be precluded from taking as a legal right or on intestacy.  Are we talking about the share at the date of marriage, on the date proceedings are instituted, on the date of the hearing or on the date of the coming into effect of the order? What is meant by that subsection?  It is important that it is clarified and does not give rise to confusion at a later date.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering what the Minister proposed in subsection (2) (j) which states:</P>
    <P>any earning capacity or increase in earning capacity which it would be reasonable to expect a party to take steps to acquire;</P>
    <P>That requires the injured party to take <Col N="1699" /> steps to limit loss.  We could be placing an unfair burden on an injured spouse. A person who seeks redress in the courts may be denied that redress if it is put to him, or her, most likely her having regard to statistics, that the onus is on that party to fend for himself or herself once the decree of judicial separation is granted. Are we going overboard in placing that onus on an injured party?  In my view it will have the effect of frightening a party away from seeking his or her entitlement under law.  A short time into the proceedings a judge may consider it necessary to adjudicate on that issue.</P>
    <P>I did not intend commenting on subsection (2) (k) for no other reason than that it should be treated with contempt in the light of what has been said.  We are now back to concerning ourselves about the conduct of each spouse.  Whatever about the issue of fault or no fault or the quickie separation a decree of separation cannot be granted without mud being thrown, without parties being painted blacker than black in order to minimise the amount of maintenance or the share of one party's entitlement.  We are doing a great disservice to parties by introducing this adversarial concept.  No attempt is being made by the Minister in his amendment to minimise the adversarial nature of the proceedings.  I view that as a deliberate attempt to discourage people from using this legislation.  The format of the Bill has been changed so much since 11 o'clock this morning that I am left wondering if we should proceed with it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct to say that my amendments are merely a rerun of Deputy Shatter's provisions.  To a certain extent they are but in many important respects they include necessary and important additions which I have already fully explained.  In brief, the court will be empowered to order the transfer of property for the benefit of dependent children.  Secondly, it could order the payment of a lump sum to a spouse and children by instalments and the security of those payments.  Thirdly, it will have <Col N="1700" /> expressed powers to order the sale of property.  Deputy Shatter has introduced an amendment to correct this latter omission and this amendment, for the most part, is based on the amendment I introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>In regard to the making of property transfer orders, the objection I had to Deputy Shatter's proposal was that once a court considered the question of a property transfer order, whether or not it made an order, it could not consider the matter again.  That was the specific prohibition on the court, not to consider the matter again.  There is no need for such a prohibition and my proposals have no such prohibition.  Deputy Shatter said that my amendment does not include the provision in section 17 (g) of his Bill. That is not correct.  My amendments in the new section 18 (2) (f) covers the point clearly.  It provides that a court may consider the contributions which each of the spouses has made or is likely in the foreseeable future to make to the welfare of the family including any contribution by looking after the home or caring for the family.  The general provision relating to contributions to the welfare of the family covers all the possible ways a spouse may contribute to the welfare of the family, including all the cases mentioned by Deputy Shatter and including the contribution made by a farmer's wife, say, to the running of the farm.  My new section 18 (2) (h) also relates to the contribution the spouse has made by relinquishing her chance of remunerative activity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter referred to section 18 (2) (j) of the amendment.  There will be cases where there will be two professional people and no children where it would only be right for the court to take into account any earning capacity which it would be reasonable to expect a party to take steps to acquire.  Of course every case would have to be dealt with on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter and Deputy Taylor raised the question of the loss of succession rights again.  This matter has already been discussed in full and there is no point in going over the old ground <Col N="1701" /> again.  A vote has been taken by the House and I am sure that that is recognised by all.  The Deputies are aware that following the acceptance by this House of my amendment on succession rights, subsection (2) (g) of the new section 18 is a consequential provision.  I do not intend to be drawn any further by Deputy Shatter's contribution concerning succession rights in general and the provisions in subsection (2) (g).</P>
    <P>In regard to matters of conduct Deputy Shatter seems to have forgotton the fact that he had conduct rules in relation to maintenance.  He also had conduct rules in relation to succession.  What he did not have in his Bill were conduct rules relating to lump sum or property transfer orders.  That particular omission has not been explained.  Deputy Taylor expressed some worries about my new section 17 regarding orders for the sale of property.  Deputy Shatter, incidentally, has a similar amendment.  The first point to be made is that, these orders would be ancillary orders to orders for secured maintenance for lump sums or for property transfer orders.  I recognise the point made by Deputy Taylor but I do not think we can fetter the powers of the court in this matter.  There will be little risk of unnecessary or oppressive orders being made.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan inquired about section 18 (2) (a).  What we are talking about here are the needs of the spouse now and in the future.  The most urgent need is often for a secure home and in that regard the court is to consider not only the present but all the foreseeable future as far as it reasonably can.  Where there are young children, the need to care for them will directly affect the financial needs of the custodial parent &mdash; usually the mother &mdash; for some time in the future.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Barnes, that my new approach to this Bill has been consistent at all times during the debates on it.  On Second Stage and again on Committee Stage, while welcoming the principle of the Bill, I expressed my reservations in relation to certain aspects of it and my amendments have reflected those concerns.  This Bill has no provision <Col N="1702" /> about a spouse's conduct being a matter for consideration by the court when making property or lump sum orders and I think that is an extraordinary omission. I do not know of a similar omission in any other jurisdiction.  My proposal that the court should take into account the conduct, where it would be inequitable to disregard it, is the minimum required. However, where there has been desertion, I propose that it should be an absolute bar to obtaining benefits under the financial provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have to be clear about what desertion is.  Not only must there by a physical separation but there must be an intention on the part of the spouse in desertion to bring the matrimonial union permanently to an end.  In other words, one spouse must intend to destroy the marriage.  In our law at present, desertion operates as a bar to maintenance and the Bill seeks to change this under the Family Home Protection Act and to statutory rights of succession under the Succession Act, 1965.  I would like to remind the members of the House that those two measures were initiated by both Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments.  My proposal that a spouse who deserts should not be able to claim support or rights of succession from the deserted spouse, is in line with the policy behind the existing statutory provisions which is to the effect that a spouse who repudiates a marriage should not, in justice, be entitled to claim support from the other spouse.  No good reason has been advanced for departing from that long-standing policy.  Of course, desertion does not include the case where a spouse, because of the others behaviour, has a just cause for leaving the other spouse.  In that case, it is the spouse who remains who may in fact be in desertion.  That is in constructive desertion, as it is called.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister sits down, he might answer one question. How many times does the Minister say, under his provisions, a spouse can make an application for either lump sum payments or property transfer orders?  The case was made that any such number of <Col N="1703" /> applications could be made.  I think we are entitled to clarification on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of <i>res judicare</i> I would refer the Deputies to subsection (1) of my new section 18 which states:</P>
      <P>In deciding whether to exercise its powers under section 14, 15 or 16... and, if so, in what manner, the court shall seek to ensure that such provision is made for any spouse and for any dependent child of the family as is adequate and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because that duty is being imposed on the court, the court must be able to review the situation if the needs of a spouse demand it.  The court could not do that as it stands.  As an alternative to making a property transfer order or a second property order the court would be in a position under my amendments, <Col N="1704" /> and under the Bill, to make a lump sum order or a secured maintenance order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to continue with my reply to the Second Stage debate. On Part VI of the Bill Deputy Bruton suggested that to avoid situations where creditors might be misinformed and agree to a voluntary liquidation, all voluntary liquidations should be subject to a declaration of solvency requirement.  I should explain here that there are two kinds of voluntary winding ups, a members' voluntary winding up and a creditors' voluntary winding up.  The essential difference between the two is that a members' voluntary winding up is only available if the company is in fact solvent.  Therefore, since most creditors' voluntary winding ups occur where companies are insolvent in any event a requirement to have a declaration of solvency in such cases would be inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also on Part VI Deputy Bruton along with a number of other Deputies raised a number of detailed points on section 116 which introduces the new civil concept of reckless trading.  I recognise that this is a particularly tricky area and one that needs a lot of teasing out.  For that reason there was a substantial debate on that section in the Seanad and I am sure that will be repeated in this House.  I should also tell the House that the section concerned was amended by the Seanad in an effort to clarify more exactly what the Bill is driving at with this new concept. As a result of that amendment section 116 is now much clearer. However, the various matters arising can of course be further teased out on Committee Stage.  I would say at this stage that I do not share the Deputies' concerns <Col N="1708" /> as to the likely effects of the section concerned on the creditors of a company or on its ability to attract directors to its board.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the question of the preferential status of the Revenue. They raised the familiar question of the preferential position of the Revenue Commissioners in the winding up of a company and asked that this be abolished or substantially reduced.  This issue was also debated at some length in the Seanad and a commitment was given in that House to give the matter the fullest consideration. That consideration is still going on and I would say that I hope to conclude the examination concerned at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>Also on Part VI, Deputy Lowry said that certain difficulties can arise in bringing dishonest directors to court.  The most obvious cases would be where there were insufficient finances available within the company to do so.  To help overcome this problem he suggested that a fund should be created to enable liquidators to pursue dishonest directors.  Deputy McDowell made the related point that there should be a statutory division of the assets of a company in liquidation in somewhat the same way as applies to inheritance under the Succession Act.</P>
    <P>Taking Deputy Lowry's point first I should say that section 299 of the Principal Act already obliges liquidators in the course of winding up companies to report any suspected wrongdoing by directors or shareholders of the company concerned to the DPP.  Section 153 of the present Bill proposes a similar duty for receivers.  Secondly, the imposition of a charge spread over the whole business community to create a fund for use in circumstances where the receiver or liquidator did not have sufficient resources in the company to pursue the directors would not be something to be lightly taken on board.  It would not only involve a direct additional cost on industry but its administration would also involve making resources available at a further consequent cost.  Finally, with the overall tightening up of the provisions in the Bill relating to the operation of companies <Col N="1709" /> the necessity for a fund as suggested by Deputy Lowry should not be as great in the future.</P>
    <P>Turning to Deputy McDowell's point, this would have dramatic effects on the existing relationships which exist between companies and those who provide finance to the companies, either members, shareholders or lending institutions as well as creditors.  The circumstances of each company liquidation which occurs vary so much that such a rigid arrangement would result in a major reassessment of trading relationships. This is something I would not be inclined to consider at this stage.</P>
    <P>On Part VII of the Bill a number of Deputies suggested that a black list of restricted or disqualified directors should be available to ensure that people establishing companies did not invite disqualified people on to the board.  The suggestion was also made that all companies, both public and private, should have minimum capitalisation requirements. I should clarify that under the 1983 Companies Act the minimum authorised capital of a public limited company is already £30,000.  However, if we went on to require a certain minimum capital from private companies also I wonder if this would have the effect of discouraging the very enterprise we all agree is so badly needed in this country.  Our approach to this, on the other hand, was rather more limited.  All section 128 does is say that if one is a director of a company which goes into liquidation and cannot pay its debts then before one can start up again the new company will have to meet the minimum capital requirements set out in section 128.</P>
    <P>As regards the register of restricted or disqualified directors, I should point out that the Registrar of Companies will, under sections 128 and 135, be notified of the names of every person to whom these sections apply and he will be in a position to monitor the directorships of new companies or any change in the directors of an existing company.  Obviously, the registrar would have discretion about the manner of making available to <Col N="1710" /> the public any information he gets under this subsection.</P>
    <P>Deputies Cullen, Mac Giolla and Dempsey, among others, gave examples of directors who so organise their affairs that new companies are formed before the old ones which have run up massive debts are liquidated.  These Deputies will be interested to learn that, following publication of the Bill, company directors were encouraged by certain parties, even before the Bill came into operation, to protect themselves from the proposals contained in section 128 by setting up shelf companies now which could be used at a later stage if the company with which the director was already involved went into liquidation.  We became aware of this proposal and section 128 closes that particular loophole.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that most Deputies welcomed the provisions dealing with what I might call &ldquo;outright disqualification&rdquo; of directors, although Deputy Lowry expressed concern that a director of a company which goes into liquidation for perfectly legitimate reasons might be victimised under the provisions of this Part of the Bill which provide for the automatic disqualification of a director following conviction.  I should point out that these automatic disqualification provisions will in general only operate where a director has been convicted and found guilty of a serious offence involving fraud or dishonesty and obviously this is something we will stand over.</P>
    <P>On Part VIII of the Bill, Deputy Bruton thought that section 149 could actually militate against a receiver obtaining the best price for company property in that his valuation of the assets would be known to the potential purchaser. While the section does place a duty on the receiver to prepare a statement of affairs, the fact remains that in the valuation of assets, which was the case instanced by Deputy Bruton, the receiver would more than likely avail of the services of a professional valuer.  Subsequently, when disposing of assets, he <Col N="1711" /> would be obliged to exercise all reasonable care to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable.  After all, a valuation is simply one person's estimate of what an asset is likely to realise.  In practice, the market dictates what will be realised on the sale of such an asset and reflects such matters as interest, scarcity, location and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Donoghue thought that receivers should in general take more account of the interests of employees.  I should tell the Deputy that this has been addressed by section 146 of the Bill, which was amended in the Seanad to allow employees to apply to the court for directions as to the manner in which the receiver is carrying out, or indeed is not carrying out, his functions.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies welcomed the general aims and ideas behind Part IX of the Bill although some expressed reservations about the cost aspects of the new rescue system we are proposing here.  Some others &mdash; for example, Deputy Swift &mdash; expressed concern about the shortness of the period during which the debts of a company would be frozen following the appointment of an examiner.</P>
    <P>Taking Deputy Swift's point first, the period during which a company can be under the protection of the court will in most cases be three months but in exceptional cases may be extended to four months.  However, rather than being a disadvantage I think this is one of the major attractions of the rescue proposals in Part IX of the Bill since it will tend to concentrate people's minds on what needs to be done.  Thus, it will not have the disadvantage attributed to the American &ldquo;Chapter XI&rdquo; system which we understand can often run on indefinitely. There is a definite time period in Part IX of the Bill and I think it would be wise to stick to it.  I also want to make the general point that much consideration went into designing the proposals in Part IX.  They have been so structured as to involve the least possible resort to the courts and the speediest possible operation of each appointment.</P>
    <P>This is an innovative measure so far as <Col N="1712" /> company law in this country is concerned and it deserves every opportunity to see if it will operate successfully.  At the same time, if there are ways and means in which it can be improved still further I will be only too willing to listen to them. Indeed, this was certainly the case in the Seanad where Part IX was radically overhauled and improved following many suggestions to that effect which we openly received.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is obvious that a scheme along these lines is not only desirable but necessary.  It will give companies in financial difficulties but which have a long term future the necessary breathing space to sort out their problems.  I have no doubt that Deputies in this House as well as myself and others know of companies which could have been kept in business and jobs saved if such a provision existed in company law.</P>
    <P>On Part X of the Bill, most Deputies welcomed the efforts to raise the general standard of account-keeping within companies, although Deputy Bruton wondered whether this would involve every company having to have an accountant on its board, leading to increased company costs.  I think we would have to accept that compliance with the new requirements may involve some additional expense for companies.  On the other hand, there is ample evidence in recent times that many companies have become particularly lax in keeping proper accounts &mdash; indeed all one has to do is to ask company liquidators what their general experience is in this regard, to confirm this.  What we are saying is this: there is no substitute for proper accounts and management information systems and many a good company would still be around today if they had paid proper attention to this aspect of their affairs.</P>
    <P>Taking this one step further, if the poor records kept by a company contributes to its ultimate demise, I see nothing wrong in allowing a creditor who suffers loss as a result to seek compensation from directors who have contributed to that loss by failing to keep proper accounts. Section 200 does no more than that and indeed includes a number of tests that a <Col N="1713" /> court would have to be satisfied about before it could make a declaration under that section.  All in all, if the provisions of Part X of this Bill achieve the desired improvement in the standard of account-keeping generally then this House can be well satisfied.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that the restrictions on access to the privilege of limited liability should not be confined to directors of companies which go into liquidation in that directors could evade these restrictions by not formally winding-up the company.  Section 207 of the Bill is aimed at dealing with the type of abuse mentioned by the Deputy.  It provides that certain provisions of this Bill and the Principal Act can be applied to companies even though they are not being formally wound up.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley said that present take-over panel arrangements in relation to mergers involving Irish companies were unacceptable and would need to be addressed by way of amendment of the present Bill or the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978. While I appreciate that the matter mentioned by the Deputy is very topical at present, I am sure he will share my view that it is more appropriate for consideration separate from the present Companies Bill.  Indeed, in this regard I wish to say that preliminary discussions have already taken place with interested parties in regard to the future role of the panel in Ireland.  I will certainly bear the Deputy's comments in mind in relation to the matter.  I believe all of us and the public at large feel totally dissatisfied at recent events in this regard.  I can assure the House that the discussions which have started are for real.  We have involved the Central Bank, the Stock Exchange and many other interests in the discussions and these will continue in the hope that they will produce an appropriate solution to the situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley also said, in welcoming the indication that proposals to provide for purchase of own shares by a company will be brought forward by way of Committee Stage amendment, that he would like to see copies of the scheme at <Col N="1714" /> an early stage.  As the Deputy remarked, this is a particularly involved proposal and the details of the scheme are being finalised.  I wish to assure the Deputy that I will bring the scheme before the House at the earliest opportunity.  It is a innovation in company law and there are concerns about it but I am also concerned that, at least, Irish companies can operate under the same ground rules and be afforded the same opportunities and as we look towards 1992 that they are given the opportunity to purchase their own shares, not just to be able to purchase them as such, but to ensure that the proper safeguards are fully in place before this goes through.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the general thrust of the Bill, many Deputies said that companies must not be deterred from taking risks, and that it was vital that the Bill should strike a proper balance between curbing abuses on the one hand, and not restricting normal business practice on the other.  This is precisely the point that we have been at pains to emphasise throughout the whole debate on the present Bill.  It is absolutely essential that the right balance be struck here, and in this regard all suggestions that will help to ensure that this is achieved have been, and will continue to be, fully, fairly and carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I would like, finally, to thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their excellent contributions to the debate.  I hope the House will understand that I could not hope to cover all the points that were made.  Indeed, I know that my reply has been on the long side, but so many points were made by Deputies that I felt I had to reply to as many of them as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in <Col N="1715" /> thinking that there is a provision in the Bill which provides that a person who has been a director of another company which was wound up leaving a list of unpaid debts behind it cannot be a director of a new company unless the paid-up capital of the new company is at least £10,000?  If that is right, does the Minister think that that will be a discouragement to anybody who has failed and wants to set up a sham company to trade again without any chance of succeeding a second time?</P>

      <P>Arising directly out of what the Minister has said about the possibility of amending the Mergers and Monopolies Act, 1978, given the new context that now exists, I think that he expressed the view that it would be better to do this by way of a separate amending Bill rather than as part of this Bill.  Does he propose to bring in such a Bill shortly? Secondly, if he does, is it proposed to deal with the takeover panel problem in that Bill, or to deal with it by some administrative arrangement or agreement separately from legislation?</P>

This practice, if it become embedded on the part of advisers to creditors, could have a very serious effect in discouraging people from becoming directors of companies at all, particularly directors who come in as non-executive directors to help to rescue companies&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was speaking on this subject the last day, I raised the question about the extent of the duty that is placed on auditors under section 35 of this Bill.  I repeat the question whether the penalty provisions in section 3 applied to it or not.  If not, how in general terms is it intended to enforce it because of the fairly subjective element which is predominant in that section, even though I greatly welcome the section and wish that it had been there perhaps some years ago.</P>
      <P>One of the major events that one can foresee in the reasonably near future in this country, that will have a significant effect on insurance generally and on the insurance market, is the advent of product liability.  This debate so far does not seem to have dealt with what the insurance consequences of product liability are likely to be.  Under the Directive that has been passed in Brussels the liability on manufacturers is a very considerable one.  The liability that can potentially attach to Irish manufacturers is very substantial, indeed.  It is necessary, and vital indeed, for them to have proper insurance cover against that liability. Proper cover may well be extremely expensive if one is to go by the premium levels for liability insurance generally in recent years &mdash; motor, employers' and public liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to Second Stage the Minister should deal in some detail with this matter because I do not know of any single foreseeable event that is likely to have as great an influence on the insurance market here in the next few years.  It is necessary to remind ourselves of what the position is in the United States where they have had this form of product liability for a while and where the costs frequently associated with it for manufacturing companies are, frankly, astronomical.  Many companies in the United States are able to survive because of their sheer size and wealth but a great many Irish companies will never be in a <Col N="1719" /> position to survive claims of that type. The problem may not be as great because of the recent abolition of juries, but it is too early yet to make any real assessment of the effect of that in practice.</P>
    <P>I might add, since it is very much tied in with the issue of insurance, that I keep reading inspired comments put into newspapers by people who do not like what has happened saying that the abolition of juries has not made any difference to the cost of insurance.  I see that even barristers are running to local provincial newspapers telling them that it has not made any difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think we are in a position to judge its effects as yet because it has only been in operation since 1 October 1988 and the number of cases is very small indeed.  I am not aware of any outrageous award having been made by a judge since, and if one were to look at juries, at the very limited way in which they have operated in civil cases on this island in recent weeks, one can only say thank God they have been abolished in almost all civil actions.  The last jury decision that I read of on this island was made two or three weeks ago in Belfast in favour of Messrs.  McCartney and Bowe where they each received from a jury a sum of £50,000 sterling, which is a total approximately of IR£120,000 plus costs, which probably will amount to not less than £50,000 for a most ridiculous so called defamation, in which the newspaper said they had some slight verbal altercation outside the window of a cake shop in Bangor, County Down &mdash; I think &mdash; and had some minor argument about which of them was to be entitled to buy the last éclair in the window.  If that is worth £100,000 sterling in the eyes of a jury I think the right decision was made in this House last May or June.</P>

      <P>Miss Koo Stark has also been the beneficiary of a jury. However, the fields in which she dabbles are more difficult to assess and quite different from the question of the éclair in County Down.  Obviously, it will take a couple of years before we get to a stage where a proper assessment can be made. I am very glad that this step has been taken in regard to juries.  Apart from the cost of insurance, the very necessity to try to achieve justice is better served by what has happened.  Even though there may be vested interests at work to try to undo the benefit of the legislation, I hope that on calmer reflection they will not try to impede its operation in any way.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the question of payment of commissions by insurers.  While I cannot vouch that it is the same word for word, it is certainly similar in intent to a Bill I introduced in 1982 to try to cope with the problem, that arose at that time, of the payment of extraordinarily excessive rates of commission by some life assurance companies to brokers and to other intermediaries. It was not necessary in 1982 to proceed with the Bill through all stages, because its introduction and Second Reading was enough to make the companies concerned realise they were not going to get away with what they were doing and they voluntarily stopped the practice.  I was then able to withdraw the Bill.  But I fully support its re-introduction as Part III of this Bill.  It is important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have these powers in case this practice were resorted to again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may surprise people to learn that the rate of commission paid by a number of life companies in this country at that time was 130 per cent of the premium.  In some small number of cases the commission was as high as 150 per cent of the premium. The person who suffered most by that rather outrageous level of commission was the consumer, the person taking out the insurance.  The overall premium he had to pay annually reflected this exorbitant rate of commission which was being paid by a limited number of <Col N="1721" /> life companies who were operating here at the time.</P>
    <P>I find it a bit surprising that a voluntary agreement entered into in 1982 between the life assurance companies as a result of the Bill that I had brought in here in that year has recently been found by the European Commission to be in breach of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome, as inhibiting inter-state competition.  The purpose of that agreement was to put a limit on the maximum percentage which could be paid in commission on both life and non life insurance premia.  I think the Commission in deeming that agreement invalid have taken a very theoretical view of competition and competition policy but I do not think that what they are doing is in the consumers' interests.  Clearly, it would have been in the consumers' interests that such an agreement was maintained to prevent excessive commission being paid.  What clearly would not be in the consumers' interests would be an agreement between companies that they were going to keep commission above a particular level or that they were going to enter into a cartel arrangement. Strangely enough, the Commission is doing the very opposite and for that reason it is all the more vital that Part III be there because they cannot find the provisions of this Bill to be in breach of Article 85, if it is part of national legislation affecting all those who are trading within the jurisdiction.  That is why it is particularly important that it should be there at this stage.</P>
    <P>An aspect of insurance which is not specifically referred to in the Bill, but which certainly needs some consideration, not just by the Minister for Health but by the Minister for Industry and Commerce also, is the whole vexed and sorry question of health insurance. We are aware of the tremendous difficulties now being encountered by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. While there are several reasons for its present unfortunate difficulties, one of the reasons is that the Act which governs it, the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1956, is very limited in terms of what it <Col N="1722" /> allows the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board should be treated and allowed to trade as any other insurance company.  They would extend their categories of risks thereby in a way that would be helpful to them and that would perhaps avoid or <Col N="1723" /> alleviate the severe difficulties they have encountered in the health insurance field in the past two years.</P>
      <P>There has been talk of other insurance companies, who at present are precluded by the 1956 Act from writing health insurance here except of a very limited kind, coming here to write insurance in competition with the VHI, who at present have a monopoly.  I have seen some of the correspondence which has been, as one might expect, with the Department of Industry and Commerce and subsequently with the Department of Health.  The companies concerned thought it appropriate to correspond with the regulatory authority here, which is the Department of Industry and Commerce. It would be unwise and totally unfair if companies like that were allowed in here at the present time, given the way the hands of the VHI are tied.  If on the other hand the VHI were given a free hand to operate in the way any other insurance company can operate, I would then welcome that competition, provided it was fair and equal and that those coming in were not allowed simply to take the choicer risks by insuring only the health of younger and healthier people, leaving the more expensive risks of elderly people to the VHI.  Major changes will have to happen in this field and consideration of them should certainly not be confined to the Minister for Health. The issues at stake are very broad.  Apart from widening the field in which they should be allowed to operate as an insurance company, the VHI should be given power, for example, to acquire and run hospitals if they think it appropriate. I believe the VHI have been anxious to do so and I can well understand the reason.  It seems incredible that they own no hospital or part of a hospital in this country, whereas one of their big potential competitors from Britain, BUPA, who are not allowed to trade here at present, have the majority stake in one of the largest and most expensive of the modern private hospitals here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1724" /> Part IV of the Bill deals with the question of the regulation of insurance intermediaries. Some aspects of this are controversial and different people have different points of view, depending on their own particular interests.  I am sure some people are not very happy with Part IV as it stands, but I believe it provides a reasonable way of dealing with the problem.  It is rather different from what it was when originally introduced in the Seanad.  The Third Schedule, for example, has been removed and various qualifications which were originally required are gone.  It is a reasonable way of trying to approach it.  It is not perfect but it is probably as good as we can get, given the various competing interests.  In particular I am glad that the English concept of polarisation of agencies into one has not been introduced.  That would have been quite inappropriate, although I understand there was pressure from the brokers for this to be done.  It would not have served the interests of the consumer, particularly in rural areas where it is very important that he be given as wide a choice as possible by whatever agent he is dealing with.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV deal with the question of commission and the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  There is one point which is not dealt with in the Bill, although I thought it might have been. That is the question of controlling in some fashion the relatively new concept of services charges which has been introduced by intermediaries.  A broker, in addition to bring remunerated by the company by way of a percentage commission on the premium can, under our existing law, add a service charge to the gross premium and send the bill for the total amount to the customer.  He is not obliged to disclose the amount of the service charge and frequently customers who are insured do not know that there is a service charge.  If they are aware of it, they often do not know how much it is.  I do not know if it is desirable to let that situation continue.  Some years ago an order was introduced in the Seanad to control that practice.  It was during the term of the previous Government.  The order was <Col N="1725" /> passed in the Seanad but never introduced in this House.  As a result it did not become law since to do so it would have had to pass through both Houses. The Government apparently had second thoughts about it, perhaps as a result of representations made to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the position is in that regard and what proposals or thoughts the Minister has.  I am not advocating that the practice should be outlawed, but the amount of the charge should certainly be disclosed.  I am informed that in some cases the service fee can be as much as 50 per cent of the premium, which is very much higher than justified.  In the great majority of cases it is very much less than that and many brokers do not charge it at all.  I think there are many classes of business in which it is not charged either.  It tends to be charged on motor insurance to people who find it difficult to get cover.  The premium which may already be excessive is made much more so if a charge of that kind is added to it.</P>
    <P>The main part of this Bill is Part II which deals with the supervision of insurance companies in some detail.  I agree with its provisions and there are many points of detail where perhaps it could just as easily be done somewhat differently but some choice has to be made about how you do it and I do not see any serious reason for disagreement with the general scheme now proposed for supervision.  It is a great improvement on the position up to now.  In particular, I refer to sections 16, 17 and 18 which give the Minister general powers to acquire information, to carry out investigations and to intervene in cases of doubtful solvency. They set out in some detail how he goes about that and what he can do.  I agree with all these proposals which are, by and large, reasonable as they increase his powers and all the rest of it.</P>
    <P>However, you must look at how these things operate in practice.  It is not just a question of setting them out in sections in a Bill and seeing if they look all right. How do they operate in practice?  If any kind of investigation is carried out under sections 16, 17 and 18 and it becomes <Col N="1726" /> known that it is being carried out, that immediately and of itself has an effect on the company concerned.  There is a tremendous sensitivity about these matters. One suggestion I make to the Minister in relation to these sections is to try to give the impression that these are routine things and that they can or should go on virtually every year.  He should not distinguish between something that is routine and something that is done because he believes there is a danger of insolvency or of under provision for claims.</P>
    <P>You will see what I mean by section 16 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers it necessary in order to satisfy himself whether an undertaking is complying with its obligations under the Insurance Acts, he may require the undertaking to prepare and submit to him....</P>
    <P>Section 17 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers it necessary in order to satisfy himself whether an undertaking is complying, or has the ability to continue to comply....</P>
    <P>Section 18 (1) states:</P>
    <P>If the Minister has reason to believe&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that an undertaking is or may be unable to meet its liabilities or</P>
    <P>(b)  that an undertaking whose head office is in the State is or may be unable to provide the required solvency margin....</P>
    <P>The Minister may intervene in a case of doubtful solvency.  However, if he is known to be intervening under section 18, he puts the whole world on notice that it is a case of doubtful solvency.  I had to struggle with that problem for quite a while and therefore, I realise how difficult it is at times even if the law is fully adequate to act under it without causing huge damage.</P>
    <P>The Minister is given powers under these three sections, basically, to withdraw the licence or authorisation if he is <Col N="1727" /> not satisfied as a result of his investigation, either to withdraw generally or to withdraw it in respect of any particular class of business.  Short of that, he does not have a great sanction.  That again was one of the difficultes I faced, you either went the whole way and put them out of business or you were powerless.  I would not be averse to withdrawing the licence or authorisation from a company for a particular class of business if I was not going to distort or disturb the entire market.  That is grand if you are dealing with a company who have 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the market in a particular class of business but if you are dealing with a company that had 45 per cent or 50 per cent of a market and all the other operators in the market did not want any part of the market anyway, then you would cause devastation.  For that reason, it is very important that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at all times would keep under close scrutiny the precise shares of the market held in each class of business by each company operating in it.  Naturally, I am talking about non-life business because the problem does not really arise in respect of life business.</P>
    <P>There are classes of business where it is particularly undesirable that any company should have more than, at the very outside, 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the market.  In something like motor insurance, I would prefer to see nobody having more than about 12 per cent of the market because if problems arise in relation to somebody with more than that it can cause major repercussions throughout the entire market in something that is very difficult and sensitive.  I faced that problem in the early eighties and it ultimately caused that particular company to go under.  It was dealt with under the 1983 Act but it is an expensive way of dealing with it.  As far as one can judge by the statements of the administrator and others, it looks as if it will be more or less indefinite, the administrator mentioned a period of ten years before he can get out of the situation.  He also said that, for the whole of that ten years, the levy <Col N="1728" /> which is paid to him by the customers of every other company will have to continue. That is very unsatisfactory facing into 1992 which will mean freedom of services.  Better and more prudent Irish companies are afflicted with these levies because two companies were run imprudently. It was a cruel blow to properly run Irish companies &mdash; other than the PMPA and the ICI &mdash; who have to collect money to pay to people who are now running these two formerly insolvent companies in competition with the people who are collecting the money.  That is a severe handicap and a cruel quirk of fate. It certainly makes it very difficult for those kind of companies to think in terms of overseas markets and trying to resist the pressures that will be on them when freedom of services arrive during the nineties and they are open to full competition from people who do not have to establish here and who do not have to obey the local rules.</P>
    <P>The local rules are disadvantageous to companies practising here and to those who may operate in the market from offices or establishments abroad without establishing themselves in this market, as they will be free to do.  The kind of disadvantages are the 2 per cent levy which has been brought about as a result of the insolvencies of the PMPA and ICI, the 1 per cent tax on premiums which does not apply anywhere else, the higher rate of corporation tax that applies here to companies and the inability of companies here &mdash; unlike their competitors in the Community &mdash; to defer liability to tax on profits which are allocated to contingency reserve funds designed to meet prudent solvency levels.</P>
    <P>Even though there will soon be a welcome and very marked dropping of the exchange control requirements generally for the movement of capital within the Community &mdash; as and from 1 January next &mdash; the rule affecting companies about the investment of 80 per cent of their reserves here has not, apparently, been changed or affected by the change in the exchange control regulations.  I wonder if that is fair to companies.  These reserves are not just supposed to lie <Col N="1729" /> there.  For many companies, the way in which they have invested their reserves has meant the difference between profit and loss because many of them have been operating for a long time on the basis of an underwriting loss.  You cannot put them at an unfair disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other companies who are making investments. In particular you cannot put them at an unfair disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other insurance companies within the Community who are not subject to those kinds of restrictions or penalties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill even though some of it is of fairly ancient lineage.  As I have said, I recognise some of it from six and a half years ago in this House.  Nonetheless, all the provisions in it are by and large welcome even though in some cases a different provision might be just as effective but not necessarily better.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in reply to some of the points I have raised and some of the questions I have asked.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage.  It is important that at least parts of it that are urgent would be enacted into law as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister, in his introductory statement, outlined the role of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the insurance industry and action needed to improve the overall environment affecting the Irish insurance market.  For a number of years I have received a barrage of complaints from individuals, small firms and trade associations regarding the high cost of insurance.  These complaints reflect a mood of anger, bitterness and incomprehension as to why a basic business service such as insurance should have, in a short space of time, become so costly and sometimes so difficult to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern regarding this Bill and regarding insurance generally is the cost factor and what the consumer has gone through over the years.  The abolition by the Government of the use of civil juries in personal injury cases and fatal accident cases in the High Court was a major step in the right direction.  I <Col N="1730" /> compliment the Minister for Justice and the officials in his Department for their assistance in this regard.  In 1986 I spoke in the Seanad on insurance and insurance problems.  I will quote from that speech of 16 October 1986:</P>
    <P>This realisation and the reforms necessary will not come from the Courts themselves.  The Department of Justice, who have the ultimate responsibility for courts administration, must intervene to ensure that changes are brought about including the abolition of the three counsel rule and settlements on the steps.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Government have responded in a very positive manner to that request in the interests of the industry and the consumer.  When I spoke on that matter in 1986 I continued many of the problems in relation to insurance costs and in many cases the unavailability of insurance cover for many of our small business and firms.</P>
    <P>I have gathered statistics in relation to insurance and its availability.  I discovered that during the late seventies and the early eighties the increase in employers' liability premiums was on average 280 per cent while inflation over the same period rose by 23.9 per cent. I also discovered that some individual employers experienced increases at that time of between 300 and 400 per cent. These figures came from a survey of FUE members.  The Irish Caravan Council stated that the feedback they had received from a representative selection of their members would indicate that the cost of public liability insurance had increased by as much as 400 per cent over a period of three years.  The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland stated that they had experienced an increase of 50 per cent for professional indemnity insurance.  Many firms would have experienced an increase of 100 per cent over a two year period.  RGDATA stated that premium increases from 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent for property insurance were being experienced by many retailers at that time.</P>
    <P>Up to recently, we have experienced a <Col N="1731" /> prolonged recession among small firms right across the business.  We have witnessed closures and job losses.  We have seen small firms fighting for survival in the face of weak markets, intense competition, onerous levels of taxation and increasing commercial rates.  These firms also had to cope with massive increases in insurance premiums.  The situation had deteriorated to such an extent that many firms could no longer afford adequate cover.  I consider this a very serious matter.  Thank God we are coming to the end of this recession and there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Something had to be done to put insurance on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>The result was that this involved implications for the competitiveness of our manufacturing industry.  The situation had become so bad that premium rates for employers' liability were 5.5 times higher in this country than in Britain.  To my knowledge this claim has not been refuted either by the Department of Industry and Commerce or by the insurance companies themselves.  Many small firms were unable to obtain insurance at reasonable costs and this increased the risk inherent in start-ups and, in the case of employers' liability, proved to be a disincentive to increasing employment.  We are all fully aware of the lack of jobs in this country.  Yet there are difficulties in obtaining employers' liability cover at affordable premium rates and this is a real disincentive to new employment.</P>
    <P>However, side by side with this unacceptable situation there is the irony that employers' liability insurance is not compulsory. It is regrettable that only third party insurance is compulsory.  Many employers who did not have cover have lost their entire business either through legal action for personal injuries to an employee or, for instance, where a serious fire took place.  An employee working in an uninsured or an under-insured firm would be in an extremely vulnerable position in the event of a serious accident.  He runs the risk of long term incapacity with the prospect of little <Col N="1732" /> or no compensation.  We cannot allow this to continue.</P>
    <P>In the past year I have witnessed a situation whereby many small farmers who had serious fires in their yards lost their entire stock of hay and did not have any cover at all.  On top of that they received a huge bill for fire brigade services, a bill they could not pay.  It is a pity the public are not fully aware of the implications of not having adequate cover.  However, if people were given the incentive to insure they would do so.</P>
    <P>Employers' liability is one form of liability cover.  Many small firms in catering and retail have to cope with the growing problem of claims from customers for damages regarding public liability, even in the case of the most trivial of accidents. Professional people have to come to terms with the growing cost of professional indemnity cover.  Our manufacturers will have to adopt the provisions of the EC Product Liability Directive which could mean considerably increased cost for this form of cover.</P>
    <P>I am fully convinced that we have a crisis in the insurance business.  It did not develop overnight and will not be resolved immediately, but I believe we have set out a solution in this Bill to many of the problems.  The problem in relation to securing business cover derives, in my opinion, from five main factors behind the massive increase in insurance rates. They are the volume of claims, the level of compensation, the legal system, risk management, crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>There has been a continued increase in the volume of claims and the level of compensation from the late seventies. The average cost per claim in 1984 was approximately £2,000 and that represented an increase over 1979 equal to 1.8 times the rate of inflation; yet while this increase had taken place there was virtually no change in the total numbers of people employed in the country during those years.  That is an interesting comparison. In other words, 35 per cent more claims originated in 1983 than in 1979 from a workforce the size of which had remained static.  Over that period the <Col N="1733" /> legal system had proved to be slow, ineffective and expensive.  Legal costs had accounted for 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the total amount paid out by insurance companies in meeting claims.  The Courts Act, 1988, we hope will eliminate that cost.</P>
    <P>With regard to the poor level of risk management, the general conception, particularly among the insurance companies, is that the management of safety in Irish workplaces is not what it should be and certainly is below European norms.  The growth in levels of crime and vandalism has affected particularly the cost of property insurance.  While crime and vandalism are mainly urban problems, I have to say we also have our fair share in our villages and towns.</P>
    <P>A further factor which has affected the cost of the insurance issue is the way in which the insurance industry has developed over the years.  The insurance industry comprises the insurance companies and the brokers.  My main concern would be with the insurance companies. It is the companies who accept or decline business who set the premium rates and impose securing and other conditions. The brokers are essentially insurance advisers and the principal channel for placing insurance business.  Up to the mid seventies the insurance industry enjoyed a protected home market.  The industry comprised Irish home companies who had no interest in spreading their wings in overseas markets and subsidiaries of British companies who had operated here.  Crime levels were low at that time and remained fairly static.  Inflation levels were low at that time also.  Legislation had more or less frozen the number of companies operating in a protected home market.  The commercial environment for insurance companies was very cosy indeed.</P>
    <P>This very stable way of life was rudely shattered by the passing into law in 1966 of the EC Non-Life Establishment Directive. From that point on, foreign companies already established in other EC countries were allowed set up subsidiaries in Ireland and since 1976 a number of additional foreign companies have set up <Col N="1734" /> office here.  Then we had several years of cut-throat competition for insurance business between insurance companies who were apparently oblivious of the other changes taking place in the environment for insurance.  There were increased levels of crime and vandalism, increasing litigation consciousness and high levels of inflation.  The attitude seemed to be to get insurance business at all costs and forget about economic premiums.</P>
    <P>This came to an end within the last number of years as insurance companies have been forced to take corrective action in the face of mounting losses. Massive increases in premiums brought severe criticism.  In a defensive response to that criticism insurance companies lashed out at everybody else as being responsible for a situation largely of their own making.  They had blamed the legal system and Irish firms generally for poor levels of risk management, with some justification, it must be said.  However, they seemed to absolve themselves from major responsibility in this area.  The panic reaction of the insurers to difficulties being experienced by small firms and business people showed absolutely no regard for the many problems of the firms themselves at a time of recession, very little sensitivity for customer relations and a blinkered view of their own role in the economy.  The measures taken by the insurance companies at that time and the manner in which they were being taken reflected an overwhelming concern for their own well-being with no regard whatever for the over-view of the effect of their action on their customer, the economy generally and employment in small firms as a whole.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the insurance companies, however, I wish to state that some years ago some steps were taken.  I refer to the merger of two representative bodies for insurance companies which became the Irish Insurance Federation.  The federation gave full recognition to the problems connected with insurance cover and the consumer.  They recognised that the insurance companies in general have a poor overall image and that measures <Col N="1735" /> were necessary to improve the situation. It is my wish that in time public representatives will have to listen to fewer complaints from the public regarding the behaviour of insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The big question seems to be, who can solve these problems?  Who has a role in finding a solution?  The insurance companies themselves have an obvious responsibility.  The Government also have responsibility.  The legal profession have their responsibility.  The business themselves and the trade unions also have responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>The measures being taken by this Government in the introduction of this Bill, I hope, will put this industry on a secure footing.  More important still, it will protect the consumer who over the years had to carry the can in regard to the high cost of insurance, yet we must remember that the person least responsible for the increased insurance cost was the consumer.  Also there is need for a much more safety-conscious approach by management.  More and more businesses must be brought to appreciate the simple fact that a reduction in the level of accidents in the work-place is a most effective way of controlling insurance costs.  Trade unions need to get a similar message across to their members.  If we are to get our business insurance costs down to the level of other countries we must get our standards of managing safety at work up to their levels.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this Bill is to get our business insurance costs into line with those of Britain and other countries and to ensure that adequate cover is readily available.  To achieve this we should aim for (a) a reduction in the volume and level of claims (b) the establishment of an efficient, expeditious and inexpensive compensation system (c) a safer work-place environment and a reduction in exposure to crime and vandalism.  There should be a reduction in the number of speculative claims.  It appears to me that there is a lack of balance in the growing number of liability claims.  While I accept that levels of risk management are grossly inadequate, I do not believe work-places <Col N="1736" /> had become 35 per cent more unsafe in 1983 than they were in 1979, nor do I believe that the risks to public safety generally are any greater now than they were then.</P>
    <P>Public liability insurance should be about adequate cover for compensation in respect of genuine injuries and incapacity. Some sections of the public need to be re-educated to this fact.  A large section of the business community has lost faith in a court system that is more attached to its own archaic ways than to the notion of giving value for money to the taxpayer.  The judgments of the courts must always be seen to be independent of outside pressures.  I respect that independence, which is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. However, notions of independence and good efficiency in administration are not incompatible.  They are complementery. Therefore, the streamlining of this system under the Courts Act, 1988 was a most welcome innovation by this Government.</P>
    <P>Risk management in Ireland is in need of urgent and substantial improvement. At the same time all the legislation, all the regulations, all of the inspections will be of limited use only, unless firms themselves develop a genuine understanding as to why a safe work place is important. There is a major task here for Government, the insurance companies and trade associations.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there has been a reduction over the years in the levels of recorded crime.  That is welcome news. However, we have daily reminders in our newspapers as to the prevailing high level of crime and vandalism.  At the same time we have to face the reality that some risks are becoming uninsurable in certain areas where there is a high level of vandalism. Motor insurance has been an issue over a number of years.  There are business aspects to motor insurance and we must never forget this.  The high level of increase in motor insurance has led to a situation where many of our young people have been unable to hold or accept jobs due to difficulty in obtaining insurance.  The Department of Industry <Col N="1737" /> and Commerce should examine the declined cases agreement to ensure that the system operates more effectively than at present.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Bill clearly demonstrates that the Minister and his Department are fully aware of the problems relating to insurance.  This Bill has many technical aspects that I certainly would not be able to deal with, but it will streamline the operation and allow for a degree of sensible competition, at the same time providing protection for the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We in The Workers' Party welcome this Bill generally. We have some criticisms of it, mainly that it does not go far enough.  I am very interested in the comments of Deputy Lynch in regard to public liability insurance, etc. and in the facts and figures he gave.  There are few service industries that have produced the level of public dissatisfaction that the insurance industry has produced in recent years.  There are very few consumers who believe they are being treated fairly or reasonably by their insurance companies.  There is much evidence to suggest that this lack of confidence is well founded, especially in the area of motor insurance, but also in the area of public liability insurance.  Everything is fine in an insurance company until they have a claim, and in motor insurance until one has an accident.  It is then one discovers the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to motor insurance is particularly unsatisfactory because the cost of premia is so high here in relation to almost any other country. Many drivers simply cannot afford to pay.  The result of this of course is not that these people stop driving but that they drive without insurance.  This in turn increases the premia to others who do pay their insurance.  There have been various suggestions as to the numbers of people who do not pay insurance.  Insurance companies themselves put the figure of uninsured drivers between 15 and 25 per cent of drivers but a survey conducted earlier this year by the Garda in co-operation with An Foras Forbartha puts the <Col N="1738" /> level considerably lower than that at between 7 and 14 per cent.  This would still mean that about 76,000 cars are being driven around our roads without the required level of insurance cover which is an enormous figure when one thinks of it, and that is the lowest estimate.  The whole thing seems to be a vicious circle, insurance is so dear that many, particularly young people, cannot afford to pay it.  The fact that they do not and drive without insurance pushes up the cost of insurance and makes it even more difficult for people to pay.  Lower premia would resolve quite a lot of that and enable people to pay the insurance.  Thus, everybody would be covered by insurance and this would reduce the overall cost of premia to everybody.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the attitude of insurance companies towards particular categories in society.  The loadings they put on premia often seem to be based on social prejudice at least as much as on statistical data.  Young people in particular, even those with clean driving records, have been particularly discriminated against.  Some companies have adopted an arrogant and insulting attitude to particular areas of this city. At least one company were in the news recently, the Royal Insurance Company, for deciding that they would not provide motor insurance cover for people living in the Dublin 11 area, a large working class area in this city, although the Garda statistics showed clearly that this area is by no means the worst in the city for car thefts.  In fact, the south city area had much higher figures for car thefts than the Dublin 11 area.  It was simply a social prejudice on the part of the insurance company that they just wrote off one area of the city and would not provide insurance.  This should not be allowed to happen.  As far as I can gather, it is the Minister's intention to look into this and to see that such discrimination would not be allowed when motor insurance is compulsory.</P>
    <P>There has also been a major problem with regard to public liability insurance. In this area very many voluntary and community organisations in particular <Col N="1739" /> are finding it almost impossible to get cover for public functions that they run to raise funds or simply as a social outing for their members.  This has meant that many voluntary organisations cannot go ahead with their activities because of the cost of public liability insurance and, in many cases, are tempted to take a risk and go ahead without cover.  That is happening frequently in the city and in country areas.  I am sure most Members are aware of people who, when running functions, take a chance because of the very high cost of insurance.  That is a recipe for disaster and it is only a matter of luck that there have not been major tragedies in cases where there is no public liability insurance cover.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies must be blamed for the enormous charges and although that has been pointed out frequently nothing has been done about those charges.  The companies have their own prejudices and decide where the highest cover should apply without having any information on which to base that decision.  They do not refuse public liability cover but the premiums they quote to firms in certain areas are so high that it amounts to a refusal.  As a result certain areas in this and other cities are being run down because businesses are being forced to close thus creating greater problems.</P>
    <P>There has been valid criticism of the reaction of the insurance companies to the problem of AIDS.  It seems to be a priority of the insurers to protect their own interests rather than provide cover or contribute in some way to a solution of the problem.  There are few people who would argue that we do not need improved powers for supervising the operations of the insurance industry, particularly given the fact that two major crises in the financial sector in recent years required Government intervention. Both of them were insurance companies.  I am referring to the collapse of the PMPA and of the ICI, and they <Col N="1740" /> cost the taxpayers and consumers significant amounts of money.  Those collapses came about due to a degree of incredible bungling and mismanagement on the part of their private sector owners. If that had happened in the public sector there would have been an outcry.  They would have been quoted time and again by the majority parties of the Right in the House as examples of public sector inefficiency and of the need to privatise them and put them into efficient private sector ownership.  There have been so many examples of inefficient private sector ownership that that argument must surely have been shot down by now but people continue to trot it out.</P>
    <P>Many questions remain unanswered following the collapse of ICI.  We do not know the final cost of the collapse.  Estimates have been as high as £1 billion but the direct cost to the taxpayer through the money paid over by the Central Bank was more than £100 million.  That amounted to a loss to the Exchequer because had the Central Bank not paid over that money it would have gone to the Exchequer and would have been of benefit to taxpayers.  Various attempts were made to pass the buck for the ICI debacle.  Suggestions were made that there was inadequate supervision by the UK authorities at the London end of the operation but, whatever the arguments, ultimate responsibility for the supervision of their operations rested with the Department of Industry and Commerce. The fact that ICI were allowed to get into the dreadful state in which they were, clearly points to major shortcomings in the procedures for supervision in the insurance industry.  Therefore, the Bill, although coming very late, is welcome.</P>
    <P>What annoyed people more than anything else about the ICI collapse was the fact that Allied Irish Banks were allowed to evade their responsibility.  Those people, with the aura of expertise and business responsibilities in the banking and financial sectors evaded their responsibilities for the collapse and the State was allowed to, and did, step in at considerable expense to rescue AIB.  The funny thing is that had the ICI gamble <Col N="1741" /> paid off and AIB had made major profits, as they expected, the State would not have received one penny of the profits but when the gamble failed the State had to pick up the tab for the losses.  AIB are still trying to blame their auditors for the ICI collapse but it is hard to see how people who are supposed to be expert in accounting and finance in AIB could be out by so many millions of pounds.  It proves what I said at the time, that when it comes to such an event, accountancy is much more of a black art than a science.</P>
    <P>If ICI could have been allowed to drift to the extent that their liabilities amounted to hundreds of millions of pounds, despite having their books audited by apparent reputable companies, how many more companies could be in the same position?  How can we accept the word of those reputable auditors? In my view it leads the public to suspect that all of this financial mystique, mumbo-jumo, is a cover-up for plain ordinary fraud or, what is known in other circles as plain gangsterism.  The ICI collapse came only two years after the appointment of an administrator to the PMPA and that emphasises the need for a comprehensive review of the way in which all financial institutions operate in this State.  The days of unbridled licences for the banks and other financial institutions must be brought to an end and if the State is not going to have to move in again and again to sort out financial disasters like ICI it must have adequate powers of supervision.  The State must have some say over the appointment of auditors and it should have the power to appoint its own nominees to the boards of those companies.  Many of those companies have the right to nominate their nominees to the boards of semi-State companies and to the board of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>It is more than three years since the ICI crisis and this is the first legislative attempt to increase ministerial powers of supervision over insurance companies. The need for comprehensive reform of company law has been emphasised on many occasions and there is in particular a need to give the Central Bank more <Col N="1742" /> power to supervise the operations of the banks.  I accept that such a Bill is being prepared.  We must assume that were it not for EC pressures, and the panic of 1992, the Government would still be sitting on the fence and allowing the cowboy, fly-by-night operators to continue in business, allowing insurance companies to screw the last penny from every widow and pensioner and allowing any clever chancer to get involved in the banking business.  That is how the business in the financial, insurance and banking sectors have been run.  It is funny that it is just now that panic has set in and that we are promised Bills dealing with banking and insurance to prepare us for 1992.  It appears that we are very backward in regard to those matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased supervisory powers in the Bill.  They are desirable although to a large extent what is in the Bill is merely codifying powers which the Minister has under administrative rules and statutory instruments.  The Bill does not go far enough.  The general thrust of the Bill is to see supervision in some of the same ways as it has been seen up to now.  It is a question of looking at the financial returns, analysing them and seeing if there is cause for concern, and if there is, then all of these actions can take place.  That is not good enough because the result of that procedure is that you will always be running behind the trouble and never anticipating it until it is too late and the trouble has occurred. What is required is intervention at an earlier stage rather than a rescue service when it is too late.  It is no use intervening after the problem has been identified, that is too late and leaves the possibility of problems similar to those of PMPA and ICI occurring.</P>
    <P>I understand that in insurance circles the current rate cutting in the motor insurance market is giving some cause for concern and leading people to think that something similar could happen again in the not too distant future.  A more interventionist approach is what is required in the area of supervision.  In view of the deregulation taking place in the financial services market and the various changes <Col N="1743" /> following EC directives for completion of the internal market, etc.  It is important that there should be just one single supervisory authority for the whole financial services sector.  There is a whole series of supervisory authorities, for example, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and so on.  The Central Bank should be made responsible for supervising the whole area of financial services including insurance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area of the Bill dealing with the regulation of brokers and agents or insurance intermediaries, I agree that the insurance intermediaries should be regulated and I welcome the fact in this Bill we are talking about regulating them but the concept of regulation in the Bill is flawed.  It is a concept of self regulation whereas what is required is statutory regulation.  The responsibility for regulating insurance intermediaries rests basically with the insurance undertakings themselves.  The Irish Insurance Federation agrees with what I say.  I quote from a letter, dated 17 October 1988 which I presume they circulated to every Deputy:</P>
    <P>The IIF supports the concept of supervision and regulation of insurance intermediaries but strongly believes that proper supervision is best achieved through an independent statutory body.  Insurers will do their best to comply with whatever obligations the Bill imposes upon them, but urge that the Bill should at least contain power to enable the Minister establish, in due course, a statutory system for supervising insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage The Workers' Party will be putting down an amendment on those lines calling for statutory regulation of all insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Insurance is a vital service in modern society.  Motor insurance is compulsory although there is widespread breach of the law.  Employers' liability insurance, though not compulsory, should be compulsory. It is a necessity for all employers <Col N="1744" /> except some renegade employers.  Public liability insurance falls into more or less the same category &mdash; it is compulsory and it is a necessity.  Also, insurance of property against fire, burglary, theft etc. is a necessity for people nowadays. Marine and aviation insurance too, are all essential.  All such forms of insurance are desirable or essential.  They are not luxuries, for whatever reason.  In the light of this and because of the large sums of money involved, the argument for State insurance is exceptionally strong.  The State is already engaged in many areas of insurance, for example, disability benefit, retirement pensions, widows pensions, the VHI, export credit insurance and there are other areas also in which the State is directly engaged in insurance business.  Of course, they are forced to take up the slack where the private sector totally failed in the cases of ICI and PMPA.  They are now State insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The argument for the State becoming heavily involved in the insurance area is powerfully strong and is a logical step in the whole insurance area.  This Bill, while welcome, does not go far enough but if the Minister becomes seriously involved in the supervision area it will show very clearly the need for State involvement. Supervision is only the beginning of the involvement of the State in an absolutely essential area of life in the economy.</P>
    <P>The last point I would like to make relates to the old cutbacks again.  If we are to have an Insurance Bill, such as this, where supervision of the whole insurance business as promised, staff will be required.  As I understand it, the whole insurance business has become much more complicated and sophisticated. There are all sorts of EC Directives, etc. so more people are required for that type of supervision.  Even during the term of the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, the whole supervisory section had become depleted due to the public service embargo which has become much worse under the new Government.  I would imagine that that area is totally run down in terms of numbers and probably has not got the experienced staff to deal with it. <Col N="1745" /> This is an area in which the much maligned accountants and actuaries are the experts whose services would be required if the Minister is to carry out his supervision in this area.  I should not like to hear from the Minister that he will have an ineffective Bill because he will not have the staff to implement its provisions, but rather that he is determined to implement its provisions, that he will seek the requisite staff, will hammer the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, or whoever, to ensure that when he has the Bill enacted he will have the wherewithal and staff to implement its provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryJJAbbott" hpid="Mr. Abbott Mr. Abbott">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Abbott</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for the tightening of controls and supervisory provisions it contains.  With the benefit of hindsight one might ponder the possibility that, had these controls been operative and implemented in time, the disasters that occurred in relation to the PMPA and the ICI might have been averted.  Had those unfortunate experiences in the industry been averted the country now might be in a better position to avail of whatever marginal benefit might accrue from being in the position of steering away somewhat further from the derogation of full and free competition with our European counterparts. One fallacy being put about in certain areas is that the derogation from the directive on free competition in relation to non-life assurance would constitute a denial of the panacea to the problems occasioned by cheap insurance.  While the opening up of our insurance industry to full competition from Europe would reduce premiums in the non-life area significantly, I do not think that move would be an overriding one.  We shall have to examine the underlying factors behind the cost of insurance claims, the cost of premiums here and address those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the action taken already with regard to the abolition of juries and the also, as yet, non-statutory action in relation to the compilation of a book of quantum, and other action which, in the medium term, will help in controlling the <Col N="1746" /> level of claims and their frequency in relation to the abolition of juries in cases where claims might not have been sustained in the past had juries not been trying such cases.  In the long run that type of multi-disciplinary action being taken by the Government will help to decrease, little by little, the level of claims, hence the level of premiums. Existing competition between various insurance interests will ensure that the administration costs of insurance companies will be kept at a minimum.  Indeed the threat of the ultimate removal of any derogation from free competition within Europe should be another factor in ensuring that insurance companies would keep their costs at a minimum and be preparing for the ultimate opening up of this country to free competition.</P>
    <P>We shall have to examine the level of road safety, of safety in industry, in factories where people are asked to undertake tasks when, very often, they are exposed to unreasonable risk of injury.  These are areas which require vigilance on the part of Government and both sides of industry, employers and employees alike.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general level of claims there is another consideration to be taken into account.  Possibly this is occasioned by the fact that we work within a different legal structure from Britain and certainly from that obtaining on mainland Europe. For example, we work within a different structure of court awards from that in Britain while, otherwise, our respective structures may be somewhat similar. When it comes to comparison with mainland Europe we work within a structure different from the point of view of the rules and laws establishing liability and those establishing the quantum of any claim.</P>
    <P>When looking, in this multi-disciplinary way, at the task of reducing insurance premiums and general updating of our insurance industry, the Government should devise some means by which the level of claims here could be brought into line with the general or average level of those in Europe by way of a harmonisation procedure which <Col N="1747" /> might be initiated here.  In this context, given that there is much detailed study necessary in relation to comparative law, and comparative levels of awards in the various other countries of the EC, I might suggest that the Law Reform Commission or some other such suitably qualified body, would be asked by the Minister to examine the position so that the inherent direction of the Irish legal system would not run counter to other such systems delivering awards in countries with which we compete within the EC.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by other speakers about the alarming rise in the level of public liability insurance.  At some stage legislators will have to examine the alarming propensity of the courts to declare the law of negligence.  Here I might add that the areas of liability in negligence have not yet been set.  As time goes on it appears that the courts become more and more ingenious, along with the lawyers operating in them, in extending the areas of negligence.  One need only look at the way in which the law has changed resulting from court decisions in the area of liability of a local authority in regard to misfeasance in roadworks and their liability arising from misfeasance through the improper execution of roadworks. The courts will contend that the standard now required of a local authority in relation to the construction of a road is that which would apply to a super highway.  If there is a pothole, or a pebble out of place &mdash; which might be attributed to actual misfeasance on the part of a local authority &mdash; now, as a result of a fairly substantial alteration of the law, in turn resulting from court decisions over the past 20 years or so, local authorities are practically automatically liable regardless of the lack of care on the part of the driver of a motor vehicle.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that, in instances like these, local authorities really should not be the parties to be insured.  They are treated by the courts as insurers themselves in so far as there is developing rapidly a tendency to impose liability on <Col N="1748" /> local authorities without testing the possibility of whether any other person, including the driver of a motor vehicle, might be responsible.  There is also a tendency on the part of the courts to extend the area of misfeasance into that of non-feasance, an area which traditionally granted an exemption of liability to local authorities.  That is an area where the local authorities would be guilty on the basis of doing nothing rather than for doing something negligently.</P>
    <P>The cost of bus insurance has been and will continue to be a source of concern. Private bus operators have expressed concern that the cost of insurance is still very prohibitive, the cost of premiums being far above the level which has to be paid by their English competitors.  They are in competition with their English counterparts and perhaps this problem might be addressed through the multi-disciplinary approach with which this Bill is associated.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to join with the many other speakers who voiced concern about the difficulty in drawing the line of demarcation as between insurance agents and borkers in the part of the Bill which deals with insurance intermediaries.  I would like to see the number of agencies of the agents referred to in the Bill limited to a few in number.  I appreciate the practical difficulties in drawing the line of demarcation and in ensuring that a broker will be able to offer the consumer a suitable number of choices in the market.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring to the claim made by the last speaker that we should have a State insurance industry.  Whatever merits there may be in establishing a State insurance industry I would see one overriding demerit and that is that such an industry would eliminate entirely the competitive element and choice for the consumer and the effects which competition would have in keeping the service reasonably priced.  While we have suffered in the past from rocketing insurance costs we are now reaping the benefits of the sound private sector approach to the insurance industry led by a Government who are inspired by the <Col N="1749" /> need to ensure that there is proper control of and proper direction given to the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportuntiy to be able to speak on this debate on the Insurance Bill which I deem to be very important and necessary legislation in the interests of the consumer. Like every Member of the House, I am deeply concerned about the high cost of insurance in Ireland.  It is a heavy burden for motorists to carry, especially young drivers.  It is even more serious for employment.  Many firms find the cost of employers and public liability insurance prohibitive.  It affects their prospects for survival.</P>
      <P>There is a number of features in the insurance industry which need to be addressed and which fall into a number of categories such as cost, availability, competition and safe practice.  In regard to cost, there are many things which have contributed to the high and escalating cost of insurance in Ireland, for example, uninsured driving.  The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland pay out approximately £20 million in personal injury claims to the victims of uninsured drivers per annum.  It is claimed that up to 20 per cent of drivers are uninsured and this is only part of the cost of uninsured driving. The cost of damage to property has to be met from insurance premiums and apart from this many innocent victims suffer loss with no compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to legal costs, the costs of wrangling over liability absorb 20 per cent of the total claims paid out by insurance companies.  In addition, the legal process needs to be rationalised with a view to shortening the litigation process so as to make it less costly.  We must recognise that the abolition of jury trials and the limitation on the number of counsel, although necessary, will not provide the complete solution.  There is an urgent need for judicial guidelines to be established by the Judiciary in consultation with the medical profession, insurance companies and industry so that the award of damages in personal injury claims <Col N="1750" /> would be based on professionally developed actual assessments taking account of the whole range of factors involved.  Furthermore, it should be recognised that there is a major role for a more widespread use of safety audits by insurance companies in assessing the accident prevention measures which have been taken by a firm, and to take these fully into account when deciding on the premium.  This approach would promote greater adherence to the safety procedures and reduce the cost of insurance for firms which have the highest standards of accident prevention.</P>
    <P>Industry has a major role to play in promoting an awareness of safety measures among all employees.  High safety standards go hand in hand with high quality production.  It is also to be expected that the new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill will promote active safety procedures in the workplace as an integral part in bringing down liability insurance costs.</P>
    <P>Vehicle defects caused or contributed to one in 12 motor accidents.  The results of an exercise carried out by the Garda Síochána in 1986 over a four day period show that they identified 261 vehicle defects.  Of these, 192 drivers carried out the necessary repairs on request.  It is also to be noted that the public have become claim conscious.  We are told that the frequency of whiplash claims in Ireland exceeds that in the UK several times over.</P>
    <P>The uncompetitive state of the insurance industry is also pushing up costs.  In regard to compensation levels, court settlements for injuries, as I previously stated, have been very high and indeed higher than in many other countries. The Courts Bill passed earlier this year was supposed to help in this regard. The Government have repeatedly stated that reductions would take place in the cost of premia to the consumer resulting from the enactment of the Courts Bill. The President of the Irish Insurance Federation also stated that savings resulting from this legislation would be passed on to the consumer but I regret to say that there is no firm evidence of such a <Col N="1751" /> reduction and indeed the position in some sectors such as the food, drink, tobacco, textiles and clothing industries rather than improving continues to deteriorate. It is my opinion that savings are being made by insurance companies in relation to claims but these savings are not being passed on to the consumer in the form of lower premia.  I suggest that it is now time for the Minister to request the Fair Trade Commission to examine this area as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The high cost of insurance is placing an intolerable strain on the overheads of many a business and has led to a number of cases to liquidation and job losses. Companies are finding it increasingly difficult in a very competitive environment to absorb these massive charges.  In particular I am extremely concerned, as are previous speakers, about the high cost of employers' liability and public liability insurance premia to businesses.  Companies are now running the risk of having no insurance at all because of the prohibitive premia being quoted.  Companies are often prepared to go into receivership if they get a large claim rather than having to meet the cost of the insurance claim from their own resources.  This would confirm the view that the cost of insurance premiums is now preventing job creation and contributing to job losses.</P>
    <P>In regard to availability, difficulty in getting insurance at any sort of bearable cost is becoming very common.  In some businesses it is virtually impossible for employers to get employers' liability and public liability cover.  More and more employers are being forced to operate without insurance.  This is a frightening development when one considers the plight of the victims of accidents.</P>
    <P>There is no agreement with the insurance industry for dealing with declined cases for employers insurance and this is a major inhibiting factor in job creation.  In my constituency of North Tipperary I am aware of a number of proposed projects which have failed to materialise as a result of high insurance costs and in a number of instances they <Col N="1752" /> have even failed to get a quotation.  Some sectors are finding it increasingly difficult to get adequate insurance cover.  These include agricultural engineering, carpentry, woodturning and industries associated with the building trade.  Only last week I had experience of a typical example of this when a company who wished to expand and develop had their efforts frustrated because of failure to secure insurance cover for their plans which involved the demolition of an old building to make way for a modern structure. The company received negative responses to their many requests for public liability insurance to cover the demolition work.  It is a scandalous state of affairs when this closed shop attitude of insurance companies stifles initiative. There is ample evidence to indicate that insurance companies are selective and over-cautious in relation to their pricing structure and are only interested in low claim risks to the exclusion of many who require insurance.  The Minister should make provision in this Bill to oblige all insurance companies go give quotations on all consumer inquiries and insist on the involvement of the Irish Insurance Federation in the creation of a structure and mechanism to provide insurance for the sizeable share of the market that is at presently denied cover on a frequent basis.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations are also experiencing great difficulty in acquiring insurance cover and far too often many community events are cancelled because of the prohibitive premiums quoted.  It is very damaging to community spirit when organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association and other sporting organisations, Macra na Feirme, Foróige and local community development associations are frustrated in their attempts to provide additional facilities, entertainment, recreational facilities and the general improvement of amenities in their local areas, especially when one considers that all the personnel in these groups are involved on a voluntary basis. Voluntary effort is being halted and undermined by the profiteering of insurance companies and the Government should take the necessary steps to <Col N="1753" /> alleviate and correct the serious deficiencies encountered by voluntary groups in relation to insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I am presently dealing with another example of the non-availability of insurance in my area involving the Thurles Tidy Towns Committee.  As the House is aware the Department of Justice, in association with the courts, sponsor community service orders whereby criminals are afforded the opportunity to repay their debt to society by way of involvement in community work rather than spending time in prison.  Much useful work could be carried out.  This could prove very beneficial to the criminal as an individual and the State would not have to meet the estimated £650 which it costs per week to keep a person in prison.  It is now evident that community groups who put forward such projects are not able to get public liability cover, thereby rendering this scheme totally ineffective.  This is a classic example of a lack of insurance availability curbing Government initiative.</P>
    <P>Another area of serious concern to me is the availability and cost of insurance to young drivers.  The premiums quoted in many instances are outrageous and often surpass the value of the vehicle involved. To many of these young people a car is essential but because they are not in a financial position to meet these exorbitant charges they often succumb to the temptation to drive without insurance, placing all road users and themselves at great risk in the event of an accident. There can be no doubt that mature and sensible young people are being discriminated against when it comes to insurance cover.  I am aware of only one insurance company offering a reasonable deal to first time drivers under 25 years. I urge the Minister to exert his influence to get more insurance companies to quote better terms for this category.</P>
    <P>The European Court has ruled that Ireland was acting illegally in the way in which it tried to keep overseas insurers out of certain insurance businesses in this country.  This ruling heralds competition from overseas into the Irish market.  A move to reduce and improve service to its customers is clearly in the insurance industry's interests.  Lack of competition <Col N="1754" /> is clearly contributing to the high cost of Irish insurance.  The growth in management expenses has averaged over 20 per cent per annum in recent years which is way above the rate of inflation.  There is also a huge variation in efficiency within the industry among the large motor insurers.  General expenses range from between 8 and 20 per cent of gross premium income.  This means that some companies are unprepared for competition and their clients are bearing excessive costs.  It can also be stated that the management expenses of insurers in the UK are less than two-thirds of those in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Along with improved efficiency there is also a need for better services to the customer.  There are many areas for improvement &mdash; much more access for the consumer to information about the terms of his policy, the structure of premiums and the level of commission and service charges so that the consumer can shop around freely.  There is a need, too, for the preparation of a code of practice for brokers and agents to protect consumers from unfair selling practices.  In this regard I welcome the introduction of insurance bonding in Part IV of the Bill. This will afford the consumer better protection in relation to the investments made through an insurance intermediary. However, I must say I am seriously concerned at the ease with which individuals can get an agency with an insurance company with no apparent qualifications or formal training.  I am aware of several instances where inflated and unrealistic investment returns are being quoted to gullible consumers.  When the policy is cashed, the expectations are not fulfilled and serious questions arise, these whizz-kid salesmen are not to be found.  It is not unusual for some companies to change agents and sales personnel several times in a year.  This type of approach to insurance sales brings the whole insurance industry business into disrepute and leaves it open to ridicule.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the insurance industry's attempts to counteract this in the form of a cooling off period for general insurance and life assurance policyholders, together with the voluntary life offices agreement reached in 1987.  However, I believe that <Col N="1755" /> all of these agreements will fail to stamp out dubious activities in the insurance sector.  It is my considered opinion that the only way to regulate and control insurance agents and brokers is to introduce a system of registration for all.</P>
    <P>Under the term &ldquo;better service to the customer&rdquo; it is also desirable that insurance practices which unfairly victimise particular groups are removed. For example, disabled drivers still face a 10 per cent loading for which there is no foundation.  Even more unjust, victims of untraced drivers receive much lower compensation for personal injuries than victims of uninsured drivers.  This practice has no logical foundation either.  In summary of the competitive situation, it must be clearly understood and accepted that in the next few years greater competition will be imposed on the industry with the introduction of the EC Freedom of Services Directive.  In the interim, it is necessary for the industry themselves to improve efficiency and service.</P>
    <P>Something which has recently gained much publicity is the Bank of Ireland subsidiary, Lifetime.  It is of serious concern to me and to several insurance firms who have complained to the Irish Insurance Federation that Lifetime are using their privileged and favourable position within the Bank of Ireland group to direct a flood of business towards Lifetime. It is claimed that in some instances the bank's customers are literally being forced to purchase endowment policies from this subsidiary.  I am reliably informed that Bank of Ireland managers and senior staff are being offered inducements to direct business to Lifetime.  I understand that the Irish Insurance Federation have raised this matter on numerous occasions with the Department of Industry and Commerce but to date have not received a satisfactory response.</P>
    <P>It appears that the general insurance industry is not aware of what conditions were attached by the Department of Industry and Commerce to the licence they gave to Lifetime, especially in reation to the behaviour of bank managers in giving business to it.  This is a serious charge and in the interests of propriety and in fairness to all concerned it <Col N="1756" /> is imperative that the Minister, during the course of this debate, would clarify all issues in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to welcome the introduction of this long-awaited Bill. The insurance industry constitutes a crucially important part of the overall financial sector and thrust of the economy as a whole in terms of employment and investment.  There are 5,000 people employed in the insurance industry.  This Bill has been described as the most important Bill for the insurance industry since the early thirties.  I would like to think that the results of the Bill would be of benefit to the policy-holder, the intermediaries, the Government and all who have an interest in bringing the industry forward from strength to strength in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with three problems, being the supervision of insurance companies, the payment of commission to insurers and the regulation of the intermediaries between insurance brokers and others.  In relation to the supervision of insurance companies, the insurance industry has not performed very credibly over the last few years.  We have had two major collapses where the unfortunate taxpayer had to suffer for the incompetent decisions of two major insurance companies, namely, the PMPA and the ICI.  There was a purported Government supervision of these insurance companies in existence well prior to these collapses and it is with regret that I note that both insurance companies are still under administration and still a potential liability to the public purse, this at a time when other insurance companies here are reporting very substantial profits running into millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the insurance compensation provisions, which are to some extent strengthened by this Bill, are very important and that an insurance compensation fund should be built up to meet these eventualities, rather than insurance companies turning pathetically to the taxpayer when they get themselves into trouble by their mismanagement.  This can be done by more stringent controls of the insurance company and their <Col N="1757" /> enforcement.  One of the problems has been that there is a very slow enforcement procedure which is way behind events and that the public and the Government are not alerted in sufficient time to avert a crisis such as has arisen. One would wonder about the qualifications and expertise of the people involved in the assessment of these claims at all levels.  This seems to be the centre of the problem.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies now say that because juries have been abolished more certainty will be brought into the claims procedure and I hope it will result in more certainty in the insurance industry, because insurance premiums are now a very real burden on the public, particularly the business people.  It is to be hoped that there will be a substantial reduction in premiums as this seems to have been one of the planks on which the insurance industry based their claim that juries should be abolished.  The important thing about Part II of this Bill is to see that it is enforced.</P>
    <P>Regarding commission for insurers, here one must be careful that the legislation is enforced and enforceable.  Commission can be paid in various shapes and forms, as we well know.  It would seem that a customer who is a policy-holder should be informed of exactly how much commission is paid to every person who is involved in the transaction, either directly or indirectly, and that information should cover direct or indirect payments and subsidies.  This is done very effectively in relation to hire purchase transactions and people realise what exactly they are paying.  It is well known that people's assessments seem to fall rapidly with some investments in the insurance world, which is normally explained away by payments of commission at the initial stages.  People's anxieties to get tax-free investment often lead them to a path of problems they did not anticipate and deductions of which they were not informed.  It is suggested that the Minister, by his regulation, would require insurance companies, on the issue of a policy, to inform the policy-holder of exactly who are being paid and how much they are being paid.  Indeed, there might be a cooling off period during <Col N="1758" /> which the policy-holder could revoke their investment if they were not satisfied that the matter was just and fair.</P>
    <P>Regarding insurance brokers and others, there is classification in this Bill of intermediaries which will limit substantially, the number of brokers or insurance agents.  This should be to the general benefit of the public, provided sufficient competition exists between the brokers and intermediaries for the business. This matter should be reviewed in time if competitive rates are not in existence, say, in three to five years time and we do not see a reduction on premiums as promised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the keeping of separate bank accounts and the duties on accountants. There appears to be some difficulty of enforcement.  Many brokers do not belong to organisations.  Many insurance agents are fairly freelance.  Are there sufficient personnel available to see that the provisions of the Bill are carried into operation, or are we simply passing legislation that nobody will enforce, in other words, pious platitudes and aspirations? I also wonder if it is advisable to limit the compensation to the public to £100,000. Many of these brokerage firms handle very large sums of money and £100,000 would be small money to them in the event of a liquidation.  Why not have a general compensation fund for brokers similar to that for insurance companies, which would be built up something like the solicitors' compensation fund so that it would meet all claims with appropriated money?  This is something that the Minister may consider when replying. I say this because brokers are the people who are normally in contact on a day-to-day basis with the older person who is putting away a little money for his old age, or the victim of an accident who is investing his accident compensation. Such decisions and such money are of vital importance to the wellbeing of the customer or the consumer.  It seems that such customer should be entitled to a full indemnity in the event of this money being misappropriated.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and its general principles, but feel that it could and should be strengthened and could and should be monitored and certainly should be <Col N="1759" /> reviewed in due course to see how it is working and being enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first to thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  It has been very constructive, indeed.  I am happy to note that there has been widespread general support for this legislation.  I would like to run through some of the points made.  Deputy Bruton referred to the question of amending the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act of 1964 so as to take account of certain payments made under the social welfare code and gratuities or payments from other sources in the determination of a personal injuries claim award, so as to avoid double compensation for victims.  I agree generally with the Deputy's proposition on the matter.  Adoption of such a proposal would not appear to prejudice the injured party financially as the net amount combined through the recovery of damages by way of legal action and payments from the other sources would equal the total compensation that any other victim not entitled to such payment would receive in any event.  This is one of the points listed for consideration by the recent inter-departmental committee on liability insurance costs and I understand the Minister for Justice is examining the whole matter in the context of his proposed reforms of the legal systems generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have taken action to improve the operating environment for insurance in the country by the abolition of juries, by encouraging a reduction in legal and other professional costs, by promoting the publication of a book of quantum of damages and by drawing up proposals to implement a system of pretrial procedures to speed up the claims process.  We have been taking action on what we view as the priority areas, in an effort to drive down insurance costs. Having said that, however, I can assure the House that I am totally committed to taking any further action that is open to me to improve the insurance environment and reduce premiums and to <Col N="1760" /> speed up compensation to victims.  The Government have no intention of resting on their laurels and if interested parties come forward with proposals suggesting that more changes or reforms are necessary beyond the action programme already outlined by me, I will be quite happy to take such action, either on my own initiative or in consultation with my colleagues in Government.  Some of the ideas put forward in this debate will form the basis of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also adverted to the possibility of awarding compensation in the form of annuities or periodic payments rather than in the form of a lump sum to those who suffer injury.  However, I note that other Deputies disagreed with him on this point.  As the insurance supervisory authority, my major concern is, of course, the financial stability and security of non-life insurers.  I do not see the issue of periodical payments as one of central importance in the context of the agenda of items requiring action to bring about a real and lasting improvement in the overall environment for insurance.  Representatives of non-life insurance companies have expressed concern at the implications of a system of periodic payments for the reserving practices of underwriters and the potential solvency implications which this might pose, in that the uncertainty factor in what is already a less than certain science requires a high level of qualitative judgment on the part of the experts and that claims, if anything, would be increased.  In my view, therefore, it is better to concentrate resources on encouraging more competition in the insurance industry, bringing more consistency and reliability to bear on the awards system, reducing legal and other professional costs associated with the claims process, and on grounds of social justice ensuring that victims of accidents receive their compensation as quickly as possible.  The implications of any system of periodic payments for the ultimate liabilities of underwriters and the potential consequences for premium levels arising from increased demands due to inflation proofed annuities must not be lost sight of.  Insurers would prefer to know and provide as accurately as possible for lump <Col N="1761" /> sum payments on foot of compensation to victims rather than having to reserve on an on-going basis for periodical payments with the in-built risk of possible significant increases in future years. However, I am aware that the present work programme of the Law Reform Commission includes a reference to compensation in the form of periodical payments for personal injuries sustained by individuals.  I will be prepared to consider the matter further when the Law Reform Commission have completed their deliberations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the so-called compensation mentality which exists in our society today.  I would agree with much of what he said.  It is the case that far too many people regard insurance companies as fair game and seem to see them as having a bottomless pit from which an endless supply of money can be drawn.  Generally there is a view in the country that if the insurance company pay, nobody pays, when in fact the reality is that when the insurance company pay, everybody pays.  Unfortunately, the reality is that when the insurance company pay, everybody pays.  Unfortunately, the reality is, too, that far too many serious and false insurance claims are still being made.  I have already impressed on insurance companies the need for vigilance in detecting and combating try-on claims.  The new legal environment should contribute to the tightening up and early detection of these claims.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred in the course of the debate to the costs and availability of liability insurance for sporting and recreational facilities and community events.  It is unfortunately the case that activities of this nature give rise to a particular risk of injury to and, consequently, claims by members of the public. The cost of claims can only be met by insurance companies if adequate premia are forthcoming to cover the risks involved.  It is a straightforward but harsh equation.  The cost of claims is still the major input into insurance premia charged by underwriters.  We are all too well aware of the high level and cost of claims in the Irish insurance market and the Government's action programme, <Col N="1762" /> which I outlined earlier is designed to get this important component element of insurance premia under control.  An arrangement exists between my Department and the Irish Insurance Federation to assist in cases where difficulties are experienced by community groups, industrialists and others in obtaining their liability insurance requirements.  Before a case can be referred to the federation, it is necessary that at least half the Irish market, including Lloyds, be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches such as a letter from the insurance broker together with a brief synoposis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department, who will refer the case to the federation with a view to providing cover. However, while cover is generally forthcoming, I should emphasise this evening that no guarantee can be given that cover will be provided in every case, but as I have said it is provided in most cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies have also mentioned the need for increased awareness of safety in the workplace.  I know the Minister for Labour will be introducing legislation shortly to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission in this area.  With regard to the possible introduction of safety audit arrangements, the Irish Insurance Federation have undertaken a survey of their members to determine policy and resources in the area of risk improvement and surveying.  I am aware that the matter is under active consideration between the Irish Insurance Federation and the Department of Labour.  As matters stand, a substantial proportion of liability insurers time and resources is devoted to the assessment of surveyors' reports and follow-up work involving policyholders with a view to improving risk management and safety procedures in the workplace.  I am fully in favour of the closest possible liaison between insurers and policy holders with a view to improving occupational safety and health.  In this context insurers, apart from supplying valuable techncial and practical experience collected over many years, will be particularly concerned to reduce the number of accidents and claims.  Once again, prevention is better than cure.  I <Col N="1763" /> expect the insurance industry to play their full part in the proposed national authority for occupational safety and health which will follow the enactment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill. In this context Deputy Foley referred to possible contributions by insurance companies to local authorities in respect of fire prevention services.  I should point out that it is already the case that insurance companies, for many years, have been making a substantial contribution to the work of the National Industrial Safety Organisation.  Also, the members of the Irish Insurance Federation meet a significant proportion of the operating costs of the newly established National Safety Council which incorporates the Fire Prevention Council, the National Road Safety Association and the Irish Water Safety Council.  The Insurance Industry Federation is represented on the board of the National Safety Council.  Insurers are providing financial suport and playing their full part in these important areas.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the difficulties experienced by young drivers in obtaining motor insurance.  This is an area in which I have taken a particular interest since coming to office.</P>
    <P>Cover is always available to the young driver, as a last resort via the declined cases agreement.  Under the agreement, the declined cases committee examine cases referred to them by my Department which have been declined by five or more motor insurance companies and nominate one of the companies to quote for the risk involved.  Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration, it is necessary first to obtain written refusals from five motor insurance companies.  These should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department indicating the order in which they were approached together with details of previous insurance held in the last three years.  It should then be possible to have the necessary cover arranged.</P>
    <P>Premiums for young drivers are high but so also are the number and cost of claims in this category.  In the absence of an improvement in the underlying claims experience, lower insurance rates for <Col N="1764" /> young drivers would mean higher rates for other categories of driver but as I will outline later we have been making some progress in this area.  More mature drivers have been statistically proven to be safer drivers than their younger counterparts whose rates reflect the higher risk. However, important steps to alleviate the burden on young drivers have been taken recently and are now proving effective.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the Courts Act, 1988, on 1 August last, members of the Irish Insurance Federation are now offering a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claims bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies if they have been named drivers on their parents' policies for two years, have a full licence and have been accident free.  In addition, a number of insurers have introduced special schemes offering more favourable rates to young drivers.  The signs are encouraging and indeed a recent survey carried out by my Department indicated a 13 per cent decrease in premium levels for young drivers in the last 12 months or so.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the problem of uninsured driving.  In this context it is worth recalling that the 1987 survey carried out by the Garda Síochána estimated the level of uninsured driving at between 6 per cent and 8 per cent of all drivers.  This is a significantly lower figure than the previous estimate of 20 per cent or more.  A number of factors have contributed to this decline, notably the introduction of the insurance disc, more stringent enforcement of the law on uninsured driving by the Garda and heavier penalties for uninsured driving. The introduction of the insurance disc has made the identification of uninsured vehicles easier for the Garda.  However, the Government are not complacent with regard to this problem.  A 6 per cent to 8 per cent level of insurance evasion still involves about 76,000 uninsured vehicles and represents an average loading of perhaps £30 per insured driver.  Thus the Minister for the Environment is proposing to introduce new legislation which will reduce further the level of uninsured driving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> Deputy Cullen commented on the current downward trend on insurance premiums and on the need to ensure that the rates charged do not threaten the future financial stability of the insurers concerned. The Government's objective is to create the environment for lower premiums. However, I am also very conscious of the danger involved if an insurer were to reduce his rates below a financially viable level and I am certainly not advocating that.  My Department will continue to keep a close eye on developments in this area to ensure that the interests of the insuring public are protected, both in relation to the cost of their insurance and the solvency of their insurers.  The provisions in Part II of the Bill will reinforce this protection for policyholders.</P>
    <P>With regard to the comments made by Deputies Dempsey and Foley concerning the provisioning record of non-life insurance companies, I would refer them to my reply of 31 May last to Deputy Dempsey's Dáil Question on the matter when I pointed out that the figures quoted in a magazine article which appeared at that time could be misinterpreted, given that they reflect the gross position on claims, that is, before allowance is made for reinsurance recoveries.  Therefore, the increases in the claims provisions referred to do not have a corresponding effect on the companies' net profitability as they are, to a large extent, met by the reinsurers involved.  This is particularly so in so far as the more costly third party injury awards and settlements are concerned.</P>
    <P>Difficulty in claims reserving in the past can be attributed to a number of factors, which in general either no longer apply or are now being taken into account by insurers.  These include high inflation over a number of years, a dramatic increase in claims consciousness and the level of claims awards by juries and other unforeseen factors outside the control of insurers.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise that my Department exercise supervisory control over insurance companies and pay particular attention to claims reserves.  The strengthening of provisions by certain companies in recent years came about <Col N="1766" /> following action taken by my Department in their insurance supervisory capacity.  My Department have also been instrumental in the increasing use of independent expertise by insurers in recent years to assist them in estimating their claims liability and in advising on the appropriate premiums to be charged.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, as well as helping to reduce insurance costs, the Government's programme of measures to improve the overall environment for insurance will also provide a greater degree of certainty for insurers in estimating their future claims liabilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the question of supervision within the different member states of the European Community, particularly in the context of the opening up of the internal market in the 1990s. He was concerned that supervision of insurance in Ireland might be somewhat tougher than in other member states and that this could cause a competitive imbalance in the freer European market of the future.  He also asked whether sufficiently rigorous standards of supervision would be applied uniformly throughout the European Community to avoid what he termed the dangers of competitive laxity of supervision.  I will attempt to allay the Deputy's fears in relation to supervision in both the Irish and European contexts.</P>
    <P>The purpose of insurance supervision is the protection of policyholders.  The basic duty of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Ireland, in common with the supervisory authorities of the other member states, in relation to insurance companies is the supervision of insurers to insure that they are solvent and to take the necessary measures to improve matters if they perceive any potential solvency difficulties.  I would stress that the basic supervisory procedures have already been harmonised throughout the European Community following the various directives which have been adopted in relation to both the life and non-life insurance sectors.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, within this basic framework, there are certain member states which are highly regulated and others which are perceived as being more liberal. The thrust of insurance supervision in Ireland can best be summarised by <Col N="1767" /> saying that fundamentally insurers are told what they may not do, as opposed to being required to obtain specific approval for what they may wish to do.  In the Irish context, intervention in the affairs of the insurance industry is intended to assist in maintaining the security, profitability and efficiency of the business in the interests of policyholders; it is not intended to be unnecessarily inhibiting or restricting on the sector.  The provisions of the Insurance Bill have been framed against this general background and it is significant that the provisions have been welcomed by all sectors of the insurance industry here.  While we are careful not to cut any corners in the insurance supervisory process, we are also very much aware of the need to maintain the normal commercial freedoms within which insurers can operate.</P>
    <P>In the context of the completion of the internal market and increased provision of insurance services across national frontiers, it is important to remember that all member states are particularly conscious of the need to supplement existing directives in order, particularly, to clarify the powers and means of supervision vested in the various supervisory authorities and because it is also eminently desirable to lay down common specific provisions regarding the taking up, pursuit and supervision of activity by way of freedom to provide insurance services.  Indeed, this is the course already followed by the recently adopted Non-life Insurance Services Directive and further directives in the insurance area will maintain this course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asserted that the requirement to localise assets in Ireland representing technical reserves of insurers on Irish business could cause competitive distortions which would harm the prospects of Irish insurers competing with their European Community counterparts.  At present the Irish regulations stipulate that, generally speaking, insurance undertakings must localise assets in the State equal to at least 80 per cent of technical reserves.  With the competitive factor mentioned by Deputy <Col N="1768" /> Bruton very much in mind, my Department have recently concluded an examination of the position in other member states and the results of this study show that, if anything, our requirements are liberal by comparison with other countries where, in the main, a 100 per cent domestic localisation of assets representing the technical reserves is required.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies questioned the need for transitional arrangements in the context of the recently adopted Non-Life Insurance Services Directive, and inferred that there is a lack of competition in the Irish non-life insurance market.  I will take the second point first. All players in the market agree that there has been a significant increase in competition in the Irish non-life insurance market since freedom of establishment by insurers was allowed in 1976.  Since then, 17 new entrants have established in the Irish insurance market, most of whom are competing actively for business. Indeed, Deputy Cullen in the course of this debate represented that in his view there was excessive competition in certain sectors of the non-life industry in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>As to the transitional arrangements negotiated for Ireland, the particular problems associated with the non-life insurance industry in recent years are widely recognised, with two of our largest insurers technically insolvent and under a process of public administration with State support and public financing mechanisms to resolve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The action of the Government in securing extra breathing space for the Irish non-life industry is totally consistent with the approach of the previous Government, in which Deputy Bruton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, which included a unilateral declaration in the Single European Act, 1986, to cater for the special position of the non-life industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The deadline for initial implementation of the services Directive for all member states, including Ireland, is 1 July 1990.  The full entry into force of the Directive is staggered for everybody.  In the case of eight of the member states, the quantitative thresholds will be set initially at higher levels and will reduce <Col N="1769" /> to the basic fourth company law thresholds of 250 employees from 1 January 1993.  In the case of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece, we have been given the facility to apply higher initial thresholds, in Ireland's case until the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1999 the basic quantitative thresholds will apply in Ireland. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the Irish non-life insurance industry will begin to open up to services competition from 1 January 1993 and will be faced with gradually increasing competition throughout the nineties as we move closer to these basic thresholds.  Of course, the Government always reserve the right to speed up the process between now and those dates.</P>
    <P>The transitional period negotiated for Ireland ties in with the broad timescale for the recovery of the PMPA to normal trading.  In any event, the arrangements are optional in nature and the phasing-in process, as I pointed out earlier, can be speeded up by the Government, if necessary, in the light of improving circumstances in the nineties.  It is quite sensible to negotiate the derogation, as not to have done so would have had implications for the administration of the PMPA and ICI, employment levels and for the premiums payable by most policyholders who do not fall into the large industrial and commercial risk categories covered by the services Directive.  I, therefore, reject the criticism which suggested that we should not have negotiated this breathing space.  Clearly, if it is examined objectively, one must agree that it was the sensible course of action.</P>
    <P>I would stress that this Government are not &ldquo;derogation-minded&rdquo;.  Because of our interest in the completion of the internal market on schedule, we have only sought derogation where we are convinced that there are exceptional problems which require special treatment for a temporary period.  This is obviously the case in non-life insurance.</P>
    <P>I have impressed on the Irish non-life insurance industry the need to prepare itself for the impact of open and free competition in insurance.  It is essential to improve efficiencies and get costs down and whatever rationalisation or <Col N="1770" /> reorganisation is necessary must now be undertaken by the industry in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>Even in a services context, the overall claims environment and claims costs in Ireland will continue to be the major determinants of premium rating levles. This is why the Government are taking determined action to bring about real cost-reducing changes in this whole area. Cost reductions will benefit all policyholders and not just those who can avail of freedom of services.</P>
    <P>I would take issue with Deputy Bruton's assertion that the present 1992 &ldquo;European&rdquo; awareness campaign is, in his words, manufacturing obsessed and that the whole financial services area, including insurance, is being ignored by Government.  The facts plainly show otherwise.  I have in recent weeks chaired regional seminars in the main centres of population around the country to spell out the implications of the completion of the internal market for all sectors of the business community in Ireland.  I have been accompanied to these seminars by an assistant secretary and a principal officer from my Department who are responsible for the International Financial Services Centre and the insurance sector, respectively.  Their attendance at the various seminars is specifically to deal with questions on the opportunities and challanges in the financial services sector arising from 1992.  Furthermore, many of the European information leaflets deal specifically with financial services topics such as banking and mortgage credit, insurance, exchange controls and capital movements.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments of Deputies in relation to the charging of fees under section 7 of the Bill.  I will bear these and the views of all interested parties in mind when considering a fee structure which I intend to be fair and reasonable and supervised.  I am aware that in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, fees have been linked to premium income on a sliding scale basis.  As to Deputy Cullen's point that fee harmonisation throughout the European Community would be a useful exercise, I would simply observe that the fees in any jurisdiction would not be at a level which could distort <Col N="1771" /> competition between insurers in the different member states.  For example, in the case of the United Kindgom the total annual fee for an undertaking with gross premiums in excess of ST£1.5 million is set around £5,000 at present.  This is hardly a competitive factor in the context of the internal market in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton inquired about section 19 of the Bill, specifically subsection (3) dealing with the display of policy terms and premium rates, as to who would police the provisions in relation to the display of the requisite information.  I would point out first of all that section 19 as framed is a reserve power to be invoked only where warranted by specific circumstances.  To date, my Department have received very few complaints from consumers expressing concern at a lack of full or fair information from insurers on premium levels or policy conditions. Nevertheless, the opportunity is being availed of in the Bill of providing power to the Minister to require the display of such information.  We all agree that it is desirable in the consumers' interest that insurers should provide meaningful information to clients on what is to be covered by a particular insurance policy, how much it costs, what no claims bonuses provisions apply and so on.</P>
    <P>If orders are brought in at any stage in the future which oblige insurers to display certain information in relation to their policies, I have no doubt that underwriters will accept and discharge these requirements to the full.  As is normal practice, the Department would consult fully with insurance interests before any display order would be made.  The making of a display order would be publicised and the general public would obviously expect insurers to comply with the legal requirements.</P>
    <P>In addition, staff in the insurance section of my Department would, in the normal course of their duties, carry out periodic checks and I can assure the Deputy that no staffing implications are foreseen in this respect.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the question of the criteria to be used in assessing the qualifications of directors and managers of insurers.  The purpose of section 20 is <Col N="1772" /> to enable the Minister to assess on an ongoing basis the quality of insurance company management in the interests of both shareholders and policyholders.  I do not consider it desirable to lay down a list of specific criteria for assessing the suitability of directors and managers because there is always the danger that such a list might not be comprehensive enough to deal with all cases that may arise.  In deciding on the suitability of directors, managers and authorised agents I will, of course, take into account a person's track record by reference to previous business experience, competence, qualifications and expertise in the insurance and financial areas.  Deputy Bruton stated that it seemed to him that there were all types of possibilities for extremely subjective judgments by the Minister and that those judgments would not be open to question by anybody.  I can assure the House that the powers will be exercised judiciously where necessary or desirable in order for the Minister to satisfy himself as to the capacity of those directing insurers' business.  I would draw attention to the avenue for appeal under section 20 (7), which allows an insurance undertaking to appeal to the High Court in the event of an objection of the Minister to any individual.  It should also be pointed out that such an appeal procedure may be heard in Chambers so as not to damage the interests of the insurer concerned.  Again I would make the point that any Minister for Industry and Commerce would have to exercise care and apply considered judgment before proceeding down this avenue.  At the end of the day, the Minister must act reasonably in relation to insurers supervised by him.</P>
    <P>Deputies Foley and Dempsey raised the question of commission payments. The reason powers in Part III are being taken at all is to enable me to curb excessive commissions should the need arise. They are, in effect, maximum price control powers.</P>
    <P>On the non-life side, some brokers would argue that commission levels are too low for certain classes and that these were reduced by insurers.  Insurers on the other hand would point out that these commissions are calculated on a percentage of gross premiums basis and that, <Col N="1773" /> generally speaking, over the last decade or so increases in liability, in motor rates in particular, have far outstripped the level of general inflation.  Indeed that is why the Government have taken action overall in the package to which I referred earlier to reduce the cost of insurance to the public.  As I said earlier, this is now beginning to take effect.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already be aware that the powers to control commission levels are reserving powers to be activated if self-regulation by the industry fails and consumer interests are eroded by excessive commission payments.  The powers are very much in the nature of controls on maximum levels of commission payments. My primary concern in this has to be the consumer.  Free holidays in exotic locations and that type of nonsense at the expense of consumers simply will not be allowed.  I will expect that all sectors of the industry regulate their affairs in a reasonable manner.  However, it is not the intention that the Minister should interfere with responsible market forces or the normal commercial interplay between intermediaries and insurers.  I will not act as a form of pay arbitrater for insurers and their intermediaries.  This, in my view, is a function of insurance company management on the one hand and the intermediaries and their representative bodies on the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the manner in which life assurance policies are sold. There are certain occasions when, because of the hard-sell attitude of certain unscrupulous sales people, a portion of life assurance business is taken on which simply ought not to have been taken on.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dick Spring gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of difficulties being experienced in the Munster area by freezing home heating oil.  The matter is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is important that it is aired and that the Minister in question should be given an opportunity to respond.  I sought leave this morning to bring this matter to the attention of the House because of the substantial number of complaints which I have received in the last two days, which indicated that there is a serious problem with certain grades of home heating oil.  This has become apparent in the last two days since the cold weather has begun.  In the last two nights home heating oil which was distributed throughout Munster has frozen, in many instances, at temperatures equivalent to -4º.  The most serious element in the complaints that I have received lies in the fact that all the oil that is causing this problem is oil which is refined at Whitegate.  The distributors with whom I have been in contact in Counties Cork and Kerry and also outside the Munster region, in Wexford, have confirmed that the difficulty has been experienced only with oil which has come from Whitegate as opposed to oil in use in these areas which has come from refineries in Britain in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last 24 hours complaints have been received by some distributors from over 20 customers and I have concluded that there seems to be little doubt that there is a serious problem.  This problem has to be addressed now because if we do not address it now and give some guidance to the distributors and the consumers then a far more severe problem will arise when the weather worsens and <Col N="1775" /> before the winter is over.  It is unlikely that we have had the most severe blast of weather for the winter and it is reasonable to expect that the severe weather which we have experienced for the past two days will be surpassed long before January is over.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that this problem has occurred; it was highlighted some years ago.  Since then new standards have been introduced to cover all home heating oil.  In years gone by there were two grades of home heating oil, winter grade and summer grade.  The essential difference between the two grades was that summer grade oil would freeze easily and winter grade oil would not freeze until a temperature of -10º was reached.  I understand that all oil is now intended to be covered by the same standard as laid down by the IIRS and what is commonly known as IS251.  This means that basically no home heating oil should freeze until a temperature of -10º or less is reached.</P>
    <P>The reason this problem is confined to the Munster area in particular is that Whitegate oil, the product of the refinery at Whitegate, is distributed mainly in the Munster region for the obvious reason of minimising cost to the distributors.  I am sure the House and the Minister are well aware of the fact that oil companies must get approximately 35 per cent of their requirement from Whitegate, as laid down by previous Governments.  Since the oil is distributed by road transport it is obviously cost effective from the company's points of view to distribute it as closely as possible to the refinery.</P>
    <P>There are some serious questions which I would like the Minister to respond to.  Firstly, is the standard applying to all home heating oil adequate?  Has there been some slippage in the monitoring of the standard?  Would the Minister indicate to the House how frequent the monitoring is of the oil which is in supply at present?  More to the point, is the standard being applied to oil from Whitegate, and if not, why not?</P>
    <P>From the number of complaints that have been received in the past 48 hours it appears that, at least in this instance, substandard oil has been allowed to be shipped out of Whitegate for distribution <Col N="1776" /> in Munster.  I describe it as substandard oil because it has not stayed in its liquid form at temperatures of -4º over the past two days.  One distributor described the oil in a particular home heating installation as more like a jelly substance than oil.  It was in such a state that it would not flow through the normal domestic heating system.  The question is how has this oil gone into distribution and become available to the consumer?  This matter is to be taken seriously by the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>It also raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the system in Whitegate. I would like to think that, by raising and highlighting this matter at this early stage of winter, steps can be taken, firstly, to acknowledge that there is a problem and, secondly, to alleviate the problem and make sure that it does not happen again.  In some instances today people such as district nurses were quite frantic in contacting oil distributors and agencies to ensure that people could get alternative heating or that some emergency supply could be made available because old people who are totally dependent on their domestic oil systems were in distress.</P>
    <P>A serious question arises if oil from Whitegate is allowed to be of a lower standard than home heating oil that is imported directly into this country.  As one who has defended Whitegate down through the years, all I can say is that this would not be in the interest of Whitegate and certainly not in the interest of the oil industry.  It might be tempting to speculate that there are other interests who would feel very well served if Whitegate were to get a reputation for a substandard and shoddy product, but I do not believe that would be in the national interest. That is why I have taken steps to bring this to the attention of the Department at the earliest possible opportunity.  I ask the Minister to give us an assurance, first, that this complaint will be investigated fully and that a response will be given in relation to the seriousness of the complaint and, secondly, that steps will be taken to ensure there are no more problems with home heating oil supplied from Whitegate stocks in the course of this winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me assure the Deputy that I have taken careful note of the points he has raised and will ensure that they are taken into account in the context of consideration of the appropriate Irish specification for diesel oil.</P>
      <P>My Department at present have not received any complaints concerning the freezing of home heating oil in the Munster area.  I have ascertained, however, from the Department of Energy that a number of oil suppliers in the Munster area have received complaints which they are investigating at present.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Irish National Petroleum Corporation refinery at Whitegate is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that Whitegate supplies 35 per cent of the motor spirit/gasoil requirements of the Irish market under the terms of the fuels order.  The INPC supply home heating oil to winter-grade specifications all year round, that is oil which operates successfully down to a temperature of -12º Celcius.  In this regard, I am informed by the Meteorological Office that temperature in the Munster area did not fall below -6º Celcius in the last few days.  I hope Deputy Spring will take careful note of those points of information received from the Meteorological Office.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Energy have informed me that some suppliers supply two grades of oil during the year, a summer grade, which operates down to -4º Celsius and a winter grade which operates down to -12º Celsius.  It is possible that the problems to which the Deputy is referring may have occurred and been caused in installations containing summer grade oil or a mixture of summer and winter grade oils.  This oil waxing problem last occurred in January 1987, following which, with great alacrity, the Government asked the then IIRS to investigate and report on changes in the winter grade specification which might be needed to avoid the problem. As a result of that investigation, the standard was strengthened in November 1987 <Col N="1778" /> to specify a low temperature limit of -12º Celcius rather than -9º Celcius, which was introduced in 1981 and which continued to appertain while Deputy Spring was in Government and represented the Government as Tánaiste and as a very senior Minister in that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are concerned to ensure that consumers are aware of the problems which can occur during spells of extremely cold weather. In line with this, on 17 November last that is Thursday of last week, just a few days ago, the Minister issued a press release warning of these dangers.  In the press release, the Minister announced that he had directed the National Standards Authority of Ireland to organise a special consumer information campaign on winter grade diesel and heating oils. The aim of the campaign is to ensure that home owners, farmers, and transport fleet operators will know what precautions to take to protect their oil supplies, heating systems and diesel vehicles against freezing in very cold weather conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister has secured the co-operation of the oil companies to fund the campaign.  They have agreed to distribute a leaflet, prepared by the NSAI in co-operation with the oil companies themselves, to every customer explaining the precautions to be taken.  This is a unique achievement which, if Deputy Spring had had the initiative to take, he would have been proud of.  The thrust of the leaflet is that if the consumer takes common-sense steps now to protect his tank and equipment, then in the conditions we normally get in this country when he presses the button the heating will come on or the tractor will start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister keeps under review, on an ongoing basis, the standard specifications which apply to oil supplied on the Irish market.  In this regard, I would point out that the Irish standard applied to home heating oil, in relation to its cold weather properties, is exactly the same as the standard which applies in the United Kingdom, where much more severe weather conditions can occur, as, no <Col N="1779" /> doubt, Deputy Spring is aware as a result of his numerous visits to the UK when he was Tánaiste and Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>While it would be possible to specify operating limits to extremely low temperatures, as is done in countries like Canada, this approach would be extremely costly and supplies of such oil would be quite difficult to obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for his great understanding.  The cost of setting Siberian or Yukon limits would be very high to provide oil with cold weather performance which is needed only for a few days, in pockets of the country which vary each year depending on weather patterns.  Indeed, in most years the winter frosts in Ireland never reach a level that affects oil flow properties. It is clearly more cost effective to employ precautionary methods and measures in this limited number of affected areas and cases than to impose a cost penalty on the domestic and industrial sectors as a whole by requiring a winter grade standard which is more severe than that applying in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would strongly urge consumers to take precautions to avoid <Col N="1780" /> waxing problems or mixing.  First, when they are buying their heating oil for use in the winter months, they should always specify and insist on getting winter grade oil.  That is common sense.  Second, they should obtain a copy of the information leaflet from their suppliers and follow the advice given.  I hope we do not get the sort of weather that Deputy Spring is predicting.  He is becoming a master artist in the prediction of doom and gloom.  I hope he is not going into the weather forecasting business because if he does we are going to have a rather disastrous end of year and New Year.  I hope his dreamy predictions for the future weather of Ireland will prove to be totally unfounded.</P>

      <P>With your indulgence I would like to put one brief question to the Minister of State.  His eloquent geographical gymnastic waxing has left me a little bewildered.  I want to clarify that I understood the Minister responsible for Science and Technology correctly when he said that all of the oil supplied from Whitegate to the consumer is winter grade oil and that thus we can conclude that there should not be a problem at minus four degrees celsius with that oil product?</P>

Where a proposed merger or take-over involves at least one enterprise which carries on business in the State and the parties concerned exceed certain financial thresholds, the Act requires all of the enterprises concerned to notify me.

    <P>The Deputies will be aware that in May 1987 I signed the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order which among other things banned the retail sale of grocery <Col N="1555" /> goods below cost.  Fresh vegetables together with other grocery goods particularly liable to deterioration were excluded from the scope of the order.  In view of the fact that the imposition of a ban on below cost selling was seen by many as a major interference in the market place I decided that the order would be reviewed after it had been in operation for one year.  The order came into effect on 11 December 1987 and it is, therefore, due for review next month. The question of including potatoes within the scope of the order will be examined in detail as part of this review.  I have discussed this matter with the IFA and I am currently examining their submission on the effects of the exclusion of potatoes from the scope of the order.  It would be premature, however, to give any indication of the likely outcome of the review at this point.</P>

    <P>The initial bid for Irish Distillers Group plc by GC &amp; C Brands Limited, which at <Col N="1556" /> that stage was controlled by Allied Lyons plc, Grand Metropolitan plc and Guinness plc, was notified to me under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, on 27 June 1988.  I referred the matter to the Fair Trade Commission on 6 July 1988 for investigation and report in relation to the scheduled criteria to the 1978 Act. The commission's report was submitted to me on 5 August 1988.  However, as a result of intervention by the European Commission this bid lapsed.</P>
    <P>Subsequently GC &amp; C Brands Limited, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan's Irish subsidiary, Gilbeys of Ireland Group Limited, made a fresh bid for Irish Distillers.  Notification, in accordance with the 1978 Act, of this proposal was made to me on 22 August 1988.  I requested the Fair Trade Commission to investigate this proposal in accordance with the Act on 30 August 1988 and I received its report on 18 October 1988.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent offer by Pernod Ricard to acquire the shares in Irish Distillers a notification was received by me on 5 October 1988 and referred to the Fair Trade Commission on 11 October. The report of the commission's investigation was submitted to me on 9 November 1988.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the 1978 Act, having received a report from the commission of its investigations into a proposal referred to it, I have the option of allowing a proposal proceed without objection or, if I think that the exigencies of the common good so warrant, after consultation with any other Minister of the Government appearing to be concerned, I may, by order, prohibit a proposal either absolutely or except on conditions specified in the order.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining the commission's reports in relation to both proposals and expect to reach my decision shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Savings arising from the compulsory wearing of seat belts are already reflected in motor premium levels as the measure was introduced in February 1979.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the compulsory display of windscreen insurance discs in 1986 has made identification of uninsured vehicles easier for the Garda and this is reflected in the latest estimated national level of uninsured driving of 6.8 per cent, which compares with an estimated level of 15-20 per cent prior to the introduction of the disc.  While this improvement is to be welcomed, I should stress that this level of uninsured driving adds on average about £28.60 to the cost of each motor policy, or £28.6 million overall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is already apparent that premium levels, particularly in motor insurance, have been reducing in recent months as a result of increased competition in the market place and in anticipation of the <Col N="1559" /> benefits arising from reorganisation in the legal system and other Government measures to improve the environment for insurance.</P>
    <P>Members of the Irish Insurance Federation have delivered on their commitment to offer a 10 per cent to 20 per cent no claims bonus to young drivers taking out their first policies if they have been named drivers on their parents policies for two years, have a full licence and have been accident free.</P>
    <P>The results of a published survey on motor insurance premium levels carried out by my Department indicate that decreases of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in specific third party motor rates and 13 per cent in young drivers' rates have occurred within the last 12 months or so.  The latest Automobile Associations survey of motoring costs reports similarly encouraging trends.  These positive indications are borne out by the Consumer Price Index which has recorded a reduction of 1.6 per cent in motor insurance costs in the period from May 1987 to August 1988.</P>
    <P>In addition, the largest motor insurance company in the State has, with effect from 1 October 1988, implemented rate adjustments on the comprehensive elements of private motor insurance policies equivalent to an overall reduction of 3 per cent in its private motor premium income.</P>
    <P>With regard to insurance premiums for industry, the most recent Confederation of Irish Industry survey indicates that, on average, employers liability insurance rates have fallen from 2.78 per cent of payroll costs in 1986 to 1.85 per cent of payroll costs in 1988.  This is a significant improvement in an area which may have acted as a disincentive to employment in some cases in the past.</P>
    <P>It is clear that competition and Government action have already created the momentum to bring about actual reductions in insurance premium levels for both industry and the motoring public.  My Department, in co-operation with the CII and other relevant bodies, <Col N="1560" /> have made arrangements to monitor premium movements in these areas on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that the cost of insurance is directly related to the number and cost of claims.  Only when the number of accidents, settlement and award levels and other associated costs are reduced will the problem of high insurance premiums be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Government are fostering the environment for lower premiums. However, I am also very conscious of the dangers involved if an insurer were to reduce its rates below a financially viable level and I am certainly not advocating that.  My Department will continue to keep a close eye on developments in this area to ensure that the interests of the insuring public are protected both in relation to the cost of their insurance and the solvency of their insurers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to assess with any degree of accuracy the impact on job creation of changes in the tax code in relation to accelerated depreciation allowances.  The changes introduced in the Finance Act, 1988, are, I believe, useful in accelerating the shift in incentives from support for fixed assets towards other areas of perceived weaknesses in industry such as marketing, product and management development. I would not favour, at this stage, the total elimination of accelerated depreciation as it would probably slow down the rate of industrial investment and reduce the <Col N="1562" /> attractiveness of our overseas incentives package.</P>
      <P>As part of the reorientation of industrial policy announced in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> there is now a wider use of employment grants and it is now standard practice to incorporate in grant agreements performance clauses which trigger grant payments and/or clawback clauses which safeguard the State's investment in the event of performance not being as promised.  This means that companies are aware from the outset of the employment targets that must be met if they are to receive full State support.  This will ensure a higher conversion rate of jobs promised to jobs created.</P>

Submarines must travel on the surface in such cases and must fly their flags.  My Department has no record of such transits having taken place in the last five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of Irish vessels at sea has been a matter of particular concern to the Government.  The Government have brought the issue to the attention of all parties concerned through the channels <Col N="1568" /> of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and has raised at the IMO four incidents involving boats damaged or lost since 1982 outside Irish territorial waters.  The list includes well publicised casualties to fishing vessels which were caused or were likely to have been caused by submerged submarines.</P>
    <P>We understand that in at least one of the cases the owners of a damaged fishing vessel have sought compensation and that compensation has been paid.  Claims for compensation in such cases are essentially a civil matter.  A particular problem clearly arises in incidents involving unidentified vessels.  The Government will take whatever action is open to them to assist in the identification of such vessels thus facilitating any action for damages that might be taken.</P>
    <P>The Government has already taken steps to highlight the dangers posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines. Ireland sponsored a resolution at the IMO aimed at focusing attention on the problems posed to fishermen by submarine traffic.  The initiative resulted in the unanimous adoption on 17 November 1987 by the General Assembly of the IMO of a resolution entitled &ldquo;Avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their fishing gear&rdquo;.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to suggestions by a company (details supplied) in Dublin in relation to their proposal for Inns Court, that the tax incentives for Dublin represent half of those which apply to other urban renewal centres such as Waterford and Limerick; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the tax advantages favour purchasers of units and their occupants as opposed to the builders-developers; his views on whether this is an anomalous situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Representations from the company concerned have recently been referred to me, expressing the views contained in the Deputy's question.  In fact, the Dublin designated area has exactly the same range of development incentives as the other designated areas referred to, apart from the reduced rate of accelerated capital allowances, which is available at 50 per cent, rather than at 100 per cent.  I have already dealt with the reason for this exception in my reply to Deputy Birmingham on 10 November last.</P>
      <P>I would not agree that the tax incentives in the designated areas create an anomalous situation as between builders-developers on the one hand, and purchasers-occupants, on the other.  The relevant incentives are intended primarily to promote urban renewal, and this gives a direct stimulus to the construction sector in meeting the demand for buildings to which the incentives are applicable. This obviously is of direct and major benefit to the builders-developers.  It is of course quite open to any builders-developers to retain ownership of the buildings they have constructed and either to occupy or lease them, and thus avail immediately of the various tax reliefs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no one rate of interest at which State companies can borrow money.  The rate varies, depending on the commercial status of the organisation and also on whether the borrowing is undertaken in Irish or foreign currency, the type of borrowing, fixed or floating rate, the borrowing instrument used, as well as the repayment terms required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, a ministerial guarantee will enable State companies to borrow on <Col N="1570" /> more attractive terms than could be achieved without such guarantee.  Recent experience suggests however that prime State borrowers with a good commercial record can borrow without ministerial guarantee at an extremely competitive cost.</P>

      <P>The works being undertaken in the Oireachtas Library form part of the major scheme of structural repairs to the north wing of Leinster House.</P>
      <P>The need for these works arises from the structural failure of the north-east gable wall.  This caused cracking in the masonry and plasterwork in the Seanad Chamber and the Oireachtas Library.  It also caused sagging of the floor in the Seanad Chamber which in turn gave rise to deflection in the Oireachtas Library ceiling with resultant damage to the plasterwork in the ceiling.</P>
      <P>The structural problems in the gable wall have been corrected as has the sagging in the Seanad floor over the Library. The damage to the Library ceiling will be corrected using conventional plaster ceiling restoration techniques.  The walls will be replastered as necessary and the Library will be redecorated.</P>
      <P>The work in the Library is an integral part of the overall project for the structural repair of the north wing of Leinster House and unfortunately it cannot be attended to out of sequence with the overall programme of work.  The present indications are that the Library will not be available for normal use for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any inconvenience caused to Members of the Oireachtas and to the staff of the Houses due to the structural repair works is very much regretted.  The Commissioners of Public Works and their contractors are making every effort to minimise the inconvenience and will continue to do so.  I am advised however that a short-term closure of library facilities may be necessary while the ceiling is being repaired.  Any such closure would <Col N="1576" /> of course be discussed with the appropriate Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas if it should prove to be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not possible without considerable research which could not be justified to isolate the expenditure to date on the Library from the overall expenditure on the project.  Since the work in the Library is an integral part of the overall scheme, I do not consider its completion to be inordinately long.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to provide the <Col N="1577" /> information sought in the second part of the question because until recently it has not been the practice for the Garda authorities to monitor the charges brought against persons following their extradition to other jurisdictions.

      <P>It is not correct to speak of persons being extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland or of applications being received from those jurisdictions under the terms of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987. These matters continue to be governed by the relevant provisions of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965.  The provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, will, of course, apply to certain applications received from those jurisdictions. For the purposes of my reply, I am assuming that the Deputy is seeking figures for the number of applications received to which the provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, apply and the number of persons extradited on foot of such applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Warrants have been received in respect of five persons to whom the provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, apply.  One of the persons has been returned to Britain in accordance with an order of the District Court made under section 47 of the 1965 Act.  In addition, warrants in respect of a further six persons were received and subsequently recalled by the requesting authorities. The 1987 Act provisions applied to two of these cases, and the warrants in respect of the remaining four were recalled <Col N="1578" /> before there was an opportunity to establish whether the provisions of the 1987 Act applied.</P>

      <P>I am not aware, nor are the Garda authorities whom I have consulted, that there is, as the question implies, an increasing tendency for motorists to ignore red traffic lights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement of road traffic legislation is, of course, a matter for the Garda Síochána.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, having regard to the many other demands on their services, the Garda are taking all practical steps to enforce the requirements of the law relating to traffic lights.  These requirements are contained in the Road Traffic General Bye-Laws, 1964.  The number of prosecutions taken in 1987 for offences generally under these by-laws including going through red traffic lights, was 4,621.  Infringements of the by-laws may also, in sufficiently serious cases, give rise to prosecutions for dangerous <Col N="1579" /> driving, careless driving or driving without reasonable consideration for other road users.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice in view of the apparent inability of the Garda Síochána to enforce traffic laws especially in our major urban areas and in view of the likelihood of widespread objections to any diversion of Garda resources from other matters, if he will introduce a special force to enforce traffic laws with reference to improving safety, mobility and accessibility for citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion contained in the question that roads-related legislation is not being actively enforced by the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Commissioner's Report on Crime for the year 1987 indicates that proceedings were taken in that year in respect of a total of 526,293 offences under the Road Traffic Acts, the Road Transport Acts and the Roads Act &mdash; an increase of nearly 21,000 on the corresponding figure for 1986.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, there is already a Traffic Corps within the Garda Síochána with a unit in each Garda Division, which has special responsibility for traffic control and accident prevention. In addition, traffic wardens are employed by the Garda Commissioner in Dublin and by the local authorities at a number of other urban centres to enforce parking regulations and thereby improve traffic flows.  I do not see that there is any particular need to set up a special force to enforce traffic laws.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities can be relied upon to ensure that adequate resources will continue to be made available for the enforcement of roads-related legislation having regard to the many demands that the force has to meet.  The Garda of course maintain full co-operation with the various Departments, local authorities and other agencies which also have responsibilities in the area of road traffic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the percentage of those examined by the Department's medical referees who had their invalidity pension claims disallowed on medical grounds as a result, for each of the years from 1980 to 1987 and the first six months of 1988.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of invalidity pensioners found capable of work following examination by the Department's statutorily appointed medical referees are as follows: 1980, 20; 1981, 20; 1982, 10; 1983, 6; 1984, 7; 1985, 9; 1986, 11; 1987, 31; 1988 (June), 50.</P>
      <P>Separate figures of the numbers of invalidity pension cases referred for examination have not been kept so it is not possible to give percentages as requested.  However, it is estimated that in 1987 some 1,500 cases were referred for examination and approximately 750 in the first six months of 1988, which would result in disallowance percentage rates of some 2% in 1987, and 6% in the first half of this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of short-term unemployment assistance recipients with dependants who benefited under the <Col N="1584" /> urban fuel scheme in the winter 1986-1987; and the numbers of such people estimated by his Department to be losing out this winter and last winter since their exclusion from the fuel scheme's coverage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that some 5,000 short term unemployment assistance claimants with dependants were in receipt of a weekly fuel voucher at the end of the 1986/87 fuel season under the former Urban Fuel Scheme.</P>
      <P>A national fuel scheme with uniform criteria throughout the whole country was introduced last year, and at the same time the scheme was extended to include 30,000 long term unemployed who were previously excluded.</P>
      <P>The urban fuel scheme, which operated in 17 urban areas only, was replaced from October 1987 by the national fuel scheme which operates nationally. Unemployment assistance applicants in receipt of the short-term rate are not eligible for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.  However, in order to safeguard the position of existing recipients, a &ldquo;saver clause&rdquo; was introduced whereby all existing entitlements were preserved unless circumstances had changed.  Those who had qualified at the end of the 1986/87 fuel season for a fuel voucher under the urban fuel scheme but who did not satisfy the conditions of the national fuel scheme, were thus entitled to receive the allowance in the 1987/88 and current fuel seasons under this saver clause.  No statistics are available about how many of the 5,000 applicants in question are still in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Nor is it known as regards those still in receipt of unemployment assistance, how many of them have had a relevant change of circumstances but the number would be minimal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy arising from the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 135 of 2 November, 1988, the number of trees felled under the 989 licences granted during the period 1 October, 1978 to 30 September, 1988; if his attention has been drawn to widespread tree felling without such licences; whether any prosecutions have been made in respect of unlicensed felling; and the system his Department have for monitoring licensing and compliance with licence conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two types of felling licences are granted by my Department &mdash; general and limited. General felling licences are granted to owners of forest plantations who are carrying out a systematic scheme of thinning or clearfelling and replanting in accordance with good forestry practice. These licences cover areas of forest rather than numbers of trees.  Limited <Col N="1589" /> felling licences are granted in respect of specified trees.</P>
      <P>Of the 989 licences granted during the period 1 October 1978 to 30 September 1988, 893 were limited felling licences which authorised the felling of 732,473 trees.  The remaining 96 licences were general felling licences covering areas of forest and it is not possible to state the number of trees involved.  General felling licences are granted only after a detailed inspection of the area involved by my Department, the consequent drawing up by my officials of felling programmes to be carried out by the applicant and the inspection of such programmes to ensure that specified conditions have been met.</P>
      <P>Cases of felling without licence are reported by the Garda, local authorities, members of the public and local inspectors of my Department.  The number of such reports does not suggest that widespread illegal tree felling is taking place. If the Deputy is aware of cases where illegal felling is taking place, perhaps he would bring these to my attention so that action can be taken against those involved.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions have been made in respect of unlicensed felling &mdash; five cases have been prosecuted in the past 12 months &mdash; and relevant penalties have been substantially increased under the Forestry Act, 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983, arising from specific recommendations of the Trident report, the then Minister entered into a pricing agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries.  That agreement set parameters for Irish trade prices of drugs and medicines by reference to directly comparable trade prices in the United Kingdom.  Some 85 per cent of drugs and medicines on the Irish market are imported from the UK.  The agreement <Col N="1604" /> with the FICI was renewed in August 1986.  At my request, officials of my Department undertook a renegotiation of the agreement in the summer of 1987. A new agreement took effect from 1 August 1987.</P>
      <P>I share the view of my predecessors in office that the general level of manufacturers' prices and wholesalers' trade prices obtaining in the UK, and therefore in Northern Ireland also, offers a reasonable basis for the establishment of trade prices here.</P>
      <P>I have no function as regards the retail prices of drugs and medicines paid by private patients in high street retail pharmacies.</P>
      <P>Direct comparisons of trade prices in selected continental countries does indicate that drug prices in some countries are much lower than they are in the UK. However, a very broad spectrum of social, economic and market circumstances must be taken into consideration when such comparisons are made.  The level of trade prices on the Irish market will, however, be kept under constant review, particularly as regards the situation which will arise from movements towards completion of the internal market within the European Community by the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>The current agreement with FICI is scheduled to run until July 1990.  This agreement provides that, on average, trade prices of drugs supplied through the GMS scheme shall not exceed the comparable UK trade prices by more than 7 per cent, after allowance for currency differentials.  A rebate of 5 per cent of trade price cost of drugs supplied in the GMS is payable by companies, reducing the net differential on GMS sales considerably.  The GMS accounts for 55 per cent of all Exchequer expenditure on drugs and medicines, with hospital purchases accounting for most of the remainder.</P>
      <P>In the hospital services, a mandatory discount of at least 15 per cent is available on listed trade prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current agreement also provided for a 15 month absolute freeze on Irish trade prices, regardless both of currency <Col N="1605" /> movements and of ongoing price increases in the British market.  This price freeze ended on 31 October and companies were then entitled to recalibrate their prices in line with the agreement.  It is estimated that this recalibration will give rise to an average increase of about 7 per cent in trade prices generally.</P>

      <P>There are 857 existing remedial teaching posts in primary schools.  30 posts were sanctioned in 1987. Remedial teachers in post-primary schools were regarded as ex-quota from the commencement of the 1979-80 school-year.  One hundred such posts were approved for post-primary schools in 1979-1980, a further 100 posts were approved in 1980-81 and 37 posts were approved in 1985-86.</P>

    <P>A further 55 ex-quota posts were allocated under the terms of my Department's Circular Letter No. 23/86 and designated as remedial/guidance.

In addition, many post-primary schools employ remedial teachers within their approved quota of posts who have been trained in the area of remedial education.</P>
    <P>My Department's records do not show the number of remedial teachers appointed by school authorities within the normal quota of teaching posts.
