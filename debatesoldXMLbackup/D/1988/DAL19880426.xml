      <P>asked the Taoiseach the groups, organisations and individuals he met during his visit to the United States; the general topics discussed; in the light of his decisions, if any new measures are expected to be taken to assist the plight of out-of-status Irish in the United States; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice to make statements on brief working visits of this type. I would, however, like to take the opportunity afforded by these questions to tell the Dáil how encouraged I was at the favourable view taken in the United States of prospects for the economy here, for changes in the immigration laws and by the great volume of sympathy and support there is for the Irish people in <Col N="1890" /> their desire to bring peace and justice to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the visit, one of my main priorities was to assess at first hand the present situation of Irish emigrants in the US and how our efforts on their behalf are progressing.  I had meetings with the Immigration Working Committees under the aegis of the Consulates-General in both New York and Boston, as well as discussions with Senator Edward Kennedy who, together with Senator Simpson and Congressmen Donnelly and Schumer, have brought forward legislative proposals to reform the immigration laws.  There is every chance that this legislation will be enacted this year. It would represent a considerable improvement in the position of young Irish people working in the US.  I availed of every opportunity during my visit to urge the Irish-American community to use their influence to have the legislation successfully enacted.  In meetings which I had with Cardinal O'Connor of New York and Cardinal Law of Boston, this issue was at the centre of our mutual concerns.  I regard the discussions I had on this subject as very useful and constructive.</P>
    <P>The promotion of the financial services centre, industrial investment and tourism were among my principal concerns in my meetings with US and Irish-American businessmen and in media interviews which I gave.  Again here, I found the discussions extremely useful and potentially of great benefit to Ireland.</P>
    <P>On Northern Ireland, I availed of my visit to reiterate a number of important features of Government policy.  I reiterated again the Government's adherence to the Anglo-Irish Agreement to which, as an international accord, they are fully committed to working as part of the process for funding peace, stability and reconciliation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In short, I took the opportunity afforded by the visit to bring to attention in the US, across a wide spectrum of opinion, the main priorities and concerns of the Irish Government at this time, I regard the visit as having been very satisfactory and successful.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the extent to which the proposed legislation with regard to Irish emigrants will, in fact, protect those already in the United States and out of status?  Will the legislation deal with areas such as medical care and support while these people are out of work and so forth?  Also, will the Taoiseach clarify to the House his attitude with regard to Northern Ireland, in view of the confusion that appears to have been created by some of the statements which he made in the United States?  Does he consider that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is now a long-term agreement and not one simply to be set aside at the earliest opportunity?</P>

      <P>I am attempting to be brief, a Ceann Comhairle.  In relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, what is the attitude of the Taoiseach now to the question of devolved government in Northern Ireland?  He seems to be implying, in reports of his speeches, that he no longer sees that as a viable option for Northern Ireland.  Will he clarify, finally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me just complete my final question.  Does the Taoiseach consider now that there is no possible option for a solution based on an internal arrangement within Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only part of the Deputy's question which I understand is his question about young Irish people who are out of status in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been evident over the last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that a considerable amount of progress has been made in that regard. The Kennedy Bill, which has gone through the Senate and a counterpart of which is now before the House of Representatives, would greatly improve the position of many young Irish people. There is, of course, the proviso that applications for visas under it would have to be made from here.  I do not think that would be a difficulty for most of these people.  Apart from that, there is some political movement on at the moment to bring forward the date of the amnesty.  It is difficult to ascertain or assess what success that might have.  One of the main matters on which I was concentrating when over there was on the work on the ground which is taking place on behalf of these young people, particularly in New York and Boston where there is a great deal going on, through the Catholic Archdiocesan charities and through the city <Col N="1893" /> administrations and by means of the work of our own consulates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I note in the Taoiseach's response that he states one of the principal reasons for the trip to the United States was the marketing of the financial services centre.  In that regard he considers his job to be a job well done.  I can only conclude there is less confusion in the United States arising from his trip than there is at present on this island. Will the Taoiseach outline to the House now in what way the media reporting on his visit were encouraged to report that he now favoured a federal solution as envisaged by the New Ireland Forum report?  Alternatively, will the Taoiseach outline his view of a federal solution?  Has the Taoiseach a strategy for achieving a federal solution?  If this is the Taoiseach's ideal would he accept that a proper federal approach requires fundamental constitutional change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with those points I will also deal with the points raised by Deputy De Rossa.  The best thing I can do is to recommend that Deputies read my speeches.  At no time in the United States did I even mention the word &ldquo;federal&rdquo; or a federal solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just stating my position.  I never at any stage mentioned a federal solution or used the word &ldquo;federal&rdquo;, nor did I talk about devolved government in Northern Ireland when in the US.  I would ask Deputies to read my speeches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any fair minded person reading those four speeches would accept that they presented a very fair and reasonable picture of recent developments and events in Northern Ireland, particularly since the beginning of this year.  They also contain a very clear and specific outline of the Government's policy in regard to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Why, at no stage in those speeches did the Taoiseach indicate what the next step in the process was, and why did he make it clear to any fair minded person reading those speeches that his references to the Anglo-Irish Agreement were just to take the bare look off things?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only reject that suggestion by Deputy Dukes.  It was not anything near a fair assessment of the thrust of my speeches in America.  In fact I would say that in practically everything I said on Northern Ireland I repeated in some detail all the things I have been saying in this House.  For instance, with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, I made clear both in my speeches and in press and radio interviews and in converstaions exactly what the position of the Irish Government is in regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; that it is in place, fully accepted, and that we are committed to implementing its provisions to secure an improvement in the situation of the people of Northern Ireland, particularly the Nationalist people.  I am aggrieved at being attacked on these lines by Deputy Dukes who on one occasion, in an interview on 25 February, told Unionists that they were neglecting one of the strongest points in the agreement and that this was not emphasised enough, that that was the self-destruct mechanism in the agreement.  Before Deputy Dukes starts to question me in my operation of the agreement, he should examine whether that is a particularly valid sort of statement to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a dishonest approach.  This Government have clearly stated time and again, and I did it again in America, our commitment to the agreement and to the working of the agreement.  A further meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference will take place very shortly and everybody agrees that the last meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference was one of the best and one of the most effective ever held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach feels so positively about the Anglo-Irish Agreement as he is indicating today, I am delighted, but why did he not express those positive views in the United States and in particular in the course of a very lengthy speech in New York on Northern Ireland and the problems relating to Northern Ireland?  There are two brief sentences only in that speech about the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Will the Taoiseach say whether in reports in various newspapers here &mdash; in particular the <i>Irish Times</i> of Saturday last in which there was the headline &ldquo;Haughey suggests federal solution to the North,&rdquo; and which went on to attribute two sets of remarks to the Taoiseach in that regard &mdash; he is entirely misquoted or incorrectly reported in this respect and if the experienced correspondent concerned dreamed up all of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the business of casting doubts on any genuine attempts by journalists to report.  They have their own job to do and it is often very difficult. I would just reiterate that at no stage in America or anywhere else have I ever advocated a federal solution for Northern Ireland.  Now that we are talking about these matters, I would like if Deputy Des O'Malley would explain to me a remark I heard him making on television when he was up there attending the Alliance conference and when he was asked by a reporter if he would agree with the suspension of the agreement to allow the Unionists to talk.  The Deputy's reply was: &ldquo;I supose it would make it easier, but I am not keen to see it.  I would hope that some formula could be arranged.&rdquo;  If ever there was ambivalence about the <Col N="1898" /> Anglo-Irish Agreement it is in those remarks.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has come before the House today and asked us to accept that his presentation of recent events in Northern Ireland, as presented in North America, was fair minded. Would the Taoiseach not accept that it is incumbent on him as head of this Government to condemn violence at every opportunity?  Why in that context was there no reference to the outrageous events in Eniskillen earlier this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the easiest thing to deal with.  On a number of occasions I made absolutely clear the position of this Government and of all constitutional parties in this House in regard to violence.  I made clear our condemnation of violence, our rejection of barbaric acts and our belief that progress can only be made through constitutional political action.  The group of people I was talking to in New York were a very <Col N="1899" /> respectable cross-section of Irish-American opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I were to urge that particular audience not to support violence or the Provisional IRA they would be insulted.  They are people who have. never had anything to do with violence.  They do not want to know violence and in no circumstances would they ever support anything connected with violence.  The people I spoke to inside the Waldorf Astoria are totally committed to supporting constitutional political action.

      <P>I want to explain to Deputy Spring that I gave a major interview to American correspondents which I thought was probably the best vehicle for getting my views across to American public opinion in general.  I went to great lengths in that interview to explain the <Col N="1900" /> position of this Government and all parties in this State in regard to the rejection of violence.  I did so also in other television and radio interviews.  Therefore, I think that is a very base, false criticism to level at me.  The people I spoke to are people who accept it as axiomatic that no Irish Government condone violence and that none of us in this House condones violence.  It would be totally counter-productive to suggest to them that there is any possibility that they might.</P>

      <P>Let me add that not one single penny has been spent in the United States on their welfare, unfortunately, but the point which I want to put to the Taoiseach is this.  In view of the Taoiseach's optimistic view of the legislation concerned which is now in the House of Representatives, has he taken into account a report which appeared in today's newspapers in which a spokesman for the State Department is quoted as saying it will not be possible under the legislation for Irish immigrants who are in the United States illegally to apply there and that it will be necessary for them to apply here in Ireland?  Does he appreciate that it will cause enormous problems for them if they have to come back here to be interviewed when perhaps they will have little chance of getting back into the United States?</P>

I have already mentioned that if the legislation goes through, which looks likely, it will be necessary for persons to apply from their own home state but I also said that in my view that would not necessarily cause difficulties for most of these young people.</P>

      <P>The consultants were commissioned to examine the major payment systems in my Department in order to establish where the systems are most at risk and to advise on the best cost-effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum.  Three reports have been submitted and these contain a large number of recommendations ranging from organisational arrangements to changes in particular controls and procedures.  These matters are being considered in detail by my Department.  In the meantime on an ongoing basis full account is taken of the recommendations of the consultants in the development of new schemes and procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as publication of the reports is concerned, I expressed reservations about this to the House on a previous occasion.  I have considered the matter further in the meantime and in view of the sensitive and confidential nature of many of the consultants' findings I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate to publish the details.  I have, however, made arrangements to have a summary <Col N="1905" /> of the reports published in booklet form and this will be made available to Members of the House as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat surprising to hear that the information is confidential and cannot be made available to Members of this House or to the general public.  We hear quite a lot about abuse.  We will know the extent of abuse, which is very prevalent, we understand, at present, from this report.  It is of vital importance that Members of this House would have all the information in this report.  I cannot understand why it is confidential and why we will only get some sort of breakdown of the report.  The report, as submitted to the Minister, should be made available to every Member of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to repeat what I said.  The matters in the report are internal security matters within the Department. The Deputy must surely recognise that, if we are to prevent fraud and abuse, we have to ensure that the systems are fraud proof and are kept as confidential as possible.  On that basis, the recommendations of the consultants deal with much of the day-to-day operations of the Department which it would not be appropriate to disclose publicly.  I take it that the Deputy and other Deputies in the House are interested in the main recommendations and the main thrust of the report.  I said I am prepared to publish a summary of the findings and I think that is very reasonable.  I will have that available fairly shortly.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the fact that certain bank branches have a policy of not cashing <Col N="1908" /> social welfare cheques when they are crossed, which leads to considerable difficulties for social welfare recipients; if he has any plans to overcome the difficulties facing social welfare recipients arising from this policy by the banks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of cheques issued by my Department are for disability benefit purposes and cheques which exceed £50 in value are crossed. While the banks have a formal policy that all crossed cheques, not just social welfare cheques, should be lodged direct to accounts, in practice banks do cash cheques for customers, including social welfare recipients, whether they are crossed or not.  Cheques are also cashed regularly by supermarkets and other retail outlets.  Where a person is known or can produce satisfactory evidence of identity there should be no great difficulty in cashing cheques.  Satisfactory evidence of identity is obviously a necessary factor to prevent fraud or abuse.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 14 April I launched new secure social welfare cheques with special high security features to prevent forgery.  These include a chainlink watermark and a scratch invisible ink security feature.  The new cheques are the first in the country to include a watermark.  We have also circulated special information stickers for cash registers for retail outlets and banks. These have been widely welcomed.</P>
      <P>The issue of the new cheques began on 15 April.  The new cheques will be of considerable help to banks and traders. However, I am in touch with the banks in connection with difficulties experienced by persons cashing social welfare cheques at certain branches.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply to the question. In the context of the contacts he has indicated he is having with the banks in relation to this problem, is it the intention of the Department to continue to use the crossing system of cheques over the sum of £50, in view of the new high security features introduced on 14 April?  Is he <Col N="1909" /> aware that at least one of the major banks uses the crossing as a reason for refusing to deal with people they know very well in the community?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the case the Deputy is referring to applies to a particular branch or maybe a limited number of branches.  It does not apply to that bank generally.  This problem has arisen in some branches and that is why I mentioned that at the end of my reply.  The £50 level is the general level used in banks, with pass cards, and so on, for security purposes.  That system operates very satisfactorily at present.  There are very few exceptions and I am following up that matter.  In addition, we are improving security for all those who deal with cheques.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to convert from paying by cheque to paying by plastic money?  Will recipients of social welfare disability benefit or other benefits who are paid by cheque be able to get their cash at pass windows and so on some time in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. The development of the systems would, in future, enable the payments to be made in a variety of ways.  Many people would have to co-operate.  Clients would have to be interested in having the payments made in that way, and that is one of the potential developments or partial developments.  For instance, some people opt to have child benefit payments made through the bank but most do not. Likewise, many people prefer to receive their unemployment benefits in cash, although some would be interested in other methods of payment.  That is an area the modernisation and computerisation of the systems will facilitate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>

Time does not allow for me to illustrate what is the practice in the banks in this regard.  Alternatively, would he be disposed to the Department waiving the crossing of cheques where specific instances are brought to his attention of difficulties in cashing cheques?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the crossing of cheques for sums above £50, the traders and the banks accept the responsibility and the Department of Social Welfare do not.  We will facilitate people any way we can.  The step we have taken recently will considerably facilitate banks and traders. If the proper means of identification are used it is hard to see how there will be any serious problem.  As regards the Deputy's questions, I am in contact with the banks about specific cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has received representations from AONTAS, the National Association for Adult Education, concerning the difficulties that many people who are in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance may have in participating in <Col N="1911" /> adult education courses and programmes; if he intends to take any measures to alleviate these difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations from AONTAS, the National Association for Adult Education on the question of participation in education courses and the effect on entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of my concern to ensure that those in receipt of unemployment payments are encouraged to engage in constructive activities and to develop skills which will also assist them in gaining employment.  I am very conscious that education plays a vital role in helping unemployed persons to improve their prospects, particularly so in the case of those who left the school system early. I am anxious to ensure that there is the greatest possible flexibility within the current legislation to allow persons who are unemployed to attend education courses while still retaining entitlement to unemployment payment.</P>
      <P>The main criteria for entitlement to receipt of unemployment payments are that the person concerned be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  The question of whether a person who participates in an educational course fulfils these conditions is a matter for decision by a deciding officer who must be satisfied that the degree of participation is not such as to remove the person from the labour market.  In general, full time attendance at a school or college of education is not regarded as being consistent with being available for work, but claimants who engage in part-time courses would normally be eligible to continue to receive their unemployment payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department recently issued guidelines on the matter to local offices for the guidance of deciding officers.  The guidelines seek to ensure that part-time education courses are not regarded as a barrier to continuing entitlement to unemployment payments.  A copy of the guidelines is now being made available <Col N="1912" /> to AONTAS and if that body have any specific cases which are causing difficulties, I will be happy to have the matter examined.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the education opportunities scheme which allows unemployed persons over 25 years, who have been unemployed for at least a year, to return to school and complete a certificate type course with a view to improving their chances of securing employment.  I have already told the House of my intention to extend this scheme nationwide and I will be announcing details shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  It is particularly pleasing to hear that AONTAS will be issued with a copy of the guidelines he has forwarded to the deciding officers.  Would he be disposed to allow Deputies have a copy of those guidelines for our own information? Has the Minister any proposals for making available to the public the guidelines which affect those genuinely seeking work?  This seems to be a major bone of contention affecting claimants, whatever their circumstances at the moment.</P>

      <P>This question is causing a great deal of confusion.  I know many boys and girls who applied for social assistance.  At the local offices they were asked if they were taking educational courses.  They said they were taking such courses in the afternoons.  They were then told they were not available for work.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the Minister appreciate that different interpretative patterns are being encountered in the <Col N="1914" /> exchanges?  Will be accept that there is a need for him to reaffirm his views?  Not seeking to anticipate everything in the regulations, I should like to ask the Minister if they include a definition of what is &ldquo;part time&rdquo;?  For example, will half-a-day be considered as &ldquo;part time&rdquo;?  Will the regulations define what is a course?  Do I understand the Minister to say that some courses may not be considered productive or assisting in developing skills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Ultimately, the decision is one for the deciding officers under the Act.  We are increasing the flexibility and in doing so we have been extending the definitions.  If the Deputy goes back a few years he will find that the definitions were much tighter.  Generally speaking they have been extended.  Short of defining each course I should like to tell the Deputy that the general intention is that people should participate in part time courses.  In most cases people attend such courses because they want to improve themselves in some way and for that reason there should be no difficulty about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme is intended to provide more flexible arrangements for unemployed people in the over 60 age group, many of who regard themselves as semi-retired and not really members of the labour force.  At present these people are required to sign on each week at their local employment office where they receive their unemployment payments.  The new scheme will relieve certain persons, who are long-term unemployed of the necessity of attending the local office while at the same time providing them with alternative arrangements for receiving their basic income maintenance payments. The scheme will be optional and in these circumstances it is not possible to predict the numbers of people who might claim. However, it is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 persons in the over 60 age group in receipt of unemployment payments for periods in excess of 12 months will avail of the option.</P>
      <P>Persons who opt for the pre-retirement allowance instead of staying within the unemployment payments system will not remain on the live register of unemployed.</P>

The Deputy's question is a meagre, miserly one which is typical of what the Progressive Democrats are coming up with at present.  The Deputy had his opportunity to say what he wished about this matter.  The people concerned are being given an opportunity under the arrangements approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We estimate that between 2,000 and 3,000 people will avail of the scheme.  I do not have the exact figures because the scheme will not come into operation for a couple <Col N="1918" /> of months.

The Deputy is aware, following our discussions on this matter in the House, that they will no longer be on the live register.  The whole purpose of this is that they should not have to go to the local exchange to sign on each week. Does the Deputy want to reverse that decision and insist on such people signing on weekly?  The Deputy cannot have it both ways and that is what he is trying to do now.  On the one hand he is trying to say that we should not insist on these people signing on weekly but at the same time he wants them counted on the live register weekly.</P>

      <P>I should say that the arrangements for social security are already in place.  There are a number of questions that would remain, not because of the establishment of the single European market, but on account of further developments that may take place, particularly in relation to equality of treatment.  For example, there are two measures in relation to equality of treatment whose provisions stipulate that women be treated no less favourably than men.  The Deputy will be aware of one, which is the equal treatment provision which was implemented during his term as Minister in the previous Government. Another is the question of equality for women in occupational pension schemes which is at present being examined by the National Pensions Board with a view to having the appropriate legislation enacted within the deadline imposed by the relevant directive.  The remaining question which arises in relation to equal treatment &mdash; and which will arise in future &mdash; is under discussion at present and has nothing to do with completion of the single European market, that is, widowers and the provision of pensions for them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the position under the recently enacted Social Welfare Act, 1988 of a number of retired supervisors and inspectors from CIE who on promotion to that rank became superannuated staff and were not eligible to make contributions to social insurance thereafter; his views on whether this category of men are at a major disadvantage compared to several other categories who with possibly as little as ten years' contributions can get a full or near full old age contributory pension; in the circumstance his views on whether the minimum average contributions requirement of 20 should be waived in this case and a <i>pro-rata</i> pension paid depending on the annual average contributions in each case made by the men between 1953 and the date of retirement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has received representations on behalf of CIE bus inspectors who from 1966 to 1970 ceased being social welfare contributors but resumed paying contributions in 1974; if CIE inspectors can opt to have the average contributions for entitlements to social welfare benefits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 16 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The persons concerned were liable for social insurance contributions at a modified rate which covered them for widow's and orphan's pension and deserted wife's benefit.  They were not covered for retirement and old age contributory pension on the grounds that they were covered under their company pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> Prior to becoming salaried staff of the company they would have been paying social insurance contributions at the standard rate and covered for the full range of social insurance benefits, but their entitlement to retirement and old age contributory pension would depend on whether they have a sufficient number of contributions at the standard rate prior to becoming salaried staff to qualify them. Representations have been made that special arrangements should be made to cover the situation of persons who do not qualify for social insurance pension in this situation.</P>
    <P>The arrangements made in section 30 of the Social Welfare Act 1988 relate to a specific group of people who were removed from social insurance cover prior to 1974 because of the operation of the remuneration limit for social insurance and who came back into insurance in April 1974 when the limit was abolished.  These arrangements do not cover the situation of persons with gaps in insurance as a result of moving from full to modified social insurance cover.  This is an inevitable feature of any system where there are different levels of cover for people in different types of employment.  The whole question of the level of pension cover under the social insurance system and the appropriate relationship with occupational pension schemes will be examined by the National Pensions Board in the context of their examination of pensions policy as a whole and the problem of &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that persons in this situation should be granted <i>pro rata</i> pensions on similar lines to people affected by the remuneration limit subject to an overall limit on the total pension payable. This was proposed, in the context of the Commission's recommendation that all employed persons, including public sector employees, should in future be fully covered for social insurance pensions. Information on the cost of applying the recommendations of the Commission in this area is not available as there are no firm figures on the numbers of people <Col N="1923" /> affected now or likely to be affected in the future.</P>
    <P>The provision made in the Social Welfare Act, 1988 for people affected by the remuneration limit will result in an additional cost of over £2 million a year in the initial years and a total cost, over a 30-year period, of some £22 million at current rates.  Some 1,250 people will benefit under the arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are dealing with a small number of semi-State employees who because they were efficient enough to be promoted to supervisory or inspectorate rank would the Minister agree they are now being deprived of the benefits of their contributions in a way that other employees of the same employer are not on account of the 1974 regulations?  Because of the small number involved and the deep injustice felt by those now on pension, would the Minister not agree that some concession should be made, by way of granting them a pension <i>pro rata</i> with their average contributions, from the time they commenced work, or from 1953, whichever is the earlier, until such time as they became superannuated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, the basic difference, in the case of the people concerned, was that they went outside the scope of the social insurance scheme whereas the &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; insurance people remained within the system though at a different level of cover.  Therefore, the people covered by the recent <i>pro rata</i> arrangements were very specific and clearcut.  I am examining this other group but they are much more difficult to define because their employment does not apply only to the occupation the Deputy has in mind.  Their extent is not clear and I am endeavouring to have it ascertained.  I might assure the Deputy that it is something I will be examining in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to how receipt of the family income supplement from my Department affects a person's eligibility for a medical card under the Health Acts. As the Deputy will be aware, entitlement to a medical card is determined on the basis of guidelines issued by the Department of Health to chief executive officers of health boards.  While circumstances arise where a family's income, inclusive of family income supplement, exceeds the medical card guidelines the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board still has discretion to issue a medical card if he considers that undue hardship exists.  This has been the position since the family income supplement scheme came into operation and I am not aware of any particular difficulties in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am of course concerned and if the Deputy takes the case of a family with one child and an income of £108 per week there will not be a problem with the FIS.  However, as additional income is added, since the rate of increase is considerable in the FIS for each child, greater than it is in the medical card, it could result in the income going above the medical card guidelines. We have had discussions with the health boards and they have said that as far as they are concerned no medical card should be lost solely because of the FIS. This is the practical position at the moment; therefore, in practical terms the FIS should not affect eligibility for a medical card as a matter of practice as distinct from theory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the plans, if any, he has to include the public service in the Social Welfare system; the categories which will be included; if they will be included as A1 contributors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the 165,000 persons in the public sector contribute to the social insurance system on a modified basis.  These contributors are insured for contributory widow's pension, contrubutory orphan's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and limited occupational injuries benefits.  Their occupational sick pay and pension arrangements reflect the fact that they are not covered for the other benefits of the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that social insurance coverage should be extended to categories previously excluded from the system.  The main gaps identified by the commission were the absence of social insurance coverage of any kind for the self-employed and the limited cover for public sector workers in modified insurance.  The Deputy, I am sure, will be aware that self-employed persons have now been brought into the social insurance system for pension purposes. The question of extending full social insurance pension coverage to all public sector employees is under consideration. This issue raises complex questions regarding the existing conditions of employment of the employees concerned and I am not in a position at this stage to say when firm proposals in this area will be brought forward.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will accredit a team of five or six community welfare officers to the Irish Embassy in London, in order to assist, under the supplementary welfare provisions, Irish citizens who have recently emigrated and <Col N="1927" /> who are in financial and social difficulties; if he has any plans to provide additional resources for Irish centres in Britain, in order to assist them in alleviating the flood of emigrants with which they have to cope; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowances under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are payable, under existing legislation, only to persons within the State.  The scheme is administered by the health boards within their own functional areas and, accordingly, emigrants cannot be assisted under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently visited the Camden Irish Centre in London to hear at first hand of the problems experienced by Irish emigrants and to establish the implications of the changes implemented earlier this month in the British social welfare code. I am concerned at the implications for young Irish emigrants arising from these changes and I shall be keeping the matter under review in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The provision of financial assistance to Irish centres in Britain is the responsibility of the Minister for Labour and this year the Government have made available £250,000 for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a great number of young Irish people who are forced to emigrate because of lack of employment here are at risk in London and elsewhere in the UK?  Is he not aware of statements made by certain churchmen in recent times?  In view of the facts and the high social risk involved because of lack of resources, will he not take exceptional measures by sending relieving officers to the embassy in London who are not geared to help to alleviate this problem at the moment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to this time the services provided at the centres and the Camden centre in London particularly are very well co-ordinated with local welfare services in the DHSS.  That has worked generally fairly well and they provide some supplementary income in exceptional <Col N="1928" /> cases.  My main concern in that respect is that with the changes in the regulations there which were introduced recently, new difficulties could arise.  In that connection we are monitoring the position and I will be reporting to the Government on my findings.</P>

      <P>That is a separate question. No doubt the Deputy will be aware of the reports of the Irish centre in London which indicate the number of people they assist.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons for bringing forward this important Bill.  Its most important objective is to help curb drink abuse, particularly so far as under-age drinking is concerned.  At the same time, to meet public demand in relation to certain aspects of the legislation, the Bill makes some adjustments in the prohibited hours and proposes that special provision be made to enable restaurants of an acceptable standard to serve a full range of alcoholic drinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing legislation on intoxicating liquor is extensive and complex.  There are about 40 separate Licensing Acts, dating back to the early part of the last century.  Of these, almost a dozen date from the foundation of the State, with important enactments in the 1920s, 1940s, and 1960s.  The last major item of <Col N="1993" /> legislation in this area was the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962.  Accordingly it is now timely to review some of the more important aspects of the legislation. Much of the legislation touches on questions that are difficult and controversial and there are understandable differences of opinion on many aspects of the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>There has been a trend in the various Acts passed since 1924 towards gradual liberalisation, to reflect social change and public demand.  The intoxicating liquor laws have a very widespread effect and for that reason there will be few people in this country who will not have an interest in the changes now proposed. These changes will, of course, affect the general public, but they will have a particular interest for the trade groups concerned. I regard it as important that the agreement of these trade groups should be secured, as far as possible, for the new proposals.  Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have met many deputations from organisations concerned with the licensed trade and before that, over a period of years, meetings took place at frequent intervals with my predecessors in office.  It cannot be expected that all the organisations concerned will be able to give unqualified support to my proposals, since the interests of these groups often conflict.  The general public interest must, of course, be paramount and I trust, accordingly, that I will receive a considerable measure of agreement from all concerned for my proposals.  These will, I believe, serve the public interest while not conflicting seriously with the legitimate commercial aspirations of any particular group.  I will certainly listen to any reasonable suggestions for amendments to my proposals but I should make it clear, at the same time, that I cannot contemplate major policy changes which would be solely for the benefit of any particular sectional interest, at the expense of the public interest or of other trade associations.</P>
    <P>The consumption of intoxicating liquor in a moderate and responsible way must continue to be accepted as a normal <Col N="1994" /> aspect of social and business life.  At the same time, the abuse of drink does have grave social and economic consequences, so that controls on its sale are essential and are a feature of legislation everywhere. Since intoxicating liquor is potentially a dangerous substance, most States have a licensing system restricting the outlets through which it may be sold.</P>
    <P>In putting forward proposals for amendment of the licensing laws, it is important to maintain a balanced approach.  The great majority of people who take a drink do so in a mature and responsible way and it is quite reasonable to liberalise the licensing laws to the extent necessary to meet their legitimate requirements.  It may be necessary, at the same time, to introduce restrictions to counter abuses where it is clearly established that these exist.  The task of the Legislature is to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws are concerned essentially with the number and nature of licensed outlets and the persons to be licensed, as well as the times at which, and the persons to whom, drink can be sold.  All of these elements are dealt with to some extent in the Bill now before us.  The licensing laws are quite wide-ranging, however, and extend to aspects which are not covered in this Bill.  When it has been dealt with, a continuing examination of the legislation will range over a wider area.  Deputies may well be wondering why this Bill is being brought forward if there is a possibility of another to follow some time later.  This is because the Bill deals with a limited number of important proposals, the need for which has been clearly established, and which merit immediate consideration and attention in advance of any other proposals that may be formulated for amending existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is divided into six Parts.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill sets out the proposed changes in non-technical language.  I will endeavour now to outline the more important provisions.  These can be teased out in more detail during the later Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill introduces a new <Col N="1995" /> concept into the intoxicating liquor laws, that is, the special restaurant licence.  The system of special restaurant licences now proposed is very similar to that already operating in Northern Ireland.  Before giving details of this system, I should like to make a few general remarks.  In the first place, since there is a natural connection between food and drink, there are many, especially among visitors from abroad, who would regard it as understandable that special provision should be made in the licensing system to enable restaurants to serve a full range of drinks. Any hotel can serve alcohol to residents and the association between eating and drinking is surely as strong as that between drinking and the provision of overnight accommodation.</P>
    <P>The background to the present licensing arrangements is, very briefly, that the Licensing Act, 1902, put a stop to the grant of additional full licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor, save for the special case of hotel licences.  Since then, anyone wishing to get a new licence to sell a full range of drink has had to extinguish at least one existing public house licence.  This includes hotels which wish to sell intoxicating liquor to the public &mdash; in such cases at least one existing intoxicating liquor licence must be extinguished.  However, there are other criteria which are often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to comply with.  It is these other criteria, which relate to the location of licences to be extinguished and increases in population in the locality, that can make it impossible for some restaurants to purchase existing licences.  It is, therefore, not correct to argue that any restaurant wishing to obtain a liquor licence under existing arrangements can do so.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill now before the House it will not be a condition for the grant of a special restaurant licence that an existing licence must be extinguished and there will be no numerical limit on the number of these licences. While the licence will allow the sale of a full range of drink for consumption on the premises, the restrictions on the grant <Col N="1996" /> and operation of the licences are such that they cannot be compared directly with full public house licences.  Thus, any restaurant wishing to get a special restaurant licence will have to meet very exacting standards which will be set out in standards regulations to be made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
    <P>As the Department of Justice are the Department primarily responsible for intoxicating liquor legislation, the consent of the Minister for Justice will be necessary for the making of these regulations. Bord Fáilte will be the inspecting authority and will decide whether or not any particular restaurant meets the required standards.  The special restaurant licence will enable the supply of intoxicating liquor only in connection with the consumption of a substantial meal, during specific periods of the day and evening, either in the waiting area of the restaurant before the meal, or with the meal and up to half an hour after it has ended.</P>
    <P>I will now look briefly at some of the specific proposals relating to special restaurant licences.  Section 2 of the Bill includes a definition of &ldquo;bar&rdquo;.  While this definition will apply throughout the Bill, its significance, so far as restaurants are concerned, is that a restaurant selling intoxicating liquor under a special restaurant licence will not be allowed to have a bar.  In other words, it will not be possible for such restaurants to have any sort of counter or barrier either in the waiting area or the dining area, or elsewhere on the premises, across which drink can be served to customers, as can be done, for example, in public houses or hotel bars.</P>
    <P>Section 7 defines &ldquo;special restaurant licence&rdquo;.  As I have indicated, this will permit the supply of a full range of intoxicating liquor on the premises to anyone who has ordered a substantial meal.  The drink can be consumed in connection with such a meal, either in the waiting area or the dining area of the restaurant, and must be paid for at the same time as the meal is paid for.</P>
    <P>Section 8 sets out the procedures to be followed where application is made for <Col N="1997" /> a licence of this kind.  In principle, the procedure will be similar to that followed in making application for new public house licences, except that in this case a Bord Fáilte certificate in respect of the restaurant must first be obtained.  Where the applicant satisfies the court that a Bord Fáilte certificate is in force, and no objection is made, the court will give the applicant a certificate which will entitle him to receive a special restaurant licence from the Revenue Commissioners on payment of the specified fee.  The normal objection procedures applicable to the grant of other intoxicating liquor licences will apply to the grant of special restaurant licences.</P>
    <P>One aspect of section 9 which I would like to mention is the fee of £3,000 for the initial grant of a special restaurant licence.  It has been suggested that this fee is excessive, though I am also aware that there are those who feel it is not large enough.  In deciding on the amount of the fee, the Government bore in mind the considerable commercial value of any licence which permits the sale of a full range of alcoholic drinks.  It was necessary, in order to help prevent a proliferation of these licences, to settle on a figure which was more than just nominal. At the same time, it was considered that the fee should be less than what is believed to be the going rate for new pub licences obtainable from the &ldquo;in pocket&rdquo; or non-trading stock of such licences.  It was borne in mind that as the applicant for a special restaurant licence will not have to extinguish any existing licence, the only requirements he must meet will be compliance with the standards set out in the regulations and payment of the initial fee.  In all the circumstances, I feel that a fee of £3,000 is right and reasonable. Since it may be necessary, in due course, to vary the amount of the fee, section 9 provides that this may be done by regulations made by the Minister for Justice.  Under section 24, any such regulations, as well as regulations under section 12 prescribing standards for the restaurants concerned, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and <Col N="1998" /> may be annulled by resolution passed by either House.</P>
    <P>I already mentioned that all the normal objection procedures will apply to the grant and renewal of special restaurant licences.  Section 10 will give the local Garda superintendent an extra ground for objection, in that he will be able to object to renewal of the licence on the ground that the premises have not been bona fide and solely used as a restaurant.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a very important section which sets out the matters which can be provided for in regulations to be made by the Minister for Tourism and Transport and which will specify the standards to be met in restaurants qualifying for the new special licences.  The objective will be to ensure that these licences will be available only to restaurants of good stanard whose primary business is the serving of meals to the public, the supply of intoxicating liquor being merely ancillary. The Minister for Tourism and Transport may wish to amend the regulations in the light of experience or to extend their scope, and accordingly he will have power to make regulations in respect of any other matter, not already mentioned in section 12, where he considers this to be necessary or desirable. The consent of the Minister for Justice will be necessary for the making of any such regulations since he is the Minister with overall responsibility for the intoxicating liquor legislation.  As well as having power to grant certificates, Bord Fáilte will be enabled to cancel the certificate in any case where a restaurant no longer complies with the standards required.  Section 13 sets out the procedure applying in such cases.</P>
    <P>The times at which restaurants holding special restaurant licences will be able to sell intoxicating liquor are set out in section 14.  On weekdays these will be from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 12.30 a.m.  The hours for Sunday and St. Patrick's Day are 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.  Those for Christmas Day will be 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  These are the times when restaurants could resonably expect <Col N="1999" /> a public demand for substantials meals. In accordance with the existing practice, the supply of alcohol will not be allowed at any time on Good Friday.  While intoxicating liquor can be supplied in premises having special restaurant licences during the times indicated in section 14, such premises will be able to stay open at any other time for normal restaurant business but the sale or consumption of alcohol will not be allowed during such other time.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the introduction of a system of special restaurant licences is fully warranted, it is important, at the same time, to ensure that they are used only for the purpose for which they are intended and are not made a basis for carrying on a pub trade.  Accordingly, I have specified a fine of £500 in section 15 for contravention of the terms of a special restaurant licence; the mandatory endorsement provisions in the intoxicating liquor laws will apply in the case of any such conviction.  I should mention that the ordinary enforcement provisions relating to licensed premises, including, for example, the power of inspection by the Garda and the prohibition of under-age drinking, as well as penalties, such as those relating to prohibited hours, will apply in relation to premises having the new licences.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that restaurants holding special restaurant licences will not be allowed to have bars. Section 16 sets out the penalties for contravention of that provision.  I would regard the carrying on of a bar trade in such a restaurant with the utmost seriousness and the penalties apart from the fines set out in section 16, include the application of the mandatory endorsement system in the case of any such offence.</P>
    <P>Special restaurant licences will not enable the sale of alcohol for consumption off the premises and it will not be possible to use them as a basis for obtaining occasional licences or special exemption orders.  Section 23 of the Bill is intended to ensure that liquor licences of other kinds, such as pub licences, <Col N="2000" /> cannot be obtained by extinguishing a special restaurant licence or licences. Restaurants which do not obtain the new special licences and which already have full liquor licences will, of course, be able to continue operating under those licences and, indeed, any restaurant owner who wishes to obtain such a licence by extinguishing the requisite number of public house licences and meeting the other criteria set out in the legislation can continue to do so as in the past.  Similarly, restaurants with wine licences will be able to operate as at present and new wine licences will be obtainable under the usual conditions.  However, where a special restaurant licence is obtained, any other liquor licences or certificates held for the same premises will cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>If I could sum up in a few words the reasoning behind the statutory provisions I have just outlined, it is that what I would describe as good quality restaurants will be facilitated in serving a full range of drinks with meals at the times of the day and evening when people would normally wish to eat in such restaurants; the restrictions on special restaurant licences to which I have referred are designed to ensure that such licences are not used as a basis for developing another type of drink business, such as a pub trade.  The new system will undoubtedly help the tourism industry.  It is to be hoped that by emphasising the connection between food and drink it will help to produce a more responsible attitude to alcohol overall.  It is my view &mdash; and I would not propose the introduction of special restaurant licences if I did not so believe &mdash; that these licences will not militate in any way against the public interest and will not unfairly affect the legitimate commercial interests of existing outlets for the sale of alcohol.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the permitted hours for the sale of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises generally. This is dealt with in Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is probably no single aspect of the liquor licensing laws which creates more interest among the public than the hours during which intoxicating liquor <Col N="2001" /> can be sold.  This is a subject on which widely diverging views are held, not merely in this country, but in other countries as well.  There are, no doubt, many people who will maintain that the permitted hours are already over-generous. Equally, there are many who believe that public houses should be allowed to open more or less whenever they want to.  I have come to the conclusion that the present permitted hours are fundamentally sound and have stood the test of time well.  However, times do change, and experience gained from the operation of the present hours for over a quarter of a century is significant.  The Government have therefore decided that changes in some aspects of the permitted hours are desirable.</P>
    <P>Since 1960 there has been a policy of basic uniformity in permitted hours.  In other words, the opening hours of all licensed premises and registered clubs have, in general, been the same.  The closing hours adopted in 1962, which are still in existence, may have been regarded as over-generous in some respects, but less than what was justified in others.  To put that more specifically, it has been suggested that there should be an even later closing time than 11.30 p.m. during the summer months in tourist areas or throughout the country generally and it has been suggested that there is possibly a case for an earlier closing time in major urban areas.  However, I am proposing that the policy of uniformity of opening hours throughout the country should be maintained and indeed extended.  I have examined exhaustively the argument that the general weekday closing time for licensed premises, especially during the summer, should be later than at present. I have also been told by some people that I should make pubs close earlier.  The view most generally expressed, however, was that the present closing times are basically acceptable.  Having fully weighed the arguments, I have come to the conclusion that the present weekday closing of 11.30 p.m. during summertime and 11.00 p.m. during the rest of the year should remain as the latest times for serving drinks but that the present ten <Col N="2002" /> minutes drinking-up time is not sufficient to allow last drinks to be consumed in an unhurried atmosphere.  Accordingly, I am proposing that weekday closing remain unchanged but that the drinking-up time should be extended from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.  This means that during summertime the latest time for serving drink will continue to be 11.30 p.m. but the premises must be cleared by 12 midnight.  During the rest of the year last drinks will still be at 11.00 p.m. and the premises must be cleared by 11.30 p.m.  As I have said, this will allow last drinks to be consumed in a leisurely manner without all the hustle and bustle associated with the present ten minutes drinking-up time.  It will give bar staff an opportunity to begin tidying up before the premises are cleared and will, I hope, go some way towards bringing a calmer and more relaxed atmosphere to drinking-up time.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should differentiate between tourist and nontourist areas so far as closing time is concerned. However, such a distinction between different parts of the country is hardly valid nowadays.  If it was, and opening hours were differentiated accordingly, we would then have the situation where licensed premises in some parts of the country were staying open later in the evening than similar premises elsewhere.  This would put licencees who were just outside the areas where later opening applied at a major commercial disadvantage.  An even greater objection to differentiated closing times would be the dangers on the road caused by people leaving licensed premises at closing time and travelling long distances by car to areas where later drinking hours applied.</P>
    <P>So far as Sunday evening is concerned, I have received a large volume of representations for some extension in the present 10 o'clock closing time.  Having considered these representations, I have come to the conclusion that such an extension is justified and I am proposing accordingly that general Sunday closing should be at 11 p.m.  The reaction I have received to this proposal indicates that it will be generally acceptable.  Under my <Col N="2003" /> proposal, licensed premises generally, as well as clubs, will close for the supply of drinks at 11.00 p.m. on Sundays.  With 30 minutes drinking-up time, this means that premises will have to be cleared by 11.30 p.m. on Sundays.  This is the same as the proposed closing and drinking-up times for weekdays during the winter months.</P>
    <P>One of the main effects of these relatively minor changes in permitted hours will be that people will be able to drink in a more relaxed manner at closing times.  I do not believe that these changes will give rise to any significant increase in the total consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill, which inserts a new section 2 in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, contains the main provisions regarding prohibited hours in licensed premises and section 26 has corresponding provisions for registered clubs.  Section 25 also increases the fine for prohibited hours offences by licensees to a maximum of £400 for a first offence and a maximum of £800 for a second or subsequent offence.  The present maximum fines of £20 and £40 were fixed in 1927 &mdash; that is, over 60 years ago &mdash; and are clearly outdated now in view of the fall in money values.  An important point to remember is that up to 1986 endorsement of the licence was mandatory where a licensee was convicted of a prohibited hours offence, the licence being forfeited where there are three live endorsements.  Since 1986, however, endorsement in such cases is at the discretion of the court.</P>
    <P>In view of the provision for forfeiture, endorsement of the licence is regarded as a more severe penalty than any fine.  It is relevant to note that the Bill proposes that the permitted hours for the sale of drink should be liberalised to some extent.  The system of prohibited hours remains a very important control, however, and I am determined that the provisions in this respect will be strictly enforced.  Taking all these factors into <Col N="2004" /> consideration, I am satisfied that a substantial increase in the fines for prohibited hours offences, as now proposed in the Bill, is fully justified.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a word about the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  This refers, of course, to the mandatory closing of licensed premises and clubs in Dublin and Cork between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on weekdays.  Afternoon closing of licensed premises was introduced in Britain during the First World War and its adoption in certain areas here was recommended by an Intoxicating Liquor Commission in 1925.  The &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; system was adopted because it was thought to be necessary in order to prevent continuous drinking throughout the day.  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927 it was originally applied to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. It was not applied elsewhere because it appeared that about 80 per cent or more of the public houses outside those cities where mixed businesses and it would have been unfair if the proprietors of those mixed businesses had to forego the sale of goods such as groceries or hardware while their competitors in those lines of business remained open.</P>
    <P>In 1962 the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; was abolished in Waterford and Limerick, again because of the number of mixed businesses in those areas, leaving Dublin and Cork as the only areas where it remained. I now propose to abolish it in these remaining areas, not only as an opportunity to extend the policy of uniformity in the permitted hours, but because I believe the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; has outlived its usefulness and is no longer desirable, especially in view of the increasing tendency to take midday meals in licensed premises.  Indeed, it probably has an adverse effect on tourism and on business generally in Dublin and Cork and I have had representations both from the vintners' interests in those cities and from the Dublin City Centre Business Association requesting that the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; be abolished. Deputies may note that there is no reference to the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in the Bill. <Col N="2005" /> Its abolition is effected by omitting reference to it in the new provisions inserted by sections 25 and 26.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards Part III of the Bill, I come to a subject which has given rise to considerable difficulty.  I refer to the question of special exemption orders. Provision for such exemptions was first introduced in 1927, in the Intoxicating Liquor Act of that year, enabling the District Court to grant special exemptions from the ordinary permitted hours in respect of special occasions in licensed hotels and restaurants.  There has been a considerable increase in the number of such special exemptions in recent years and there have been complaints that they are now a source of abuse.  In view of this, I have considered whether restrictions on the grant of such exemptions would be justified in the public interest.  I have had to bear in mind, in this connection, representations which I have received, particularly from licensed hotels, that the late evening drinking allowed under special exemptions now meets an established demand, especially in rural areas, and that many hotels have come to rely on the income from these occasions for their economic survival and the continued employment of staff.  I have, nevertheless, decided that some restrictions are warranted and I will now outline these.</P>
    <P>Most of the special exemptions are granted in respect of dances at which substantial meals are required to be served.  In the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, the definition of &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo; includes a provision that the meal must be of a kind for which it would be reasonable to charge a sum not less than an amount to be prescribed by the Minister for Justice.  This minimum figure was last prescribed in 1979, when it was put at £2. I am satisfied that this amount should now be substantially increased, not merely because of the fall in money value in the interval but also as a measure to ensure that the meals served on these occasions are substantial, as the law intended.  This has implications for other <Col N="2006" /> aspects of the intoxicating liquor legislation. As I have indicated in relation to Part II of the Bill, the intention is that drink may be served in restaurants qualifying for the new special restaurant licences only in connection with the supply and consumption of substantial meals.  In this context, as well as in connection with special exemption orders, an appropriate minimum price for a substantial meal would be £5.  Under the 1962 Intoxicating Liquor Act a variation in the indicative price for a substantial meal can be affected by ministerial order and, accordingly, this requires no provision in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I would next like to mention weekend special exemptions.  As I have indicated, the grant of special exemption orders is a matter for the District Court and such orders tend to be given mainly in respect of weekend nights.  The law provides that special exemptions may not be given in respect of any period on a Sunday but this has been interpreted as allowing them to commence at 12 midnight on Sunday. The special exemptions for Monday mornings are of particular concern since, for most of the population of this country, Monday is the first working day of the week.  It is a matter for the court to decide the time in respect of which any special exemption would be granted.  I am satisfied that some restriction on Monday morning exemptions is justified and seciton 29 of the Bill accordingly provides that they may not be granted for any time after 1.30 a.m. on Monday.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to special exemptions, I am proposing that persons under 18 will not be allowed to be present in the licensed premises concerned while they are in operation and section 35 of the Bill contains a provision to that effect.</P>
    <P>I come now to the part of the Bill which arguably will have the greatest social impact &mdash; that is Part IV, which contains provisions aimed at curbing under-age drinking.  Before outlining my proposals, I would like to strike a note of caution as to the role of legislation in this area.  I agree with those who say that under-age drinking is a major problem which needs to be dealt with urgently.  The passage of <Col N="2007" /> time has shown up some inadequacies in the licensing laws and I intend to remedy the situation in that respect.  However, the introduction of new intoxicating liquor legislation must be regarded as only one of the instruments to be used in tackling this abuse.  It will not solve the problem on its own.  I do not intend to speak in detail about the other measures that can be used, but I would stress the importance of parental example and a good home environment, of education in the dangers of drinking alcohol and also of social outlets where alcohol is not consumed.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to commend Deputy Sean Barrett for his Private Members' Bill on under-age drinking, which has already been discussed in the House.  To an extent, that discussion could be regarded as paralleling the Second Stage debate for Part IV of this Bill but I intend, nevertheless, to outline briefly the main provisions of my proposals, notwithstanding the similarity between them and those already debated.  These proposals relate to the presence of under-age persons on licensed premises, the supply of drink to them and the consumption of intoxicating liquor by them.</P>
    <P>One change which has been repeatedly requested by those concerned about the problem of under-age drinking is the removal of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from sections 10 and 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act, 1924, since the inclusion of this word makes it very difficult to prosecute successfully in cases covered by the sections.  Those sections, which are repealed by section 4 of the Bill, made it an offence for any licence holder to knowingly supply alcohol to a person under the age of 18 years for consumption by that person either on or off the premises.</P>
    <P>New provisions aimed at prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons are now contained in section 31 of the Bill.  This important section makes it an offence for any licence holder to sell or deliver intoxicating liquor, either directly or indirectiy, to anyone <Col N="2008" /> under the age of 18 years; to permit a person under the age to consume intoxicating liquor on his licensed premises or to permit anyone to supply a person under the age of 18 years with intoxicating liquor on his premises.  The penalties for contravention of these provisions include the endorsement of the licence on conviction.  It has been pointed out that it can sometimes be difficult for a licence holder to judge whether a particular person is under or over 18 years of age.  As a balance to the provisions which I have just outlined, I have accordingly provided that it will be a defence for the licence holder, in any court proceedings, to prove that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person in respect of whom he is alleged to have committed the offence was over 18.</P>
    <P>Whereas section 31 creates offences for the licence holder, section 32 makes it an offence for any person to purchase intoxicating liquor for, or deliver intoxicating liquor to, any person who is under 18 years of age or to send a person under the age of 18 to obtain alcohol.  Under section 33, it is made an offence for the first time for a person under 18 to purchase alcohol or to consume it in any place other than a private residence, or to represent himself as being over the age of 18 years for the purpose of obtaining alcohol.</P>
    <P>I come next to the question of the presence of under-age persons in licensed premises.  It is an offence for a licence holder to allow anyone under the age of 15 years to be in the bar of his licensed premises.  There are certain exceptions to this &mdash; for example, where the person aged under 15 is resident on the premises.  This is a provision which, I am satisfied, should be changed.  There are circumstances where the provision may appear to be unreasonable and to that extent difficult to enforce.  Thus, for example, it may be convenient, or even necessary, for a parent with young children to remain for some time in a licensed premises, especially in the country, while waiting to catch a bus or to keep a medical or dental appointment.  There are other <Col N="2009" /> occasions, such as during family holidays, where it will be reasonable to allow children in licensed premises when accompanied by their parents.  After careful study, I have come to the conclusion that it is unreasonable to place a blanket ban on the presence of children in licensed premises.  I am proposing, accordingly, that children should be allowed in bars at any time during permitted hours if they are accompanied by their parents or guardians.  Section 34 of the Bill sets out my proposals in this respect.  In doing this, I have had to balance carefully the dangers of introducing children to a pub atmosphere at an early age against the reality that in some cases parents will have no practical alternative to bringing their children with them, for limited periods, into pubs.  Deputies will notice that I have set out penalties, both for the holder of the licence and for the parent or guardian, where a child is found in the bar of a licensed premises in contravention of the section.</P>
    <P>There have been frequent complaints about drinking by under-age persons at late-night functions.  Section 35 of the Bill seeks to correct this abuse by making it an offence, both for the licence-holder and the under-age person, where anyone under the age of 18 is on licensed premises while an exemption order is in operation. I have already referred to this proposal in my comments on special exemptions.</P>
    <P>Section 36 restricts the presence of persons under the age of 18 in off-licensed premises which are structurally separate. Under this section, persons under that age will be allowed on such premises only when they are accompanied by a parent or guardian, or where their employment in the premises is not prohibited.  It would, I submit, be unreasonable to impose a total ban on persons under the age of 18 from entering off-licensed premises.  If that was the case, children &mdash; and even babies in prams &mdash; could not accompany their parents into the licensed section of supermarkets.  I should mention, in this connection, that the provision whereby a person over the age of 15 years could purchase intoxicating liquor from <Col N="2010" /> an off-licence, where the liquor was in a closed vessel containing not less than one pint, will no longer apply &mdash; this will be the effect of section 4 of the Bill, which repeals section 11 of the 1924 Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act.  Deputies will notice a series of penalties for contraventions of section 36, both for persons under the age of 18 who contravene that provision and for licence-holders who allow unaccompanied persons under the age of 18 to be in their structurally separate off-licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Bill provides a very useful weapon in the fight against under-age drinking.  It gives the Garda powers to remove containers of alcohol from any person who is in a public place, and who appears to be under the age of 18, where the Garda suspects, with reasonable cause, that an under-age drinking offence is being or has been committed.  This will give the Garda powers in relation to occasions such as so-called cider parties which are not only detrimental to the young people involved but are a source of nuisance to people living nearby.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to under-age drinking, I would like to say a word about section 38.  This section deals with the employment of persons under the age of 18 in licensed premises.  The present law in this respect is contained in section 12 of the 1924 General Act, a section which is now being repealed.  Under that provision, no female under the age of 18 and no male under the age of 16, apart from specified relatives of the licence-holder, could be employed in a licensed premises. Section 38 now gives a common minimum age-limit of 18 years for males and females, with a minimum age-limit of 16 for specified relatives.  It is usual for young persons to commence their apprenticeship in the bar trade at 16 years of age and section 38 allows this to continue.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to mention a subject which was raised on a number of occasions during the debate on Deputy Barrett's Bill &mdash; that is, the question of providing for an official system of age cards to help curb under-age drinking.  I would like to make a few comments on <Col N="2011" /> this suggestion.  I would point out, first of all, that unofficial systems of this kind have already been tried in particular localities, with varying degrees of success. When people speak of the adoption of an official system, I presume they have in mind the establishment of a countrywide system operated through a body such as the Garda Síochána, with penalties for the abuse of such cards and statutory backing for their use, such as a provision that licensees and the courts would have to accept them as evidence of the age of the party presenting them.</P>
    <P>While the age of 15 is also significant in relation to presence on licensed premises, we are here speaking of cards which would show that the bearer is aged 18 or over.  In my view, any such system would have to be voluntary &mdash; there could be no question of compelling all persons who wish to patronise licensed premises and who are aged between 18 years and, say, 21 to have such cards with them.  Many such persons will be merely taking a cup of coffee or a snack and will not wish to drink intoxicating liquor.  Another basic point is that the initial discretion as to whether to look for the card in a particular case would have to be with the licensee.  To put it at an extreme, there will be very young children who will obviously be under 18 and middle-aged and elderly people who will obviously be over that age.</P>
    <P>Any system of the kind in question would have to be aimed at the marginal cases, that is, cases where an observer might be in doubt as to whether the person in question was under or over 18.  In practical terms, it is the licensee concerned who must make the initial judgment in such cases, so that there could be no general compulsion on licensees to look for age-cards.  Of course there will be nothing either in the existing law, or in the Bill provisions, to prevent a licensee refusing to supply drink or refusing admission to a structurally separate off-licence or to a late night extension, where he thinks the person concerned might be under 18.  Deputies will note from Part IV of the Bill that in <Col N="2012" /> all relevant cases it will be a defence for the licensee to prove that he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned was over 18.  The provisions of the Bill are such that there will now be a strong incentive on licensees to look for evidence of age in doubtful cases and for young persons age just over 18 to supply themselves with such evidence.  In the case of a prosecution, it would be matter for the court to decide what constituted reasonable grounds so far as the licensee is concerned, but doubtless they would include production of any document which showed that the person concerned was over 18.  Reasonable grounds in this context might also include an assurance from a mature person known to the licensee that the young person concerned was aged over 18.  Of course a countrywide system of age-cards organised through a body such as the Garda Síochána could provide such evidence but such a system could well prove expensive to install and operate.  It is possible that the expense in question could be offset by making a charge for the issue of the card but there would be many young men and women of 19 or 20 years of age who would not be prepared to pay such a charge, since their ages could be readily established by other means or they might feel that it was clear from their appearance that they were over 18.  In this connection, it is relevant to remark that the expense of establishing an official, countrywide age-card system would only be justified if there was a large-scale take-up of the cards by people in the age-group at which they were aimed.</P>
    <P>There are other points to be borne in mind.  Persons who had obtained age-cards might well find that they did not have the card with them when they wished to purchase or consume intoxicating liquor and in such cases, alternative evidence of age would have to be acceptable.  Age-cards could of course be abused either by counterfeiting them to help get drink directly for under-age persons or to help older teenagers of 18 or 19 in getting drink from off-licensees for their under-age companions.  I would <Col N="2013" /> point out that although under the existing law a licensee can be convicted if he knowingly supplied drink to an under-age person, the under-age person who purchases and consumes the drink cannot himself be prosecuted.  Under the Bill, however, whereas the licensee will have a defence if he had reasonable grounds for believing that the person concerned was over 18, the under-age person who purchases and consumes the drink can himself be prosecuted under section 33. This should prove of considerable assistance to those many licensees who might be genuinely concerned about difficulties which the provisions of Part IV of the Bill would present for them.  In view of all these considerations it was decided not to make provision in the Bill for the establishment of a countrywide system of age cards for the purposes of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  I should mention, in this connection, that the desirability of introducing a system of age cards in the context of the liquor licensing laws has been considered, and rejected, by official committees in Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that careful consideration has been given to the question of introducing a system of age of majority cards in relation to the purchase and consumption of intoxicating liquor.  My own view is that the case for such a system has not been clearly established and that it would be best to see how the new provisions in Part IV of the Bill work in practice before deciding whether the introduction of such a system is warranted. However, in view of the interest already expressed in this subject in the context of Deputy Barrett's Bill, Deputies will doubtless wish to give their own views on the question.  Finally, I should mention that the question of introducing a general system of identity cards was referred to during the debate on Deputy Barrett's Bill.  This, of course, raises issues going far outside the ambit of the intoxicating liquor legislation and would not be appropriate for discussion in this context.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn next to Part V of the Bill which proposes a number of <Col N="2014" /> changes in relation to registered clubs.  In principle such clubs are private establishments where members enjoy a common interest and where the law allows intoxicating liquor to be supplied to the members themselves and their guests.  I have, however, received complaints that in many such clubs the law regarding the supply of intoxicating liquor is not being observed, so that in effect a public house trade is being carried on and that some clubs, at least, are tending to become merely drinking clubs, contrary to the intention of the Registration of Clubs Act.  Part V contains provisions to help remedy any abuses that exist.</P>
    <P>Section 40 will make it clear that the club rules must forbid the supply of drink to persons aged under 18.  Section 41 of the Bill will allow clubs to be inspected on the same basis as licensed premises. At present a club can only be inspected by the Garda Síochána on an order from a member of the Force of at least inspector rank.  This amendment will allow for easier and more rapid detections of breaches of the law in registered clubs. Section 42 will allow objection to be made to renewal of club certificates by persons living outside the parish where the club premises is situated.  At present only persons living within the parish can so object. I am told that publicans and others living close to club premises do not like to object to renewal of certificates because of the hostility they might incur and, in the case of publicans, that this could be commercially damaging.  Section 42 will bring clubs into line with licensed premises generally so far as objection to certificates is concerned.  Finally, section 44, with the Schedule to the Bill, will provide increased penalties for a range of offences relating to registered clubs.</P>
    <P>In Part VI of the Bill I am taking the opportunity to increase a number of penalties under the licensing Acts and the Registration of Clubs Acts, where the level of fines has fallen out of line with current monetary values.  These new increased penalties are provided for in section 44 and the Schedule and individually call for no comment from me at <Col N="2015" /> this stage.  Many of the fines have been on the Statute Book since the last century and the large percentage increases are justified on that ground alone.</P>
    <P>One particular penalty in the Schedule which I should mention is that provided in section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, for the offence for being &ldquo;found-on&rdquo;.  The present minimum penalty for being &ldquo;found-on&rdquo; is £1 and the maximum £5.  I propose to increase these amounts to £25 and £50 respectively.  This will give a much greater incentive to customers to leave licensed premises voluntarily by the end of drinking-up time and should help licensees in clearing their premises at closing time.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset of my speech that this Bill was concerned with some of the main principles underlying the licensing laws.  These include the kinds and number of licences, the permitted hours and the age at which persons can buy or consume alcohol.  However, this measure is not a comprehensive Intoxicating Liquor Bill, since it does not cover anything like the entire field of the licensing laws.  A further examination of the liquor laws may identify the need for further changes and, if so, a second Bill can be brought before the Dáil.  I cannot say as yet what matters might be covered in a second Bill but some areas which may need to be thoroughly examined are the questions of late night drinking and sales from offlicences. It would not be unusual for two Liquor Bills to follow in quick succession. This happened in 1924 and 1927 and again in 1960 and 1962.  Not only could areas of the law not covered in this Bill be tackled in a second Bill but, if experience shows that any provisions of this Bill need amendment, this could be quickly remedied.</P>
    <P>I am expecting a very wide-ranging debate on this Bill and many Deputies will probably have their own particular suggestions as to what the Bill should cover.  I will be very glad to consider all proposals which are put forward during the debate.  Where the subject matter of such proposals is not appropriate for inclusion in the Bill now before the <Col N="2016" /> House, they can be considered in the context of a possible second Bill. However, I consider it important to proceed now with all possible haste on the matters covered by the present Bill and I would point out that any major changes to the Bill outside those areas could cause major delays as the Bill proceeds through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Bill now before the House dealing with the granting of special restaurant licences to bona fide restaurants, amending the law relating to the opening and closing hours of licensed premises and tackling the problem of under-age drinking is essentially the same Bill as that produced by Fine Gael in Government in December 1986.  Unfortunately, that Government did not get the opportunity to put that legislation on the Statute Book due to the general election held in early 1987.  It is fair to ask the Government why it has taken so long to reproduce this legislation.  After all it is over 13 months since they took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the Bill dealing with the problem of under-age drinking is practically word for word the same as the section in the Private Members' Bill which I introduced on behalf of the Fine Gael Party in March of this year and which completed Second Stage on Wednesday last.  It proves we have a very long way to go in this House to update our procedures and change attitudes towards the introduction of Private Members' Bills by Members on the Opposition benches.  My Private Members' Bill <Col N="2017" /> should now be well on the way to becoming law.  Instead we have to debate the same issue all over again simply because the Government feel that they and they alone should be permitted to introduce legislative change in this area.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of weeks and, indeed, months the problems of alcoholism have been given a lot of coverage on radio and television and in the press. Many startling facts have been revealed, particularly in relation to under-age drinking.  Having identified the problems, it is important that we do something about them.  Changing the law is important but it is not the solution to our problems. There is an obligation on all of us to support in a practical way those bodies which are engaged in trying to solve the problems.  One such body, with which I came into contact recently, is the Irish National Council on Alcohol which is presently struggling to stay in existence because of the lack of finance.  In that regard I would like to mention that the grant which the Irish National Council on Alcohol received from the health boards this year was £42,000.  Having paid salaries, PRSI, postage, telephone bills and other costs there is absolutely nothing left for the development of programmes.  If we are serious about dealing with alcohol abuse, surely the minimum we should do is to fund to a reasonable extent such important bodies as the Irish National Council on Alcohol.  I am sure there are many other bodies in a similar position needing support.  It is also important that research bodies and agencies be funded so that they can keep us informed of the situation on the ground and it is important having been informed that the urgent and necessary steps be taken to amend our laws on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the problem itself is vitally important but we must also take steps to prevent the problem occurring in the first place.  There appears to be a lack of proper education programmes available for our schools, parent and youth groups etc.  Information should be available in the workplace for staff and anywhere it is possible to communicate with groups of people, information on the dangers of <Col N="2018" /> the abuse of alcohol should be available. The success of the non-smoking campaign is an example of what can be achieved as a result of a properly thought out campaign.  I am not suggesting for one moment that we should launch a non-drinking campaign but a campaign to educate people in the proper use of alcohol.  The difference between drinking for enjoyment and drinking to get drunk should be pressed home to all of us on a continuous basis.  The savings for the State as a result of a proper campaign being pursued are there for all to see.  It is better to pay now for the provision of good education programmes than to spend ten times as much in trying to cure the problem later.</P>
    <P>The need to invest in facilities for young people is also essential.  The reality that young people are attracted to the atmosphere in pubs must be understood and if we want to keep young people out of them, we must be realistic in providing the facilities to compete.  We are fortunate in having many committed people involved in sporting and youth clubs but they can do only so much.  They need financial assistance in order to provide the sort of facilities which will attract young people to their premises.  We have no excuse for not helping them.  After all, was this not the main reason for setting up the national lottery?  The use of existing facilities in our schools and other public buildings must also be liberalised to the extent where they are freely available, properly staffed, outside normal hours. Locking up facilities which were put there as a result of State investment after, say, normal school hours is no longer acceptable. Attitudes must change and change will have to be imposed if it is not forthcoming voluntarily.</P>
    <P>The licensing laws as they stand at present are confusing to many people and are obviously in need of change to meet the needs of today, particularly in relation to the tourism industry.  Many tourists find it strange that they cannot obtain an alcoholic drink other than wine with a meal in a bona fide restaurant.  I am pleased, therefore, that this Bill will do something to remedy this situation. <Col N="2019" /> Changing the licensing laws is not an easy task because of the many inequities contained in our existing laws and because many aspects of the existing laws are not being enforced.  The public find it confusing that you can leave a pub after official closing time and go down the street to a club, hotel disco or restaurant and drink for another couple of hours. How is it, they ask, that alcohol can be served after hours in one place and not in another?  Admittedly, this alcohol is often sold contrary to what the law permits but, equally, because of some provisions in our laws it can be sold within the law as well.</P>
    <P>Those engaged in the licensed trade feel also that there is a certain amount of unfairness in the way some people can trade for certain hours while others are restricted, often, they feel, unjustly.  It is important, therefore, that whatever changes we make now will be seen as far as possible to those in the licensed trade to be equitable and to those outside to make sense and to be capable of being enforced.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to deal with the various sections contained in this Bill, I would ask the Minister if he has any proposals to allow for the issue of a limited number of exemptions for ballrooms. Over the past number of years discos appear to have taken over from the traditional type of ballroom.  I am told that ballrooms which, after all, are capable of providing a good deal of employment, be it through the staff engaged in the actual running of the ballroom or the bands engaged for the evening, find it extremely difficult to compete with discos.  I regret the demise of the traditional type of ballroom which for many years provided a very important amenity, particularly in rural Ireland.  I do not think anybody would like to see this trend continue and I would ask the Minister to give this matter serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main sections of this Bill.  The campaign which started some years ago to allow restaurants to sell a full range of alcoholic drinks with a meal appeared, and still appears, to be <Col N="2020" /> reasonable.  The problem, however, is to define clearly what is a restaurant and what constitutes a substantial meal.  I realise it is not the intention to allow café-type premises which serve snacks to apply for and obtain a licence to serve alcohol.  The problem with any legislation is that unless extreme care is taken when drafting it, loopholes will be found later and you end up with a situation where what was intended to be one thing turns out to be something completely different. I suggest, therefore, that before this section of the Bill comes into operation, the Dáil should approve the regulations which are to be drafted by the Minister for Tourism and Transport and that those regulations should set out clearly the conditions that must be met by those applying for a special restaurant licence. The Bill should not allow for the issue of a Bord Fáilte certificate until the Minister for Tourism and Transport has made regulations prescribing the standards to be complied with in restaurants.  I would ask the Minister to confirm that it will be necessary for each restaurant to be inspected annually before a Bord Fáilte certificate for renewal of the licence will be issued.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill sets out the procedure to be followed by a person applying for a special restaurant licence.  On receipt of a certificate from the Circuit Court, the applicant applies to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence and pays a fee of £3,000.  Is this a once-off payment or is there a charge for the annual renewal?  It is not clear from this section whether it is necessary to insert a notice in a daily newspaper as to the applicant's intention to seek a licence, or is it the intention that the only requirement is a formal application to the court? In relation to the renewal of a special restaurant licence, it would appear from the Bill that the only person entitled to object to the renewal of the licence is the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the Garda district in which the restaurant is situated.  Surely the same conditions should apply to the renewal of a special restaurant licence as apply to <Col N="2021" /> other liquor licences.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this matter when replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>The hours during which alcohol may be supplied on premises having special restaurant licences &mdash; week days from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 12.30 a.m. and on Sundays from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. &mdash; appear to be reasonable, bearing in mind that the intention is to allow restaurants to sell alcoholic drink during their normal trading periods.  I find it difficult, however, to understand why we should insist on 11 p.m. closing on St. Patrick's Day, bearing in mind the day that is in it.  It seems extraordinary that in this country we are restricted in opening and closing hours on St. Patrick's Day while in every other country in the world where there are Irish present they seem to celebrate well into the early hours of the morning.  It does not make sense that we should select St. Patrick's Day for special licensing hours.</P>
    <P>I note that there is a provision in the Bill which requires that no drink be consumed 30 minutes after the completion of a meal.  I cannot see how this provision can be enforced unless somebody is present to check when each meal is finished. The other points I have to make in relation to this section of the Bill are more appropriate to Committee Stage and I will make these points when we reach that stage.</P>
    <P>I feel a fair attempt has been made to provide a service to the public through the issuing of special restaurant licences. As previously stated, we want to see bona fide restaurants being allowed legally to serve alcohol to their customers.  It is not, nor should it be, the intention to provide a second string of pubs in the country.  It is better that we encourage the eating of food by those taking alcohol, and that in itself is a step towards a more responsible attitude to drink.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill which deals with the opening and closing hours of licensed premises is essentially the same as a similar part of the 1986 Bill produced by us in Government.  The main differences are that summertime closing remains at <Col N="2022" /> 11.30 p.m. instead of 12 midnight, and &ldquo;drinking-up time&rdquo; has been extended from ten minutes to 30 minutes.  The Bill provides for 11 p.m. closing on Sundays throughout the year and also extends the new hours for opening and closing to registered clubs, hotels and licensed restaurants.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill also provides for the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork. While this will be welcomed by many people for the simple reason that it previously applied only in parts of Dublin and Cork, and was very difficult to enforce mainly because it is difficult to clear the premises &mdash; on a personal note I was one of the people who always felt that the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; was a ridiculous imposition &mdash; I have some reservations about this move.  Having listened to many people and read many articles on alcohol abuse over the past number of weeks I can appreciate the fears expressed by some people that without a break in the hours during which drink is served during the day, we could be putting some people at risk of continuous drinking, thus leading to a greater risk of alcohol abuse. While I appreciate that this may affect only a small minority of the drinking public, I feel at the same time that we should give this matter further consideration before taking this step.</P>
    <P>The alternative to abolishing the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; would be to prohibit the sale of alcohol between 2.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. on a countrywide basis &mdash; this in effect would mean the non-availability of alcohol between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. allowing for the &ldquo;drinking-up&rdquo; period of 30 minutes. I make that point in all sincerity.  I have given it a lot of thought.  While I am not definite in my views &mdash; I could be persuaded otherwise &mdash; I think it is worth making the point that there are a considerable number of people who are concerned that without a break during the day &mdash; and it is not for me to specify areas &mdash; people who are unfortunately unemployed and have social problems including alcohol problems, can find it very easy to stay on premises if they are <Col N="2023" /> not asked to leave for a limited period. The consequential effects on the family home and the amount of money available for essentials can be serious.  Therefore, this matter should be considered in greater detail before we take the final step.</P>
    <P>Since 1927 the fines for prohibited offences for licensees have been a maximum of £20 for a first offence and a maximum of £40 for a second or subsequent offence.  This Bill proposes to increase these fines to a maximum of £400 and £800, respectively.  The problem as I see it with setting a fixed sum as a maximum fine is that it does not take into account the turnover of one premises against another and, while £400 could be a severe penalty for a small premises, it might be only a drop in the ocean in another instance.  While I appreciate that it will be up to the court to use its discretion when dealing with individual cases, it might be worth considering ways of punishing offenders other than the imposition of fixed amounts.</P>
    <P>Like many other Deputies I have received complaints about the activities of some clubs which are ignoring the law as it stands at present and engaging in business not covered by their licences.  I would ask the Minister to state in his reply if he has any proposals to see to it that the law is enforced and that those small number of clubs which are behaving in such a manner will be prevented from doing so in the future.  Has the Minister any proposals to increase the number of members required before a club can seek to be registered for licensing purposes?  I understand at present 25 members are needed and that figure was set some time ago.  Perhaps we should consider increasing that number at this stage.  It is my intention to raise a number of other points on Committee Stage but, in the meantime, I invite the Minister and the House to consider the points I have raised under this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the problem of under-age drinking.  This particular subject got a very good airing in this Chamber over the past weeks as a <Col N="2024" /> result of the Private Members' Bill which I introduced on behalf of Fine Gael.  The provisions contained in Part IV of this Bill are practically word for word the same as those contained in my Bill, with a few exceptions.  I propose to deal with those differences later.</P>
    <P>It was very pleasing for me to see the level of agreement on all sides of the House during the debate on the problem of under-age drinking.  It is quite clear that those of us who spoke accepted that legislative change can only do so much to deal with this problem and that parents, schools and other influential groups in society have a major role to play in dealing with it.  It is important to stress that the proposed changes in this area relate to the sale and consumption of alcohol on licensed premises and in public places.</P>
    <P>The Bill in no way interferes with what goes on in the home and in that regard I think it is important to mention that teaching young people to respect drink is just as important as making it difficult for them to obtain it.  There is an enormous difference between drinking and drinking to get drunk and learning this lesson at a young age will prevent many problems later on in life.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in this section of the Bill are reasonable and indeed necessary.  They are necessary, not because those involved in the liquor trade are irresponsible in the way they sell alcohol to young people, but because the law as it stands at present is in some respects out of date and incapable of dealing with some of today's problems.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of publicans, off-licence holders, hotel or restaurant owners, I am sure, are as much concerned about the problems of under-age drinking as I am and, indeed, welcome some change in this area.  I am sure they are equally concerned that the proposed changes might cause them difficulties in the daily running of their businesses, particularly the removal of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from the legislation. However, I am sure the House will agree that as long as the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; remains, it is impossible to enforce the legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2025" /> There is another alternative, however, and that is the introduction of identity cards.  It would appear from the debate over the past few weeks that there is considerable all-party agreement on this issue and I would urge the continuation of a constructive debate and examination of this subject.  If identity cards were introduced it would certainly be far more convenient for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides of the House are well aware of the problems caused by the so-called &ldquo;drink parties&rdquo; often held in public places.  The public suffer considerably from the results of these parties through acts of vandalism, joy-riding episodes, etc.  The need for legislative change to make it more difficult for under-age people to purchase alcohol from whatever source is quite obvious as, indeed, is the need to increase the penalties for those who break the law. On the same subject, may I say that the new powers proposed for the gardaí to confiscate bottles or containers suspected of containing alcohol from under-age persons are also very necessary and welcome? This new measure should help in dealing with the problems associated with &ldquo;drink parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Bill differs from mine in that it will not be an offence for children under 15 years of age to be on licensed premises, accompanied by their parents or guardians, during opening hours.  I had proposed that children could not be on licensed premises after 8 p.m., and I must say I thought that was reasonable.  I am not at all sure that it is a good idea to allow children in pubs or other licensed premises during opening hours without restrictions on time.  While the majority of parents will probably behave in a reasonable way, there are dangers that some might not.  I do not think it helps children if they are left in pubs for hours &mdash; I do not need to expand on the theme of good example as I am sure most Deputies will realise what I am trying to get across.</P>
    <P>Another area where both Bills differ is in relation to the employment of persons under 18 years in licensed premises.  I have to admit that the change proposed <Col N="2026" /> by the Minister is reasonable in that it allows for bar apprentices over 16 years to be employed.  I think we could go a bit further and allow persons other than bar apprentices over 16 years to be employed.  Many young people do casual work and the money earned often goes to help in the running of a home.  I was seriously considering recommending to my party that we should amend the provision in my Bill to allow persons over 16 years to be employed and I would ask the Minister to give this matter further consideration before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Part V dealing with registered clubs is broadly along the lines I had proposed. It is reasonable to insist that the rules of registered clubs should forbid the supply of alcohol to persons under 18 years and that persons under 18 years should not be admitted as members unless the club in question is one devoted to sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Other points I have to make on this Bill can wait until we are discussing Committee Stage.  My party will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage and will be considering introducing some amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Bill promised by the Minister some weeks ago has been introduced so speedily.  I agree when he says this is an issue that has been demanding attention for a long time and is one on which the House should move fast and without any undue delay.  I would like to aid him in this exercise.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with a subject on which legislation has been long awaited.  For many years people have been calling for extending the full licensing facilities to restaurants and for some way of coping with the emerging and increasing problem of under-age drinking.  The Bill goes a long way towards dealing with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister and Deputy Barrett pointed out, the main provisions of the Bill are the granting of special restaurant licences to designated restaurants, allowing for the sale and consumption of alcohol with a meal, a change in the opening <Col N="2027" /> hours of licensed premises and measures to deal with under-age drinking.  I also welcome the decision to increase the amount of fines as a realistic move.  I should like to deal first with the decision to grant licences to restaurants.  I regard that move as having wider implications than just a change in the licensing laws. It seems to me, and to the Progressive Democrats, that this amounts to an opportunity for the Minister to ensure that a positive step is taken to develop our tourism industry.  In conjunction with the Minister for Tourism and Transport, the Minister for Justice should ensure that there is a positive development as a result of this exercise.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the owner and occupier of a bona fide restaurant must make application for a licence to the Circuit Court and submit a certificate from Bord Fáilte with that application. Such a certificate must be a realistic one that takes note of the requirements that are demanded of a restaurant in modern society.  Bord Fáilte must use this provision to spearhead a drive in the tourism industry.  I would go so far as to say that that industry has been stymied for many years by the lack of good restaurant facilities accompanied by full licences.  We have suffered in our image abroad when visitors who normally associate drinking alcohol with eating have found that they cannot have liquor with their meals here. They see it as an uncivilised way of behaving. The granting of licences to restaurants to serve alcohol can only improve our image.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide, as Deputy Barrett said, that the regulations should be laid down by the Minister for Tourism and Transport before licences are issued under the Bill.  That is a mistake.  We should be aware of the regulations and be happy that they address the problems in the restaurant industry.  We should see to it that what are described as &ldquo;high standards&rdquo; in the Bill are high standards. I do not mean they have to be the highest <i>haute cuisine.</i> They must be high in terms of efficiency, management, hygiene and general food preparation so that the <Col N="2028" /> public, and visitors to this country, can have confidence in the new system of licensing.</P>
    <P>The fee of £3,000 which must be paid to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence for a restaurant is reasonable.  It would be unreasonable to look for more money because it would be adding another overhead to an industry where the income is marginal enough.  The restaurant industry is not renowned for making a lot of money but it creates quite a lot of employment.  We should not add more burdens than are necessary.  In my view there is a case for charging restaurants in seaside resorts, where there is a season of between eight and ten weeks and where they close completely after the summer a lot less than the fee charged to restaurant owners whose premises are open all year around.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for a high degree of supervision of the new system.  The Circuit Court, Bord Fáilte and the Minister for Tourism and Transport are involved. We should make use of that and not allow the new system to amount to no more than a series of rubber stamps.  In the past year the Government have indicated that they are relying on the tourism industry to provide thousands of new jobs and we should be pinpointing areas where that can be assisted in legislation.  This is one area where we should be careful to stress that we mean what we say.  We should set out in black and white what we mean by the term bona fide.  We should make a great virtue of the fact that only decent, well run hygienic restaurants will be granted a new licence.  We should make a virtue of the fact that we will be offering a high-class comprehensive restaurant service.</P>
    <P>People from other countries regard our tradition of drinking as being very strange and slightly uncivilised.  I see the move to link drinking and eating as a positive one. If there is one area where we have failed it is in the diverting of drinking activity down one lane and eating down another. That must have catastrophic consequences. Deputy Barrett was afraid that with the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; some people may go into a pub and sit <Col N="2029" /> there drinking all day.  I disagree with certain aspects of his contribution, that because we did not have liquor licences for restaurants people here see drinking as an activity in itself.  That is unhealthy. Many people who deal with alcoholics say that the pattern for becoming an alcoholic is set early on in one's drinking career.  The availability of alcohol is a factor but we must have regard to the idea of educating our children, and ourselves, about the normal way to enjoy alcohol.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not about preventing the consumption of alcohol but about the abuse of it.  We should concentrate on that and ensure we do not go overboard in our efforts to try to rid society of alcohol.  That is not the object of the exercise.  Those dealing with alcoholics say that it is not just alcoholics who are affected by the abuse of drink and that for every one alcoholic there are up to ten people affected.  That brings us back to the tradition of drinking here and the fact that, sadly, we have failed to educate our children in regard to the consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>In expressing my agreement with the decision to extend licences to bona fide restaurants I do not wish to downgrade the licensed vintner trade which has given a lot of employment and has for long been part of the social fabric.  However, it has been allowed to run away with one aspect of social activity in a way that is unhealthy.  In my view, licensed vintners will agree that it would be healthy to allow people the option of drinking all types of alcohol, including those of Irish manufacture, with meals.  Their concern is that licences should be given out on a fair basis.  That is true up to a point but they are not the same types of licences.  I would draw quite a distinction between the type of service provided by a public bar or lounge and that provided by a restaurant.  Therefore it does not stand up to say one should have the same approach to the granting of licences as between the two.  I would contend that they should not be in competition, they provide a different service.  I predict that, after the enactment of this legislation, there will not be a rush to the restaurant, <Col N="2030" /> on the part of those who would normally go to a pub for a pint of stout.  Those people will continue to go to the pubs.  I would predict that those who want a meal will go to a restaurant and be delighted to be able to have a drink with their meal but I do not honestly believe that the provisions of this Bill will change the pattern of drinking here to any large degree other than getting people used to the idea that a different atmosphere prevails when one is drinking and eating.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will help in achieving some balance in the type of drinking engaged in in, say, late night discos to which there is a rush from the pubs because no drinking can be done after 11 o'clock or 11.30 p.m. in pubs.  It is my belief that if people felt they could get the type of drink they wanted with a meal they would begin by going to a restaurant and, possibly, go home earlier. Nothing horrifies me more than hearing of the late hours kept by people in nightclubs &mdash; I do not know how they keep it up &mdash; but drinking has a lot to do with it; the reason they go there is to get drink. If they want to incorporate a meal, after the enactment of this Act, they can have a meal with their drink.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hours in which restaurant proprietors are allowed to serve alcohol there will be real difficulty experienced in adhering to the times stipulated under the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister has indicated that normally people eat what might be described as their substantial meals between the hours of 12.30 p.m. and 3 p.m. and from 7 p.m. onwards in the evening.  In this day and age it seems unrealistic to expect people, en masse, to go for lunch between those hours and, likewise, for dinner later.  It must be remembered that there is now great flexibility in people's eating, working and social habits.  I would be against the disallowance of the serving of alcohol in restaurants between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  The Minister has contended that there is no need for the abolition of a licence in order to be the holder of a special restaurant licence.  That is not strictly true because they will cease to hold their present wine licences.  If they <Col N="2031" /> continued to be the holders of those wine licences they would then be able to serve wine with a meal between the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.  It should be remembered that many people lunch a, say, 2.30 p.m. which would mean that it would be, say, 3.10 p.m. by the time they would reach their main course.  It is unrealistic to contend that restaurant proprietors cannot continue to serve alcohol at that point. There seems to be an anomaly obtaining here in that, on the one hand, restaurant proprietors are being given a special licence to serve the full range of alcoholic drinks while, on the other, the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in pubs is being abolished.  This means that restaurant proprietors are being restricted from serving drink at a given time while allowing the proprietors of pubs &mdash; who also serve food &mdash; the flexibility of serving drink throughout the whole day.  That is an anomaly the Minister should examine between now and Committee Stage.  Certainly we will be addressing ourselves to that anomaly, which applies not only to the indigenous population but also to tourists.  If this anomaly is allowed to continue it will appear elsewhere that we do not know what we are at, that we are giving a facility with one hand while abolishing it with the other.</P>
    <P>I might deal now with the changes in the opening hours in general.  I welcome the abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; in pubs. I disagree with Deputy Seán Barrett's view in this respect.  I understand that people may have misgivings about the fact that there is no pressure, or need, on a person who comes into a pub at say, 10.30 a.m. to ever move out of those licensed premises before, say, 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. that evening.  There will be no pressure on them to do so after the enactment of this Act.  If there is anything to the credit of the provisions of this Bill it is that they are moving us toward a greater degree of responsibility for ourselves and our actions.  While realising that we have a large alcohol problem generally I do not believe this is the way to solve it.  We cannot continue to legislate for morality, for the good health <Col N="2032" /> of those in our society who may abuse alcohol.  The way to solve that problem is to educate people, to try to avoid people becoming alcoholics rather than closing the door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable that this so-called &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; should disappear.  It always seemed to me to be ridiculous that, once one found oneself outside Dublin or Cork, one did not encounter such restriction. I could not see the reasoning behind it and I welcome its abolition.</P>
    <P>The move to implement an 11 p.m. closing hour on Sundays is also welcome. As one publican said to me only yesterday, a 10 o'clock closure in the middle of the summer was ridiculous, when one found oneself putting the whole of one's pub out into the bright summer evening. That is just not on.  People go out for an evening, want to enjoy themselves, and may only do so at approximately 9 o'clock or 9.30 p.m. and then find themselves turfed out at 10 p.m. or shortly afterwards. In effect we have had the 30 minutes drinking-up time in operation for many years.  However, if its inclusion brings legislation into line with reality, that too, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Barrett referred to drinking hours on St. Patrick's Day.  We shall be referring to them also.  We would contend that there should be no reference to any special licensing laws with regard to that national holiday.  If the holiday happens to fall on a Sunday, then let it be and, if it does not, likewise.  There would appear to be no underlying reason for making special provision for licensing hours on that day.  We will contend that all references to special licensing hours on St. Patrick's Day should be deleted.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will regard that as being a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of Part IV in regard to under-age drinking constitute an important move in the right direction.  If the provisions of the Bill can be seen to be moving in any direction, they are in the direction of those who should be taking <Col N="2033" /> responsibility for themselves and their actions.  It is the key concept that those who are under-age and who are at present purchasing drink will be made responsible under the provisions of this Bill. That is only right.  Even if they are juveniles they should be brought within the scope of the law.  Those licensees who are serving under-age drinkers should also have the rigours of the law fall heavily on them; likewise, anybody who purchases drink and supplies it to an under-age drinker in a public place.  That is another practice which should incur heavy penalties.</P>
    <P>However, the responsibility for enforcing this legislation it seems depends almost entirely on the fact that the licensee can identify who is and who is not under age.  Nothing in this Bill helps that licensee to any great extent.  I believe the last legislation on this has gone into disrepute publicly.  If we want this legislation to work, if we want something that moves in the right direction, we should have great regard to the difficulties facing the licensee and subsequently the Garda in obtaining prosecutions.  In 1986 the Commissioner's report indicated there were only six prosecutions for under-age drinking and only five of those resulted in convictions.  We know the breaches are far more numerous than that.  Why are we not having more prosecutions?  The answer staring us in the face is the difficulties of proving that the licensee under present legislation knew the person was under age.  That difficulty is tremendous and it continues in this legislation.  It is not made that much clearer that the licensee will be able to know.  The onus of proof is on him.  He has to show only that he reasonably believes.  It is elusive and vague and we should tighten up on it if we are serious about this legislation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, some identity card system would seem to be called for.  There are people who shy away when they hear the words &ldquo;identity card&rdquo; because they feel it is an encroachment on their civil liberties. That does not stand up to scrutiny.  We have already systems of cards for voting, driving licences and passports and a number of so-called licences are available <Col N="2034" /> to people in different areas and there are no difficulties.  People do not object to carrying passports or driving licences.  We need to co-ordinate all these licences held by the public.  We could have one licensing card and, for instance, a letter on it to indicate what one was being licensed for and that could be added to from time to time or, as my colleague Deputy Quill suggested in the debate on the Fine Gael Bill, we could have an age of majority card.</P>
    <P>These suggestions should be considered very seriously.  I appreciate the Minister says he has done so, but in the light of the fact that this Bill lacks the possibility of really taking the kind of effect we would wish it to have without giving the licensee and those in authority something to go on, we should give further consideration to it.  There is no inherent threat to civil liberties with an identity card system.  It is easier and less onerous on the individual to carry that card if he wishes to have a drink &mdash; he does not have to carry it all the time &mdash; than having great tracts of regulations and legislation to get around the fact that the whole thing is shrouded in uncertainty, indecision and so on particularly in the present situation.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;no card, no drink&rdquo; rule would be something we would become accustomed to very quickly; it would affect only those in their late teens and early twenties and they would not mind having to carry such a card.  It is done in many other countries. Many states in the USA use it and it is very effective.  It would show that we are serious, that we mean business in our fight against under-age drinking.  If we do less we are showing that we do not really want to follow through, and the follow through is what it is all about.  If we do not have the follow through in this Bill there is no point in talking about further Bills coming in.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said we could have a second Bill on liquor licensing, that on two other occasions Bills followed in rapid succession.  I do not know what he means by &ldquo;rapid succession&rdquo;. Three years and two years respectively do not seem to me to be Bills <Col N="2035" /> following in rapid succession.  I would be talking in terms of weeks and months.  If the Minister gets the ideas here I see no reason why he cannot move with them.  I believe there would be a great deal of public support for identity cards.  They would inconvenience very few people and would bring certainty into the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move to allow children with their parents or guardians to be on licensed premises, not so much in an unrestricted way but really leaving it to the discretion of the parents or guardians.  It would be very difficult to implement a system where children were not allowed on licensed premises after, say, 8 o'clock.  Deputy Harney asked in the other debate what one would do with the children who are on the premises in a hotel which is a licensed premises after 8 o'clock.  I do not think that anomaly could be got over.</P>

      <P>Throughout the Bill there is a move to increase the fines being imposed and I see that as urgently needed.  It should have been done a long time ago.  It is another area which, not being attended to, brought the licensing laws into disrepute and, therefore, brought the whole of our body of laws into disrepute.  I would increase some of the fines, and we might address ourselves to that on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said that sometimes the fines are not adequate.  The owner of a small pub would find a £400 fine quite onerous but in a large premises, as the Deputy said, it would be quite a small outgoing.  He said there are other ways of deterring but he did not bite the bullet or go so far as to say what they might be.  Our view is and has been that there should also be the possibility that the court could impose a suspension of licence instead of or with a fine instead of loss of a licence or endorsement.  The problem at the moment in this area is that the ultimate deterrent of loss of licence is just not used.  It is akin to the nuclear <Col N="2036" /> deterrent; we know it is there but we are too afraid to use it.</P>
    <P>When it comes close to the time when the licensee sees he may be subject to loss of his licence he quickly transfers that licence and gets out from under the legal system as it stands.  To get away from that and allow judges a discretion of using something they know will be a reasonable deterrent, we should have the possibility of suspension of a licence for a week, a month or longer depending on the gravity of the offence.  A pub owner will simply not allow that to happen.  If it has happened once he will not let it happen again.  It is too costly.  He does not just lose the business for that week, he loses the trade that will obviously go somewhere else in that week, and he will make darn sure it does not happen again. On the other hand, it is not fair to do that to a vintner if he has not a reasonable way of identifying, for instance, in the under-age drinking problem who is under age and who is not.  Therefore, harsh deterrents can only go hand-in-hand with reasonable and definite identification of those who are under age.</P>
    <P>I would like to finish on that point.  We will be addressing a number of items on Committee Stage.  I take the Minister at his word when he says he is looking for reasonable suggestions and hope he can take on board some I have mentioned. As he said at the outset, we should not delay in implementing this Bill.  If by any chance he feels there is need to bring in a second Bill, for heaven's sake let it not be in two or three years but in weeks or months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill represents the first major reform of the licensing laws in 25 years.  The Minister is to be complimented, as he has been already, and congratulated on his courage and initiative in bringing in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the remarks of both Deputy Barrett and Deputy Colley.  At least 95 per cent of what they have said is sound, logical and reasonable, especially Deputy Colley's remarks regarding the enforcement of the law on under-age drinking.  If there is one major <Col N="2037" /> flaw in this Bill, that is it.  We should take her remarks seriously and consider inserting some enabling powers.  I hope this Bill will bring a sense of reality into the whole question of the sale and consumption of alcohol and the responsibility of all concerned.  I hope it will lift the licensed trade out of the limbo in which it has existed for some years.  The trade has been through a period of instability, insecurity and unrest.  It has been governed by legislation with which it was almost impossible to comply on the part of the supplier and impossible to implement from a legal point of view. The family publican has had to endure a system where there was one law for one section and in other cases almost no law at all.</P>
    <P>I agree that premises should be closed on Good Friday, but I have witnessed the sale of alcohol on that day from supermarkets controlled by multi-nationals. We should amend the law and bring in proper controls.  The Minister has done his utmost in drawing up this Bill and I believe he will be well disposed to suggestions and amendments.  The end result will be legislation worthy of this House, designed to deal with complex problems.</P>
    <P>I am interested in this Bill for a number of reasons.  I was vice-chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses which published a comprehensive report in April 1985 containing a number of recommendations of interest to the licensed trade.  We carried out an in-depth study of tourism-related businesses under the chairmanship of Deputy Ivan Yates.  The committee is now defunct but must be complimented on its tremendous work.  Some of our recommendations have already been implemented and others will soon be put into force.  I am also a member of the licensed trade and the provisions of this Bill are relevant to my business.  Thirdly, I am a family man and a public representative with a deep concern to control the abuse of alcohol, particularly by the young.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the recommendations contained in the report and I want to analyse the manner in which the Bill <Col N="2038" /> responds to them.  There were seven recommendations dealing with the licensed trade, six of which are directly relevant to this Bill.  The first recommendation is the only one outside the scope of the Bill but of very great interest to the licensed trade.  I feel justified in referring to it and commenting briefly. We asked the Government of the day to reduce the excise duty on beer, having regard to the recent reduction in the excise duty on spirits and beer price differential between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  That recommendation was complied with.  No trade has been hammered more by taxation in recent years than the licensed trade.  I am grateful that this Government have at least not put any further taxation on our hard-pressed business.  However, I would urge that our rates of excise duty and VAT on beer be brought into approximate harmony with those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation was as follows:</P>
    <P>closing hours should be fixed on a seven day basis at 11.30 p.m. all the year round with 30 minutes drinking up time and 1.00 a.m. on New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day.  The 2.30-3.30 p.m. Holy Hour in Dublin and Cork should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I have no quibble with what the Minister has recommended in the Bill because I believe 11 o'clock with half an hour drinking up time is late enough in the winter months.  The Minister might give further consideration to a couple of special exemptions.  In Scotland they do not close at all on New Year's Eve.  Very responsible people from all sides of the House who were members of that committee suggested that leaving the pubs open all the time would lead to a levelling out. Such a suggestion would be of grave concern to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would.  The recommendations in the committee's report are more or less in line with the Minister's proposals.  I have no strong feelings with <Col N="2039" /> regard to St. Patrick's Day and New Year's Eve but I am very glad that in other respects the Bill comes very close to the thinking of the committee.</P>
      <P>Section 25 in Part III maintains the existing week-day closing hours of 11.30 p.m. in summer and 11 p.m. in winter, but section 27 extends drinking up time from ten minutes to 30 minutes, as recommended by the committee.  I am glad that the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; has been abolished since the logic of its existence always defeated me.  The extension of closing time on Sundays to 11 p.m. is again in line with the thinking of the committee.</P>
      <P>The essential view of the committee was that licensed premises should be vacated by midnight.  It is my belief that alcohol should not be served on any premises other than a hotel after midnight. During the summer months closing time on weekdays will be 11.30 p.m.  On a Sunday night it was very difficult to try to call time at 10 o'clock, especially in country areas where farmers might have come in for a drink about 9.30 p.m. having finished the milking.  The day should be long gone when a publican was called before a district justice by a garda who said he did not hear the publican calling time outside the door.  One does not have to call time to people in the street.  Every drinker knows what closing time is and there should be a responsibility on the customer to vacate the premises.</P>
      <P>Our third recommendation deals with registered clubs and states:</P>
      <P>Licensing laws should be standardised for all lounge/bar outlets e.g. restrictions on garda supervision on clubs should be abolished.  Extensions to pubs should be available in line with those to clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone a considerable distance in meeting this recommendation. Section 40 of the Bill makes it clear that registered clubs must forbid the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons under the <Col N="2040" /> age of 18 years and section 41 puts registered clubs on the same footing as licensed premises in relation to inspections by the Garda Síochána.  This is very welcome.  Section 42 places registered clubs and licensed premises on the same footing so far as the right to the objection of renewal of a certificate or a licence is concerned.  All in all these provisions will leave many members of the licensed trade with the feeling that they are now being dealt with more fairly under the law.</P>
    <P>Our fourth recommendation states:</P>
    <P>Responsibility for vacating a licensed premises should rest with the customer.  On the spot fines should be introduced.  Existing penalties for customers found drinking after hours should be increased from £5 to £25.</P>
    <P>That recommendation was made in 1985 and the Minister has raised the limit to £50.  Section 44 of the Bill provides for a minimum fine of £25 and a maximum fine of £80 for customers who are found drinking after hours.  However, on-the-spot fines are not being introduced and there is no change in responsibility for vacating a licensed premises.  This Bill has my support but I, like other members of the trade, wish that the onus for vacating a licensed premises would rest with the customer.  If there is not an equally shared onus of responsibility by all sections &mdash; parents, guardians, members of the licensed trade, who are willing to do their bit, and customers &mdash; I believe we will still be operating under legislation which is impossible to comply with or implement.  It has already been stated here that the general feeling, especially among young people, is that they should not be pushed out of a licensed premises at 10 p.m. when they can pay £5 to get into a disco and drink in comfort, even though they pay substantially more to drink there.  I am not saying that this is total irresponsibility on the part of young people.  They do not seem to understand the pressures under which publicans have operated for a number of years.  I hope this legislation will relieve some of the pressures that have been wrongfully <Col N="2041" /> imposed on publicans for a long number of years.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the Oireachtas joint committee's recommendation of on-the-spot fines.  It would certainly boost the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>What legal right have I or any other publican to forcibly eject them from our premises?  What legal right has a publican to take a glass out of a customer's hand?  We must remember that even though the customer only has the loan of the glass, he has purchased the drink.  That is where the legislation could fall down.  It could be argued that the publican has the right to seek the comforts of the law, to go to court and to defend his case.  However, people do not like going to court and we should look at that aspect of it.  I say in all sincerity to the Minister that publicans and people in <Col N="2042" /> the legitimate licensed trade are willing to play their part so far as they can and that they welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>The increase in drinking-up time from ten minutes to 30 minutes has to be welcomed. It will certainly help to alleviate the problems I have mentioned.  The increased fine on customers will also be a help.  However, at the end of the day no publican can force a customer to leave his premises and, therefore, there is a need to increase the onus of responsibility on the customer in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the fifth recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee report to be important because it states:</P>
      <P>Forfeiture of a licence should be a discretionary sanction of the courts and not a mandatory one.  Endorsement should be removed after two years if there are no intervening convictions.</P>
      <P>Thankfully that issue has been dealt with. Recommendation No. (vi) states:</P>
      <P>Restrictions on credit sales should be altered to cater for organised groups, receptions and resident guests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the most important recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee and it is not addressed in this Bill. However, it is a petty restriction which <Col N="2043" /> should be removed.  No member of the licensed trade or any other trade is going to allow credit unless he is very sure of the soundness of the customer.  In other words, if I sell alcohol on credit this is not legally binding.  We recommend that this be changed.</P>
    <P>Our seventh recommendation states:</P>
    <P>Children, accompanied and fully supervised by parents should be allowed on licensed premises until 6.00 p.m.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Bill provides that a person under the age of 15 years may be present on a licensed premises during normal hours if accompanied by a parent or a guardian.  Similarly, section 36 provides that a person under 18 years of age may be present on a licensed premises only if accompanied by a parent or guardian. At present, a person over 15 years of age may enter a licensed premises unaccompanied.  These are sensible measures.  Children on a licensed premises who are accompanied by their parents are not a source of social problems except when they scatter Tayto around the floor or do something like that.  The real problem are the young teenagers who have cash in their pockets and who have uncontrolled access to alcohol, usually not from licensed premises. I congratulate the Minister for going so far in responding to the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have all been concerned at the rise in under age drinking. It seems that many teenagers are generously funded with pocket money by parents who in many cases should be more interested in the way the money is spent.  As a parent I worry about the growth in under age drinking.  As a member of the licensed trade, I run my business in a responsible manner and would never allow my premises to be used in this way.  I believe that is the attitude of most of my colleagues in the trade, yet it is the licensed trade which is always the football when the search for a scapegoat is on.  We read reports in the <Col N="2044" /> newspapers every day about premises, and they exist, who open early, close late and sell alcohol indiscriminately.  I can assure the Members of this House that these are the premises which carry &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs every two or three years.</P>
    <P>To exist in the trade one must keep up a certain standard.  The growth of off licences and supermarkets has transformed the availability of alcohol, as has the growth of hotel discos.  There are no restrictions on children and teenagers entering supermarkets.  Wine, cider and beer are available on a self-service basis just like groceries, even on Good Friday. Many supermarkets are highly responsible in this matter of selling drink to minors.  However, alcohol available in this way is more accessible than alcohol which must be sold over the counter in a licensed premises.  Part of the reason for the growth of teenage drinking is that teenagers have much more freedom, particularly financial freedom.  However, the uncontrolled growth of alcohol outlets in the retail trade is a major factor in this whole issue.  When alcohol was sold mainly through the family pub we did not have the problems we have today.</P>
    <P>Part IV of this Bill is devoted entirely to persons under 18 years of age.  Section 31 provides that it will be an offence for a licence holder to sell intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age for consumption on or off the premises or in any place other than a private residence. I welcome this tightening up of the 1924 Act.  I can assure this House that it is my belief that we are passing into law what most publicans already practice.</P>
    <P>Section 32 makes it an offence for any person to purchase alcohol for consumption by a person under 18 years of age except in a private residence.  I welcome this provision as it makes the purchaser legally responsible and I hope that the Minister will ensure that this measure is widely publicised.</P>
    <P>I also welcome section 33 which makes it an offence for a minor to purchase alcohol, and section 36 which makes it an offence for a person under 18 years of age to enter a licensed premises unless <Col N="2045" /> accompanied by a parent or a guardian. I wonder if there might not be a point in making parents or guardians responsible for the actions of the children in their care?  However, let me come back to what I said earlier.  Enforcement of this proposed legislation will depend on effective control of the sale of alcohol to young people, and that means a certain concentration on retail outlets.  There is a world of difference between purchasing alcohol over the counter from a publican who knows the trade and purchasing it in a supermarket where the person at the check-out has to cope with queues of shoppers with wire baskets and trolleys containing an enormous variety of domestic goods.  It is entirely understandable that a person in such a position would make no particular distinction between a packet of soap powder and a six pack and would not pay any particular attention to the age of customers.  This is not a criticism of supermarket staff.  They are under considerable pressure during their working day.  But it is an indication of the problem we face in this whole area.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of this Bill which empowers the Garda to seize bottles or containers suspected of containing intoxicating liquor from persons under the age of 18 years of age has all my support.  This Bill represents a major assault on the problem of under-age drinking.  The measures proposed to combat this problem have my full support and that of the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>The granting of special restaurant licences is a major aspect of this Bill. Many people in the licensed trade argue that there are thousands of inpocket licences available and restaurants could obtain full licences without too much difficulty and on the same basis that ordinary publicans have to acquire licences.  It is a view with which I have the utmost sympathy. However this particular measure has been signposted for some years now. The representative associations for the licensed trade who are fearful for the livelihoods of their members at a time of declining sales have asked that in the instance of restaurants being licensed the following conditions should be met:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2046" /> (i)  Licences should be granted only under the most stringent and enforceable conditions.</P>
    <P>(ii)  They should not be granted to fast food outlets or similar establishments.</P>
    <P>(iii)  There should be no bar or waiting area in licensed restaurants.</P>
    <P>The definition of a restaurant is set out in section 6 of the Bill as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; means any premises which are structurally adapted and used for the purpose of supplying substantial meals to the public at midday or in the evening, or at midday and in the evening, and in which any other business carried on is ancillary and subsidiary to the provision of such meals.</P>
    <P>That definition is reasonable but I wonder if the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;for consumption thereon&rdquo; after &ldquo;to the public&rdquo; would make the definition that bit more tight?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that when making an application to the Circuit Court for a licence a restauranteur must produce a Bord Fáilte certificate in relation to the application.  The provisions set out in section 8 as to the requirement for a Bord Fáilte certificate are comprehensive and what one would reasonably expect in a properly run restaurant establishment and would certainly exclude a fast food operation.  I welcome the provision for inspection of licensed restaurants by Bord Fáilte as set out in section 11 of the Bill.  We are in an era of cuts and tight management of State resources, but I would welcome an assurance from the Minister here this evening that resources will be allocated for regular inspection of licensed restaurants.  If a restaurant is found to contravene the conditions under which it received a licence, Bord Fáilte should be ruthless with regard to the revocation of the certificate. If the provisions of section 13 are applied rigidly in the first year of the new restaurant licence system, there will be far fewer problems later on.  Standards in <Col N="2047" /> restaurants will be very positively influenced.</P>
    <P>I find the midday hours from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m. as provided in section 14 to be reasonable, but I wonder would it not be better to substitute 11.30 p.m. for 12.30 a.m. in sections 14 and 6.  That is something that Deputy Colley referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect here would be to have closer conformity with pub closing times and thus ease somewhat the apprehension in the existing licensed trade.</P>
      <P>The penalty not exceeding £500 on summary conviction as provided in section 15 is stiff, but I feel it would be better if the fines could be brought into conformity with those applicable to pubs in section 25 of the Bill &mdash; up to £400 for a first offence and up to £800 for a subsequent offence.  Indeed, on reflection, I wonder if the fines set out for pubs are not a little on the high side, as many rural publicans simply could not afford fines on the scale outlined.  In fact, it would mean the end of their business.</P>
      <P>The logic behind section 19 which prohibits the granting of a separate court certificate prior to construction is very clear.  If inspection is the key to the implementation of this system the restaurant should already be in existence. Members of the licensed trade will be very happy with the provisions of section 21 that prohibit the granting of occasional licences to holders of special restaurant licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 preventing the granting of special exemptions from the permitted hours is also welcomed.  Like any other member of the licensed trade I have reservations about these new licences at a time when there are so many inpocket licences available.  However, I must compliment the Minister on the balance contained in the Bill with regard to this issue. He has certainly done as much as is legislatively possible to prevent abuse arising <Col N="2048" /> from the issue of special restaurant licences.</P>
    <P>There is one area with which I should like to deal briefly, that of discos.  Section 29 provides that in future special exemptions may not be granted to licensed hotels and licensed restaurants, those with full on-licences, in respect of any time after 1 a.m. on Sunday morning. This welcome provision should go some way towards dealing with Monday morning absenteeism, which is a genuine problem in many of our workplaces.  This Bill does not deal with the whole area of late drinking in hotel discos, nor was it intended to.  However, no attack on teenage drinking can be fully effective until this matter is given the attention it deserves.  We hope that the next reform of the licensing laws, it is hoped within the next few months, will deal with this very difficult issue.  It is not easy to deal with a Bill in such a complex area as the licensing laws, but the Minister has done this after only one year in office.  He certainly deserves the praise of all concerned with the welfare of our young people and the praise of all of us for the sense of fairness with which he has approached this problem.  As I said earlier, both Deputy Barrett and Deputy Colley made some interesting points and I hope the Minister will give them due consideration at a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As well as dealing with restaurants, public houses and discos, we should have some regard for the few remaining ballrooms left in this country.  I think that these number only around 21 or 22.  The owners of such ballrooms have made representations, I am sure, to every Member of this House asking for occasional licences with regard to weekend dancing. As somebody who is very interested in music and who has played light music, I consider these are the places where live music and entertainment can be found. They have kept an art alive in the form of dancing, Irish and ballroom.  It is bad for tourism that almost all our ballrooms are locked up, including one in my home town.  They were a legend in their time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> If he can help the owners of these ballrooms, the Minister should give this favourable consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very good one and is long overdue.  I hope it receives a safe and quick passage through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute on this very important legislation.  It is said that alcohol <i>per se</i> is not evil but its abuse is clearly a problem with which we must contend. In a country where an estimated £3.5 million per day is spent on alcohol, obviously the extent of the consumption of alcohol within our community is something that must concern us all.  The function of legislation in this area is to challenge and deal with the abuse that stalks so many in our community, but in doing so to seek to strike a balance between the individual need for consumption and the need to curtail unlimited sale and abuse of alcohol publicly. The Bill, in general, has struck this balance correctly.  The Workers' Party will give it broad support in its thrust, but there is a number of areas where this balance perhaps has tipped unfairly one way or other and we shall be proposing amendments to a number of items on Committee Stage.  It is hoped that the Minister, in the spirit of his speech inviting contributions, views and ideas both inside and outside the House, will be able to take on board some of the constructive suggestions from the Opposition with a view to making this better legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already commented, in my contribution last week on Private Members' time, on the unfortunate collision which took place between Government legislation and that proposed by Deputy Barrett of Fine Gael.  There should be a better way of ordering the business of the House.  However, if that collision was the means whereby this legislaiton has come more quickly on to the floor of the Dáil for discussion, then it is a welcome duplication. If, on the other hand, it is simply another feature of the seemingly time honoured or time abused practice of the House that nothing can emanate from the <Col N="2050" /> Opposition benches and all innovative legislation must come from Government, it is an unfortunate repetition of what I believe to be a needless and very narrow approach to the working of the House. Time has been wasted in that context, time which is apparently so valuable that tomorrow very urgent and important legislation on the question of powers of Customs and Excise officers is being so severely truncated.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of Deputy Barrett's Bill, taken up verbatim by the Minister in his Bill, is in a section dealing with under-age drinking.  Because of that, I propose to address my initial remarks to that section and in some way I am out of touch with the Minister's approach and the draft of his Bill.  It is vital that we confront what is now a major problem of under-age drinking and abuse of alcohol, in urban areas in particular.  The Minister and I and anybody else who has drifted into the use of the name &ldquo;cider party&rdquo; exclusively describing these events stand corrected in a circular from the Cider Council of Ireland.  They have made a fair point which I shall come back to briefly later on.  These drinking parties in public areas are a source of major community turmoil.  They are a source of major serious crime such as assault, malicious damage and rape.  On occasions I have had the dubious pleasure of defending young people charged with such serious crimes as murder which originated from mindless arguments, senseless bravado fuelled by the abuse and over-consumption of alcohol at these assemblies.  We must urgently, as an interim measure, bring in legislation to confront the problem in a practical way.</P>
    <P>One point must be made, that is, that so long as we condemn our young people to living in conditions of poverty by giving them no serious prospects of employment and equipping them with an education that is irrelevant and oftentimes utterly inadequate to help them to cope with finding employment in our community, we shall always have to live with and expect to find these gatherings of aimless and directionless young people in our communities.  We have now a very new and <Col N="2051" /> different problem among young people growing up, a problem that never existed in any previous generation in this State. A whole generation is growing up without affinity with the community.  They are coming out of the schools with no prospect of ever having long-term employment. In previous generations there was emigration, or the unskilled labour pool. Now one cannot even approach those options without some form of advanced formal education of leaving certificate standard or higher.  It is from this pool of totally uncommitted and unassociated youth that we have these drinking parties which are a major problem and they cannot simply be dealt with by legislation although one cannot deny the need to improve our existing laws.</P>
    <P>People other than the under-age abusers are involved in this phenomenon of under-age alcohol abuse.  There are the preying proprietors of our off licences, there are the supermarkets who sell alcohol from the open shelf to all and sundry and there are the pub owners.  In a survey carried out by the ESRI in 1986 it was established that the extent of alcohol consumption among under 18's is as extensive as it is among the adult population. Three out of four young children are alcohol consumers.  That in itself is a startling fact and it must be addressed by legislation in conjunction with acting on other factors.</P>
    <P>If we want to address alcohol abuse among people we must work to draw down the mystique we have built around alcohol and its consumption over the years, a mystique that the alcohol industry seeks to perpetuate through its advertising campaigns, which give the impression that it is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to be seen to drink.  It cannot be denied that perhaps the best place to help young people appreciate the positive features of alcohol is in the family environment.  We should ask parents to be more flexible and to help to educate their children on the positive aspects of alcohol consumption as opposed to continuing the notion that they cannot have it thereby <Col N="2052" /> making it more exciting for young people to try to get what is forbidden.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the Bill that are too restrictive.  It is unnecessarily restrictive in sections 31 and 32 to prohibit a young worker of 17 years from drinking a glass of wine with a meal at, say, a family wedding reception.  That is something that should be looked at in regulating the consumption of alcohol by people under the age of 18 years.  The prohibition on young people under the age of 18 years from working as lounge people is somewhat restrictive.  Many school going children on their transition year from secondary to third level or who must repeat the leaving certificate which will cost up to £200, often avail of and welcome the opportunity to take seasonal work in the lounges of licensed premises. To cut out that opportunity for people under 18 years of age is a bit heavy handed.</P>
    <P>An important area which does not come within the ambit of this Bill but which must be mentioned to the Minister in the hope that he will bring it back to his Cabinet, is the question of the unfair imposition of a similar tax on non-alcoholic wines and beers.  The mystique surrounding the consumption of alcohol makes it very difficult for young people to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in company and to be seen the odd person out.  One obvious way to help them is to have available cheap non-alcoholic beverages such as non-alcoholic wines and beers.  At the moment, a bottle of many, if not all of these, beverages costs more than the price of a half pint of beer.  This does not help to deal with the problem in a positive way.  I would like the Minister to consider my point and pass it on to the relevant sections so that we might be able to get amending legislation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The pub is often the centre of the community, the centre of social activity and, regrettably, too often the only centre of social activity in many communities.  If we wish to keep young people out of these places, we must provide alternative recreational and sporting facilities so as to draw them away from the pub as the centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> Our pubs are part of the tradition of our communities and are very important features of our landscape.  In the context of restaurant licences, it is important that pubs receive the protection of legislation. I was interested to hear Deputy Lynch of the trade say that he considered the legislation to be fair.  Many of the submissions I received from the Vintners Association suggest that it is unfair <i>vis-àvis</i> the restaurant licence.  I am worried that many of our community and local town pubs would be threatened economically by competition from the restaurant trade.  We have a duty to protect many of these important features of our tradition and geography.</P>
    <P>In the area of under-age drinking I would repeat that the imposition of monetary fines alone as penalties is not enough.  The endorsement on licences is there but this is so easily circumvented by skilful lawyers or skilful manoeuvring of the assignment of the licence to nominated parties.  The imposition of these endorsements is in the main, discretionary and often a well earned endorsement is avoided simply because of the eventual consequences of a suspension of licence should a third active endorsement be imposed.  One cannot blame district justices taking that discretionary circumvention of the legisation when the consequence of it would mean the loss of a livelihood.</P>
    <P>In the context of the current penalties, fines and endorsements not being adequate, what I am arguing for is the alternative of imprisonment.  I believe that the peddling of alcohol to those who are under age is an offence which merits imprisonment <i>per se,</i> particularly where there is persistent repetition of this practice. One of the best ways of bringing licence holders who are so uncaring of the community as to peddle and sell alcohol to under-age drinkers to appreciate their important role in the community and the serious damage which they can cause is to have them do community work and the only way this can be imposed under the present legislation is as an alternative to imprisonment.  District Courts and Circuit Courts who deal with <Col N="2054" /> offenders in this area should have available to them as an alternative the imposition of community service and for that reason I advocate the availability of imprisonment as a penalty.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the problem of under-age drinking in open places it is essential that the Garda Síochána be given the power of arrest.  This is not provided for under the existing legislation or in the Bill as proposed.  One can envisage the problems a garda would be presented with if he were to approach a crowd of young people drinking in a public place. He can confiscate their alcohol and take their names in certain circumstances if they will give them to him but what often happens when the Garda arrive is that the crowd scatters in all directions.  What is important for the Garda Síochána then is to identify the ring leaders, the people who set the scene, who manage to get the alcohol from off licences and who, if it is confiscated, will go back down to Phibsboro or Fairview or wherever these off-licences exist to buy another stash. I believe it is important for the Garda Síochána to have the power to arrest these people.  It would be no harm to have them cool off and sober up in a cell for a few hours and face the court subsequently.</P>
    <P>It would be of great assistance to bus drivers in the city if persons who are clearly under age and carrying alcohol on buses could be confronted and removed in custody by the Garda Síochána, if necessary.  It should not be left to bus drivers and bus conductors who on a daily basis are being given more and more policing powers on buses.  Bus drivers have now got to collect fares and police good conduct on buses.  It is a bit much to ask them to deal with the problem of under-age drinkers carrying or consuming drink on buses.  Therefore, I believe the Garda Síochána should have the power to remove from buses in custody persons who are not prepared to behave or who are in breach of this area of the law.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is to be welcomed.  The issuing of identity cards as a means of assisting licensees and publicans was raised recently in a debate during Private Members' time.  We <Col N="2055" /> believe that a compulsory identity card system would be too oppressive and is not warranted in the context of this legislation and problem.  At no stage in the course of that debate did I suggest otherwise, although Deputy Barrett may wrongly have taken me as having suggested that.  At that time the Minister asked me what my views were on the matter and I indicated that we had not considered it but in looking at the matter in the context of this legislation we believe such a system could only be introduced on a voluntary basis, area to area, and that its probable effect would be that it would provide a means of circumventing the legislation rather than making it more effective.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy for an older brother on the basis of likeness to pass it to a younger brother, for a friend to pass it to a friend and for a publican to suggest that on a busy night he had asked for seen quickly produced an identity card which assured him that the person was over 18 but that on a closer subsequent examination he realised that the card did not belong to the person producing it.  In those circumstances that would I believe provide an adequate defence or means of defence for a publican to say that on a flash of the card he believed the person had been over the age limit.  In any event, we believe that the onus to conduct the premises according to law must always rest on the shoulders of the licensee.  If there is any doubt about the age of the person seeking to purchase alcohol, that person should be refused.  For too long publicans have had the benefit of legislation which allowed them when in doubt to serve and then to argue later on the question whether or not they knew.  We say that the onus should rest on them and that if they are in doubt they should refuse and that if they do serve they do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Private Members' time, as on this Bill, the issue of young people under the age of 18 being allowed on premises in the company of a parent or guardian was raised.  As on that occasion, I suggest that this is not a <Col N="2056" /> desirable development.  It has received the specific disapproval of the licensed trade, particularly in the Dublin area, and it is one which I would be very slow to support.  However, I believe there are other ways and means of dealing with this issue in a more sensible way.  The purpose of this legislation is to prevent the introduction of young people to the environment of the pub at too young an age. As I have stated before, one possible compromise is the designation within a licensed premises of an area for young people who would be accompanied by their parents.  In other words, the person who is in the pub for the purpose of consuming alcohol and who has brought along with him of necessity a young person would be compelled to remain in an area away from the general run of the bar.  Of course the point has to be made that parents should, as much as possible, avoid bringing young people into licensed premises.  I note the Minister's point about rural areas where other facilities do not exist but on balance it is not a desirable development and I would have grave reservations about supporting that provision of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The curious section of the Bill relating to the proof of age in prosecutions, section 39 (2), suggests that the proof of the person seeming to be under age shall rest not just on the shoulders of the garda at the time of the initiation of the prosecution but also, as stated in the Bill, &ldquo;and such person appears to the Court to have been a child at the date of the commission of the offence&rdquo;.  That subsection goes on to raise the presumption, shall be presumed to be under the age until otherwise proved.  Those words should be deleted for reasons that, I hope, are obvious.  The onus should rest upon the garda or prosecuting person at the time the offence is committed.  We know that, particularly on summons, it can take up to a year in many instances for prosecutions to be brought.  Even if there is an elapse of only a short period of time people can do many things so as to look older or younger and I am sure that is not unfamiliar to the Deputies in the House.  It is a curious wording that <Col N="2057" /> will work to frustrate the intentions of the Bill unless properly amended.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make in this area is in response to the submission made by the Cider Industry Council which recently announced its establishment under the auspices of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  In the context of our debates &mdash; I strike my own breast on this &mdash; we have been somewhat unfair to cider as a beverage.  Cidermaking is an important indigenous industry, although I am curious to see some of the names that represent the members of the council &mdash; certainly not names particular to our own jurisdiction &mdash; for example, West End Wine Company and Taunton Cider Company.  Nonetheless, we know that cider is an important beverage and many jobs depend on its manufacture. The cider industry has a big job to do in correcting its own image.  It is a very recent phenomenon that it is now being promoted as an adult or table drink.  Perhaps we could help in its promotion as a reasonable beverage by being careful not simply to single it out as the only source of under-age drinking.</P>
    <P>The licensing of restaurants for the general consumption of alcohol is a very good development and must be welcomed by all.  It brings our legislation up to modern day conditions and that is a good thing.  However, I would like the Minister to expand a little more on the definition of a restaurant of, to quote his words, &ldquo;good standard&rdquo;.  He said that licences will be available only to those restaurants of good standard.  I am a little concerned in the drift of what the Minister has said and in some of the comments on the Bill that there is an element of snobbishness creeping in.  A good and substantial meal to the lovers of <i>haute cuisine</i>&mdash; I am not one of them &mdash; would be very much frowned upon by the man or woman who likes simple foods such as chicken and chips.  The Minister did not elaborate on his idea as to what is a restaurant of good standard.  Is it a restaurant that is well appointed, well decorated or provides a particular standard of food?  That needs to be clarified.  I note that there are provisions for the issuing <Col N="2058" /> of standards regulations at a later stage by the Minister for Tourism and Transport but before we are fully satisfied with the legislation we are now dealing with, we are entitled to hear what those regulations will deal with.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned by the indication of the Minister that the £5 worth meal in the area of special exemption provisions will also apply to a restaurant meal where a full licence for alcohol and beer will be available.  There is a different case to be made for a special exemption function which is usually associated with a dance and where the consumption of alcohol is often secondary to the event of the night or the special occasion.  We have known for a long time the meal plays a very small role and that is because the value was put at £2.  You can serve little for that amount but you would have to justify to a court later that it constitutes a substantial meal within the monetary definition of the term.  When dealing with restaurants, the meal is the primary reason for being on the premises.  We should differentiate between the value of the meal in the context of the special exemption and the value of the meal in the context of the restaurant.  It now seems that by putting down £5 on the table you will have your choice of the alcohol in the restaurant.</P>
    <P>That is a very small premium to pay. However, I am extremely concerned in the context of this legislation that it will seriously undermine the local pub, the town licensed premises.  I am not convinced by the arguments of the publicans' trade at present that they are under serious threat and I do not fully accept the arguments they advance on the numbers game about the proliferation of licensed premises, particularly in urban areas.  I am concerned because it is inevitable that their trade will be affected in some regards by the introduction of the restaurant licence.  It would be foolish to suggest otherwise.  At the same time we have a duty to keep a close eye to ensure that the traditional pub is not obliterated by reason of the proliferation of the restaurant licence.</P>
    <P>In this regard I ask, is the premium of £3,000 for such a licence a fair figure?  It <Col N="2059" /> certainly does not seem to be half enough but it is a figure that the Minister has picked.  I ask the Minister, subject to debate later and amendment to that area of legislation by those of us who believe the figure should be higher, to at least give an undertaking or an indication that he will keep that figure under very active review and in the event that there appears to be a rush or proliferation of the creation of restaurant licences as a result of the passing of this legislation, to take appropriate and pre-emptive action to dissuade the proliferation of these kinds of licences.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, I am anxious to know why the Circuit Court is the court of application for restaurant licences.  I am always concerned with legislation which seeks to play down the primary importance of our District Courts.  These are the courts that are more widely distributed, more in touch with what goes on in the community and, if properly staffed and furnished, are the best equipped to deal with legislation of this sort and we should be working to build them up.  However, this is another example of where we are saying these licences should be applied for in the Circuit Court, with the next stage of appeal to the High Court with the consequent cost and delays that attach in the higher courts.  We should use the District Courts and have recourse to the Circuit Court if there is an appeal.</P>
    <P>What was the Minister's response to the submission from the Irish ballroom industry and the brief that lobby group submitted to him?  Will he tell us why there is nothing in the Bill to address their problem?  Does he accept that a lot could be done for this traditional form of entertainment by granting the concession of the two special exemption licences per week for which they are looking?  This would, and must, be welcomed if it would help an obviously ailing area of leisure, and if the exemptions were to be confined to the weekends, say, Friday, Saturday or Sunday night going into 1 a.m. Monday as with special exemptions for pubs.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; is welcome.  The increase in the licensing <Col N="2060" /> hours, where appropriate is welcome but must not involve any compulsion on those working in the trade to work longer hours.  At this time their conditions are appalling, and we would support them, through their unions, in resisting any effort to impose on them the duty to work longer and more unsocial hours.  This matter must be negotiated and I hope the Minister in promoting this legislation will use his good offices to promote a fair resolution of any disputes that will inevitably arise between the staff and their employers.</P>
    <P>I am worried about homeward-bound late night transport, particularly in urban areas.  Have the Government any proposals to negotiate or discuss with CIE making available late night homeward transport in view of the extension of drinking hours?</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the half-hour drinking up time and I ask that it be seriously policed because what will inevitably happen is that people will double or treble their last purchase and be sitting happily not drinking up but consuming more alcohol and availing of the longer time to clear the premises. There must be strict enforcement of this legislation and the licence holders and publicans must be held responsible if we find they are dispensing double and treble rounds as the last round, realising there is longer time to clear the premises and more money to be made.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister has not conceded to the tourist/non-tourist designation of areas with regard to licensing hours.  I believe uniformity is useful and workable.  It would be unbelievable to have people, having consumed a lot of alcohol, trying to get from one area to another late at night, to avail of longer drinking hours in an adjoining area. There is no district in this country remote from a tourist location.  Some people would argue that the entire country is a tourist area.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the general points I wanted to raise and in view of the time I do not propose to delay the House.  I ask the Minister and the Government to ensure that this legislation moves <Col N="2061" /> expeditiously through the House.  This Bill covers a very important area of law dealing with under-age drinking.  This could have been passed in this House last week if we had accepted Deputy Barrett's Bill.  Now, under-age drinking has been incorporated into wider legislation and I hope it will not be delayed unduly while we debate other aspects of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the Committee Stage will be taken without delay and that this legislation will be dealt with by both Houses as early as possible. I have some memory of a commitment being made by the Minister that he would have this legislation steered through both Houses by the height of the tourist season &mdash; I think July was mentioned &mdash; but he did not refer to that today.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister's initiative in introducing this legislation, long overdue as it is.  This exercise will have the effect of bringing the liquor licensing laws up-to-date and consistent with the requirement of Irish life in 1988. I was delighted to hear the Minister's invitation to Deputies to debate and to tease out thoroughly this issue so that the legislation in its ultimate format will represent real improvements in these areas, will result in bringing equality to the trade in general and will serve the best interests of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister, in preparing this legislation, has sincerely striven to achieve this equality throughout the trade. <Col N="2062" /> The intoxicating drink business is very diverse with retail outlets ranging from pubs to hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, off-licences, discotheques, clubs and so on.  There are 10,477 fully licensed premises operating in Ireland. Of these 834 are situated in the Dublin area and 9,643 throughout the remainder of the country.  There are 817 hotels with fully licensed restaurants and there are 300 fully licensed restaurants.  There are 557 registered clubs which supply alcoholic drinks.  These figures would appear to emphasise the fact that this country is more than adequately provided for in terms of available drink outlets and there does not appear to be a need for providing further outlets.</P>
    <P>However, realising that we are in the midst of a major operation to attract more tourists to our country, particularly from continental Europe, we must provide appropriate services for visitors. It is in that context that I must accept the Minister's proposal to allow certain restaurants to have liquor licences so that they can provide alcoholic drink to those who are having a meal on the premises. That is the custom that prevails elsewhere in Europe.  It appears ludicrous to prevent the making available of Irish beers and spirits &mdash; in fact, a full range of drink &mdash; to those people.  However, all conceivable measures must be taken to ensure that there is no abuse of the new system.  Frankly, I have serious reservations as to whether this abuse can be prevented in practice.</P>
    <P>The principle of providing bona fide restaurants with the facility to serve drink with a meal is one I can agree with readily but, however, I do not want to see that exercise develop to such an extent where in issuing a special restaurant licence we are, in effect, creating another pub.</P>

      <Col N="2063" /> That Dáil Éireann recognises the crisis facing the beef industry, notes the Fine Gael proposals for a resolution of the problem and calls for the introduction and implementation of a comprehensive programme to achieve the necessary increase in beef cow numbers.</P>
    <P>The major crisis in agriculture is that facing the beef industry which arises because of a shortage of supply.  The crisis is one which has huge post-farm implications and, therefore, a solution is essential not just in the interests of farming but in the interest of the economy.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food has finally admitted what has been known for months past, that his scheme for maintaining the national beef cow herd has no hope for implementation.  Apart from the difficulties of securing acceptance of the scheme it could have been criticised as being a totally insufficient response to the problem.  In any event, it has now been consigned to the dustbin and is no longer relevant to the debate.  However, it must be said that the pathetic posturing of the Minister in Limerick yesterday attempting to blame the meat industry, and all and sundry, for his own failures did not add anything to the debate.</P>
    <P>What is needed now is a comprehensive action plan which will apply over the next four years.  The target should be to increase beef cow numbers to 750,000 by 1992, an increase of almost 300,000 on the June 1987 figures.  I have on behalf of Fine Gael circulated proposals for a 20-point action plan to achieve that target.  Implementation of that programme will result in at least 1,000 additional jobs being created in the meat industry, extra beef exports of £200 million per year and viability for 20,000 to 30,000 farm families.  Correspondingly, failure to act will result in thousands of farmers and many meat plants being forced out of business and many jobs lost. Indeed, many meat plants are operating on a three-day-week, or less.  In addition our exports will suffer as will our balance <Col N="2064" /> of payments.  The utterly defeatist attitude of the Minister is not acceptable to us.  This is an issue on which defeat cannot be accepted.  The consequences are too serious not just for our farmers but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to recognise that the beef industry is facing a crisis. The introduction of the meat quota, and its reduction in the last two years, has major implications for our beef industry through reducing dairy cow numbers and, thereby, calf supplies for the beef herd. Over recent years cow numbers have fallen by almost 100,000.  The effect of that is that the supply of calves going to the market has fallen sharply.  An obvious consequence of that, which can be seen at marts around the country, is that calf prices are booming and squeezing the margins from beef production.  Indeed, the increase in calf and store cattle prices puts into question whether many farmers can afford to remain in beef production.</P>
    <P>I reckon that about 90,000 farmers are involved in cattle production and the future viability of many of their operations must be in question.  Even more serious is the prospect of a further cut-back in dairy cow numbers.  I have read a variety of papers on this and listened to speeches from various experts from AFT, ACOT and elsewhere and the general consensus is that there will be a reduction of another 200,000 dairy cows over the next four years.  That, on top of our existing problems, will exacerbate the difficulties being faced by farmers.  It confirms my view that there is a crisis in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>If we look at another aspect of the same industry we will see that there has been massive investment in beef processing in recent years.  Between 1983 and 1986 the IDA approved grants of £20 million towards capital investment of about £90 million in that sector.  In 1987 we had the announcement of IDA support for the investment programme of our largest beef processing company, Goodman International, which projected investment of £140 million over the next five years.  The IDA have projected an extra 1,000 jobs in beef processing but <Col N="2065" /> there is a condition.  They say that the jobs are there if there is not a reduction in cattle numbers, and that is the reason why I am focusing on that aspect of the problem tonight.</P>
    <P>The implications of a continuing drop in numbers in the national cow herd are obvious.  On the other hand, because the pattern of falling numbers is not unique to this country a major opportunity is presented to us.  If we examine the figures in the EC &mdash; the only figure I had access to related to the Ten; Spain and Portugal only joined recently &mdash; we find that there was a drop between 1984 and 1987 of 2.6 million, or 10 per cent of what might be called the international herd.  In this year alone the EC self-sufficiency ratio for beef is expected to be 100 per cent as compared to 110 per cent in 1984.  I accept that there are still intervention stocks but it is expected that they will be significantly reduced, if not eliminated, over the next couple of years.  We now have an attractive prospect of market opportunity opening up for our meat exporters in the context of the EC market coming into balance and the prospect of under-supply in a few years' time.</P>
    <P>We must then examine our circumstances: will we be in a position to exploit this potential?  My basic contention, one accepted by most people with an interest in this area, is that we will not be in a position to exploit this potential despite our massive investment in processing facilities and so on unless our meat plants can get sufficient supplies. The position was summed up at one seminar by one respected individual in the trade when he referred to the prospect of a herd of meat-processing white elephants around the country.  That is the danger if insufficient supplies are not available.</P>
    <P>It is against that background of market opportunity, spare capacity on our farms and in our factories &mdash; I mentioned those on a three day week and so on &mdash; that a serious commitment must be given to increasing cow numbers rapidly.  The Minister has been in office for well over a year.  I understand from his public statements that he accepts the facts underlying <Col N="2066" /> the basis of my concern.  On the other hand, he has failed utterly to introduce and implement a policy to cope with the problem.  That failure has led to this debate here this evening.  Apart from the Minister, I accept that there is need for an acceptance on the part of all with an interest in this area that this constitutes the major national priority within the agricultural sector and is one of the top national economic priorities of all sectors.</P>
    <P>I carried out a fair amount of examination of this issue in recent months. Before circulating my proposals some weeks ago I had come to the conclusion that no single policy instrument would be sufficient to achieve the overall objective if we are talking about a targeted increase of 300,000 extra beef cows.  The only way that target can be achieved will be by a combination of measures covering grants, tax incentives, financing arrangements and measures to improve on-farm efficiency and profit margins for those involved in the business.  At the end of the day it will be so difficult to achieve that target that every possible method should be deployed to bring about the necessary increase in cattle numbers. That is the strength of my conviction about the depth of the crisis, the need for action and the possibility, the golden opportunity, that awaits us if we do take such action and can bring about the necessary increase from the point of view of supply.</P>
    <P>If one examines the grant structure at present one will see it is clear that the grants provided for beef cows largely represent social payments.  This is due mainly to the fact that this system of farming is predominant in disadvantaged areas and on poorer farms outside disadvantaged areas.  Because of the over-riding need to increase cattle numbers, public policy toward beef cow numbers must take on a much clearer economic focus.  Thus, the various restrictions attaching to the grants schemes, by and large, are no longer justified.  In examining the position obtaining one must understand that there is another problem to be faced, that is the funding difficulty of those involved <Col N="2067" /> in beef cow enterprises, particularly in their early stages.  I also accept that there is a low borrowing capacity on the part of many farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to touch now on the principal proposals contained in my 20-point programme. I am putting them before the House for serious consideration, as forming the basis for an action plan to be implemented now.  I have already presented them to my party.  Were we in Government I would be pushing for their immediate implementation.  My outlook is that the position is so serious I must put them to the House, seek the views of Members, asking that they be implemented immediately.  If the Minister has alternative proposals to achieve the same result I will be quite prepared to debate them.  The following are my proposals: (1), I am talking about a subsidy of £100 to be paid on pregnant heifers in the beef herd kept for the purpose of increasing the herd.  Because of the difficulties encountered by those involved in the beef area some such arrangement is necessary, one which would involve a down payment rather than the prospect of some return in the distant future.</P>
    <P>(2), I contend that the existing grant levels for beef cows, within disadvantaged areas, should be maintained. I believe strongly that the restrictions on receipt of grants in relation to off-farm income &mdash; affecting the cattle headage and beef cow schemes and the restrictions in regard to full time farmers, affecting the suckler cow premium schemes &mdash; should be removed.</P>
    <P>(3), I propose that the existing restrictions concerning grants payable per farm and per forage acre &mdash; another restriction &mdash; should be modified, that the current limit of 30 livestock units for headage payments in the more severely handicapped areas should be increased to 45 livestock units.  I am not proposing the introduction of that provision <i>carte blanche.</i> I suggest that it should be increased provided the increase relates to beef cows.  I propose that the current limit of 28 beef cows should be increased to 42 under the provisions of the beef cow <Col N="2068" /> scheme in the less severely handicapped areas and, correspondingly, the maximum payments per forage acre adjusted to £45.72 in severely handicapped areas and £42.73 in less severely handicapped areas.</P>
    <P>(4), I propose that there be a review of the EC beef policy later this year.  The Minister is in a very strong position to seek an increase in the EC-funded suckler cow premium scheme, at present standing at £36.80.  Fully argued I believe there would be a possibility of having that sum increased to at least £60 to be applicable outside disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>(5), I propose, in relation to the calf subsidy at present standing at £77.60 and applicable to all calves born in the dairy and beef cow herds, that, subject to EC approval that subsidy should no longer apply to dairy herds but, instead, be increased by £15 per calf in beef herds.</P>
    <P>(6), I propose that dairy farmers with a milk quota of less than 30,000 gallons should be eligible for beef cow grants; that is becoming more and more obvious. There is great potential there for expansion on small farms with limited quotas. I want to see that potential encouraged and the possibility of beef cow grants being made available to those with a quota of less than 30,000 gallons.  I accept that any such scheme would have to be thought out carefully from the point of view of administration.  I propose that we take the numbers of dairy cows and quotas in 1987, as a base so that cows kept in excess of that base would then qualify for the beef cow and suckler cow premiums.</P>
    <P>(7), stock relief is an instrument which can be used to help in achieving the necessary numbers.  Stock relief for additional beef cows should be increased from 110 per cent to 125 per cent.  I can confirm that Fine Gael propose to table an amendment to the Finance Bill to achieve this effect.</P>
    <P>(8), because stock relief cannot be used to create a loss, I am also proposing a further change that, for beef cows, unused stock relief should be carried forward for up to three years.</P>
    <P>(9), in regard to stock relief, I also <Col N="2069" /> propose that the clawback period should be reduced from ten years at present to seven years.</P>
    <P>(10), on the basis that it is in the long term interest of the financial institutions that as many farmers as possible remain viable, I propose that their contribution towards achieving this should be by way of the extension of the AAA rate of interest to farmers engaged in the expansion of beef cow numbers, thus reducing the existing interest rate by 2 per cent to 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>(11), a further incentive would be the introduction of a new loans scheme which would provide for a three year interest moratorium while the beef cow enterprise is being established.  I have had discussions with some of the financial institutions and I have reason to believe that they could be encouraged to introduce such a scheme.</P>
    <P>(12), because of the need to tackle farm level constraints to development, a properly funded research and advisory service is necessary.  More research is required on technical aspects of suckler systems, including nutrition levels and breeding policies.  This needs to be translated into practice on farms, through the advisory service.  Therefore, the drive to expand suckler cow numbers must receive an appropriate priority in the programme of the new agricultural policy. Of course there is now a further difficulty in the implementation of that proposal because of the unholy mess that has been made of the merger arrangement. However, that is a matter for another day.  Despite the mess, the results from this decimation must be prepared to take as one of their priorities this whole question.</P>
    <P>(13), in regard to housing, the figures show that up to 70 per cent of dry stock farms in the west have little or no housing for store cattle and a high proportion of the remainder have very poor facilities. It is essential that the revised western package is put in place straight away. Furthermore, existing regulations should be modified to allow low cost housing systems.  Some of these have been <Col N="2070" /> developed in recent years by ACOT and AFT and low cost housing does not necessarily relate to poor quality.  On that basis, the regulations should be modified to allow such low cost systems to qualify for grant aid.</P>
    <P>(14), because calf mortality is still a serious problem &mdash; on about one-fifth of our farms the rate is running at 10 to 20 per cent &mdash; there must be an intensification of existing campaigns to reduce it.  In particular, such a campaign obviously must be targeted at these problem farms.</P>
    <P>(15), the IFA initiative in promoting producer groups and the application to the EC Commission that producer groups in the beef sector should be eligible for establishment aid and other support measures are worthy of the strongest support.</P>
    <P>(16), while it does not make sense to build a beef industry based on imported raw material, some limited imports will help, in the short term, towards achieving the overall objective of increasing numbers. Obviously, such imports will have to come from herds of an approved health status and would be imported to farmers operating calf to beef systems.</P>
    <P>Perhaps undue attention has been focused on that proposal but I do not anticipate that the numbers resulting from that approach will be enormous. However, the problem is so serious that it is one of many proposals which would help to achieve the overall objective.</P>
    <P>(17), I want to see an effort made to overcome the constraints in the expansion of the use of once-bred heifers.  The main constraints of the price discount in the carcase and the fact that the variable premium does not apply in the UK to the once-bred heifer carcase means that processors have a responsibility to explore all market opportunities for once-bred heifer meat.  Even though I accept that some research has been done which has been reasonably positive, further market research in this field should be undertaken jointly by the processors, the research arm of the new agricultural authority and the CBF.  The whole idea <Col N="2071" /> is to feed back to the producer the benefits of a better market outlet for this type of meat.  We must find a way to encourage producers to breed the heifers before disposal.</P>
    <P>(18), while I do not see short term benefits resulting from the excellent research into twinning which has been undertaken in our universities and research institutes, in the medium term such research will help in the overall solution. Accordingly, the importance of this research should be reflected in the allocation of the national science and technology budget and the processing industry should contribute to this national effort on a greater scale by linkages and funding with the universities and research institutes.</P>
    <P>(19), processors have a major role to play, specifically those in receipt of substantial grant aid.  They must undertake commitments in terms of increasing national added value and in respect of undertaking measures to increase the supply of cattle.</P>
    <P>(20), conditions should be laid down and there should be an annual review of the progress made towards achieving targets and respecting the conditions agreed under the grant aid arrangements. There should also be a clawback in the event of failure to achieve targets.</P>
    <P>That is an outline of my main policy proposals.  There are also possibilities under the business expansion scheme and my policy document emphasised the need for rapid progress in the eradication of bovine TB which has been a continuing major cost to the livestock industry.  It was the basis for the first policy document I produced last year in the area of agriculture and I am glad that the Minister is making a move in that regard at long last.</P>
    <P>If my proposals are implemented, I anticipate that we can achieve the necessary target increase of 300,000 beef cows over the next four years at no additional cost to the Exchequer.  I accept that, in some instances, the proposals require the approval of the EC Commission.  Clearly, in the light of the acceptance &mdash; it was written into the Single European Act &mdash;<Col N="2072" /> of the need for cohesion and of the importance of the industry to our economy, we have an exceptionally strong case for securing such acceptance by the Commission.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of cost, a reallocation of the calf premium would cover the additional cost of doubling the subsidy for calves in the beef herd as well as the subsidy for pregnant heifers.</P>
    <P>The increase in EC recoupment from 50 per cent to 70 per cent would enable the other measures to be implemented without any difficulty or any additional charge to the Exchequer.  In considering this, it is also very important that we look at the overall benefits to be derived by the economy and the Exchequer.  It is very clear that there are huge benefits to be achieved from having an additional 300,000 beef cows.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the importance to farmers involved in beef production of the achievement of such a target which would substantially improve and make a vital contribution to maintaining the viability of 20,000 to 30,000 farmers in this country.  Then we can look at the effect on our balance of payments and exports.  I also dealt with this in my policy document and I said that it would result in increased exports which would amount to £200 million.  There is also the question of jobs.  More jobs will be lost in the meat sector, people will be laid off or put on a three-day week and this trend will continue unless the supply is there.  On the other hand, if we can achieve increases in supply of the order I have mentioned I have no doubt that we can achieve the additional 1,000 jobs in the meat processing sector projected by the IDA.  The results would probably be even better because the target I have set is higher than that talked about in the IDA document, therefore, the 1,000 extra jobs would be an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the Exchequer inflow from additional spending associated with this sector, agriculture and food imports, represents about 25 per cent of the value of these exports.  I have not heard that figure contradicted in any way.  If we are talking <Col N="2073" /> about an increase in exports of the order of £200 million from this sector and if the figures in that study are correct, the direct return to the Exchequer would be of the order of £50 million a year.</P>
    <P>As we stand it is clear that much valuable time has been lost.  I am presenting my proposals to the Dáil as the basis for a comprehensive plan to be implemented immediately.  As I mentioned, if the Minister has alternative proposals to offer let us also debate those.  As I have said also, it is now time to recognise that the crisis is there and for us to insist on the introduction and implementation of a programme to resolve that crisis.  It is clear that such a programme cannot just focus on one plain or one policy instrument; it has to be broad and comprehensive. Only in that way will we achieve the kind of increase in numbers that clearly is needed.</P>
    <P>I am not sure at this stage whether, with the collapse of the Minister's own plans, he is prepared to take on board my proposals completely.  For the purposes of the debate I will be glad to hear what he has to say.  If he has alternative proposals I will be glad to discuss those in my reply to this debate, but clearly we need action now.  I am asking that all parties in this House recognise that the crisis is there and be prepared to debate the proposals I have put forward or any additional proposals which may arise in the debate and that, arising out of this, we will have agreement in this House on the need for the introduction and implementation of a comprehensive programme to achieve the necessary increase in beef cow numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate in the House on the beef industry.  I recognise that the document recently published by Deputy O'Keeffe, the Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture, was intended by him to be a discussion document and that he set out to make a constructive contribution to a debate on the future of the industry.  That said, I am afraid &mdash; and this will not surprise him &mdash; I have to take issue with <Col N="2074" /> him on a number of items contained in the document.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say, I suppose, that noone, not even a Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture, should be held responsible for the sins and failings of the past, but if there is a crisis, as he puts it, in the beef industry now, that crisis did not start this year.  I want to give the figures in relation to the crisis so that we have an objective presentation of the reality.  As it happens, that crisis ran right through the period of office of the Government of which Deputy O'Keeffe was an active supporter in the Dáil.  I want to give the figures and trends that now emerge.</P>
      <P>Since 1984 the total numbers of the cow herd generally have dropped from 1,949,000 to 1,864,000 up to this year. The beef herd is particularly affected by this.  Take the last couple of years: there was a drop from 414,000 to 406,000 in the space of one year, 1986.  During last year, which I am glad to come back to, there was a significant improvement back to 420,000, an improvement of 14,000 in the space of that year.  I mention these figures, not for the purpose of trying to suggest that even the improvement that was evident last year is anything like adequate, but to demonstrate above all else that the crisis the Deputy refers to was much more acute &mdash; indeed, it was chronic &mdash; when the party he supports were in Government.  The facts bear that out.</P>
      <P>I would like to bring other facts to the attention of the House which from the point of view of the confidence of all concerned in this sector have to be presented.  That is my function.  Then, to the extent they are matters that need to be corrected, my function is, of course, to take corrective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the beef industry today is far from being as black as the Deputy or others would wish to have it seen.  Let me give some of the rather reassuring facts in this as in every other sector in agriculture and point that out.  Since 1 January this year, for instance, cow slaughterings are down by 17,000 cows. We were all concerned about the level of cow slaughterings and the Deputy should <Col N="2075" /> know &mdash; but did not refer to it &mdash; that right now as he presents this crisis picture we are seeing a major reversal with cow slaughterings down by 22 per cent.  In the last six months the drop in the number of cow slaughterings has been some 50,000. Clearly a pattern is now emerging where farmers are already retaining extra cows in significant numbers for good reasons which I will point to in my contribution. What are those reasons?  They are fairly evident.  Cattle prices have remained buoyant and look like remaining so for the foreseeable future.  Those are facts on which we do not need to &mdash; indeed, we cannot &mdash; take issue on in this House. Those facts speak for themselves to the extent that our prices have recently been higher than the Community average for one of our main categories of beef, category O, and the same trend is developing in regard to category R.  What is the significance of that?  For the first time since we joined the EC in the early seventies, apart from one brief isolated period in 1973, our average price for the main categories of beef is higher than the Community average.  Of course, that is having a major effect on the whole attitude of the producer to the beef sector and to the retention of suckler cows because the prices for calves this year have been exceptionally good and obviously constitute an enormous incentive to farmers to retain extra breeding stock and produce calves.</P>
    <P>You can look at that in one of two ways.  Deputy O'Keeffe chooses to look at it in the other way, that the prices are so high they are a disincentive, you cannot purchase calves.  That is one way of presenting it, but the other is the reality, that because the prices are so high and there is such unprecedented buoyancy in the beef sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is scarcity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may call it scarcity if he likes.  I have given the figures in relation to slaughterings. Deputy Farrelly can ignore those or he need not do so.  I have given the trend <Col N="2076" /> and I will give more in relation to the increase in the herd in a moment.  Farmers like anybody else are prudent managers and they react to the market, and the market condition is now encouraging them to react in a way they could not and did not when there really was a crisis.</P>
      <P>The prices of calves this year have been exceptionally good and that in itself will constitute enormous incentive to farmers to retain extra breeding stock and to produce calves.  We have to keep in mind that dairy cow numbers are being cut back in other member states of the EC &mdash; in many cases much more drastically than here.  The situation here must be considered in the context of what is happening in the Community as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, accepted that an increase in the beef cow herd is a priority objective.  I accept that this is the intention in Deputy O'Keeffe's paper.  It would not be fair or reasonable to lumber him with responsibility for the failure of the past four years.  The Government and the Community are already expending a great deal of funds and effort on measures relevant to that aim.  There is already a modest but welcome increase in the beef cow herd.  In 1987 the fall in beef cow numbers was reversed for the first time in years and the beef cow herd was at its highest level since 1980.</P>
      <P>If there was occasion for a debate on the crisis in the herd it might have been in 1986, 1985, 1984 or 1983 but just when we get a reverse in the trend Fine Gael decide we now have a crisis.  They have a strange way of reacting and seem to be equipped as ever with the wrong utensils in any given climatic conditions.  It is not something that extends merely to the Leader of the party.  The lack of the appropriate utensils in any climatic conditions seems to be a feature of all the Fine Gael Party.  The same utensils were available to them for four years and they were using the forks instead of the spoons.</P>

      <P>We will dish out the spoons now and there will be enough <Col N="2077" /> for everybody.  The increase which was evident in 1987 and is still occurring is due in no small way to existing incentives but it is also due to farmers' sound business sense.  I give them full credit for seeing the market opportunities and grasping them.  Market demand for beef is clearly improving and is likely to improve a good deal more over the next few years.  Irish farmers have seen this and are beginning to act accordingly. They are not helpless children who need to be told what to do and paid to do it at every hand's turn.  That day is over.  They are enterprise managers and there is no point in giving the impression that every time there is a problem or an opportunity the taxpayer, through the Government, dishes out money.  That is not the way it will be.  The market, subject to good Government management, will determine the conditions.  Deputy O'Keeffe would not, of course, intend to suggest that farmers are children who need to be looked after but there are elements in his paper to which he referred at great length which seem to follow the traditional approach that every problem can be solved by throwing more money at it.  I had thought all Members of this House had recognised that this is not possible or desirable.</P>

Deputies will be aware, and it is recognised in Deputy O'Keeffe's document, that the State is not alone in having an interest in expanding beef numbers and production.  Farmers themselves have a contribution to make, while the agri-business and banking sectors also have a part to play.  I support the suggestion made by Deputy O'Keeffe that the banks have a role to play since they derive much of their profit from the agricultural sector.  I have publicly called on the banking sector to make a major contribution through interest rate reductions to increasing the level of the beef cow herd.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that some of those with major vested interests in expansion have failed to contribute the funds expected from them to meet the cost of the scheme I proposed to maintain the national cow herd some time ago.  It depended on the agreement of all concerned &mdash; the meat industry, the banks, the farmers.  Another factor was that the Government could not put in a single red halfpenny because of European Community conditions.  The Commission would not have it as a national aid.  Those who agreed in principle actually refused to put up the funds to give the plan effect. At the end of the day they said we should go around and collect the money from the factories in the meat industry.  If they were not even ready or capable of collecting the funds, I do not suppose I could be blamed for their disposition.  The only regret I have is that this did not emerge more clearly at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made an announcement on the basis of what had been pledged because I tend to take people at their word.  That is all over and because of the difficulties encountered in settling appropriate arrangements for the funding I have decided now to abandon that scheme.  I do not believe in hanging around waiting for agreement between the various parties.  Even though that <Col N="2079" /> scheme is not now possible, I will continue to encourage the financial institutions, the meat factories and others involved to follow their own best interests in giving real support to the expansion of beef cow numbers.  They must demonstrate their interest by their practical decision-making.  I have already initiated an examination within my Department of other options.  This morning at Government we discussed on a preliminary basis a variety of these options and I will be coming back to Government on matters within my authority and competence, having regard to constraints within the Community, with issues that do not depend on agreement from any other sector.  The constraints I am faced with at both national and Community level are well known but I am hopeful that within those constraints I can find ways of operating existing schemes in a way that will increase their contribution to the expansion effort.</P>
      <P>The document produced by Deputy O'Keeffe contains little new.  It is mainly an assembly of ideas which have surfaced over the past year or so but there was no sign of them during the previous four years when they were badly needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody told my predecessor from the Fine Gael benches about all the brilliant ideas which Deputy O'Keeffe believes started with himself. Each has its own merits and difficulties but I do not think the factors are changed much by stringing the various ideas together and baptising them as an &ldquo;action plan&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, anyone with calves to sell is likely to get, and I stress this, a record price for them judging by recent market levels.  Feed supplies are plentiful and cheap, unlike the pattern during the past four years.  Cattle producers like everyone else are aware that the prospects for beef sales in EC member states look promising now and well into the nineties. A very important point, which I think <Col N="2080" /> every farmer in this country recognises as the most important change this year and last year over the previous four years, is that interest rates are coming down as the Government's drive to restore the financial health of our economy bears fruit and the rate of inflation is being held at a very low level.  Some of the things Deputy O'Keeffe was suggesting would go very contrary to maintaining, much less improving, that welcome trend in the reduction of interest rates.  He wants to throw more money around.  Of course, if that happened I would not be surprised if teachers and nurses say they want more money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All in all, it is not surprising that the fall in our beef cow numbers was reversed last year for the first time and that the 1987 beef cow numbers were the highest since 1980.  I want that process accelerated in the national interest and in the interests of the producers themselves.</P>

      <P>That is why &mdash; and I want to refer to some practical things now &mdash; I encouraged ACOT to give top priority in their advisory work to expanding the beef cow herd.  In this regard, I am pleased to say that I had the privilege of launching ACOT's 1988 suckling campaign on 1 March.  The purpose of this year's campaign is to accelerate the <Col N="2081" /> momentum achieved during the 1987 campaign when the decline in suckler cow numbers in previous years was reversed. Speaking at the launch, the Director of ACOT said that the campaign was being launched against the background of a dramatic increase in calf prices in recent months which had increased the profitability of suckling relative to other cattle systems all over the country.  He commented on the fact that for the first time ever, suckling was now competitive with other cattle systems in the non-disadvantaged areas and would become ever more competitive over the coming years.  He added that in the disadvantaged areas where subsidies are higher, suckling is now unquestionably the most profitable system and is capable of yielding a profit of at least £50 per acre greater than other cattle systems.  That is the reality and for that reason I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating ACOT on their efforts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe, I presume you had an uninterrupted audience yourself.  Apart from the requirements of Standing Orders, the Minister should not be interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that with your experience in the House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I would like to think you are aware of my conduct in the House, you can base your presumption confidently because in fact that is what happened. Deputy O'Keeffe was uninterrupted for 40 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the House an appreciation of the positive approach taken and <Col N="2082" /> the encouraging results achieved to date. The objective of the campaign is twofold, namely to expand suckler cow numbers to counter the drop in the dairy herd and also to increase the use of continental sires in order to improve beef quality.  In other words, the objective has both a quantitative and a qualitative emphasis. The principal target groups of farmers identified by ACOT were as follows: existing suckler cow owners; dairy farmers participating in the milk cessation scheme; and farmers setting up new suckler herds.</P>
    <P>As a result of last year's experience, it has been possible to be more selective in identifying the target groups with potential for development and these now comprise 6,000 existing suckler herd owners, some 2,000 cessation scheme participants and up to 2,000 new suckler herd owners.</P>
    <P>Obviously ACOT are using every means at their disposal to get the message across to cattle farmers that suckling is the best means to protect their future income.  In addition to comprehensive farm visits to each of the 10,000 farmers identified as having strong potential to expand numbers which are now taking place, an intensive advisory programme involving a network of farmer meetings, courses, farm walks and demonstrations and the issue of special brochures has been undertaken in each ACOT District. Some 300 local meetings at separate locations throughout the country have been arranged and these should generate considerable farmer interest in suckling. Deputies will be aware of the intensive promotional programme by ACOT on press and radio at local and national level. This media coverage will continue at specific periods throughout the year and will be beamed at all farmers and impact on a much wider band of herd owners than the main target group of 10,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>What is expected from this?  The results the campaign is expected to achieve will be an additional 20,000 cows in existing suckler herds in 1988, which would be the biggest increase since 1984.  The year 1987 saw the biggest increase since 1980 and I have no doubt that we will, with those additional cows, have the biggest <Col N="2083" /> increase since 1974.  Also, another 20,000 or 80 per cent of the cows in participating herds in the cessation scheme have either been retained for suckling or sold to dairy farmers and have thus been saved from slaughter, as the figures I originally gave demonstrated, which is a significant achievement in itself.</P>
    <P>These are most encouraging results in terms of numbers and I am glad to say that the expansion was not achieved at the expense of quality.  There was in fact a substantial increase in the use of continental bulls and this augurs well for the future quality of Irish beef.  More than half the suckler herd were bred to continentals and it is ACOT's aim to increase this to 70 per cent.  I have no doubt that the efforts of ACOT, coupled with the incentives available to farmers by way of grants, will lead to further expansion of the suckler herd in the future, that the welcome reversal we saw last year, which has been even more evident in the first three months of this year, will be maintained and that we will not see the continuing decline we saw during the four years our predecessors were in Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of grants, I should like to refer to a few points because there are some inaccuracies in the Fine Gael document.  I acknowledge that Deputy O'Keeffe put a lot of thought and effort into that document, and perhaps if my predecessor put as much thought and effort into it when he had an opportunity of doing something about it, we might not have seen the crisis I inherited at this point.  A farmer keeping beef cows in the disadvantaged areas receives more than the £110-£114 per cow and calf referred to in that document.  Indeed, between the two headage and three premium schemes operating in the disadvantaged areas a farmer can receive as much as £148.80 on a cow-calf unit in the more severely handicapped areas and £129.60 on a cow-calf unit in the less severely handicapped areas where the calf is a male.  These totals comprise £70 beef cow grant, £19.20 headage grant on the calf in the more severely handicapped areas, £36.80 <Col N="2084" /> suckler cow premium, £7.60 calf premium and £15.20 special beef premium on a male calf over nine months old. Understandably, I suggest that this wide range of grants should help to increase cow numbers in the disadvantaged areas in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might well ask: if that is the case, why have these grants not increased numbers in the past if I expect them to do so in the future?  The reasons they have not done so are fairly obvious: the £70 payment rate was not introduced until 1986, the £36.80 suckler cow premium rate until 1987, and no special beef premium at all was paid up to 1987. Because of the long production cycle it takes time for every set of measures to take effect, and it is no different with these grants.  However, with our budgetary problems well under control and interest rates falling, there is a new confidence in the economy and in farmers who now have incentives where previously there were disincentives and we can expect to see a sustained response to these incentives in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I have not time now to refer to the whole range of grants to which I intended to refer.  I will just assure the House that there are some very reassuring trends in grants and incentives.  I recognise the critical importance of this issue not just to the primary producer but also to the economy generally.  Calf mortality must be reduced and we have programmes directed at that.  A short while ago I launched a programme for embryo transfer, a joint venture programme between University College Dublin and Mastock. I have no doubt that the impact of this new element in technology will have a major effect on the nature and level of calf fertility.  We have to ensure also that we control our disease levels.  The beef TB scheme that Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned has been put in place and if it has the desired effects it, too, will reduce mortality.</P>
    <P>All of these are contributory factors.  I understand the points Deputy O'Keeffe made but no Government has the total <Col N="2085" /> responsibility.  They have a responsibility to create a suitable climate but those who have an immediate vested interest have a responsibility.  I will continue to promote every opportunity at national and Community level.</P>
    <P>That said, let me make a final point which I cannot do in detail now.  There are European Community constraints on national aid, and some of the points made by the Deputy in his document would not be acceptable to the Commission.  For that reason it is not realistic to put them forward as proposals that can be implemented.  In Opposition one can say certain things should be done but in Government one has the responsibility of actually implementing them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;recognising the emerging crisis facing the beef industry, urges the Government to (i) increase the stock relief from 110 per cent to 150 per cent for additional beef cows retained, (ii) extend the Business Expansion Scheme to cover beef cow enterprises and (iii) to increase the off-farm income limit to qualify for headage payments in the disadvantaged areas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Fine Gael document attempt to tackle a crisis which the Minister says is not there but they are very involved and, to a certain extent fragmented. The Minister says there is no crisis but, nevertheless, he has personally and through his Department made numerous efforts to bring in a scheme to avert a crisis which is there and was there when he came into office in 1987.  It would be incorrect to pretend here tonight that the document produced by Fine Gael has been produced in response to that crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is quite deft with figures and in answering most arguments with statistics.  The increase in the beef cow population is very small in comparison <Col N="2086" /> with the decrease in the dairy cow population. Therefore, the overall decrease needs to be addressed.  Last year the Minister's own Department admitted that there was a potential loss of £300 million facing the beef industry if something was not done to arrest the slide in the general breeding herd, both beef and dairy.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats, while recognising the problems, have tabled a number of amendments to this motion. The Government's failure to develop indigenous industries like beef processing contrasts sadly with all the special grants that are available to attract people to the Custom House Docks site in Dublin which will have a minimal employment content.  On the other hand, we seem to have shut our eyes to the industry we say contributes so much to the economy.  At a time when it most requires a stimulus from the Government, none is forthcoming. That stimulus should have begun in 1984, when it became apparent that quotas were here to stay and would only bite deeper as time went on.  Nothing was done, but the Minister, late as it was, could have done something about it 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister now intends to bring another scheme forward which will not depend on outside agencies and organisations for its implementation. This is the proper way to go about it and the way it should have been done from the beginning.  That this was not done is an indication of the lack of understanding of the potential of the beef industry with its vast potential for downstream jobs through added value, vacuum packing and all the other possibilities that have opened up to us in the past few years.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised by all sectors of the agricultural industry that a beef herd incentive scheme is vital to counteract the loss of cows in the dairy herd resulting from the EC cutbacks.  In fact, the Minister for Agriculture and Food in reply to a question from Deputy Deasy on 24 February said that following recent discussions with interested parties the technical aspects of the scheme for maintaining the national beef cow herd, <Col N="2087" /> including the financing of it, had been largely settled.  It is most disconcerting for the industry and particularly for the confidence of farmers in this sector to find that these undertakings, given in good faith, are now worthless.  Even the scheme, as it was proposed, was a paltry one, offering £50 compensation over two years for the retention of beef animals. It shows a lack of understanding of the problem to suggest that one should take the risk of providing the capital for beef animals retained in a herd for a proposed £25 per year to be paid at the end of two years.  It is laughable.  If it were offered as a pay increase or incentive to anybody in the workplace in any other industry or sector of society it would be laughed out of court.</P>
    <P>This proposal was doomed to failure. The scheme was not properly thought out; it was derisory in its effort to provide the necessary incentive.  There is a smaller breeding herd now than there was in 1972.  This is critical because it cannot be changed with the stroke of a pen or even by an overnight scheme.  There is at least three years involved from the inception to the time when animals are ready for slaughter and that is a minimum time.  It is obvious now that some meat factories are actually holding back on their development plans and proposals because they understand quite well that the raw materials supply is going to be critical.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the level of Government support to the processing facilities for job creation, it is very hard to understand why no such support was given to the beef production industry.  It is a sad reflection in the face of all the hype that the actual headage provision for tackling the disadvantaged area this year has been reduced in the budget allocation by £2.3 million.  The disadvantaged area indeed could play a very significant role in the retention and building up of the beef herd if proper incentives were given.</P>
    <P>It may interest the House to know that the average payment for headage grants per farmer in the disadvantaged and western package area was £600 per <Col N="2088" /> farmer last year.  This suggests a very low level of activity and totally excludes any person who, by way of their own industry, may have an off-farm job or income paying more than £100 per week.  In the period since 1984 the number of dairy cows has fallen by 115,000 and this number is set to fall by a further 200,000 by 1992 as farmers cull more cows in the face of EC restrictions.  This is happening against the background of the dairy herd being the backbone of the beef herd.</P>
    <P>With higher milk yields and an onslaught on TB, for which I congratulate the Minister, there is no doubt about it but the dairy herd is set to fall significantly as a result.  That is why it is so vital to get a special beef scheme going but as I have said, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, nothing has been heard of this scheme since 24 February in the Dáil.  Indeed the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Minister's own Department last year, when introducing the beef scheme stated that there was a difficulty in relation to the losses which could be expected if such a scheme were not put into action and that £300 million would be lost to the beef industry if immediate steps were not taken to counteract the loss of calves due to the reduction of the dairy herd.</P>
    <P>Up to now the real crisis facing the beef industry has been masked by the level of cattle imports from the North, the high level of slaughtering of cull cows and surplus cows and heifers from the dairy herd and the overall reduction in cattle numbers.  However, this once-off situation cannot be maintained and without real incentives for farmers to retain more beef cattle, a major crisis will envelop the beef industry now.  We have heard of many proposals to extend headage payments to non-disadvantaged areas; we have heard of schemes and proposals to extend the disadvantaged areas to the whole country, but at this point in time we still await the green light from Brussels even to make such a submission and realistically speaking there will be no extension of boundaries in the EC disadvantaged area for at least three years even if it happens then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> There is a proposal before the Commission to have modulated payment of headage grants in the less severely handicapped areas but this area is comparatively small in relation to the entire country and in relation to the beef producing areas.  This is not a farmers' problem and it is not essentially an agricultural problem.  There are far more off-farm jobs involved in the beef industry than there are in the rearing of beef and the provision of raw material for the processing factories and the difficulty which will arise in the country will greatly affect the capital investment which the Government are making in processing plants and will certainly affect the job prospects as announced in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I am reliably informed that many beef processors at present have put plans for expansion into cold storage until they see what the Government's response will be to this national crisis.  In Europe, the number of all classes of beef cattle, are down, the biggest drop being for beef cattle over two years of age.  This indicates a tremendous opportunity for Ireland in the beef industry which it will now not be able to take full advantage of because of the lack of raw material.  This is also reflected in the growing scarcity of calves and the high prices which they can make and as, a quick turnover is needed when the investment is high, and since the introduction of the ban in hormone implants in cattle, it is necessary to sell them at lighter weights.</P>
    <P>All the information on cattle numbers adds up to a significant fall in output of prime beef in the EC for the next couple of years.  Cow slaughterings have been heaviest on intensive dairy farms which make little use of grass and rely on cheap, bought in feed.  This gives Ireland a distinct advantage because on many farms the stocking rate is not as high as in Europe and there is a far greater use made of grassland feeding.  In this way there is a possibility of keeping surplus cows to dairy requirements for breeding and multiple suckling.  This is certainly a logical development for most Irish dairy farmers where the land is more suitable <Col N="2090" /> for grassland since changing to other classes of stock to replace cows would require major investment.</P>
    <P>There are many options open to the Minister besides trying to get going with totally inadequate schemes.  There are many options open to the Minister which will be of little or no cost to the economy or to the Exchequer which could and should be better explored.  There are many options open within the context of the EC.  Among the options which we would suggest to the Minister are the possibility of increasing the value of the EC special beef premium from £14.70 for 50 cattle up to £42 for 100 cattle which would be part of the price negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Further, under the provisions of the new western package it is proposed to increase the EC headage contributions by 70 per cent to 75 per cent.  I contend that the Government should not seek to dilute their contribution but rather maximise the headage payments in order to increase the breeding stock.  Also, it is open to the Minister to renegotiate the special beef retention scheme headage payment from £36 to £60 per animal at no extra cost to the Irish Exchequer and he should also seek the extension of this scheme to mixed herds of beef cows and dairy cows as it is becoming more apparent now that the expansion of the beef herd will depend very much on the retention of excess dairy cows on dairy farms for beef cow purposes.</P>
    <P>We, the Progressive Democrats, wish to propose amendments which are of no particular cost to the Exchequer save the one in which we are asking the Government to adjust the off-farm income in the disadvantaged areas for qualification for headage payments.  When one considers that the average headage payment in the disadvantaged areas last year was £600 approximately, one can see the extent of the average income of many of the small farmers in the west and to seek to penalise those who might have to seek off-farm income to support their families by precluding them from the disadvantaged areas headage payment is not alone <Col N="2091" /> unjust but highly counterproductive and it is no wonder that rural Ireland is losing its population when we have a total dole mentality to many of the production incentives which are in place.</P>
    <P>We are also proposing an extension of the stock relief from 110 per cent to 150 per cent in the case of additional animals which would be retained in the beef cow herd system.  As it is, these animals would have to be retained and their offspring for a number of years before any money could be made out of them.  At the same time, under accountancy procedures they would be shown up as a paper profit and income tax would have to be paid on them as such.  We are suggesting that if the stock relief was extended to 150 per cent for beef cows, then the claw-back would come for the Department of Finance when the animals were sold.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are elements of the business expansion scheme which could be applied to the expansion of the beef cow herd and in particular I relate to situations whereby investments made in beef cow operations would enjoy the same type of tax benefits as are available to others in the commercial sector.  It is clear that there are many options open to the Minister which would cost very little in terms of Exchequer contribution and which would reap tremendous rewards for this country in terms of a viable beef industry.  Beef has certainly the most exciting possibility for this country and it would be a pity and a downright shame if we could not achieve that possibility by now having the raw material available.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister as a matter of extreme urgency to call together the interested parties again and also his colleagues around the Cabinet table and impress on them the urgency of immediate action and the cost-saving exercises in terms of Exchequer funding with the proper plan and the proper scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion put down by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  It is regrettable for a number of reasons that we are here tonight discussing this <Col N="2092" /> motion.  The main reason is the collapse of a proposal to secure increased numbers for the beef industry which was announced on three occasions over the past six or eight months by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  Unfortunately, it is quite evident that the background work on the proposal was insufficient to ensure that the scheme, when introduced, would be operational. It was very easy for the Minister to state yesterday evening when he had abandoned the scheme that the meat industry and the factories involved had let him down.  Had I been involved in negotiations with those people I would have said that, long before the proposals were agreed, the industry should have acknowledged that with the capacity we have in the State there needed to be a total package in the region of £15 million to £20 million made available from the beef industry, the processors and the farmers in addition to some help from the State. The State help could have been organised, and still can be organised through the good offices of Brussels, under our proposals for agricultural aid which we should be getting.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister tonight he appears to suggest that we, as a party, are totally to blame for the crisis which it is claimed exists in the beef industry.  The Minister referred to the years 1984, 1985 and 1986.  I could not allow the references to previous years to pass without stating how the circumstances arose in 1984-86. It is quite evident that there was a dramatic decline in beef numbers in the years 1980-86.  The reason for this decline was that Irish farmers borrowed money over the previous ten years to develop and expand their enterprises when we joined Europe and they could not make the repayments on those borrowings to the financial institutions.  The Minister went back a number of years but we have to go to the root of the problem and then pose the question.  The farmers could not make their repayments due to policies introduced and pursued by the then Government, of which the Minister was a member.  He left and went to Brussels when the problem became too difficult.</P>

      <Col N="2093" /> We cannot allow this debate to pass without making those comments when we recall, as I am sure the Minister of State will recall vividly, that interest rates were then 18 or 19 per cent and inflation was running at 20 or 21 per cent.  Thousands and thousands of farmers right across the country had to sell their breeding stock because of their inability to repay their borrowings which had been taken out at a rate of interest of 11 or 12 per cent in the years the Minister forgot to mention.  I am not at all surprised that the Minister has forgotten to mention those particular years because he would rather forget them.</P>

      <P>I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not have realised how serious the problem was.  It is hard to listen to it, but we have to put on the record of the House why there is still a problem and where that problem arose. The Minister went to great lengths to tell us that it arose when we were in Government.  That is the root of the problem, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and you <Col N="2094" /> have to get to the root of the problem if you want to cure it.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that calves were never as dear in this country as they are at present.  We all accept that, but can the Minister come into this House and say honestly that the beef producers can afford to pay the prices calves are making and subsequently make a profit on their beef units?  We all know they cannot because the animals are 30 per cent more expensive than they should be.  Even the farmers selling them realise that.  It is not fair to compliment people on the record prices they are getting for calves because the people who are getting those record prices are not very interested in the beef industry as they do not depend on it.  However I think the two are very much related.  The farming community, and we as a nation, are inclined to think of them as separate industries and that each looks after his own.</P>
      <P>I honestly believe that the proposals put forward by our spokesman in the discussion document <i>Securing a Future for the Beef Industry</i> are worth considering. If we take into consideration that the majority, if not all, of the finance for the State subsidy could be recouped from Brussels I do not believe there is anything wrong with the suggestion that we as a party are making to the Government that we should be looking for extra badly needed finance to help our producers, many of whom can produce nothing other than stores for the beef industry.  I do not believe that we should only have a policy for developing processing in the beef industry.  It should be a two-pronged effort, I do not disagree with further investment in processing because I believe all animals should be processed and sold abroad as a prepacked product ready for the housewife. It is recognised by everybody &mdash; and in fairness it is recognised by the processors, regardless of what the Minister says &mdash; that there is a crisis in the industry and we need an extra incentive because of the costs involved in producing the animals for the beef units throughout the country.</P>

      <Col N="2095" /> The Minister mentioned very elaborate figures of the decrease in the number of cows slaughtered in the last 12 months.  Perhaps he has not realised since taking up office that there was large curtailment on milk production because of the introduction of the super levy.  Last year would not be a year on which to judge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of giving bona fide restaurants facilities to provide drink with a meal is one with which I can readily agree.  However, I do not want to see this exercise develop to a stage where in issuing special restaurant licences we are creating another pub.  That is my dilemma with regard to that aspect of this new legislation.  The Irish publican, and especially the rural publicans has for generations played an important part in Irish life.  Many of these public houses are family concerns and the purchase and development of these premises have cost those people dearly.  After all their expenditure and years of providing a service, with all that it entails in terms of long, unsociable working hours, it would strike me as being a grave injustice if other pubs could materialise on their doorsteps in the guise of licensed restaurants. This injustice would be compounded by allowing the new pub to come into being for what I consider the paltry sum of £3,000.  This proposed initial fee should be substantially higher. I fully realise that the Minister, in putting together this legislation, has included control mechanisms geared to prevent such abuses and irregularities, but it is the question of the actual implementation of these controls that fuels my apprehension. Perhaps on Committee Stage there will be an opportunity to elaborate further on this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2096" /> In Part III of the Bill the Minister is introducing some welcome innovations in the area of prohibited hours.  In the past year or so there has been much speculation and diverse suggestions by interested groups on the extent to which hours of business should be increased. There have been suggestions that any increase in these hours should vary in accordance with the location of the premises, that is, whether they are in holiday resort areas and so forth.  In this regard the Minister, in his quest for and commitment to achieving some level of uniformity in closing times, has got this one right.  He proposes to let the <i>status quo</i> obtain in the period from Monday to Saturday and also to continue with the winter-summer situation, with one important alteration, in the area of drinking-up time, which he has increased to a half-hour instead of the ludicrous ten minutes which currently obtains.  This will bring about a far more acceptable situation at closing time for both drinker and vendor.  There currently exists a practice of purchasing and stocking up drinks immediately prior to closing time.  The efforts of publicans to clear the premises in the ten minute period can be both futile and irritating.  The extension of Sunday opening hours from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. is also a very sensible move.  It can be exasperating for people, particularly in summer and at holiday time, to be ousted from their drinking place at 10 o'clock on Sunday night.  Any publican will confirm that Sunday night is the most difficult time to effect a clearance of the premises.</P>
    <P>Among the many positive aspects of this legislation is the proposal to improve the situation with regard to the running of clubs.  This is an area in which there exists and has existed gross abuse.  Some clubs are, in effect, running their bars in the same way as do pubs.  The only difference is that they are afforded far greater leeway with regard to inspection and control.  Sections 40 to 42, inclusive, of this legislation herald major improvements in this entire area.  Henceforth clubs will be subject to the same level of Garda inspection and control as licensed premises.  Up to this time pubs which <Col N="2097" /> operated in other than a proper and legal manner openly flouted the law in the secure knowledge that there was little danger of their being apprehended or penalised.  Local residents, and particularly local business people, were loth to tender objections.  The Minister's introduction of the provision to allow any person, that is persons other than those resident in the particular parish, to lodge objections to the renewal of club certificates on any of the grounds of objection specified will introduce a measure of control which is sadly and amazingly absent at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on sections 30 to 39, inclusive, which deal with provisions relating to persons under the age of 18.  The previous speaker, Deputy McCartan, was loud in his condemnation of the peddlers of alcoholic drinks to under-age people and I, I am sure like all other Deputies, will likewise condemn that despicable practice.  This is a serious and complex problem and, it would appear, a growing one.  While we must provide appropriate and adequate legislation in this regard, one could legislate until the cows come home without making substantial improvements in the situation unless the problem is tackled in a number of other areas.  Education on alcohol and making the child aware of the implications of drinking is the crucial requirement.  This must be tackled primarily in the home and the schools and, indeed, all adult members of the community have a role and a responsibility in this.</P>
    <P>I believe that the vast majority of people and, in the context of this legislation, the vast majority in the business of selling alcoholic drinks, are responsible. In particular, most publicans want to run their premises in a proper and honourable manner.  Most are parents themselves and know only too well their responsibilities in this regard.  However, as in all trades and professions, there exists a minority of unscrupulous cowboy operators who will not take the responsible approach.  It is the responsible and honourable publican that I have in mind when I question the proposal of removing <Col N="2098" /> the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from this legislation. Here I would take issue with Deputy McCartan.  This change is putting a huge onus and responsibility on the genuine publican, particularly if it is done without the simultaneous introduction of some kind of identification mechanism. I am not all that convinced about the potential success of an ID system and have my own reservations about its effectiveness. However, in my constituency at present a pilot scheme is being launched in the town of Arklow and I shall be watching this with great interest.  We are putting a major, and perhaps an unjustifiably heavy, onus on the genuine publican by removing that important terminology without introducing some ID system or other substitute.</P>
    <P>There is a change with regard to the admission of children to licensed premises. There is varied opinion as to the propriety or otherwise of this change.  As a parent and as a member of the licensed trade I agree that it can be a good thing to allow children to be present from time to time in licensed premises, in the company of their parents.  It helps if children are exposed to the dangers.  Know thine enemy is the key phrase.  There is a certain mystique and a macho image attached to drinking.  If children are introduced in a controlled, orderly and responsible fashion in the company of their parents to drink, it will help to remove that mystique and the erroneous concept that can lead them into serious and sometimes fatal situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister's careful research and his communication with relevant parties in preparing this legislation has resulted in his achieving a well balanced Bill which will substantially improve things for both the publican and the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like every other Deputy in the House, welcome this Bill.  While some of us have reservations about the Bill, the Minister has brought forward legislation which has been requested for a considerable length of time and which seeks to achieve a balance between the expressed fears of a <Col N="2099" /> number of organisations and the needs of the trade.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of under-age drinking I commend the Minister for taking on board many of the suggestions made by interested organisations and by Deputies and Senators.  The Minister has made an honest effort to control a problem which has been increasingly difficult to control and which has caused alarm to parents, teachers and organisations set up to deal with under-age drinking.  I was a member of the committee of the House which met a delegation from County Mayo on this question.  This delegation was formed by interested people, both lay and clerical from all over the county, people who had strong reservations about what was happening in the county.  What is happening in Mayo is mirrored to a greater or lesser extent in other counties. This Bill makes a reasonable effort to come to grips with the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>Apart from the legislation, parents have a tremendous responsibility in this area.  Parents have the first obligation. They should know where their children are, they should be happy with the company they are keeping and with the places to which they go.  If the public know there are abuses by any publicans they should inform the Garda.  A number of schools at this time of year hold graduation dances and the school authorities owe it to their pupils to ensure that only minerals or soft drinks are available at such functions.  I am glad that a number of schools in my county have adopted that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of extensions is one on which there has been a considerable amount of correspondence with the Minister, and on which the Minister has consulted with many groups.  It is curious that people who have no affiliations with a club or a political party or with a charitable organisation will attend a function run by a club or party if they know there is an extension.  The Minister should have another look at the whole question of special exemptions and it should be mandatory that a proper meal be served, <Col N="2100" /> not like what has been happening over the last number of years where as someone described it, what was offered was a meal comprising a bit of lettuce and some see-through ham.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having grown up in a public house I know of the problems a publican has in trying to clear the house in ten minutes. It is not physically possible to do so. Therefore, I am glad that the Minister proposes to give a reasonable amount of time to the publican to clear the house. Most publicans should be able to do so within 30 minutes and the excuse, legitimate let me add, which was usually given to a garda who came on the premises at ten minutes past or 15 minutes past 11, taking closing time as being 11 p.m., that they could not clear the premises should no longer be accepted from now on.  As I have said, the Minister has been very reasonable in the amount of time he has proposed for a publican to clear his premises.</P>
    <P>Some people will probably quibble with the provision in the Bill which will not allow a 15½ year old person to clear up glasses.  Members of the family of a publican have up until now, particularly at busy times, helped to clear up glasses but under this Bill it will be an offence for someone under the age of 16 years to do so.  Even if the Minister suggested the age of 17 someone would still say that that is too young but on balance I think he has come up with welcome changes in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of organisations have said that the extension of opening hours will lead to an increase in drinking but I do not believe it will.  Particularly in recent years people have been going into public houses later and I think that the extension of the opening hours will give publicans, particularly at the better known holiday resorts along the western coast a chance to carry on a reasonable trade up to a reasonable hour.  It is very important that the legislation should be enforced and it should not be the case that the extra half hour would be used as an extension.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the general <Col N="2101" /> public interest must of course be paramount and that, accordingly, he trusts he will receive a considerable measure of agreement from all concerned for his proposals. In fairness, the Minister has achieved a reasonable balance.  Many people will agree with him but of course those who would like to see the opening hours restricted and those who would like to see them extended would disagree with him.</P>
    <P>One of the sections of the Bill which has given rise to a fair amount of controversy is the section that deals with the purchase of restaurant licences.  The Vintners Federation have said that there are enough licences in the country and that these should be sold prior to any others being granted.  I have no objection to these licences being granted. However, it is important that those who purchase the new restaurant licences would be subject to the same restrictions as the ordinary publican.</P>
    <P>Some people will probably see the abolition of the so-called &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; as a bad thing.  In many cases I do not think people left licensed premises at all during that hour and therefore I do not think it will make any real difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Some varying views have been expressed on this point.  As I have said, the Minister, having weighed up all the arguments from the pro and antilobbies has come up with a reasonable compromise.  Probably there are many things which one could quibble with and there are a number of things which I certainly could quibble with but, as I have stated, because of the efforts which the Minister has made, particularly in regard to under age drinking, I think there will be a general acceptance of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Minister is now proposing making it an offence for a person under the age of 18 to purchase intoxicating liquor.  This is a step in the right direction.  One of the biggest lobbies against teenage drinking in County Mayo stressed to me that not only should the publican be fined but also the person who <Col N="2102" /> pretends to be 18 or over.  This provision will be welcomed by many people because it will place an onus on the young person himself and it will help the publican in many cases, particularly in city areas, who has the problem of trying to decide whether a person is under or over 18 years of age.  At a time when modes of dress have changed considerably it is very hard to know whether a young person is under or over 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated for grasping the nettle because, quite frankly, the Intoxicating Liquor Acts have been lying dormant for a considerable length of time.  As he said in his speech, the last major piece of legislation to be introduced in this area was the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962.  Many values have changed since then and the time is now ripe for a review of the legislation. I do not want to go over any of the points which have been dealt with in detail by the Minister and the various other spokespersons but I think the Minister is to be congratulated for coming forward with a reasonable compromise.  If he were to look again at the question in regard to special exemptions I think the vast number of people in the country would be satisfied with this legislation.  While the licensed trade will probably find some sections of this Bill that they will not like, the anti-drink lobby will also find sections that they will not like.  It is the Minister's job to come up with a compromise that is workable and just.  He has done that and he should be congratulated on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking this legislation at face value, I see many sections in it that I agree with.  I would describe it as a theme with variations.  Far from tackling the dreadful scourge of under-age drinking it is likely to increase the many casualties which unfortunately occur in the late teens.  I agree with the requirement that no drink should be served to people under 18 years but does anybody here really believe that it will be implemented?  Has it ever been implemented in this country, a country that takes a very ambiguous approach to <Col N="2103" /> the question of drinking?  The problem of under-age drinking is now out of control. The next generation will reap the whirlwind of the wind sown by the seduction of children by breweries in the last 20 years.  There is no doubt that the young people of Ireland have been singled out as the target area for the profits of breweries. One has only to go into a public house any evening of the week to see that the people there are not middle aged or elderly but young people, people of very tender ages.  Publicans have been very successful in their targeting of the young people as the people who have the money and are prepared to spend it.</P>
      <P>Drink has been glamorised out of all proportion.  It has been done by the programme of seductive advertising on television.  Continual advertising is beamed directly into the homes of young people day after day.  They cannot escape it.  From the formative years of eight, nine or ten, they see the advertisements, they are indoctrinated and they believe that is the thing to do.  More and more young people are now crowding into the public houses with very tragic consequences for society in general and for many unfortunate individuals in particular who fall victim to the scourge of drink.  We, in Ireland, are particularly susceptible to the scourge of drink.  Whatever is in the Irish make-up it makes us particularly susceptible to drink.  Maybe it is in the Celtic race but certainly the figures for alcoholism in this country are great.  The breweries have won the battle. They have targeted a vulnerable and soft sector, a sector that undoubtedly has money to spend.  Many of them are not burdened with mortgages or family commitments. They are spending their money freely and gaily every weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have turned a blind eye to what is happening. I have to indict the Catholic Church who for years were the bulwark in the fight against alcoholism but who have been very silent in recent years.  Many people have opted out of the Pioneer movement and that body has weakened as a result of neglect over the years.  Recently the <Col N="2104" /> Catholic Church have recognised the problem but it did not materialise overnight. It has been many years agrowing and was clearly chronicled in the last 20 years.  The rise in the numbers of under-age drinkers was apparent a long way down the line and nothing was done to stop it.  Many unmarried mothers, who constitute a large number of people in this country at present, get into their predicament after a visit to the local pub or hotel as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The other area I would like to address is the extension of opening hours for an extra hour on Sunday nights.  I would pose the question, will this make for an increase in Monday absenteeism.  We are actually giving an extra hour and a half for drinking, bringing the closing time very close to midnight.  We all know there is a high level of absenteeism, particularly on Mondays, and that is likely to increase now.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a need to grant licences to responsible restaurants.  We have to cater for the tourist trade.  We have to bring ourselves into line with what pertains on the Continent and provide facilities, particularly in the summer season, so that people can avail of the benefits of having a meal and a drink together.  That situation should be carefully monitored because otherwise eventually fish and chip outlets in vans will be queueing up in the future for licences to sell liquor.</P>
    <P>I would like to put in a plea for the hapless owners of ballrooms which are now lying dormant.  These were an integral part of rural life and they were suddenly blitzed by the appearance on the scene of hotels who have the opportunity of selling drinks.  These ballrooms are now closed and this was a great disaster to many of their owners.  They are entitled to the same slice of the cake as hotels.  The closure of these ballrooms has hit employment in the dance industry which has been swamped by the disco scene.  There is a genuine case for equal treatment for ballrooms in every part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I note that the Government have abolished the age limit at which children can <Col N="2105" /> be admitted to a public house and some of the reasons given are ludicrous.  The Minister suggests that children should be allowed to stay in a public house while they or their parents are waiting for a bus or waiting to go to the dentist.  That is a ludicrous statement and he should come clean and not introduce those ridiculous asides.</P>
    <P>In many cases the Government are leaving themselves open to a charge of false pretences by introducing this legislation ostensibly to stamp out under-age drinking.  How will the Minister implement these laws?  The Garda do not have the time nor the resources to enforce them.  We all know the Irish nation has double standards when it comes to the abuse of drink.  All over the country pubs are open until 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock or possibly 5 o'clock&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe not in Tipperary, but it happens in other counties. Pubs are open all hours of the day without the Garda doing anything to implement the law.  There is pressure on the Garda at present in fighting the high level of crime and this makes it virtually impossible for them to implement the laws.</P>
      <P>The real answer to underage drinking was found in America where they issued ID cards.  If this is successful in a vast area like America, surely, too, in a small country of 3,500,000 people such a scheme could be introduced successfully? Because of the powerful lobby of the drinks industry, the very ambiguous approach of all Governments to drinking and the tolerance level for drink in our society, that scheme has not been introduced. To me it is an obvious answer and I exhort the Minister to bring in that simple remedy to prevent young people succumbing to the dangers of drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Sir, I thank you for a marvellous reception for the Australian delegation and I congratulate you on your excellent speech at the function last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed but there <Col N="2106" /> are some areas which might have been approached from a different angle.  It is to be welcomed that restaurants will have to be licensed.  This is the only tourist area I can see where there will be potential for growth over the next few years, and it would be ridiculous to have good quality restaurants without licences.  I am sorry the fees will be minimal.  I appreciate the Minister must take into account the fact that an excellent restaurant in a rural area may get the same volume of business as a similar restaurant in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I note that there are many dead licences throughout the country and these licences could be taken over when granting licences to restaurants.  I say this because I fear that this privilege being granted to restaurants may be abused later when it will be much more difficult for the Garda Síochána to investigate compared with a pub where the abuse may be more obvious.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister has covered the waiting area, no bar and table service, but I hope the licences will be granted to restaurants of very high standard only.  I am satisfied these licences will be supervised by the Department of Justice to ensure that standards are maintained.  I am also happy to note that the local superintendent can object to the reissuing of a licence.</P>
    <P>The most important sections of this Bill deal with underage drinking.  For the past number of years, especially in urban areas, young people of 16 years of age &mdash; and under &mdash; often as young as 12 or 13 &mdash; have been drinking.  This is frightening. Most of the under-age drinking is not done in public houses.  Under-age drinking takes place at parties.  Where do these people get the drink?  Not for one moment would I say that all licence holders are responsible people, but 99 per cent are.  It is the 1 per cent I cannot and will not defend.</P>
    <P>In my view, the main suppliers are the supermarkets where the price of drink is very attractive.  In supermarkets drink is displayed to the same extent as sugar, tea, coca cola and normal household goods.  I want to complain that this Bill does not set a standard for supermarkets <Col N="2107" /> selling drink.  The young girl at the cash desk may be harassed throughout the day.  She has to watch change, know prices and so on.  If a person comes to the check point with £10, £50 or £100 worth of groceries, and bottles of drink, to her they will be just more items to be added to the grocery list.  She is not paid to take the responsibility of checking if the customer is under age.  The £50 fine proposed for selling drink to people who are underage is nothing to a supermarket.  At present, drink is sold in supermarkets when they open at 9 a.m.  The law should apply, too, to the supermarkets and licensed premises.  Alcohol should not be on sale before 10.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>Every supermarket should have a special and separate section for selling alcohol and one mature, responsible person should be in charge of that section.  This is an area about which we must be very specific.  As I said, under-age drinkers are getting their alcohol from the supermarkets because they are selling alcohol at very competitive prices to encourage people to buy other items.  I hope the Minister will introduce an appropriate amendment to see to it that supermarkets have a separate area on their premises for the sale of drink.</P>
    <P>I agree with the decision to remove the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; from the Bill.  Any publican who sells drink knowingly to a person under 18 years of age should have his licence removed and not be allowed to hold a licence again.  The premises should not be licensed again.  The penalty for such an offence should be severe.  I have a vested interest in this in that I was brought up in the licensed trade and I am the holder of a liquor licence.  I am aware that only a small number of publicans sell drink to under-age people.  Mature people like to go to a public house to have a drink and conversation with their friends and they do not want under-age drinkers on the premises.  Certainly, they do not want young people creating noise and fuss on the premises.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has made it an offence for a young person to buy intoxicating liquor and I should like to <Col N="2108" /> suggest to him that he consider introducing a provision under which parents of such young people can be prosecuted. They at least should be brought before the court to answer for the behaviour of their children.  I accept that the responsibility lies heavily with the publican but parents must share some ot it.  Judges, when dealing with such cases, should also take into account the responsibility of parents.  There is no excuse for parents who abandon responsibility for their children under 18 years of age and blame their condition on a licensee.  I accept that at times it is difficult to judge the age of a young person because, depending on their style of dress or the amount of make-up they wear, they may look at lot older.  For that reason the Minister should consider introducing an identity card system.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to think that a driving licence produced to a garda does not prove the identity of the person who produces it.  There is no photograph attached to it and when one produces a licence the garda presumes that the holder is the person to whom the licence was issued.  I could produce my grandfather's or my son's driving licence and it would not matter unless the garda asked me to produce the licence again at a local station.  Publicans must question young people about their age before serving them intoxicating liquor.  An identity card would be a help in that regard.  A system of identity cards will have to be introduced whether by parents, through the schools, local authorities or the Licensed Vintners Association.  They should be produced by young people seeking admission to discos.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that under-age people drink at discos most of which are attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people. What amazes me is that those young people can afford to pay £6 or £7 to a disco where, it is alleged, a substantial meal is served.  However, the meal turns out to be watery mash, a couple of peas, a bit of a chicken, a burger or a sausage. The substantial meal for £2 does not exist. In my view a meal is not provided for the majority of people who attend discos. <Col N="2109" /> The first 200 people may get what is termed a meal and that is only available between 10.30 and 11.30 p.m.  When discos fill up after the pubs close food is not served.  I appreciate the Minister's decision to describe a substantial meal as one costing £5.  One will get a reasonable meal for that amount of money.  Some may call it blotting paper or soakage but it will be a reasonably substantial meal. However, I doubt if it will be supplied after 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, and the public, encounter most trouble after discos have closed.  The windows are broken and the violence occurs after those events.  It is a laugh to think that the fine for an offence of being drunk and disorderly is £2.  I have written to the Minister about that fine and I have received an acknowledgement from him.  The person who takes a lot of drink can be one of two types.  He may be the type of individual who having consumed a lot of drink will fall down and, in fairness, such a person will only do harm to himself.  The second type is the individual who is violent and aggressive and gardaí may not be able for such headbangers.  Such people if prosecuted are fined £2 for being disorderly. The Minister should consider increasing that fine to at least £100.  The cost involved in arresting such people and the damage caused to squad cars and Garda stations should be taken into account when such people appear before our courts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the decision of the Minister to bring the closing hours of discos back to 1 a.m. &mdash; it appears that there was a slight error made in his speech today in regard to this.  People are being asked to pay £6 or £7 for one hour or one hour-and-a-half of entertainment at a disco.  The prices people are charged for drink at discos should be investigated by the relevant authority, £1.80 for a pint and £1.80 for a large bottle.  Those prices are ridiculously high.  I am shocked that young people have so much money to spend on discos and on drink.  There is no way a young man will go to a dance with a young girl and get away with only spending £20.  The prices at discos are <Col N="2110" /> exorbitant because they are the only places of entertainment open for young people late at night.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has extended the time for drinking up because it is very hard to swallow two pints in ten minutes at 11 o'clock.</P>

However, they may get into good company, be discussing the victory at the hurling match of the previous Sunday or the potential of the local team.

      <P>There were some rumours that the Minister had intended to impose a minimum fine of £400.  I am delighted that that fine is not statutory.

      <P>I might revert to the £2 fine for being drunk and disorderly, which is ridiculous. As you and I know, a Cheann Comhairle, there is need to have that fine reintroduced and substantially increased. This is necessary even if only in the interests of safeguarding the Garda who must put up with the hassle and violence on the part of somebody who is aggressive while drunk and who, when brought to court, is fined a mere £2.  It is just not good enough.  The fine must be much more substantial and be more rigorously imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have to discuss the issue of identity cards so that a publican when in serious doubt may demand of a young person some proof of his age.  Surely some such system can be devised.  While it is the duty of a publican to ask a person, about whom he has a serious doubt as to his age, if the companion or companions of the person involved say: yes, he is over 18 years of age, then such has to be accepted as the law obtains.  If a publican is to be prosecuted in respect of having served drink to such a person at least he should have recourse to having an identity card produced.  That would be the ideal solution, whether such an identity card be issued by a relevant students' union, local school or whoever, showing clearly that the person is over 18 years of <Col N="2112" /> age.  In such circumstances the relevant publican would be exonerated provided he had sought reasonable proof of age.</P>
    <P>I would advocate much heavier penalties in respect of those who deliberately sell drink to people under 18 years of age. We are all aware that there are publicans in all constituencies at such a low ebb of business they are prepared to sell drink to persons of any age.  I am also glad to note the prohibited licensing hours to obtain in clubs.  While it may not be popular to say so, I do not see any reason for people who are not dependent for a living on the sale of alcohol being treated more selectively or enjoying a more exclusive position than the traditional family publican. Such clubs have been selling drink until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on the basis that no garda inspector would visit them.  It must be remembered that in most Garda sub-districts there is one inspector only. However, that practice is now being changed.</P>

      <P>This has caused many problems for publicans because the temptation is that, if one does not engage in a little business after hours, one's counter-part up the road will do so and will reap the benefit.  Provided the provisions are enforced effectively and equally among all publicans I have no doubt about their acceptability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that the matter of the serving and entry age into discos would be taken seriously by the Minister and <Col N="2113" /> those who will enforce the provisions.  It is my belief that 99 per cent of publicans accept that there should be no under-age drinking and that an identity card system would be of enormous help to them in so ensuring.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend that there be a closed-off area in supermarkets with a mature, responsible person selling alcohol there, thereby obviating the possibility of under-age persons taking bottles of alcohol off shelves and taking them to the relevant cashiers.  I might reiterate that there should be identity cards devised and the fines in respect of being drunk and disorderly considerably increased to the tune of, say, between £50 and £70 so that they would actually hurt, rather than the meagre present £2 fine which represents the price of a packet of cigarettes or one-seventh of people's expenditure on smoking in any week.  It should be remembered that the Garda are finding themselves confronted more and more by such aggression, with their lives being threatened for the sake of a mere £2 fine.</P>
    <P>The latest tendency which worries many publicans is that those proprietors who do not sell alcohol to persons under the age of 18 years have found that such people come into their premises, order an orange or coke and supply their own drink, under the counter or away from the publican's view &mdash; with a naggin of vodka, whiskey, bacardi or whatever being tipped into the orange or coke.  In such circumstances I would hope there would be a reasonable understanding that, as long as the alcohol had not been supplied by the relevant publican, he would not be prosecuted.  It should be remembered that a publican cannot have his eyes on every part of his premises at all times.  I would hope that the law would not deteriorate to such an extent.  I should say that the imposition of a £50 fine on a large supermarket means nothing to them.</P>

      <P>Indeed, they would <Col N="2114" /> merely get more publicity from the imposition of a fine.  The fine for serving those who are under age should be substantially increased, to £100.  Anything else is derisory and would not deter those who sell in multiples to young people.  If a publican has two or three convictions in this regard within a certain period he should lose his licence forever because that is the only way to prevent it.</P>
      <P>Parents cannot shirk their responsibilities in regard to under-age drinking. If an under-age person is brought to court charged with buying drink, the parents or guardians should also be in court to explain to the judge their position, role, or problem.  Perhaps before Committee Stage, some of these recommendations will be included or considered further by the Minister and the departmental officials.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in bringing forward this Bill as promised a few weeks ago.  He has also kept faith with the ideas promoted by the Fine Gael spokesman on Justice, Deputy Seán Barrett, who published an under-age drinking Bill which is, by and large, incorporated in the Minister's Bill.  I thank him for underlining the problems raised by Deputy Barrett when he published his Bill.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill gets a speedy passage through the House.  For a long time people have been asking for reform in this area.  As I said when I spoke on Deputy Barrett's Bill, a committee of the previous Dáil examined in detail the problems of under-age drinking and other areas of the licensing laws.  It is only from meeting people concerned about the abuse of alcohol that one forms an opinion on how the sale of this drug should be conducted.  The Bill is also a tribute to the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Dukes, who published a Bill late in 1986 which is almost word for word the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1988.  There are one or two changes and improvements which will be dealt with later on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> From surveys, especially of tourists, it seems it is a good idea to give a special restaurant licence to people serving food. They cannot understand why only wine is available and this has not helped to give their holiday a special Irish flavour, especially in regard to the sale of Guinness, which has an international reputation as tasting better in Ireland. Perhaps it is the water from the Liffey that makes it a quality drink.  Anyway, it has an international reputation and Guinness brewed in London does not have the same superior value as that produced in Ireland.  Tourists look for this beverage and it is right that a special licence should be granted to restaurants.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted fairly in regard to the limited opening and closing hours. He has also acted fairly in relation to Christmas Day and St. Patrick's Day. The time of employees and customers is rather limited on these days and he has recognised that such days are important. However, people in the trade are fearful that an enormous number of licences will be issued.  They also fear that their trade, which has been contracting, will contract even further.  Of course, this change in the law has been signalled and the publicans' associations should have been moving in the direction of providing food in public houses.  Many public houses in various areas have shown that they are well able to provide food when they put their minds to it and some of the tourists coming to my area &mdash; the mid-west region &mdash; look for particular public houses that have acquired a reputation for special dishes and good value.  I commend the publicans who showed this initiative. Nevertheless, there is a demand for Irish cuisine in restaurant style and the Minister was right to grant licences.</P>
    <P>I question whether the terms in the Bill about the annual inspection by Bord Fáilte are strict enough.  Guidelines should be issued prior to the passage of the Bill, because the instructions to the inspectors should be comprehensive.  It is not sufficient to put a notice of intention <Col N="2116" /> to apply for a licence in the national newspapers. As in relation to planning laws, an advertisement should also be inserted in the local newspaper because that is where most of the development proposals appear.  If there is to be a change of use or a development of this nature, local people will expect to be informed of it by the local newspaper.  Therefore, the Minister should insist on the local newspaper requirement.</P>
    <P>I have already complimented the Minister on his initiative in introducing this Bill and I must also commend Deputy Seán Barrett for raising the issue of identity cards.  He had the courage to say in the House that we should introduce identity cards.  Various voluntary bodies have suggested this over the years but no other Member of the House suggested that the identity card system should be seriously considered and put into force.  Since he made that statement I have heard very favourable comment about this in my constituency, and parents and youth leaders are anxious that some system be devised by which control can be exercised. After all, we will be changing the law by including the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, by providing that the publican knowingly sells drink to under age people, and we are making people more responsible.  As Deputy Davern requested, parents should have some responsibility and in the area of identity cards parents can be made responsible.  When people can be challenged by way of ID card parents will participate.  I know there is a certain hesitancy on the part of people in this high technology age about having too much information given to Big Brother, but in regard to under age drinking we must come to grips with the dilemma, and this is the way it should be tackled.</P>
    <P>My attitude to the hours of opening and closing has changed.  I appreciate what the Minister is doing in extending the times for Saturdays and Sundays throughout the year but, the Council on Alocholism at meetings we attended, criticised the availability of alcohol.  I have a reservation about the abolition of <Col N="2117" /> the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo;.  I support our spokesman, Deputy Seán Barrett, who suggested that maybe the Minister would consider the non availability of alcohol for one hour during the day nationally in all public houses.  There could be a break from, say, 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.; the drinking-up period could begin at 2.30 p.m. so that people would be free from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.  It is very desirable especially in depressed areas where people are badly affected by unemployment and have a great deal of time on their hands and find it easier to stay in the pub all day than go home, that there be such a break.  Rather than hanging around waiting for the pub to reopen such people could proceed home, and the break would be effective. It should be easy for the Minister to bring in this measure now because a national agreement exists between the publicans who themselves perhaps would like to have this arrangement.  I believe it is socially desirable that the owners of licensed premises, particularly family owned premises, have a break at this time.  Consider the wife of a licensee operating at home when she has young children.  If she has free time from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. she would know she could look after her own children and get the food for them. That is the social aspect from the point of view of the licensee.</P>
    <P>A number of things have been said in this Chamber about intoxicating liquor so I am not going to add any pearls of wisdom, but I understand that the alcohol in supermarkets can be sold only from a restricted area.  I would like the Minister to confirm that.  The Bill as I understand it now requires alcoholic goods to be contained in a special area of the supermarket. If that is not true I request the Minister to amend the Bill to provide for that.  The main criticism that under-age drinking draws is in regard to easy access. A railed off area for the purchase of alcohol operating in the same opening and closing hours as the rest of the licensed trade would be a measure to control some of the abuses that have taken place in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that this Bill was not introduced before now, but I welcome it and I thank the Minister for introducing it.  I hope the provisions of the Bill will go some way towards curbing abuses particularly in the area of under-age drinking.  There is a wide concern in this country about that problem. Abuse of alcohol is a major problem today and 15, 16 and 17 year olds indulge in it.  The Irish Council on Alcoholism have produced figures and facts which indicate that the problem of under-age drinking is growing.  More and more young people are starting to drink early in life and on the law of averages many of them will become heavy drinkers and the chain of misery will grow.  Innocent people whose only crime will be falling in love with drunkards will have their own lives clouded with misery.  This need not be so because if we get a grip on the problem we can support young people in their determination to be sober.</P>
      <P>The council on alcoholism have indicated that the age at which people start to drink has gone down drastically in the last 20 years.  In 1970 the figure was one in ten under the age of 17 who drank regularly; now the figure is one in three. The question is often asked, &ldquo;where do these young people get the money for drink&rdquo;.  It appears nobody is able to give the answer.  It is said they get it from parents or older brothers and sisters and that some of them are involved in part time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed with one aspect of this Bill, the extension of hours of drinking. The proposal in the Bill is to extend the hours during which alcoholic drink can be consumed.  Public houses will be committed to remain open until midnight on weekdays and 11 p.m. on Sundays.  We have heard of absenteeism from work, a problem that is widespread in this country. It has affected business and industry because the hangover on a Monday morning is a regular occurrence.  The extension of drinking hours will make that problem worse.  Under the Bill 11 p.m. is the hour until which the publican <Col N="2119" /> will be allowed to sell drink but there is to be another half hour drinking up time.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening Deputy McCartan welcomed the proposal to extend the hours of drinking but he also expressed concern about the staff employed in public houses having to work longer hours.  There is no doubt that this will be the case.  Many people who are employed in public houses have spoken to me about the hours they will have to work.  Many publicans are of the opinion that in order to operate properly they will have to introduce a shift system.  The hours of work will affect the social life of staff and they will have little time to spend with their wives and children.  Serious problems will be caused both for management and staff.  There is no point in welcoming longer opening hours and then expressing concern about the staff. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>The Minister has outlined the trend in the various Acts passed since 1924 towards a gradual liberalisation to reflect the change in public damand in the use of alcohol.  He also claimed that there is public demand for an extension of drinking hours.  I have never got that impression.  Most people go to the pub about 10.30 p.m. for the last hour of opening.  Now they will go at 11 p.m. because they have only so much to spend and the opening hours do not make any difference.  I am concerned, however, that the extension may make a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>People in public life often express concern about the number of people who have lost their lives since the troubles started in the North of Ireland in 1969. We are all concerned about the number of innocent people who have died through violence but the figure does not compare in any way with the number of people who have lost their lives in the Irish Republic as a result of drunken driving. I am concerned that the extension of drinking hours may make the situation far worse.  The Minister said that both he <Col N="2120" /> and his predecessor met various deputations. I know that the Pioneer Association and the Irish Council on Alcoholism met the Minister and his predecessor and expressed concern about the points I have been making.  They spoke about drunken driving, the numbers killed on the roads and under-age drinking.  Another problem is bar extensions, about which concern has also been expressed.  These two organisations will be greatly concerned about the proposed extension of drinking hours.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the extension is to facilitate tourists and many people are of the opinion that people come to this country just to drink.  I do not agree.  I believe people come to visit the beauty spots.  There are many attractions other than drink.  When I spoke last week on Deputy Barrett's Bill I pointed out that a person from the North of Ireland or England would not come here to drink. An English visitor went into a hotel in Dublin and asked for a pint.  He left a pound note on the counter.  The barman was looking for almost another pound while the tourist was looking for change from the first pound.  The extended hours will not encourage these people.  A woman married to a man who is fond of drinking may be used to seeing him in the afternoon when the public houses are closed but now that they are to be allowed to remain open he will be able to stay there throughout the afternoon.</P>
    <P>In England the drinking hours are far more restrictive than they are here.  On weekdays public houses close at 3 p.m. re-opening at 7 p.m. and closing at 10.30 p.m.  Nobody can get a drink after that time.  Sunday opening hours are from noon to 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I do not see any need for us to extend opening hours.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a necessity to extend licences to restaurants but the Vintners' Association are concerned that they will be operating at a disadvantage because restaurants will be allowed to remain open longer.  I agree that there will be unfair competition as a result.  If <Col N="2121" /> restaurants can remain open later than public houses it will not worry somebody to have to pay £5 for a meal.  At present such a person pays £5 to go to a club where he will not get a meal.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us and on the Minister to educate Irish people on how to drink.  We have a completely different attitude towards drink from that of people in other countries.  In many other countries people drink for pleasure, moderately and with meals, but people in this country boast the next day about how much they had to drink the night before. People in other countries do not do that. They go out every night for a few drinks and for enjoyment and I believe that is the way alcohol should be used.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to restaurants being granted licences provided, of course, that they operate during the same hours as public houses.  I agree with the restriction of these licences to restaurants which serve a substantial meal.  I do not believe that all restaurants should be granted such a licence, particularly those restaurants which serve fish and chips or chicken and chips.  I fully agree with the Minister that only the restaurants which serve substantial meals should be granted licences.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy McGahon said in his contribution about the extension of the opening hours on Sundays.  He spoke about the problem of absenteeism. Over the past few months all of us have been lobbied by the ballroom association. Every Deputy has received several comprehensive documents outlining why they should be granted a licence.  I sympathise with them in a way because they are competing in a very unfair way with discos which are allowed to have licences while they are not.  I believe that none of them should have licences, particularly the discos to which very young people go. I know that people as young as 14 or 15 years go into discos where there are bar facilities.  As I stated earlier, it would be better if we could encourage people to go out for a night's enjoyment and not drink or use drink as a crutch or to give <Col N="2122" /> themselves false courage.  Many years ago there were no bars in ballrooms and people were able to go out and enjoy themselves.  It is a great pity that that day is past and gone.  The Minister proposes that all these clubs will now close at the same time as public houses and that the Garda Síochána will be able to inspect those clubs.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I have not seen anything in the Bill which deals with hygiene in public houses.  There are some beautiful public houses in Ireland but there is a great lack of hygiene in many of them.  The Minister should have dealt with this in the Bill.  It is a shame when tourists go into a public house and see how dirty it is.  There should be an obligation on publicans to keep their premises clean and tidy.  That is not the case in some parts of the country. This does not happen in rural Ireland only.  In parts of the city some public houses are also not up to standard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern spoke about the sale of alcohol in supermarkets.  I agree with what he said in that respect.  A young girl at a check-out has not got time to check the age of a person who buys drink.  Many young people buy their drink in supermarkets. There is a serious problem in Dublin in relation to off-licences where cider can be purchased.  All Dublin Deputies are aware of the cider parties that are held and the vandalism that is caused by teenagers who are drunk.  Bus crews and people who use the buses late at night have been subject to attack. Deputy Davern said that special buses should be put on to take people home.  I suppose it is a good idea but I would not like to be the person who has to operate some of these buses at night.  I met people quite recently who suffered severe attacks and had to take a lot of time off work as a result.</P>
    <P>I know some very genuine people operate off-licences but there are some cowboys in the business who would sell drink to anybody.  All they are concerned about is the money.  I would like the Minister to deal with the granting of a licence to an off-licence.  Last week when I was <Col N="2123" /> speaking in Private Members' time on Deputy Seán Barrett's Bill I referred to a case in the Phibsboro area where the Garda went to court and objected to an off-licence licensee being granted a licence because they had evidence that he was selling drink to very young people. The Garda were successful and the justice did not grant him a licence.  The licensee appealed against the decision of the justice and, according to the law, when you appeal a case &mdash; and Deputy Cooney will know this because he is a member of the legal profession &mdash; you can operate your business until the next court case is heard.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency the tenants' association in south Finglas brought a case against a public house owner.  It cost them a few hundred pounds to do this. They had the support of the Garda who stated that this publican was selling drink to young people.  The Garda lodged an objection to the renewal of his licence but the justice said he was granting the licence because the evidence before the courts was not sufficient and the Garda or the tenants' association should have photographs of the young people coming out of his pub.  That is what the Garda are up against.  Some people say the Garda are not operating the law but this is the sort of thing they are up against and sometimes it is difficult for them to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of identification cards. I see nothing wrong with everybody having to have an identification card.  I always carry one and I find nothing wrong with it.  It is of great help to me sometimes and it would be of great help to the Garda.  I would welcome it if the Minister introduced identification cards.</P>
    <P>There has been a lobby from the cider manufacturers who believe that their beverage is in no way responsible for the parties and the vandalism.  But I am very concerned about the availability of cider and have asked the Minister in my private capacity to agree to ban the sale of cider <Col N="2124" /> altogether because it is cheap and it is effective.  If these young people want to get drunk, cider is far less expensive than beer or any other type of drink.  So I would not be sorry to see the Minister banning the sale of cider altogether.</P>
    <P>Under the law the obligation is on the publican to clear the pub.  The Minister proposes to change that to provide that rather than a publican losing his licence he will be fined £400 and a person in a public house after hours will only be fined £25.  I would be happier to see that fine raised to £50 which would be more effective. One would not find so many people in the pub after drinking hours if the fine was £50.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern expressed concern about the present fine on a person found drunk.  I agree that the fine is not adequate.  A fine of £2 at present is ridiculous and I feel it should be not less than £100.  I hope the Minister does something about that, maybe not in this Bill but in other legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Davern that young people who go to discos are overcharged and that there should be some price control. Young people must pay £8 or £10 to enter a disco, and as well as that they have to get a taxi home so a night out will cost at least £20.</P>
    <P>I know there are other Deputies who would like to contribute so I will conclude by saying that I hope the Minister will accept the constructive criticisms I have made.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will get a speedy passage through both Houses.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speakers I welcome this Bill.  It is long overdue.  I would have preferred if the Bill had gone further, particularly in relation to hygiene and standards.  Perhaps a further Bill could deal with this whole area.  The standard of hygiene in various premises around the country leaves a lot to be desired.  There is much scope for improvement and I would instance the condition of toilets, ashtrays, <Col N="2125" /> glasses and so forth.  There is a need for provisions in the Statute Book to ensure the highest standards.  What is good enough for us may not be good enough for tourists who are accustomed to very high standards on the Continent and in America.  When they come to Ireland many are disgusted by our standards.</P>
      <P>In regard to the extension of drinking hours some provision could be made for a further extension especially at seaside resorts.  I realise that this may be difficult because in addition to seaside resorts we have inland resorts.  Most towns, cities and villages could probably be classified as tourist resorts during the summer.  But resorts along the sea coast enjoy just a few months of business during the summer and it is an opportunity for them to make their living and pay their rates for the rest of the year as was the case in 1985 and in 1986 when the weather conditions were very poor.  The fact that they cannot open until 2 o'clock certainly reduces their income and inhibits them from making a decent living.  Tourists themselves would enjoy a greater latitude in the laws.  The congestion that usually prevails when people descend on the streets between 11 and 12 o'clock, and the resulting traffic chaos could be avoided.  If the hours were extended much street brawling could be avoided in addition to traffic accidents.  As far as drunken driving is concerned it would be up to individuals themselves not to drive if they are drinking late.  A case could be made for the extension of licensing hours in tourist resorts.  This argument has been put forward in the past and perhaps the Minister would consider it in the future or at least make a comment on it.  Perhaps he would explain why he has not included an extension of drinking hours at tourist resorts in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very interested in the whole area of under-age drinking.  Before I came into this House I taught for seven years and, in my work as a PE teacher, I put a lot of emphasis on health education.  We had a very good health education programme in Tarbert comprehensive school for <Col N="2126" /> some time before such programmes became popular.  I always emphasised the value of educating young people about the use and abuse of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and so on.  We need a comprehensive approach to health education here; we need a new programme.  The health education bureau must be complimented on the great work they have done in the past.  But it is obvious, since we have such a problem at the moment, that their work has failed.  Otherwise we would not have the problems we have today.  We have to reassess our whole attitude towards health education and the teaching of it, not alone in our second level schools but in our primary schools, because it is there that the problem starts.</P>
    <P>When people say young people under the age of 12 are drinking it is very hard to believe them but that is the case.  They could start at home perhaps at Christmas time, at parties or at weddings but most young people start at that tender age. That is the reason we must inculcate values in young people at a very early age regarding the dangers of the abuse of drink.  Not only children but also adults need to be made aware of the dangers of drink because, let us face it, we do most things by copying other people and by modelling ourselves on other people. Usually sons will model themselves on their fathers and in many cases where there is an alcoholic father a son follows in his footsteps at some stage.  I know there are cases where a son would be abhorred by the behaviour of his father but generally speaking, especially in working class families, the reverse is the case.  The son usually models himself on his father just as a daughter, perhaps, would model herself on her mother.  Our health education programmes should be concentrated not only on schoolgoing people but also on the community in general. There is need at this stage for such a programme.  I should also like to comment on the influence of the media.  When we talk about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the alleged export of a Bronze Age sword.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to you for allowing me an opportunity to discuss in Dáil Éireann the whole question of the illegal exportation from Ireland of historic objects which are so much a part of our culture and tradition.  This illegal trafficking of works of art and historic artefacts and objects has been going on for many years.  On occasions the staff of the National Museum of Ireland, or some other interested person, discovers that an historic item is for sale and it is then brought to the attention of the media.  It is very likely that those items which are brought to the attention of the public form only the tip of the iceberg in relation to the amount of artefacts and objects of historical importance which are being smuggled out of the country.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow, in London, a bronze sword believed to date as far back as from 1,200 B.C. to 700 B.C. goes under the auctioneer's hammer in Christies in London. My interest in this sword is that it is described as &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; in the auctioneer's catalogue and that it may have been exported illegally from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Christies have refused to divulge to the National Museum of Ireland details of the name and address of the vendor, claiming confidentiality.  The staff of the National Museum of Ireland are concerned that this historic sword may have been exported illegally from Ireland and without the necessary licence furnished. Legitimate information on this matter should be furnished by Christies to the National Museum of Ireland.  Christies have not been forthcoming with this <Col N="2128" /> information and they have failed to reply to very reasonable and legitimate questions. Have they something to hide?</P>
    <P>It is my view that when dealers fail to reply to legitimate questions regarding archaeological objects, which are protected by legislation passed by Dáil Éireann, the United Kingdom Government should compel those dealers to furnish the detailed information being sought.  In the case of this particular Irish bronze sword dating from the period 1,200 B.C. to 700 B.C. it is not the monetary value that is so serious, rather it is the principle that the body charged by the Parliament of this country with responsibility for looking after such matters should be refused full details by the auctioneers.</P>
    <P>In all instances where the National Museum of Ireland have genuine reason to believe that archaeological objects have been illegally smuggled out of Ireland, without licence, and are then publicly offered for sale and where relevant information is refused, the Irish Government should take action.  The matter should then be pursued by the Irish Government at governmental level with the country involved.  Where it is deemed appropriate the sale of the item should be prohibited and the article impounded in the country in question until satisfactory explanations are provided.</P>
    <P>The history, culture and tradition of neighbouring and friendly countries must be respected.  We have such a duty and such a responsibility.  I would expect and call upon all other neighbouring and friendly countries to respect also our history, our culture and our tradition in these matters.  The Government must give this matter urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Among the items which are believed to have been smuggled out of Ireland, without the necessary licences being granted, were a bronze axe and a stone mace which were formerly in the Limerick Museum and which were sold in Slane, County Meath, in 1980.  In 1984 a <Col N="2129" /> collection of Irish antiquities was offered for sale by Sotheby's in London.  They included three Celtic bronze bowls and two decorated Celtic bridle bits which were part of the harness of a pair of horses drawing a Celtic war chariot.  I am not going to put a price on these items but they are very valuable.  It is believed that no licences were ever granted for the export of any of them.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party are seriously concerned at these events.  I am equally and seriously concerned and upset by the fact that the directors of the three principal cultural organisations are resigning.  They are the Director of the National Museum, Dr. Brendán Ó Ríordáin, Mr. Homan Potterton of the National Gallery and Mr. Michael Hewsen of the National Library.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw to the attention of the Minister of State that the director of the National Museum was asked why he was retiring and the reason he gave was that after 33 years, he was tired of the persistent neglect of the museum by successive Governments.  In times of financial cutbacks it is a serious matter that our three principal cultural organisations are to be left without their directors. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a replacement is found for Dr. Brendán Ó Ríordáin or perhaps, even more important, that he is asked to stay on in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point you are making a Cheann Comhairle.  I raise the point because I note with regret the resignations of Mr. Brendán Ó Ríordáin, Mr. Potterton and Mr. Hewsen. They have contributed greatly to our cultural development and I note with regret their resignations which are a grevious loss to us all.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House that we must take serious note of the fact that many of our priceless possessions are being smuggled out of the country.  The National Monuments Act was updated by the Minister who brought in some very important amendments and increased the penalties for offences.  In addition to increasing the penalties, the Government must take serious action at inter-governmental level to ensure that neighbouring countries will respect our history, tradition and culture and that when items are smuggled out of the country they are not allowed to be displayed for sale at public auction.  When this is brought to the attention of the country in question by our Government these objects should not be allowed to be sold.  We should raise this point at every possible level and people should be aware and conscious of the scope of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Government should make statements and involve themselves at inter-governmental level so that other Governments will be aware of the deep feelings of the Irish people on this matter.  They should be made aware that Irish people are fully opposed to illegal and sordid trafficking in these objects which are being stolen and then smuggled out of the country without a licence and sold for gain outside Ireland.  This is part of our history and culture and it would be grevious neglect on our part if we were to sit back and do nothing.  We, in this House are charged with responsibility in this matter.  I am aware that the Garda are investigating many other matters but <Col N="2131" /> it is important that every Irish citizen should be seriously concerned about this whole question.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to ensure that all possible resources are provided to the National Museum to help them to study and catalogue these objects and to ascertain where they are.  Unless they are provided with the necessary finance we will lose out and generations to follow will accuse us of failing in our duty.  The subject matter of the debate tonight is one example of such priceless objects and we have a duty to protect them.  I put it to the Minister that he has a duty in this instance to use the full resources of his Department to ensure that the staff in the National Museum are provided with resources.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library.  Many generous Irish people are prepared to donate articles to them and it is essential that they should have the scope and facilities to ensure that the items donated are looked after safely and properly and maintained for future generations. Those facilities are not available at present and that is why the directors have resigned.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The case has been very fully made by my colleague, Deputy Enright.  I have a particular interest in the information he has provided about the bronze axe and the stone mace which were, as he said, put on sale in Slane, County Meath, in 1980. I understand they were part of the Dunraven collection which was on exhibition in Limerick prior to that date.  If the Minister has information on the previous and subsequent history of those two items <Col N="2132" /> I would like him to provide it to the House.  The case has been made and I await the Minister's reply with interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright sincerely for raising this important matter which is one of a series that have been raised in this House and are continually being raised outside the House.  I also thank Deputy Noonan for his contribution.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Ireland recently became aware that a bronze sword, described as Irish, was being offered for sale by Christies, Auctioneers, London.  Christies were approached by the museum who requested further information about the object.  A representative of Christies has denied newspaper reports that the object was exported since the National Monuments Act came into force in 1930.  The National Museum will continue to make active inquiries about it.  These inquiries are currently under active consideration and this will be continued.</P>
      <P>If these inquiries indicate that it has been illegally exported, proceedings will be instituted against the person or persons involved.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987 &mdash; which I had the pleasure of bringing to the Dáil &mdash; introduced up-dated penalties for illegal export of archaeological objects and dramatically improved the State's position in this area.  Section 17 of that Act provides for the following penalties in relation to illegal export of archaeological objects:</P>
      <P>Any person who illegally exports an archaeological object shall be liable&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both the fine and imprisonment, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2133" /> (b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £50,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>These very strong measures have been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas in the interest of preserving our heritage. The National Museum has been working in close co-operation with the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of Public Works and the Garda Síochána to prevent illegal trading in archaeological objects and considerable success is being achieved in this area.  The position is being reviewed regularly to ensure that the intense pressure on certain groups and persons who are engaged in such activities will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision in December 1987 in relation to the Derrynaflan hoard has considerably clarified and strengthened the legal position of the State in relation to similar such discoveries.  It is hoped to present the detailed proposals for legislation required to deal with the many complex issues raised by that decision to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, Deputies Enright and Noonan referred to various objects and artefacts which may have been exported from this country, in particular to items from the Dunraven collection sold by Christies in London in 1980.  These objects were sold despite strenuous representations from the staff of the National Museum and doubts exist about their authenticity.</P>
    <P>Two objects were acquired in London by Lord McAlpine which had been sold in Slane.  Although these objects were illegally exported, Lord McAlpine maintains that he was not the exporter and, therefore, did not break the law.  The National Museum have asked him to apply for export licences since March 1988 but no response has yet been received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> A further reference has been made during the course of this debate to a collection of Celtic bridle bits and bronze bowls offered for sale by Sothebys in 1985.  These objects were identified by the National Museum as being Irish and following intense pressure including adverse publicity from the Irish authorities, they failed to reach their reserve and were withdrawn from the sale.  If the National Museum investigation on this or any other matter uncovers proof of illegal export, then the matter can be raised with the British authorities and if we have substantial evidence we can raise that matter through the relevant authorities here with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to three very honourable people in the public service here who have opted for voluntary retirement. I do not think that this House could interfere with the right of any person in the public service, or indeed the private service, to take any option in life at any given time.  I should like to put on record the appreciation of the Government, and indeed of this House, to those three gentlemen for the work which they have done in their respective positions.  My fellow countyman in the National Museum, Mr. Ó Ríordáin, is a man who has given tremendous service to this country and I am sure that in a private capacity he will continue to do so, as I am sure will also his other two colleagues. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the posts of directors of the National Museum and the National Library will be advertised shortly.  The National Gallery post will be considered at the appropriate time when the vacancy occurs.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that every possible measure will be taken to stamp out the illicit trade in Irish antiquities in order to safeguard our rich heritage for future generations.  I condemn out of hand the illegal efforts of anybody in this country or outside it to try to extricate the great artefacts and objects of Irish heritage and tradition from this country.  I <Col N="2135" /> commend the Deputies for their vigilance and interest and pay tribute to the staff of the National Museum.  Collectively, we are confident that eventually we will find a solution which will ensure that <Col N="2136" /> these objects will not find their way illegally out of this country in the future.</P>

      <P>He is not entitled to credited contributions for the period he was receiving unemployment assistance and has, therefore, no contributions paid or credited in the 1985-86 or 1986-87 contribution years and accordingly is not qualified for disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Due to a misinterpretation of the legislation governing the awarding of credits to persons receiving unemployment payments, the disability benefit claim was allowed in error on 12 January 1988.  As a result of this error a sum of £67.70 was issued and he was also advised that a substantial amount of arrears would be paid.  The error was subsequently detected and he was notified of the revised decision on 22 January 1988.</P>
      <P>As the overpayment in this case was due to a misinterpretation of the law, repayment of the £67.70 issued will not be pursued.  The person concerned attained the age of 65 on 27 January 1988, and he has been advised to claim a retirement pension from the DHSS in Britain.</P>

      <P>In view of the imminence of the Olympic Games I have given detailed consideration to the possibility of continuing unemployment payments to qualified unemployed persons who are chosen to represent Ireland at the games.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> In normal circumstances unemployed persons who go abroad would not be entitled to receive payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  However, I have always adopted a flexible approach in relation to entitlement to unemployment payments generally.  Claimants can participate in various activities without affecting their entitlements so long as they continue to be in the labour market and continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Examples of those activities are participation in part time education courses and voluntary work projects. Claimants are also allowed to take two weeks holidays in the year without affecting their entitlements.</P>
    <P>In the context of this general flexible approach I have concluded that unemployed athletes chosen to represent Ireland in the Olympic Games should be accommodated within the unemployment payments schemes for the period spent abroad in connection with the games.</P>
    <P>Such persons would, no doubt, have put a lot of time and effort into training in reaching the qualifying standard to compete in the games and I would not wish my Department to act as a stumbling block by disallowing their payments while participating.</P>
    <P>I can, therefore, inform the Deputy that where an unemployed person, who is already in receipt of an unemployment payment, is chosen to represent Ireland in the forthcoming Olympic Games, arrangements will be made on receipt of an application in good time for the continuation of his or her payment for the period of participation in the games. Verification of his or her participation in the games from the relevant sporting authority would, of course be required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been drawn to the anomaly whereby FÁS are displaying advertisements in social welfare offices inviting persons to apply for jobs in Britain but that if people travel to Britain for interview they lose unemployment payments for the days on which they are out of the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>FÁS do not in fact display advertisements inviting persons to apply for jobs in Britain.  I assume what the Deputy is referring to is a FÁS poster on display at local offices of my Department which draws attention to advice available in FÁS offices to persons planning to go abroad.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance a claimant must satisfy the statutory condition which requires him or her to be available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>EC Regulations 1408/71 for migrant workers allow for the payment of unemployment benefit for up to three months to recipients who travel to another member state to seek employment.  The procedure in such cases is that the claimant registers as unemployed in whichever country he or she goes to and arrangements are then made to transfer the benefit from this country.  Where a person is absent for only a few days it would not make practical sense to apply the EC Regulations.  The regulations do not apply to unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person goes to Britain for a few days to attend for job interview obviously such person would continue to satisfy the conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  However, in such cases it would be necessary for the person on his <Col N="1932" /> or her return to supply evidence that he or she had in fact attended a job interview.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular persons in mind he feels were unfavourably treated in this respect I would be glad if he would supply their names and I will have them investigated.</P>

      <P>From 4 January 1988 claimants to disability benefit are required to have at least 260 contributions paid in order to qualify for payment beyond 52 weeks. This requirement did not apply to a claimant who had, on that date, already been paid benefit for 52 weeks.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard procedure for payment of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is that payment is made direct to the claimant on the basis of proven unemployment.  However, where a claimant is not in a position to collect the payment personally, the local office may issue payment to a person nominated in writing by the claimant to act on his or her behalf.  In the absence of such authorisation, local office staff are not permitted to issue payment to anyone other than the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wife of the person concerned <Col N="1933" /> claimed unemployment benefit for the period from 11 March to 24 March 1988. When claiming she was required to attend on Friday of each week at the local employment office to sign the unemployed register.  She attended on Friday, 18 March and was paid her entitlement for the unemployment week-ended Wednesday, 16 March.</P>
    <P>On Friday, 25 March 1988 her husband called to the local office and stated that his wife was in hospital and that he wished to collect the payment due to her for the unemployment week ended Wednesday, 23 March.  He was refused payment on the grounds that he did not have the necessary authorisation from his wife nominating him to collect the payment on her behalf.</P>
    <P>While I regret any inconvenience that the non-payment of benefit may have caused in this case, nevertheless the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that proper controls must be exercised by my Department to ensure that payments are made only to the claimants themselves or to someone specifically appointed by them to act on their behalf.  The need for the completion of the authorisation I have referred to is a practical and necessary arrangement to safeguard the rights of claimants generally to receive their personal entitlements.</P>
    <P>The payment due in this case was issued to the claimant when she attended at the local office the following week.</P>

      <P>Persons who are in receipt of social welfare pensions are entitled to an increase in pension if they are aged 66 or over and are living alone.  The living alone allowance is one of a number of increases which may be granted in Irish social welfare pensions in certain circumstances.  It <Col N="1934" /> is not a separate payment in so far as it depends on a person having an entitlement to a basic social welfare pension. Pensions payable from other EC countries, including the United Kingdom, are calculated in different ways depending on the scheme in question but there are no arrangements whereby the living alone element of Irish pension entitlement can be applied to persons living here in receipt of UK pensions.  Where, however, a person who is entitled to a pension from another EC member state is also entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> Irish pension under EC regulation or to a non-contributory pension on the basis of means, a living alone allowance would be payable where the basic conditions for that allowance are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>My Department pay rent allowances to tenants of dwellings which were subject to rent control.  The allowances are paid in order to prevent hardship arising because of rent increases following the ending of rent control.  The conditions for receipt of a rent allowance under the relevant legislation require that the rent and the terms of the tenancy must be fixed by the District Court or by the Rent Tribunal and the tenancy and particulars of the new rent must be registered with the local housing authority.  In fixing the rent, the court or tribunal are required to have regard to the personal circumstances of both landlord and tenant as well as to the nature, character and location of the dwelling and the other terms of the tenancy.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The question of indebtedness is a very complex issue on which there is little concrete information.  In addition the consequences of indebtedness can vary from person to person and in the more extreme cases people may turn to moneylenders.  Arising out of my concern about the activities of money lenders, particularly as they affect social welfare recipients, I have recently arranged with the Combat Poverty Agency for a detailed study of moneylending and the associated problems of indebtedness to be carried out.  The agency expect that the results of this study will be available by next September.</P>
      <P>The desirability of establishing a debt counselling service is one of a number of issues which the agency will be addressing in their study and I intend to review the matter in the light of the agency's findings.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the problem of indebtedness is the management of resources and in this context I have recently made a grant of £100,000 to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for personal development and home management courses.  This money has been allocated from funds provided from the national lottery for community social services purposes.  The courses will provide practical advice and assistance, including financial advice, to over 5,000 families throughout the country this year.</P>
      <P>They include counselling in relation to debt and the use of credit unions and other financial agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the underpayment in this case arose because, in the absence of completed returns of income for 1984-85 to 1986-87, the taxpayer's income for those years was underestimated.  Prior to the submission of her 1987-88 return of income, the latest year for which a return had been received by the Inspector of Taxes, was 1983-84.  A review of the taxpayer's liabilities for the years 1984-85 to 1986-87, inclusive, revealed a total underpayment of £194.88, of which an amount of £41.44 related to 1986-87.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer's gross tax free allowances for 1987-88 were £3,541.  This figure was reduced by an amount of £2,797 in respect of her social welfare widow's pension and £260 for her investment income in order to collect the tax due on those incomes for that year.  This left a net tax free allowance of £484 (£40.34 per month) for use in connection with her Irish Life pension of £176.91 per month and resulted in a tax deduction for 1987-88 of £47.79 per month.</P>
      <P>The monthly tax deduction for 1988-89 will be greater than that for 1987-88 because part of the underpayment mentioned earlier will have to be collected in conjunction with her current tax liability.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not qualified for disability benefit as regulations provide that where a claimant has no contributions paid or credited for any two consecutive contribution years preceding his claim, he cannot qualify for payment of disability benefit or the award of credited contributions in respect of incapacity for work.  According to the records of the Department the person has had no contributions paid or credited since 1966.</P>
      <P>The person claimed disability benefit on 3 January 1987.  Due to an administrative error he was incorrectly paid benefit to 1 March 1988, and benefit was withdrawn when the error was discovered. In order to qualify for the payment of benefit the person would first need to have paid a minimum of 26 contributions at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>If the person's means are insufficient he may be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance and in this regard he should contact his community welfare officer.</P>

Such statistics are not kept on a constituency basis or in such a manner as would enable disallowance decisions arising from the programme and taken under section 138 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, to be distinguished from disallowances made under other provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>In 1987, 1,951 persons had their cases reviewed resulting in disallowances under the Social Welfare Acts.  This represented 1.4 per cent of the total of 141,542 interviewed under the programme in 1987.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance in May 1987 and following investigation he was assessed with means of £109.65 weekly derived from the profit from his holding.  He did not appeal against the means assessment although it was open to him to do so.

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.</P>
      <P>In February 1987, the person concerned requested that she be transferred from disability benefit to invalidity pension. Her application was disallowed as she was not considered to be permanently incapable of work.  She was informed of this decision and notified of her right to appeal.  As no appeal was received in the Department, it was considered that she did not wish to pursue her claim to invalidity pension and no further action was taken on her claim.</P>
      <P>On 25 March 1988, the person concerned contacted the Department and again requested a transfer from disability benefit to invalidity pension.  In connection with her claim to disability benefit, she has been examined on 4 March 1988 by a medical referee who did not consider her to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have her referred for a further examination in four months.

      <P>The Deputy should understand that the special trading house scheme is targeted on market opportunities; the special trading houses will then seek out appropriate manufacturers to meet market demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the scheme should have the broadest possible impact in generating new export activity from smaller Irish companies.  I am satisfied that many of our smaller firms, across a wide range of industrial sectors, have the capacity to produce products which can be successfully marketed abroad.  Up to now, many of these firms simply did not have <Col N="1957" /> the resources to penetrate overseas markets. The special trading house scheme provides a new access mechanism to foreign markets for such firms.</P>
    <P>The special trading house is required to have the necessary structure, organisation and marketing ability to undertake successfully the sale abroad of Irish made goods.  The very strenuous vetting procedure applied to applicants for special trading house licences ensures that successful applicants will be fully equipped to serve the needs of smaller Irish firms.  The range of Irish products carried by a special trading house will be limited only by its ability to demonstrate its capacity to successfully market the products in question.</P>

      <Col N="1960" /> All the regional fisheries boards concerned attempt to transfer pike removed from trout and salmonid fisheries to nearby pike fisheries.  However, this is often difficult because of the very delicate biological nature of pike.  Any pike which are killed are sold to fish dealers at an average price of £1 per kilo.</P>

      <P>The fisheries boards who have primary responsibility for the conservation, development and protection of fisheries arrange for the sale of rod angling licences through a network of distributors throughout their regions.  Precise details of sales etc. in 1988 will be supplied in accordance with established practice by the individual regional fisheries boards after the end of the angling season. Because of the widespread location of licence distributors and the difficulty of obtaining reliable comparable data, it has not been the practice for the fisheries boards to make returns on the sales of licences etc, on an ongoing basis during the angling season.</P>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated, however, that up to mid-April over 5,000 licences had been sold realising over £120,000.</P>

      <P>Grants and wage subsidies payable under FÁS employment programmes, including the community enterprise programme, are not related to individual levels of entitlement to social welfare payments.  Consequently, an individual engaged in an employment programme may not simultaneously claim unemployment compensation from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, participants over 18 years old on FÁS training programmes receive standard training allowances equivalent to their social welfare entitlements at the start of the course, subject to a minimum of the personal urban long term unemployment assistance rate.  To maintain parity with social welfare payments, eligible trainees who received the appropriate certificate of their entitlements from their local employment exchanges were given additional allowances equivalent to the value of their Christmas bonus and fuel allowance.  My policy is <Col N="1973" /> that individuals should not lose out because of their participation in training programmes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may have asked this question as a result of a document about food additives known as the Villejuif list.  This document has been circulating in Europe raising unnecessary fears about the safety <Col N="1974" /> in use of many food additives.  The scientific authorities of the Villejuif Hospital, alleged to be the source of the information, have dissociated themselves from the document.</P>
      <P>A system of control over the use of food additives (which include colours) exists in this country.  Regulations controlling particular classes of additives list the substances which are permitted and, where appropriate, specify the conditions under which they may be used and the maximum levels of use.  Additives are included in &ldquo;permitted lists&rdquo; only if there is satisfaction as to their safety and that there is a technological need for them.  I am advised on these matters by the Food Advisory Committee, which is a committee of independent experts.  In addition, additives are also examined by international expert bodies such as the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives as well as by the national authorities of many other countries.  Information about the safety of additives is exchanged internationally.  The use of permitted additives is kept under continuous review, particularly in the light of any new evidence relating to safety and if any was shown to cause widespread problems appropriate action would be taken.</P>

The waiting time shown for the dental services in the North-Eastern Health Board relates only to Meath.  Waiting lists have been suspended in the other community care areas of the health board.</P>
    <P>In view of the problem over a number of years I have recently appointed a small working group under the chairmanship of my colleague Deputy Leyden, Minister of State to report to me as a matter of urgency on ways in which the delivery of dental services might be improved.

    <P>While many health boards have suspended the sight testing scheme whereby they availed of the services of private opthalmic opticians to test the sight of eligible adults, the health boards continue to operate the community ophthalmic service which is staffed by county ophthalmologists.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming that the reference to untested drugs refers to drugs placed on the market in Ireland without the Irish PA number (Product Authorisation Number).  Drugs could for example, carry a PL number (British Product Licence Number) or the licence reference of some other country of the European <Col N="1979" /> Community.  Such references indicate that the drugs have been tested in the countries on whose markets they are placed but they may be illegal on the Irish market unless they carry the product authorisation number granted by me, following examination of the medical preparation by the National Drugs Advisory Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing product authorisations are contained in the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984. The legality or otherwise of a product which is on the market is determined by these regulations.  Under the regulations, all proprietary medical preparations and <Col N="1980" /> only non-proprietary medical preparations placed on the market after 1 October 1984 require product authorisations issued by me as Minister for Health from 1 October 1984.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-proprietary medical preparations which were on the market prior to 1 October 1984, some for many years, it was decided that these should be reviewed by the National Drugs Advisory Board within a timetable which extends from October 1984 to April 1989 as set out in the second schedule to the regulations. Under these regulations applications for product authorisations are required 12 months before the commencement dates as follows:</P>

    <P>The Department of Health have written to all the companies known to be marketing medical preparations in categories (a), (b) and (c) requesting that they withdraw all products from the market which do not have product authorisations, are not the subject of application for product authorisations or the subject of application for review or renewal of product authorisations.</P>
    <P>A joint committee of the Department and the General Medical Services (Payments) Board will report shortly on the status of each product.  The Department have also written to companies known to be marketing medical preparations in categories (d) and (e) requesting that they make arrangements to withdraw their products from the market by the commencement dates if they have not submitted applications for product authorisations.</P>
    <P>A number of companies have indicated they will be removing their products from the market by the due date.  In January and February of this year, the Department placed a notice in the daily newspapers and trade journals indicating that <Col N="1981" /> all medical preparations excepting those in categories (e) and (f) must now hold a product authorisation and carry this product authorisation on the label.  Following the placing of the advertisement a number of parallel importers came to our notice.  The Department are at present corresponding with these companies.</P>
    <P>A number of inspections have also been carried out and there is one prosecution pending.</P>
    <P>I have also arranged that only medical preparations which hold or which are the subject of an application for a product authorisation will appear in the General Medical Services (Payments) Board Code Book in future where such an authorisation is required under the regulations.</P>

Therefore, income earned from providing accommodation to language students in the Gaeltacht areas must also be included in the gross income to be assessed for higher education grant purposes.</P>

      <P>Recommendations of the Education and Training Committee of the Medical Council would be a matter in the first instance for the council itself. The Medical Council is required under section 35 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to satisfy itself as to the suitability of medical education and training being provided by bodies in the State recognised by the council for this purpose. It would be a matter for the Medical Council, in relation to any recommendations of the Education and Training Committee which the council adopted, to communicate with the authorities of such recognised bodies in the matter of the implementation of the recommendations concerned.  I have no function in this matter as Minister for Education.  It would, however, be open to the Deputy to contact the Registrar, The Medical Council, 8 Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2, for further information in this matter.</P>
