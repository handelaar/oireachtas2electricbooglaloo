If the Minister has the report and is giving it out in a discriminatory fashion, that is one thing, but if the report has not been furnished by the Commission that is a totally different thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I ask either the Tánaiste or the Minister for Justice if, in view of the very welcome decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the Norris case, it is the Government's intention to take legislative action in response to the judgment of the court and, if so, when we can expect it?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous question, this relates to reality rather than the speculation we saw on RTE last night.  In regard to the very pertinent question asked by Deputy McCartan, we as a Government will be examining the judgment in detail to decide what course of action we will take in response to a decision by a very important court.  I assure the House that this will be done by the Government and in due course we will make a decision on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter has a Priority Question today asking the Minister for the Environment the reason the Constituency Boundary Commission appointed in July 1988 was given different terms of reference to those given to its predecessors in 1979 and 1983.  That is Question No. 61 on today's Order Paper and it will enable the matter to be dealt with in an orderly fashion.  On the other question that concerns Deputy Fitzpatrick, I will certainly respond to his very correct appraisal of the situation.  This is a matter which is being examined in a judicial way by a reputable commission presided over by the President of the High Court.  Their report will come to the Minister for the Environment and then to the Government.  That is the normal process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment last evening I mentioned a number of matters, mainly tax amnesty has assessment.  While the tax amnesty has been a tremendous success, borrowings by a number of people in order to meet the deadline may very well cause them financial problems in the coming year.  I asked that the Revenue Commissioners adopt a commonsense approach in their <Col N="804" /> dealings with people after the deadline. Because of the rush of documents submitted before 30 September some difficulty may arise.  It may very well happen that some of these rushed documents may be incorrect and the Revenue Commissioners may feel that the people involved would not be entitled to the amnesty.  I also made the point that the dovetailing of the tax amnesty and self-assessment may cause problems also, in that some may have had to borrow substantial amounts of money before the deadline and within a couple of months are obliged under the self-assessment rules to pay their own estimates of those amounts.</P>
      <P>One issue regarding the Estimates which is fairly close to my heart is the subject of Army pay.  This issue originated in my constituency.  Most Deputies would be in agreement that the whole issue of Army pay should be looked into. I am glad that the Government saw fit, long before any public disquiet was voiced about this, to organise an interdepartmental committee to look into the matter and I am looking forward to the results.  I note in the Estimates a 4 per cent increase in the amount allocated to the Defence Forces and it is hoped that some of this will go to increasing the pay and allowances of some Army personnel where that is rightly deserved.</P>
      <P>Another area in which an increase of £2 million is shown is that of tourism.  As a Border Deputy, I mention the recent celebration of the success of Carlingford, County Louth in the Tidy Towns Competition. Many Deputies feel that the efforts of Bord Fáilte are homed in on certain areas of the country to the detriment of others.  A broader outlook embracing the whole country should be taken by that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to education, I note that in most areas the Estimate has increased. One area, the third level, will obviously be a bone of contention with some.  It will lead to increases in fees.  The Department should look into the area of higher education also.  My own county council will have a substantial pay-out this year in relation to higher education grants.  One <Col N="805" /> area which caused them difficulty in their estimates was that on interest.  Nearly £100,000 in interest charges will be expended by the county council before recoupment from the Department.</P>
    <P>A number of earlier Government speakers mentioned the areas of horticulture, industry and commerce and forestry.  Over the past 18 months tremendous strides have been made here. It is an indication of the upturn and the positive approach of this Government.</P>
    <P>In one of the recent bulletins from the Confederation of Irish Industry one of the headlines is: &ldquo;Less borrowing leads to more jobs&rdquo;.  There is no doubt about that; it is the reality.  We have brought down the interest rates to such an extent that there is substantially less borrowing here. Ultimately, this will lead to more jobs. The bulletin lists the various areas that are affected.  Since we came into power the monthly cement sales have increased, consumer prices have dropped and retail sales have increased.  It is all good news these days.  This is the result of the good policies of this Government.  I would reiterate that these Estimates are another step, as the Minister for Finance has said, in the revitalisation of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck by a number of points made by the Minister for Finance in his contribution yesterday. He said: &ldquo;There is now confidence in the will and the ability of the Government to take charge of events and in the future of the economy&rdquo;.  I regard that statement as utter and total nonsense.  Could he indicate where the confidence lies?  I have no doubt there is confidence in the Stock Exchange and in the boardrooms of many private companies, but there is no confidence in this Government among the almost one million men, women and children of this State who are living in poverty.  There is no confidence in this Government among the 240,000 men and women who are idle or, indeed, among the 120,000 or more young men and women &mdash; and indeed whole families &mdash; who have emigrated to Britain, the United States, Australia and Canada <Col N="806" /> over the past five years.  There is no confidence in those areas which badly need assistance from the Government by way of job creation.</P>
      <P>There is a very clear message in these Estimates for the unemployed and for our emigrants.  The message to the unemployed is that Fianna Fáil &mdash; supported, let it be said, by the Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats parties &mdash; have abandoned and forgotten them and that nothing will be done to create the jobs necessary to take them off the dole queues or bring them back home from the countries to which they have emigrated.  The message for those leaving the country at the rate of 600 per week is that Fianna Fáil may do their best to get them visas for the United States but will do nothing to create the jobs to allow them a decent life at home.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister says: &ldquo;The results of the labour force survey for April of this year were published recently.  They show a rise in total employment of 6,000 in the year up to April 1988.&rdquo;  Yet we are told in this morning's newspapers that the Minister for Labour has indicated that there will be something like 20,000 jobs lost in this economy during 1988, which will wipe out almost totally the projected job increases.  In relation to that, the 6,000 increase in the workforce which the labour force survey indicated was shown before the redundancy scheme in the public sector took effect.  I have no doubt that when we see the figures for that area far in excess of 6,000 jobs will have been lost in the public service.</P>
      <P>Those who voted for Fianna Fáil in February 1987 in the hope that a Haughey Government would do what they promised to do &mdash; reduce unemployment and end emigration &mdash; must feel betrayed and bitterly disillusioned.  The cutbacks of £311 million provided for in these Estimates, coming on top of cuts of £485 million last year, cannot be implemented without putting more people out of jobs and creating additional hardships for the poorest and weakest sections of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may huff and puff about the attitude of the British Prime Minister, <Col N="807" /> Mrs. Thatcher, to Ireland but these Estimates show that when it comes to economic matters there is no more enthusiastic follower of the British Prime Minister than this Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
    <P>It was very cynical of the Government to surreptitiously leak figures during the summer on the size of their proposed cuts in order to massage public opinion, distracting commentators so that they would not focus on the economic and social consequences of cuts of such magnitude, but would tell the people how lucky they were that they were not as large as the figures of £400 million which had been suggested.  It is disturbing to see the Government being attacked by the so-called main Opposition Parties &mdash; Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; because they assert that the cuts are not severe enough.  The first current account deficit was brought about in 1972 by a Fianna Fáil Government and the debt we have at present was run up in vote-buying by the various parties in government in the subsequent ten years.  After 1982 we were taking more in tax than was being spent on the provision of goods and services but the debts were rising because of the size of interest payments and because interest rates rose.  It is, therefore, nauseating to see the same people who ran up the debt vying with each other in feigning virtue on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is a downright lie to pretend to the people that we must have these types of cuts, that they need to be of this magnitude. These massive cuts will hit hardest the poor and most vulnerable &mdash; those on low pay and those dependent on social welfare.  Whether this is intentional it is not yet clear but the conservative ideology of the existing major parties in this House is restricting an economic analysis of the Right wing.  The largest cuts have been in welfare, health and environment where spending could be of greatest benefit to those in need.</P>
    <P>It seems clear to me and, I suspect, to many people outside this House, that these cuts are ill-conceived and regressive. Even conservative groups such as <Col N="808" /> hospital matrons and consultants have had to speak out against them.  The Government are getting others to do their dirty work.  They have imposed responsibility without financial power on hospitals, health boards and local authorities and they sit back while each group argues as to where the cuts should take place instead of questioning the cuts in the first place.  The Government are playing the old game of divide and conquer, letting others who are trying to do a difficult job get the blame for their own failure to manage the country's finances.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a re-organisation of Government spending, and The Workers' Party hold that there is room for improving the effectiveness of public spending, there should be a review of aid to powerful economic interest groups such as industry or farmers but, of course, the Government are afraid of incurring the wrath of these economic elites.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the other side to the spending coin is taxation and reform here would have dramatic effects on the economy in terms of revenue as we have seen recently in terms of equity and in fiscal policy.  It is clear from the extent of these cuts that the only changes in taxation would be further reductions in the rates for the rich and the powerful and the extention of loopholes like the so-called business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI-Combat Poverty Agency report on poverty confirmed what a lot of us already knew &mdash; and I include in that many conservative Deputies in this House &mdash; that is, that there is real poverty in our country.  It is surely a savage indictment of almost 70 years of self government, under successive conservative governments, that so little progress has been made towards eliminating poverty and achieving social equity. Indeed, in many respects the situation seems to be getting worse.  The ESRI-Combat Poverty Agency report found that more than 750,000 people are now living in some degree of poverty and that children currently make up a higher proportion of the poor than 15 years ago, that the top 20 per cent of Irish families enjoy 40 per cent of gross income while <Col N="809" /> the bottom 20 per cent have to do with less than 5 per cent of gross income.</P>
    <P>Poverty is more than simply the absence of adequate income.  It also means, for the poor, the absence of access to adequate facilities, and this aspect of poverty has actually worsened in recent years due to the policies of cutbacks pursued by this Government. The Minister's statement yesterday that the intention is to avoid hurting those who need Government services is laughable.</P>
    <P>The two-tier nature of our health system has never been more obvious, with those who can afford luxurious private hospitals receiving prompt and efficient treatment while all others must face longer and longer queues and rapidly deteriorating facilities.  A startling statistic came to my attention last week when I was informed that in the Blanchardstown area there are 3,000 children waiting on dental care because there are not sufficient dentists employed by the health board as a result of the Government embargo.  I am sure that is duplicated throughout the Eastern Health Board area and in other health board areas around the country.</P>
    <P>The advances made in the sixties and in the seventies in first and second level education &mdash; and which were a potent force for progress towards social equity &mdash; have been whittled away by cutbacks. Third level education, and the universities in particular, have remained virtually inaccessible to children of low income families with only 1 per cent of children from the north Dublin inner city area making it to third level compared with as many as 44 per cent in some of the more affluent areas of Dublin.  Again I would make the point which relates to my own area.  We have a junior girls comprehensive school in the Ballymun area which has no home economics teacher and will not be provided with one by the Department.  The Department very graciously appointed nine-tenths of a French teacher to the school in the current academic year.  What kind of nonsense is that when we are being bombarded day in and day out by <Col N="810" /> advertisements that we must get ready for 1992, that our children must have second languages.  Here we have a Minister appointing nine-tenths of a French teacher to a school in an area which is one of the most disadvantaged in the country.  It is totally nonsensical and cynical.</P>
    <P>Job creation is the key to resolving the problem of poverty in Ireland.  The Combat Poverty Agency-ESRI report confirmed this.  It found that the largest single cause of poverty is unemployment. While that is the case it also found that low pay was an equally large cause of poverty.  With such mass joblessness with officially registered unemployment at 241,200, with over 40,000 on schemes at any one time, with a missing 120,000 &mdash; those who emigrated in the past five years, most of them reluctantly &mdash; and with tens of thousands of discouraged workers, who would enter the labour force if they could get jobs, remaining in education or at home, it is no wonder that cynicism with our political system is rampant.  A further effect of mass unemployment is the frustration of many of those at work &mdash; the square pegs in round holes &mdash; unable to move because of the stagnant labour market.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these Estimates that this Government are not going to do anything about unemployment or emigration.  In fact they will do less about unemployment than they did last year or even than was done eight years ago in 1980 when unemployment was 40 per cent of its present level and when emigration was very low.  This is revealed by the shocking cuts in capital spending.  I call them shocking because with capital spending you are able to directly reduce unemployment particularly for the most vulnerable, the less skilled, and because reductions in capital spending are extremely short-sighted.  In 1989 the nominal amount of Exchequer funded capital spending will actually be less than in 1980.  Unemployment was far lower then yet £660 million was invested by the State in the economy at that time compared with the mere £617 million planned for 1989, a year in which every <Col N="811" /> economic indicator, except employment, is at its most favourable for decades. Surely this is the very time for those who believe in climates for enterprise, in atmospheres and environments and other nebulous concepts as the guiding entrails to be followed, to invest in jobs.  If real capital spending in 1989 is to be maintained at the same level as in 1980, it should be £1,393 million, more than twice the level planned.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party do not believe that investment should be determined by climates but must be active and planned, particularly in a small, peripheral and late development economy such as we have. However, one cannot but be struck by the very favourable climate for investment in Ireland.  It is further evidence of a two track economy &mdash; a tax and profit haven for the tiny number of rich elites and a tough place for the rest of us.</P>
    <P>Growth is at 2 per cent, having been a minus figure for several years.  Manufacturing output is soaring, productivity is high, exports are booming, imports are down and we have the highest balance of payment surplus in the EC.  The national debt is, as we have always maintained, now recognised to be manageable, aided by the overdue payments of what can only be called the &ldquo;tax parasites&rdquo; from the so-called private entrepreneur class. Farmers' incomes are rising fast, interest rates are down and profits are booming. For example, Smurfits profits soared by 156 per cent to £154 million, AIB's by 23 per cent to £125 million, Cement Road-stone's profits went up by 27 per cent to £46 million, GPA's half year profits rose by 59 per cent to $72 million and will be over $100 million for the year, Clondalkin's half year's profits rose by 38 per cent and Power Corporation's by 100 per cent.  Most industrial companies' earnings per share will rise by almost 50 per cent this year, when inflation is only 2 per cent.  If workers were to get pay increases of 25 times the rate of inflation there would be warnings of gloom and doom and the unions would be accused of demanding too much from the economy. Yet economists are silent on these <Col N="812" /> immoral profit rates particularly as most of the money which was made through the sacrifices of workers is flowing out of this country.</P>
    <P>Surely when interest rates are low, profits are booming and the so-called climate is right for enterprise, it is then that the Government should be taking the lead in investment, particularly when so much needs to be done.  You cannot have jobs with climates.  You have to actually do something &mdash; you have to invest.  The forecast level of private investment next year is up on this year when it was almost nil but it is far lower than the seventies when double digit percentage increases were the norm.  The Government are making a grave mistake in making these savage cuts in the most job creating area of the economy.  Furthermore much investment will have to take place eventually and these cuts are merely post-ponements. Roads, sewers, drainage and local authority houses will have to be built.  My point is: why not build now when work is so desperately needed, when interest rates are low, when the debt is more manageable and when such building will boost the economy?</P>
    <P>I am well aware that some public investments in the past did not yield good returns and that some of them were disasters.</P>

    <P>However, the great white elephant so beloved of the Right, the NET, returned profits faster than anyone expected, aided by the sacrifices of its workforce which was cut in half and, of course, supplied with cheap gas feedstock.  Aer Lingus are doing very well.  The problems of Irish Shipping were caused by bad <Col N="813" /> management and not by its State ownership.</P>
    <P>If there have been some poor public investments I would urge that the greatest blunder by the State has been its huge investments in the private sector on which there has been no financial return in interest, dividends or even in taxation. Every year the extraordinary sum of £1.3 billion goes to aid private industry in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies designed to encourage modernisation and employment.  Yet the job losses have exceeded 40,000 since 1980, from a low base, and the untaxed profit outflows amount to £1.3 billion each year.  The amount of corporation tax paid by this sector is zero.  With such poor returns it is time to substantially redirect aid to private industry and the most effective way of doing this is to reduce the tax breaks.  The aid available must be extended to include public enterprise and it must be effectively targeted to develop integrated industries in a planned drive for productive sustainable jobs.  These are gross, particularly when the size of profits are seen, when no jobs are being created and when PAYE workers have to make up the shortfall and to pay for the businessmen's dole.  Every capitalist who complains about the high marginal rates of personal taxation must be reminded that they are caused by the existence of the two track economy where those with capital are cosseted and those without are crippled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for my Department preserves all social welfare services. There has been absolutely no reduction in social welfare schemes or programmes. The conditions of eligibility for all our schemes remain the same.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer is being asked to provide £88.5 million less for social welfare in 1989 than in 1988.  At the same time there have been substantial improvements in the rates of payments from July which are provided for the full year in 1989. The reduction in expenditure has been brought about in no small measure by effective management, intensified abuse control and a significant reduction in the numbers claiming unemployment payments and disability benefit.  In summary, we have achieved significant savings to the taxpayer while preserving and improving all social welfare services.</P>
      <P>On taking up office 19 months ago, I set myself the objective of introducing more effective management and control of the resources devoted to social welfare so that additional funds could be directed to those most in need.</P>
      <P>The accumulated savings to the taxpayer in 1987 and 1988 to date from measures to control fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming amount to £66 million.  This has been achieved by introducing new and intensified control measures aimed at ensuring that social welfare payments go to those who are genuinely entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average level of weekly unemployment in the Estimate for 1989, is 236,000 which is 17,000 below the estimate of 253,000 on which the 1988 published Estimates are based.  The actual outturn for 1988 will be 242,000 &mdash; some 11,000 below the Estimate.  This is clear evidence of the Government's success in turning the tide on unemployment and controlling abuse.  The recent labour force survey shows an increase of 6,000 in the numbers at work to April 1988. <Col N="815" /> These trends are continuing and are reflected in the reduced live register figure for 1989.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that emigration is not responsible for the expected reduction in the live register in 1989.  The figures for 1988 do not allow for any increase in emigration as compared with the last few years.  The indications are that the level of emigration will be reducing in 1989.</P>
    <P>One of the tangible benefits from our success in controlling social welfare expenditure is that funds are available to the Government to provide a Christmas bonus again this year from within my existing allocation.  The bonus will be paid to all long term social welfare recipients at the same rate as last year, that is, 65 per cent of the recipient's weekly payment.  Like last year, it will be paid in the first week of December.</P>
    <P>Almost 580,000 pensioners and long term unemployed persons will receive the bonus at a cost to the Exchequer of £21 million.  Including the dependents of recipients, the number of people directly benefiting from this measure is 921,000. This reflects the Government's concern to protect those who are dependent on social welfare by recognising the extra financial pressures they have to bear coming up to Christmas time.</P>
    <P>Let me give you a few examples of how the bonus will help people to cope.  An elderly couple on old age contributory pension will qualify for a bonus of £60.45 bringing their total payment in the first week in December to £153.45.  A couple with three children on long term unemployment assistance will receive a bonus of £64.22.</P>
    <P>The Government have made major progress in achieving their objective of controlling the public finances.  This success enables us to turn our attention now to a greater extent to the measures necessary to stimulate employment.  We have every reason to be hopeful and confident about our future.  A growing economy with a more effective public service will provide many new job opportunities.  We need to have the confidence in ourselves <Col N="816" /> and in our future to make the best advantage of these opportunities.</P>
    <P>The general outline of economic developments this year is very encouraging. Growth is remaining quite broadly based with output increased in most areas compared with the first half of last year. Manufacturing output was up over 13 per cent year-on-year in the first six months. The trade balance continues to improve pointing to a further strengthening of the balance of payments surplus this year. Inflation remained close to the 2 per cent mark at mid-August, below the EC average of 3.25 per cent and well down on the equivalent UK figure of 5.75 per cent. The indications are that Irish inflation will remain in line with the EC average or better.</P>
    <P>The profile of our economy in 1988 indicates a major improvement in most of our economic indicators &mdash; the budgetary position, the balance of payments, interest rates, inflation and international competitiveness.  The improved pace of economic growth over the past two years confirms the economy's capacity to achieve growth in a period of budgetary restriction.</P>
    <P>To provide an additional impetus in economic activity and the creation of new jobs, the Government announced earlier this month a series of measures under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to finance projects and stimulate consumer spending in a number of areas including tourism, forestry and agriculture.  These measures reflect the Government's commitment under the programme to create a good climate for growth and to exploit opportunities in key sectors.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy has laid the foundation for sustainable growth in output and employment in the years ahead, although the task is not yet completed. We expect that 3,000 new jobs will be announced before the end of the year and that the 1988 target of 20,000 additional industrial jobs under the programme will be achieved.</P>
    <P>If the economy is to realise its full potential, especially on the employment front, it is vital that the progress made to date in resolving the basic imbalances in <Col N="817" /> the economy controlling public expenditure and strengthening overall competitiveness should be sustained.  The control of spending on social welfare is of major importance in this context.</P>
    <P>As I have alrady said control measures taken to date have saved £66 million. Further new measures that I am providing in the Estimate will save an additional £21 million in 1989.  The reduction in the live register, together with a reduction in the numbers claiming disability benefit, will contribute £76 million towards the savings.  There will be £35 million income from PRSI for the self-employed in 1989 &mdash; £20 million more than in 1988.  This also contributes to a reduction in the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1989 is the amount required to finance existing schemes and services.  In accordance with normal practice it provides for increases in this year's budget but does not include any provision for increases in social welfare payments that the Government will grant next year as part of their budgetary measures.</P>
    <P>During the past year, we honoured our pledge to maintain the overall value of social welfare payments and within the resources available to make special provision for greater increases for those on the lowest payments.  This Estimate includes £54.5 million in respect of the carry-over costs of the substantial improvements that arose from the last budget.  The Government increased all social welfare payments by 3 per cent from last July.  In addition, the personal rates of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, which were the lowest social welfare weekly payments, were increased by the significantly higher amount of 11 per cent. We also streamlined child dependant rates with a 3 per cent increase in rates generally and a 6 per cent increase for child dependants in the case of persons on the lowest payments.  This represented a major improvement in income support for families, particularly in the case of large families.</P>
    <P>Specific examples of developments provided and planned for in the coming <Col N="818" /> year include the following.  The extension of PRSI to the self-employed is a major development of our social welfare service now coming onstream.  The registration and collection of PRSI from the self-employed is proceeding according to plan.  Collection began last April and about 40,000 company directors currently paying income tax through the PAYE system are now paying PRSI as well.  In addition, over 180,000 who pay income tax under Schedule D of the tax code will all by now have received a demand for their PRSI along with their tax demand at the end of this month. Overall, the extension of PRSI to the self-employed is expected to bring in about £15 million this year and £35 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>It is customary to increase the earnings ceiling for PRSI contributions in line with increases in wage levels.  From April 1989 the current PRSI ceiling of £16,200 will be increased.  Employees, employers and the self-employed will pay PRSI contributions in respect of earnings up to £16,700.  In addition, employers will continue to pay contributions up to a ceiling of £20,000 in respect of the 15 per cent of employees who have these higher earnings. The Estimate includes £5 million in respect of the higher ceiling for employers.  There will be no increase in the rate of PRSI contribution.</P>
    <P>Irish employers pay one of the lowest rates of PRSI in the European Community. In the United Kingdom there is no ceiling for employers on the amount of earnings in respect of which contributions are payable.  This measure will reduce the burden on the general taxpayer of maintaining the Social Insurance Fund and will help to avoid the need to cut benefits paid to employees.</P>
    <P>I understand that Deputy Noonan in the course of his contribution yesterday alleged that the increase in the ceiling for employers will lead to an increase in their costs of £70 million.  That is not so.  It arises from a mistake made by the CII in calculating, on day one, what might be the figure.  That matter has been discussed with them and they now fully understand the position.  As I have said, <Col N="819" /> the increase in employers' ceiling to £20,000 will raise an extra £5 million in 1989.  That is the actual figure.</P>
    <P>Last month saw the publication of a very comprehensive report on poverty and the social welfare system here by the Economic and Social Research Institute. That report is an important document providing relevant information on the categories of people most at risk in our society.  While the overall responsibility for this project now lies with the Combat Poverty Agency, my Department were responsible for making the initial arrangements to have the study carried out with assistance from the European Community poverty programme.  The main value of the report is that it highlights the groups most at risk and indicates what should be the major concerns in social policy and where particular attention should be focused.</P>
    <P>The report identifies the most vulnerable groups to be large families, families where the head of the household is either unemployed or employed on low earnings; young women bringing up children on their own; families where the head of household is sick or disabled and low income farming households.  It also indicates that a lot of progress has been made since 1980 in certain areas.  For example, the elderly generally are now in a low risk category.  This is a finding of which our society can be proud.</P>
    <P>The report shows that the policies adopted by the Government are properly directed.  We had already recognised the special difficulties of those on the lowest social welfare payments.  We provided extra increases for the long term unemployed, for those on supplementary welfare and for their children.  We also extended the free fuel scheme to long term unemployed families.</P>
    <P>Very significant progress has been made within the current financial constraints and my intention is to continue to direct resources to those in greatest need.  In this regard the ESRI report is particularly useful in that it indicates priority areas of special need.  These findings will be taken into account in the <Col N="820" /> context of future developments in social welfare.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is directed to families whose breadwinner is at work on low pay.  The review of the family income supplement is almost complete.  I look forward to receiving the report which, together with the ESRI report, will be considered in the context of future policy developments.</P>
    <P>Last December I announced in the House that I had asked the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out a detailed study of moneylending.  I am particularly concerned at the effects of unscrupulous moneylenders on the less well off in our society.  Moneylending has traditionally been regarded as a form of credit used almost exclusively by the poor.  Until now there has been little concrete information about the extent and the effects of moneylending and indebtedness.  The report will fill the void which exists not only in our knowledge of this form of credit but also in our understanding of the effects of indebtedness on low income families, particularly those who are long term dependent on social welfare.  The report will be available in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Jobsearch programme, which Deputies will recall was introduced in April 1987, provides support and assistance to the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed, in their search for work.  Under the programme the main State agencies dealing with the unemployed were directed by Government to actively assist the unemployed.  Through Jobsearch, the unemployed are encouraged to avail of the professional service which FAS can provide in assessing their strengths as potential employees.</P>
    <P>The programme provides a substantial number of placements in FÁS schemes and courses as a priority for the unemployed. Apart from the 8,500 who have so far this year attended the Jobsearch course, a further 24,000 have been placed in schemes and courses.  In addition, jobs have been found for another 5,000 persons. Most of those who do not accept an <Col N="821" /> invitation to participate in the programme leave the live register voluntarily. So far this year savings of over £15 million have accrued from persons who left the live register and did not avail of the opportunities which were being made available to them under the programme. The Government have decided that the programme will be continued next year as a special service of support and assistance to the unemployed.  It is not expected that savings of the same magnitude will accrue under the programme next year.  The Estimate allows for savings of £8.5 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>The only long term solution to unemployment is increased job creation. However, it is vital that those currently unemployed are kept in touch with the labour force and do not become marginalised. It is for this reason that the Jobsearch programme was initiated and will continue now for its third year.</P>
    <P>I have introduced flexibility into the unemployment payments system.  I want to encourage the unemployed to exploit every opportunity of enhancing their job prospects.  This we can do by allowing them, in certain circumstances, to take up part time work, to engage in voluntary work in their own community, or to pursue education courses, and still retain entitlement to a basic income maintenance payment.  Provision for these schemes is made in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The part time job incentive allows long-term unemployed persons to take up a part-time job for up to 24 hours a week.  The educational opportunities scheme is intended to give a second chance to older long-term unemployed persons over 23 years to study for a second level certificate.  The courses are provided by various VECs around the country while my Department continue to pay their income maintenance entitlements to participants.  After a very encouraging pilot period, during which I was very impressed by the motivation and achievements of participants, I was delighted to be able to announce the continuation of the scheme in the two pilot locations, Limerick city and Tallaght, County Dublin, and, with the support of <Col N="822" /> my colleague the Minister for Education, its extension to a number of other locations around the country.  Details of the new locations have not yet been finalised. However, it is expected that the scheme will be available in 12 large centres of population.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the scheme will continue to be successful and I believe that it has a definite and permanent part to play in meeting the needs of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The part-time education initiative is intended to cater for those unemployed persons who would like to further their education but do not wish to undertake a full-time course.  The initiative takes the form of guidelines to deciding officers of my Department.  Essentially the guidelines suggest that while participating in part-time courses, for example, literacy or numeracy classes, night classes or courses aimed specifically at the unemployed, an unemployed person would be regarded as fulfilling the normal criteria of being available for work.  I am examining what other options can be built into the system to allow for further educational opportunities.  Legislation may be required to enable any further development in this direction.</P>
    <P>The voluntary work option which I launched last July is intended to encourage unemployed persons to become involved in voluntary work in their local communities and to encourage voluntary organisations to create opportunities for this work and involve the unemployed as much as possible in their activities. Unemployed persons continue to receive their unemployment payments while undertaking the work although they are expected to be available should a full-time paying job turn up or a training place on a suitable course.  In addition, to encourage the voluntary organisations to create opportunities for this work, I launched a pilot scheme in which I made £50,000 available in grants to help out with the costs.  I have been very encouraged by the response from the organisations to date, with over 60 applications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> Two weeks ago I signed new regulations giving entitlement to pensions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to certain persons affected by what has become known as the &ldquo;pensions anomaly&rdquo;.  I was delighted to be able to do something for those concerned and to redress this anomaly.  The Estimate includes the provision of £2 million for this purpose in 1989.</P>
    <P>Over 1,200 elderly persons will benefit by the new provisions.  Pensions will range from a minimum payment of £13.10 up to £39.30 for a single person. Full adult and child dependant allowances will be paid with the pensions.</P>
    <P>In the course of my contribution today, I have discussed the cost of the range of services and schemes for which my Department are responsible.  An important aspect of this is the quality of the administration of those schemes and services. We are concentrating on improving the quality and service of these schemes. I will be devoting any available resources to that end.  As part of the ongoing work of my Department I am continuing to allocate resources to the combating of fraud and abuse.  The Estimates for 1989 include provision for the extension of the joint investigation unit by the allocation of another 17 extra staff.  This unit is a joint effort by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  I have also increased the staffing of the external control unit by 13 extra staff to allow for a nationwide review of entitlement to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In addition, legislation passed last year enables me to require employers to notify me of the date of commencement of the employment of any person in their employment and to furnish me with any details required to enable determination or review of a claim by a person in their employment.  I will sign the new regulations bringing these provisions into effect within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>This month represents the first anniversary of what must be regarded as an historic achievement for the Government. I am referring to the extension of dental, optical and aural benefits to the dependent spouses of qualified insured <Col N="824" /> persons from the beginning of October last year.  Since the extended scheme was introduced, 176 dentists have signed new agreements to participate in the extended scheme.  I would like to thank them for their participation.</P>
    <P>In the twelve months that it has been in operation, almost 65,000 dependent spouses have availed of dental, optical or aural treatment &mdash; treatment which was not previously available to them.  It is relevant to point out that of the 1.4 million persons who are eligible for treatment benefits some 62 per cent have earnings which are below the medical card guidelines. This new scheme, therefore, is clearly of great benefit to people in need.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Book of Estimates for 1989 is a clear illustration that this Government are prepared to honour their commitments.  We pledged that the public finances would be brought under control.  We are well on the way to achieving this.  This is the second year in which the Book of Estimates was published in October setting out the allocations within which each Minister and State agency must operate.  We pledged that we would restore growth and confidence to our economy.  We have achieved this.  Our exports are booming and the trade surplus is set to break £2 billion this year and set an all-time record.  Indications from our imports suggest that industry is gearing up for expansion.</P>
    <P>We pledged to consult the social partners. We did, and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been a watershed in changing the economic outlook.  It brought together the Government, unions, employers and farming interests in a common drive in the national interest.</P>
    <P>This decisive approach is equally evident in the Estimates for 1989.  We have shown that despite the overriding need to control expenditure it is possible to be a caring Government.  This is clearly evident in the social welfare area where we have provided extra money for all recipients and special increases for those on the lowest payments, while reducing the overall cost to the taxpayer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct to say that the Government have imposed specific financial controls in various areas of Government policy and it is also correct to say that we are now finally moving along and confronting the problem of our level of national debt.  It is a problem that the Government, when in Opposition pretended did not exist and a problem that, when my party in Government sought to deal with, were lambasted by Fianna Fáil from the Opposition benches who sought at every turn and corner to create as many difficulties as possible in resolving our economic problems. Indeed, if a greater degree of economic reality and a greater degree of political and economic honesty had been shown by Fianna Fáil in Opposition some of the economic problems which are still with us would have been closer to being resolved. Fianna Fáil in Opposition sought to ensure that difficulties being experienced by the State were exacerbated in the economic area for no reason other than their own political advantage.</P>
      <P>There has been a lesson in what happened during the months the Dáil has been closed that should not go unnoticed. If Fine Gael from the Opposition benches were not imposing the controls on this Government that are necessary to get the economy right, this Government would return to the type of policies they enunciated from the Opposition benches. What is increasingly clear, both in the area of my responsibility in the context of the Department of the Environment and in other areas of Government policy, is that when this Government are let off the hook of parliamentary control for any limited time they go seriously awry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the Department of the Environment it is fair to say that there is a total lack of political direction or initiative in confronting many of the major issues that fall within the area of responsibility of that Department.  The financial allocation to the Department of the Environment this year is reduced overall by some 11 per cent.  The Minister for the Environment in accepting that reduction has failed to take the necessary policy initiative to ensure that the least <Col N="826" /> well off in our community are the persons most protected from cutbacks.  The Minister for the Environment has failed to take the necessary initiatives to ensure that basic local services are maintained. He has failed to take the necessary policy initiatives to ensure that our local authorities can function in a way that avoids the type of disaster experienced in Cork during the last couple of days.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the Cork area has been discriminated against continuously by this Government in the context of financial allocations made by them to both Cork County Council and Cork Corporation.  In the 1987 Estimates the rate support grant to Cork County Council was in the region of £21 million.  In 1988, this year, it was reduced to £12 million.  Next year it is reduced to £11 million.  In Cork Corporation the rate support grant stood at £7 million in the year 1987.  It will stand at just under £5 million for 1989.</P>
    <P>The flood disaster that has hit the Munster area in the last two days is not just as the result of bad weather.  It is the result of local authorities in the Munster area being starved of necessary funds to carry out basic drainage services to maintain the sewerage system.  In effect the weather has been assisted by the lethargy of Government and possibily by the Fianna Fáil Party, as an act of political revenge on the region of Munster for not giving them the Dáil seats they sought from it in the last election, deliberately reducing the funding to the Munster area so as to curtail the level of services available to people in that area.  Bearing in mind the reports in our media what has been happening in the Munster area in the last 24 hours even if the Minister has not visited Cork, even if he is not interested in the people of Cork, I find it extraordinary that he was not prepared to stand up on the Order of Business yesterday or today to announce the establishment of a special emergency flood relief fund to assist the people of Cork, both businessmen and domestic householders, who found their houses, shops and businesses flooded, to enable them to come to terms with the disaster that <Col N="827" /> has hit them so that they are aware of what funding is available to make good the damage done.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister is not prepared to come into this House and state that special funding will be provided to Cork County Council and Cork Corporation to enable the necessary drainage works to be carried out to ensure we do not have a repetition this winter of the flood disaster.  When the Munster area has been hit in this way I find it extraordinary that the Minister is supporting an Estimate which has in effect cut the financial allocation to Cork in half in two years, and he has done it in the context of providing no major alternative means for raising funds to enable local authorities to come to terms with the financial needs they have to provide basic services.</P>
    <P>We have seen published in <i>Aspect</i> magazine the extraordinary confidential Cabinet memoranda showing documents swapped between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment about the introduction of a property tax.  We have heard reports that some members of the Cabinet are in favour of property tax and some members are against it.  This House is entitled to know what the Government's policy is in that area.  Do the Government intend to introduce the property tax?  Do they regard such a tax as a means of gaining funds for the central purse or is it a means of gaining funding to ensure that local authorities have a degree of independence and are in a position to meet local needs in their own areas? While the Minister sits on the fence, while this Government leak documents about rows going on, the local authority system as we have it is in chaos.  While the Minister sits on the fence local democracy is being underlined, local services are being reduced, and the level of disaster we have seen in Cork and surrounding regions in the last 24 to 48 hours will be repeated in other parts of the country during this winter.  I call on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment to clarify exactly <Col N="828" /> what Government policy is in this area. Is it Government policy to so undermine local authorities as to lead to their abolition? Is it Government policy to punish portions of the country who do not give to Fianna Fáil the electoral support that party believe they deserve?</P>
    <P>I have referred to the way in which the Munster region, and in particular Cork city and county, have been treated by this Government.  Whereas the general overall allocation to local authorities under the terms of the Minister's Estimate is reduced by about 8 per cent, Dublin has been hit even worse than Cork.  The reduction for Dublin is by some 11 per cent and the Dublin local authorities are faced in 1989 with a major crisis.  I will predict that unless this Minister finds some means of ensuring that the local authorities in Dublin have proper financing, what we have seen in Cork today and yesterday will be repeated in Dublin, if not this year certainly next year, because the work necessary to ensure that our drainage systems are working properly and our rivers are dredged so that we do not have this type of flooding is not being undertaken by the local authorities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Local authority funding is in a shambles, local authority services are in a shambles and, of course, while they are in a shambles we have Deputy Flynn as Minister for the Environment engaged in a very peculiar exercise.  I can recall being in this House when Deputy Flynn and his colleagues announced that they were opposed to local charges being imposed by local authorities throughout the country. Of course, at the moment we have a curious situation in which Fianna Fáil councillors are imposing local charges in local authorities throughout the entire country except in Dublin.  On occasions I wonder how Deputy Flynn explained to the people in Castlebar that they must pay £90 per year by way of local charges when the people of Dublin have to pay no such charges.  Deputy Flynn from the Opposition benches was opposed to the imposition of any charges of any nature whatsoever to allow local authorities any financial independence in the area of <Col N="829" /> funding.  Now we have the curious example of the Minister covertly directing a campaign by the city and county managers to recover some £30 million of arrears of charges that he and members of his own party told people they were opposed to and that people should not pay.  The time has come for the Minister for the Environment to state what approach he intends to take and what policies he intends to implement to rationalise the whole area of local government finance.</P>
    <P>In the area of priorities, it is quite clear that the Government are laying the foundations for a major housing crisis in 1989.  The major reduction in the Estimates for the Department of the Environment by 20 per cent in the context of the building of new housing schemes will result in 1989 in the smallest number of new houses being built by local authorities since the commencement of this decade.  This Government are deliberately embarked upon a policy which is designed to reconstitute and re-establish the type of housing crisis we had towards the end of the seventies and which was resolved by my party in Government in the period 1982 to 1987.  That is an area which indicates where the Government have gone wrong in the context of their priorities.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment if he is going to appear in this House on the Estimates debate?  It is very difficult to get the Minister to respond publicly to criticisms that are voiced about the manner in which he runs his Department. If he is going to come to this House I challenge him to state how many new houses he believes the local authorities here will commence building next year; I challenge him to indicate how many people he believes will be on the waiting lists of local authorities by the end of 1989.  I believe we will find that the housing lists have quadrupled by the end of 1989.  We will again have people awaiting housing for three, four or five years and being told that unless they have three or four children and live in a bedsitter there is little real prospect of local authority housing being made available to them <Col N="830" /> anywhere in the country.  The Minister is presiding over a Department to which I believe he is giving no direction and in respect of which, in the context of some essential issues, he has lost control.</P>
    <P>In the area of financing the Minister has suggested he is increasing funding to enable essential repairs to be carried out on county roads.  That is untrue.  The Minister has so reduced the level of funding for local authorities that it is quite clear that far less work will be carried out on the repair of county roads in 1989 than was carried out in 1988 and what was done in 1988 was less than what was done in 1987.  We are very rapidly becoming a pothole Republic.  The Minister who is so prone to attending at the openings of various community centres and who loves a public relations expose will no doubt by the end of this year start arranging to cut ribbons at the appropriate largest potholes in the country and put up plaques on the side of them to record his contribution to the destruction of the roads here.</P>
    <P>We have seen a Minister who has abdicated responsibility in the area of the Structural and Regional Funds that are being provided by the EC.  In effect, what has happened is that this Minister has handed over to the Department of Finance all control over the use of Structural and Regional Funds.  This Minister has allowed the Minister for Finance to hijack the regional funding and has excluded any democratic input into the plans that are now being prepared by the Department of Finance to be submitted to the European Commission for this country to gain the benefit of Structural Funds in 1989.  It appears from a response I received to a Dáil question to the Minister for Finance that the Government are clearly considerably off-target and running dangerously late in the preparation of the necessary plans to be submitted to the EC to ensure that regional and social funding will be made available for the seven designated regions for the year 1989.  The Minister has clearly failed to live up to his responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I have is that within the <Col N="831" /> time allowed on an Estimates debate it is impossible to go through all of the areas it is necessary to cover.  Suffice it to say that we have a Minister in the Department of the Environment who lacks any coherent policy direction in any particular area and whose main imput is to try to arrange natty public relations exposes for himself and to duck appearing in public to answer the hard questions that require a response.</P>
    <P>We have something more serious; we have a Government who are now presiding over a lowering of standards in the area of government that I do not believe should be tolerated.  There are a number of examples of this.  In the course of the last few months we have seen, when this Government were freed from the controls of Dáil Éireann, the shoddy and scandalous abuse of lottery funds with Government Ministers rushing to functions holding cheques in the air and distributing the largesse from the public kitty as if it was a cheque written on their own bank account and looking for some public kudos for what they were doing.</P>
    <P>The lottery funds are being distributed in a way that is bringing the entire national lottery and the political system into contempt.  This is an area the Government are seeking to continue to abuse, resulting in politicians being held in disrepute.  I call on the Minister for the Environment to indicate, in the context of the various projects to which he has allocated moneys, how many of these are of a permanent nature and what he has done to ensure that these funds are well spent.  I call on him to state what criteria he applies to the distribution of funding.</P>
    <P>We have had the story of the Taoiseach's jewels.  At a time of financial stringency it is unacceptable that gifts of a substantial value, way beyond a token of esteem by one foreign leader to another, should be retained either by a Taoiseach or a Minister and that ministerial guidelines laid down as regards the receipt and retention of gifts be ignored.  It is unacceptable that we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs coming <Col N="832" /> into this House and stonewalling questions. I do not believe the people of Ireland think it is acceptable that the Taoiseach of the day or members of his family or other Government Ministers to be, as it is rumoured, are allowed to retain in their possession gifts that are alleged to be worth some hundreds of thousands of pounds provided by a foreign leader.  These gifts should be handed over to the State.  This issue should not be fudged or we will next have the spectacle of Ministers lining up at airports to show their appreciation and respect for visiting foreign dignatories in the hope that there might be dropped into their kitty some worthwhile gift they might rely on to assist them when finally they are put out to grass or leave this House to take up their pension.</P>
    <P>We have had the dishonest claims made by this Government in the context of job creation.  Published under the heading of the Government's job creation scheme there is the item on the payment of home improvement grants where it says the Government have decided to provide the Department of the Environment with an additional sum of £9 million this year for the payment of grants due to householders.  That item should not have appeared in a job creation scheme.  Every Government Minister knows that that £9 million will not create a single job in 1988 or 1989.  That £9 million is designated to repay moneys for works done in 1987 and 1988 for which the Government have not yet provided moneys where such moneys were previously allocated.  Why would the Government seek to mislead people by suggesting that that £9 million would create a new job?  It will not create a single new job and the Minister for the Environment is well aware of that.</P>
    <P>Finally, yesterday we had the extraordinary launch of the &ldquo;Lets get the lead out&rdquo; campaign by the Minister for the Environment to promote the use of unleaded petrol.  It was little more than a public relations campaign to get the Minister two minutes exposure on the nine o'clock news, because the Minister, <Col N="833" /> who is now wasting public funds on advertising on RTE to urge the general public to buy unleaded petrol, has not properly told the general public that most of them cannot buy it because most of the petrol companies are not selling it.  We have 300,400 garages here, only 36 of which sell unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>Why is this Minister wasting public funds advertising on the airwaves?  If the Minister is serious about tackling environmental pollution and about the Government living up to their obligations under the EC Directive relating to the reduction of lead in petrol what he should do and what the Minister for Finance should do is ensure that in the budget to be published next January there is a tax reduction on unleaded petrol so that that commodity would be cheaper than ordinary motor fuels by way of encouraging the general public to buy it and the petrol companies to sell it.  In the meantime, the Minister should not waste public moneys on a self serving advertising campaign in our national media.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now just one year since the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was adopted.  The programme has made and will continue to make a great contribution to the achievement of the Government's economic and social objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the economy in general, the climate for investment and, hence, employment prospects has improved dramatically. Interest rates are at their lowest level for many years, contrasting strongly with the situation in the UK. Inflation remains at 2 per cent and the economy is showing satisfactory growth. We are showing a substantial surplus on our balance of payments and our currency is strong.  The growing confidence in the economy is reflected in substantial inflows of capital.  I feel quite confident that this turnaround in the economy will lead to the generation of permanent employment opportunities.  Preliminary results of the labour force survey show an increase of 6,000 in employment between April 1987 and August 1988.  Surveys <Col N="834" /> conducted by the IDA and Shannon Development at the end of the third quarter for this year show that 14,500 new jobs have been created so far this year, so we are on course to achieve the overall industrial job target set in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  A further increase in employment is forecast for 1989 by the latest Economic Report of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The pay agreement negotiated in conjunction with the programme will help to achieve long term wage stability.  This helps the planning process of employers, including the State, and reduces the possibilities of industrial conflict.</P>
    <P>An analysis by my Department of private sector pay settlements agreed during 1988 to date shows that the vast majority of agreements follow the terms of the national agreements.  I see no reason to doubt that this will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>All the signs are that the programme will produce a period of industrial harmony unprecedented since the late fifties and early sixties.  Our most recent strike statistics show that 1988 is likely to be the best year for industrial peace for 25 years.</P>
    <P>The completion of the European internal market by 1992 will present us with a challenge to our competitiveness, but it will also create further new opportunities for development and progress.  It is generally accepted that the completion of the internal market will bring the greatest benefits to the stronger industrialised countries at the centre of the Community and that without additional measures the benefits to the regions on the periphery, although significant, will be somewhat less.</P>
    <P>This fact was recognised by the European Council when it agreed to double the resources of the Structural Funds for the less developed regions, including Ireland, by 1992.  The purpose of the doubling of resources is to enable those regions to narrow the gap in development and GDP which separates them from the wealthier regions of the Community.  In Irish money terms, in excess of seven billion pounds of the combined resources of the Regional Development Fund, the <Col N="835" /> Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Fund will be devoted exclusively to the less developed regions by 1993.</P>
    <P>The negotiation of the detailed regulations which will govern the working of the funds is still progressing in Brussels. The Government are doing everything possible to ensure that those regulations are framed in a way that ensures maximum opportunities for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Council of Ministers has already agreed that a special effort be undertaken by the Commission to concentrate resources on the least developed regions and that Ireland shall be among those regions.  Only last week, a top level team of Commission officials representing the three funds, and led by the Secretary-General of the Commission, visited Dublin for discussions on how the enlarged Structural Funds can best be used to help Ireland achieve its development objectives.  Next Friday the President of the European Commission will pay a similar visit to this country.</P>
    <P>My Department are participating in the preparation of the necessary comprehensive regional development plans, particularly in relation to plans for labour market services.  Local interests will be consulted and involved in the preparation of the plans.  The aim will be to combine the operations of the three Structural Funds, wherever possible, so as to achieve the maximum impact for development and to reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>In the area of the Social Fund, I hope to see an expansion of training programmes for young people, for the long term unemployed and for persons in new technology industries.  I also propose to expand the scope of opportunities especially for the long term unemployed. There are other aspects of the internal market which will directly affect Ireland's ability to benefit from its completion.  The importance of this wider &ldquo;social dimension&rdquo; is now fully accepted.</P>
    <P>Within this dimension, measures to improve the working environment and protect the health and safety of workers have been given considerable prominence. The adoption of reasonable <Col N="836" /> standards of safety and health at work and the prevention of unfair competition based on the exploitation of the safety and health conditions of workers are the principal objectives of an extensive programme in this area.</P>
    <P>The Commission will also be taking measures in other areas of social policy. The Government's approach to these various proposals will be constructive, taking into account the legitimate needs of workers and the implications for employers, particularly in the small and medium sized enterprises which predominate here.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market by 1992 will also result in the abolition of any remaining impediments to free movement of workers.  Irish workers have equal access along with other EC nationals to all job vacancies arising within the Community.  The range of jobs and volume of vacancies is likely to increase within the next few years and this, allied with labour shortages emerging in the more economically advanced member states, will provide a growing range of opportunities for Irish workers with the right skills and qualifications. The Government do not encourage emigration but, for those who choose to go, they will ensure that the best opportunities and conditions are available to them in other member states.</P>
    <P>The Government are particularly concerned with the plight of those who fail to plan properly or feel forced to emigrate. However the main answer to this problem lies in increasing employment opportunities at home.  The general economic improvement and new jobs now becoming evident will go a long way towards reducing the problem.  Assistance through FÁS and the new Youthreach programme should also assist those prone to emigration without the necessary preparation.  The sum of £250,000 was allocated in both 1987 and 1988 for grants which are paid by my Department, on the advice of DION, directly to voluntary organisations operating mainly in Britain.  Despite the Exchequer constraints the Government will maintain the grant for next year at this level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> A key factor in the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be the provision of an effective, co-ordinated training and labour market service which will meet the needs of Irish industry during the coming years.  The continuing influence of new technologies in the workplace, together with the completion of the single market, make it essential that high quality training is carried out in the most relevant and cost-effective way so that industry, and our workforce, can compete successfully in the new enlarged marketplace.</P>
    <P>FÁS was established in January this year.  It has already resulted in more co-ordinated and client-centred services to the unemployed.  Integrated regional structures have been established to reduce duplication.</P>
    <P>FÁS local offices have become &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; for manpower services. Regional planning mechanisms have been established and local plans drafted to improve the relevance of FÁS programmes to local circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of reviews of programmes have been or are being completed, to increase efficiency and effectiveness.  For example, in the case of enterprise programmes FÁS has established a comprehensive pilot programme in the north east.  I hope that this will results in simpler, more accessible assistance to individual entrepreneurs and community operations at all stages of enterprise start-up.  I hope that FÁS will be able to make the new unified programme available nationwide next year.</P>
    <P>In addition, FÁS is engaged in a major review of its services to industry and of apprenticeship training.  As a result the Training Advisory Service has been streamlined and a revised craft apprenticeship system should emerge shortly.  In particular I have asked FÁS to consider a system of apprenticeship based on standards achieved and to come up with proposals on financing which would minimise the currently substantial costs to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In fulfilment of a commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> FÁS last week established a Co-operative <Col N="838" /> Development Council.  The council will stimulate greater awareness of co-operatives, identify their needs and provide technical assistance, where appropriate, and will concentrate on worker co-operatives. I am confident that the potential of co-operatives for employment is considerable.</P>
    <P>In the coming year I propose maintaining the principal employment schemes at their existing activity levels. Indeed, the Government have decided that the employment incentive scheme, for which demand was falling, should be made more flexible to attract additional employers.</P>
    <P>Training programmes will also be maintained at the highest possible level consistent with proper targeting.  In this, I have asked FÁS to target their resources at those who are least able to succeed in jobs without such assistance. I know that demand for schemes, in particular the social employment scheme, exceeds availability and that the schemes provide real work opportunities of benefit to the community and the economy as a whole.  However, with limited resources, it is not possible to expand the programmes to satisfy all potential sponsors or participants at all times.</P>
    <P>As regards CERT, in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Government have recognised the contribution which the tourism sector can make to job creation and revenue.  In my own area CERT will continue to provide training and support services to underpin the industry's growth.  To attract the necessary foreign tourism, standards of quality, cost effectiveness and service must be brought to new levels.  The very real approval given by the industry to CERT's operations is evidenced by the major increase in financial support which the industry have agreed to make.  I am confident that the target I set of £0.5 million from the industry towards the annual cost of CERT's operations will be met.</P>
    <P>Both FÁS and CERT have considerable potential for development of overseas consultancies.  FÁS have just established their overseas subsidiary for profitable commercial work.  The new <Col N="839" /> company have taken over existing contract work by AnCO, worth up to £2 million annually, and are actively pursuing further opportunities.  Discussions have taken place with other relevant Irish and international organisations in order to put together a package with a wider range of services.  CERT, too, are satisfactorily developing their international consultancy work.</P>
    <P>The recent labour force survey has indicated a welcome increase in overall employment in this country.  However, I am concerned to ensure that special assistance is given to the more disadvantaged persons on the labour market who would not otherwise benefit from employment growth.  The principal categories in need are early school leavers and the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Early school leavers are particularly at risk &mdash; 55 per cent of them are unemployed a year after leaving school.  For them, a new programme, Youthreach, was introduced two weeks ago by my colleague, the Minister for Education, and myself.  This is a two year education, training and work experience programme for young people who leave school with few or no qualifications.  While the idea of special provision for this category is not new, there are important new elements. Firstly, it will cater for up to half the total number of early school leavers each year. Secondly, it offers a comprehensive, flexible and integrated approach on a nationwide basis.  Thirdly, it will last for two years instead of the present six months.  Fourthly, it will involve for unqualified school leavers a special vocational preparation and training programme with a regular weekly allowance, as well as programmes provided by FÁS. In the last analysis we want to reduce the incidence of early school leaving.  My colleague, the Minister for Education, will be making additional efforts within the school system to dissuade young people from leaving without qualifications.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the Youthreach programme is not merely remedial.  It offers a real chance for young people to catch <Col N="840" /> up on education and social skills development, and to acquire real vocational skills.  I am confident that it will go a long way towards overcoming the disadvantages which would otherwise restrict early school leavers to a future of, at best, precarious, badly paid, unskilled jobs.</P>
    <P>As regards long-term unemployment, I recognise that we must take additional steps to reduce its present appallingly high level &mdash; some 46 per cent of the unemployed have been out of work for more than a year.  These numbers are unlikely to decline significantly without special help.  In May this year I set up an interdepartmental committee to study the problems of the long-term unemployed, to assess the impact of current provision and to examine the prospects for the future.  This committee will be reporting to me shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to management training is based on a conviction that the formation and development of managers is vital for the success of individual firms and of the economy as a whole.  As a demonstration of that commitment, I appointed an advisory committee on management training in September of last year.  I expect to receive the committee's report in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope that with the co-operation of all concerned, we will be able to focus all our efforts on the development of our managers to release the full energy and dynamism of our workforce in the pursuit of faster economic growth and expansion of employment.  Particularly in the context of the completion of the internal market of the European Community, we must develop managers of the highest calibre if we are to compete effectively in international markets, respond to the challenges and seize the opportunities.</P>
    <P>As regards my legislative programme, I have already piloted three important pieces of legislation onto the Statute Book.  First, the legislation giving the statutory base for the amalgamation of the Manpower agencies has been enacted and FÁS has been established.  Secondly, <Col N="841" /> I have extended worker director arrangements to certain other State bodies and have provided for employee participation below board level in the vast majority of State-sponsored companies.  Thirdly, I have put through legislation providing for minimum standards in regard to safety on oil rigs.  The relevance of this legislation has become only too obvious as a result of recent events in the United Kingdom.  Comprehensive safety regualtions to implement the legislation are at present being drafted.</P>
    <P>As regards forthcoming legislation, I hope to introduce to the Oireachtas before Christmas two further substantial pieces of legislation on industrial relations and occupational safety and health.  Following the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, I am giving a high priority to a Bill to reform industrial relations, trade union and trade dispute law.  For too long this necessary reform has not been tackled.  I and my officials have had exhaustive discussions with the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions since early this year.  The major elements in the reform package will deal with restrictions on picketing, particularly secondary picketing; immunities in disputes; a requirement for secret pre-strike ballots; and changes relative to the granting of injunctions.</P>
    <P>My proposals will also include further measures to facilitate trade union amalgamtion and tighter conditions for licensing new unions.  Finally, I will be proposing the establishment of a labour relations commission with a pro-active brief, and changes in the structure and operation of joint labour committees.  I intend to put these proposals to Government very shortly with a view to introducing a Bill within two months.</P>
    <P>On safety and health legislation, a fundamental review has been completed, looking in particular at the recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety Health and Welfare at Work.  The Bill to make the necessary changes has now been drafted. I intend to introduce it in the Oireachtas in this session.  The Bill represents a <Col N="842" /> major extension of statutory safety and health protection to all employers, employees and the self-employed.  Each of these groups will have statutory general duties of care.  Each enterprise will have to assess their specific needs and risks and tailor a safety and health plan accordingly.  I will also be providing for the establishment of a new national authority, again with a pro-active brief.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these developments will help to reduce the still unacceptably high level of accidents and ill-health at work.  Just to put it in context, reportable accidents have continued to exceed 3,000 per annum in recent years and these represent only part of the problem.  Developments at European level are also becoming increasingly important in this field.  It is essential for us that new European measures should be suited to our predominantly small and medium-sized industries.  My Department will be doing their best to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Apart from these two areas, I initiated a review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, the employment equality legislation and the Payment of Wages Act.  I published a discussion document on this legislation in November of last year and I received a wide range of submissions.  In each of these areas I intend to put proposals to Government in the near future with a view to introducing legislation in due course.  In particular I hope that my proposals regarding payment of wages will enable full advantage to be taken of new technologies in order to reduce the security risks both to industry and individuals of cash payments.</P>
    <P>I have recently raised with the FUE and the ICTU the relevance of the conditions of employment legislation of the thirties.  I feel this legislation has become an embarrassment as it is so out of date. I have asked the FUE and the ICTU for their views on necessary measures to update this legislation.  I am also concerned at the vulnerability of part-time workers and will be looking at their statutory position as part of the review of the conditions of employment legislation.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the foreword to my discussion document on legislation, I am <Col N="843" /> conscious in considering legislation of the need to strike the correct balance between the needs of employers and employees.  It is important, on the one hand, that the incentive to create employment be not impaired.  On the other hand, there remains the need to protect employees from abuses.  I am confident that my proposals will, in fact, achieve that balance.</P>
    <P>The various measures and developments to which I have referred give clear evidence of the more integrated and harmonised approach which this Government have been able to take.  Within the short space of time remaining before 1992 it is vital that scarce resources be directed with precision at areas of real need.  We cannot squander them on duplicated or contradictory measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i>, the preparation of integrated plans for use of the reformed Structural Funds, the establishment of FÁS, the development of new client centred interventions, such as Youthreach, all demonstrate the potential of this new integrated approach.  I am confident that this will help to ensure that we get Ireland into the best position to take full advantage of the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>While the Exchequer allocation to FÁS has been reduced by some £8 million with some resulting reductions in ESF aid, the effects on activity for the priority client groups will be minimal.  Participation in the principle employment schemes will be maintained at existing levels.  Participation in training schemes will also be maintained for the priority client groups, the early school leavers and the long-term unemployed.  Any drop in activity will primarily reflect this targetting, for instance a drop in programmes for graduates.  This has been possible through tight control and the reduction of overheads through the establishment and streamlining of FÁS.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer allocation to CERT has been marginally increased over the 1988 level.  CERT will at least maintain existing activity levels and at present is assessing the possibility of additional <Col N="844" /> recruitment to both school leaver and unemployed programmes.  The allocation to the Department of Labour has been reduced by £450,000.  Most of the individual elements relate to reductions in staff numbers and improved effectiveness. The grant for trade union amalgamations has been increased by two-thirds to meet the cost of additional arrangements in 1989.  I understand that a large number of amalgamations is under consideration by trade unions and that the forthcoming industrial relations reform legislation will provide further encouragement for amalgamations.  The grant for trade union education and advisory services, and for the Employment Equality Agency, has been increased slightly, mainly to meet higher salary costs.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members of the House will wish to compliment the Government for early publication of the Book of Estimates, more than two months ahead of the new financial year, for the second year running.  This represents an opportunity for those beneficiaries of Government aid to receive notification of the allocation in time to be able to plan in advance.  Most Members have been critical of the fact that the Book of Estimates, and particularly the allocations to the different agencies, was not presented until April or May.  Those agencies were then asked to try to prepare a plan for that year and often that was not possible. Agencies now have an opportunity to decide how best to spend their allocation. I hope that that will continue in the years ahead because, as Members will agree, it was appalling that agencies that depended on Government funds did not receive notification of their allocation until four or five months into the year. The Government have succeeded in changing a bad system.  We heard a lot of talk about the need to do that for many years and this is the first time it has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Estimates represent a continuation of the Government's overall financial stragegy, the results of which are, as I have indicated, becoming increasingly obvious in all the relevant <Col N="845" /> economic indicators.  We all welcome that recovery.  It is unfortunate that the Government cannot do everything today but it is good to see that job targets are being reached and that jobs are being maintained.  I should like to call on those who have benefited from Government policies to see their way during 1989 when the slack has been taken up in manufacturing enterprises to do what they can to tackle the appalling statistics in relation to the long term unemployed.  It is to the private sector that we must look to create jobs from the benefits they reap from the Government's policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to take up a point referred to by the Minister in his closing remarks.  He reminded me of the time when the radio was referred to as the wireless, as it is by Deputy John Kelly.  At the time a well known figure made a five minute appeal on Sunday evening for guide dogs for the blind or some other meritorious cause. When I listened to the Minister end his speech by making an appeal to the private sector to please be concerned in the coming year about the scandalous number on the long term unemployed list I thought of those appeals.  His remarks have deepened my own sense of alienation and horror at the growing gap between what is being said here and the realities that surround us.  Indeed, the language used has a funeral parlour ethos to it; where one is speaking about the corpse it does not matter what one says because the corpse does not speak back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take up some of the points made in the three ministerial speeches we have had so far and in a number of the speeches from the Opposition. It should be remembered that the Department of Finance have jealously guarded the planning function in the history of administration in Ireland.  I will go further and say that they have a unique hostility in the history of western European states to the planning process.  In their day they looked with jaundiced and green eyes at the emergence of a new Department of economic and social planning. Like the deadly snake they waited <Col N="846" /> until the kiss of death had been given to that Department but, now that it has only to deal with the defused functions between the rather mercurial and eccentric Department of the Taoiseach which has all power but operating it in an accountable way, they still retain the right to prepare the speech of the Minister for Finance for the opening of the debate on the Estimates.</P>
    <P>What I find curious in this so-called republic of ours is how we can listen to one speech after another without any attempt to relate the financial or economic strategy we are supposed to be following. That strategy is derived from a unique consensus on this small island, shared by Members on my left who say that not enough is being done to get rid of public service jobs while others want to get rid of more people from the different services.  In my view 90 per cent of Members agree on an approach towards the economy, or so we are told.  The Minister's statement, and the reaction to it, is an attempt to judge what took place last year and what is proposed for next year.  The realm of financial arrangements here is being tested against the hard ideological principles of the consensus that exists in the House at present.  It is not being contested against the reality of those who wish to work but cannot, those who are emigrating, those who are sinking below the poverty line and so on. It is as if in a time when Dean Swift's creation, Gulliver, was being trooped through the streets of Dublin and Galway we had managed a type of unique dissociation with the people.</P>
    <P>In one speech after another Members are talking about a de-peopled economy. I spent a lot of my time more than 20 years ago teaching the history of economic thought.  At that time it was not referred to as political economy but as economics.  Later I taught political science and sociology.  I could understand in a university that has its own schizophrenic practices, where careers have to be carved, where Chairs have to be won and so on, having this type of divided version of the world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> It would be a type of harmless academic eccentricity but it gets to the level of acute danger when people discuss economics without any reference to people.  In the speeches we have heard so far, those long tedious pieces of language all in the same vein &mdash; light at the end of the tunnel; prospects breaking out on all sides &mdash; I found it hard to understand the meaning of them.  It would not be safe to make speeches like that in many pubs in Ireland.  People would laugh at them, at least.  Such speeches do not mean anything.</P>
    <P>I should like to test some of the assumptions deriving from this 90 per cent ideological sunshine we have around the place.  One fact, and it is one that my first year students 20 years ago could understand, is that there is no necessary connection between a rise in exports and job creation.  In several speeches in this House I made the point that there was an increase in exports in the seventies. For a number of reasons such as the weak linkages in the economy, the fact that a great deal of the exports were inflated, transfer pricing and so on, you could not assume that an increase in exports or even an increase in favourable terms of trade would automatically result in job creation.  Yet, that is precisely what the Government are doing again this year. Thankfully, people do not have to rely on my comments for this.  In the book by the Economic and Social Research Institute, <i>The Economic Development of Ireland in the Twentieth Century</i>, written by Kieran A. Kennedy, Thomas Giblin and Deidre McHugh and published this week by Routledge, there are some interesting comments on this particular fallacy which has informed the Government's thinking which is shared by Fine Gael and which is uniquely developed by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell last night had the idea that once all these incentives towards production has been set up, employment would result as surely as night follows day.  Would that the history of economic performance fitted Deputy McDowell's version of reality.  Tragically <Col N="848" /> it does not.  I quote from the volume I mentioned, which states on page 252:</P>
    <P>There are darker shares in the picture, however.  In particular the problem of labour surplus has never really been solved.  Total employment is 12 per cent less than it was in the mid-1920s, while the unemployment rate never even in the best of times went much below 5 per cent of the labour force and is now over 18 per cent.  In addition, net emigration since 1922 has amounted to over 1 million persons, and though checked in the 1960s and 1970s has resumed in the 1980s at a rate close to the natural increase in population.  Despite the impressive overall progress of manufacturing production and exports, the indigenous industrial base remains perilously weak, while in agriculture the majority of farms are still below the threshold of viability.  Furthermore, Irish economic development has been accompanied by an enormous increase in national debt, which now constitutes a major constraint on further development measures by government.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is striking that many of the areas in which progress has been made have serious negative dimensions.</P>
    <P>It goes on to mention some very interesting points.  I am not one for long quotations but there is one that is very important which is related to the point about exports, that is, the dramatic increase in what it describes as the pattern of the outflow of profits, dividends and royalties.  These are referred to in that volume on pages 190 and 191.  It states:</P>
    <P>The other major factor responsible for the change in investment flows was the emergence of a large outflow of what are described as &lsquo;profits, dividends, royalties&rsquo;.  They rose from £128 million (2½ per cent of GNP) in 1977 to £1,321 million in 1985 (10 per cent of GNP), and are mainly associated with the rapid development in the last <Col N="849" /> decade of the so-called &lsquo;sunrise&rsquo; industries &mdash; notably pharmaceuticals and electronics.  These industries are dominated by multi-national firms, export nearly all their output, and account for most of the rapid increase in Irish manufacturing exports since 1980.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Brennan, when talking about trade figures, should bear in mind one of their comments on page 239 which is:</P>
    <P>The new foreign enterprises were highly export-orientated.  In 1983 exports of all foreign firms amounted to 82 per cent of their total sales, compared with 34 per cent in all Irish firms, and the latter figure was much less outside the food sector.</P>
    <P>This is simple evidence that there is no necessary connection between increases in exports and a favourable balance of trade and the automatic creation of jobs. That fallacy is not addressed in the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>There are two fallacies, one about the relationship between export growth and employment and the second is in relation to what might be called &mdash; the language is dropping a little but the language of last year is still there &mdash; this essentially meteorological approach to economics, the idea that favourable conditions &mdash; weather, if you like &mdash; are getting better for the Irish economy.  Before I came in this morning I was looking at the old newsletters of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They used to say if only we had the same costs as the rest of Europe, if only inflation was at the European average and if only there were opportunities and so on there would be an automatic expansion and we would make our contribution to the revitalisation of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Now the inflation rate compares quite well with that in Europe, the export conditions are quite favourable, interest rates are lower than in Britain, labour productivity levels compare very favourably with every European country and still they have something else to say.  They moan about increases in employers' costs <Col N="850" /> and so on.  That is what makes it particularly pathetic to listen to a Minister for Labour end his speech saying he would like to make an appeal to the Irish private sector to create jobs that might impact on unemployment.  He did not mention the dirty word &mdash; never mentioned by Fianna Fáil now &mdash;&ldquo;emigration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why are we asking people to believe in this subversive ignorance about the economy?  Emigration is running at 35,000 per year at present.  After 1992 it will run at 25,000.  We are exporting people for the primary reason of our failure to provide them with economic and social opportunities at home.  We have between 18 per cent and 19 per cent &mdash; I mention the 18 to 19 band so as not to get involved in arguments about decimal points &mdash; unemployment.  There is evidence from several sources of people sinking below the poverty line.  Are we not interested in these structural problems? Can we not compare the Government strategy for the coming year or the past year with these human realities? Instead, we are indulging in this deadly game, where the three parties of the Right compare the economic projections of the Government not with these human realities that are so important but with their own deeply-held Right-wing ideological prejudices.  For example, there is this bogus notion that if you take the external constraints on the economy and get them right, automatically the economy will benefit in terms of employment creation, for which I challenge the Government to show any evidence whatsoever in the economic literature.</P>
    <P>Now long regarded as unfashionable and totally neglected is any attempt to look at the pattern of distribution within this country.  An ordinary person might be entitled to ask a rather simple question &mdash; is it efficient or is it necessarily productive to have a more unequal or a less unequal society?  That question needs to be asked not only in terms of productivity and efficiency but even if you were Right-wing and you wanted to argue about where the burden of responsibility lay for the effects of what might have been overexpenditure in the past, you should be <Col N="851" /> able to point to where that over-expenditure had occurred.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister and his colleagues stand here and say that an elderly person who goes into the Regional Hospital in Galway or anywhere else for an operation must now, because of a change in economic strategy, be forked out of the hospital in three days and not allowed to recover?  Are you entitled to say to some child who was not born at the time of the great O'Donoghue expansion scheme that he or she may not now repeat the leaving certificate, may not repeat a year at school or must pay an enormous fee? Is this part of the new ethic?</P>
    <P>In economic theoretical terms what the Minister is spouting is gross ignorance and what he is being supported in is a kind of ribald, macho, careless attitude to whether people live or die.  Every now and then we get that outbreak of Populist opportunism when people have supported the cuts and then speak out when their local school or hospital is being closed, as if there was no necessary connection between voting in favour of the Estimates here or sitting on your hands here and then whingeing later about your local school.  That is part of the dishonesty that has degraded Irish politics and which is one of the unique contributions of the Right to Irish political life.</P>
    <P>There are other points I want to make. The antiquarian section of the Right wing parties come in here and start spouting about the Left and their ideological approach to the economy.  Let me lay it very clearly on the line.  I do not believe in any ideology.  I believe that politics derive from a certain set of values or beliefs about the nature of the political process.  I think economics, if they are to be valid, have to refer to such a political vision and such an ideological view.  What the Right are too cowardly to state is that their deeply held ideology is based on a retarded greedy individualism that will export one's neighbour in the emigration boat and does not necessarily care about the rising level of unemployment.  It looks on at the destruction of the education and <Col N="852" /> health services.  Because of the dominance of the locations of thinking in this country it is able to produce all these great gunges of language with their blatant fallacious views, that if only you can lash yourself enough there is some healthy outcome at the end of the day. This is as sick as those perverse extreme versions of religion that used to advise such lashings in the monasteries long ago.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast between the ideology of the Left and the Right.  It is time that people had the guts to state the differences openly.  The left believe in the location of politics and the economy in a view of inter-personal and mutual dependency and of the necessity for us to care about the shape of society and to constantly test economic measures against human values.  The view of the Right is that the economy is dissociated from any social and political vision.  Where we discern a political or social vision it is based on a revived radical individualism.  Thus, they see nothing wrong that two citizens may be born in the same ward of a hospital and as they go through life one may be naturally entitled to pay an increment and thus be able to purchase private access to the health service, not because he or she has paid for it, but because they are able to top up that payment. They see nothing wrong with taking educational facilities developed by the State with taxpayers' money and making them available for private cramming sessions for people who will now be repeating the leaving certificate.</P>

      <P>I believe I have only one minute to speak on the three areas for which I am spokesman.  The last Minister who spoke said he hoped that with the co-operation of his colleague there will be a new deal for school leavers.  However, I will have an opportunity to debate this when the Minister for Education's Estimate comes up but I would like to know what this new deal means.  The capital costs were cut by £8 million.  There was <Col N="853" /> an 8½ per cent rise in college fees last year followed by a 9 per cent rise this year.  The examination fees for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations have been raised.  The new theory on access to education is that it is good for people to struggle.</P>
      <P>In the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs there is a figure of £1,000 for disaster relief.  We are recognised as an obscenity in the world community by taking money from the lottery that we refused to provide in Foreign Affairs and sending it to the Sudan.</P>
      <P>May I conclude by referring to the Gaeltacht?  A report out yesterday from Údarás na Gaeltachta establishes that despite all the promotional work to attract new industries they have not a penny to provide the space needed to allow the jobs to be performed.  We are witnessing the annual exercise of hypocrisy, the annual degradation of language and the annual insult to the Irish people, particularly those who are suffering.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are 20 minutes available to each speaker but I would have enjoyed listening to Deputy Higgins for some time longer.  Undoubtedly he approaches the problems in Ireland from a viewpoint different from mine but that does not mean that there is not a lot of justification in much of what he says.</P>
      <P>Some progress has been made with regard to the Estimates for 1989.  I just do not want to speak about the progress in the figures because as an accountant I know how easy it is to confuse people by spouting a great many statistics.  I am afraid I have to agree with Deputy Higgins when he says that the people in the pubs talk about gross national product, debt ratios and current budget deficits. I remember, during the last number of elections, everybody speaking about this on the doorsteps but 99.9 per cent of people did not understand it and if a current budget deficit got up and ate them they would not know what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that some progress has been made in the national finances and I think I can claim some credit for this because <Col N="854" /> of some of my utterings in the past.  I think that some progress has been made regarding the stabilisation of the debt ratio.  I readily recognise that the Estimates for 1989 are only one side of the story.  However, the real progress that has been made in Irish society generally relates to the attitudes people have taken since the publication of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>I have read that some people think that the Minister's cutting exercise has not gone far enough.  I am long enough in this House &mdash; I am here since 1977 &mdash; to realise that this is a remarkable change in attitude.  The politicians follow the lead of the people and unfortunately it has very seldom been the other way round. The politicians usually wait until the people have headed off in one direction before they decide to catch up with them and say: &ldquo;there goes the mob, I must follow them.&rdquo; That is the reality of Irish political life.  There has been a remarkable transformation in the 11 years I have been in this House when the media, the people and some of the politicians say that the cutting exercise does not go far enough.  A few years ago if anyone proposed similar Estimates to those being proposed now for 1989 there would be uproar and consternation about the cuts. This shows that people are now able to face up to the reality of the position we are in.  In my opinion that is the real progress that has been made over the past seven years and particularly in the past two years.</P>
    <P>This is a remarkable transformation.  It is remarkable when one sees opinion polls that show that 60 per cent or more of the people say that more cuts have to be made.  I think it is remarkable what has happened in the past couple of years and just shows how things turn about. Ninety per cent of the politicians in this House are affecting the attitude of what is abroad rather than the other way round.  In the past various Governments paid much lip service to the financial problems the State was facing.  This has been a talking point since 1978-79 but all of the previous Governments only talked about it, and let on to be doing something about it while in reality we all kept going <Col N="855" /> the other way and the situation became worse.  It should go on record that the present attitude of the Fine Gael Party, particularly their Leader, Deputy Alan Dukes, has been a great help to the Government.  It has helped the political realisation of the country and it has certainly helped the Government in pursuing their programme.  Although some people might think that Deputy Dukes has been committing political suicide during the past year I have been on record as saying that in the long term there will be gains for his party because of the attitude he has adopted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am bigheaded enough to think that I have a certain credibility because of my whole attitude to the public finances.  I am a firm supporter of the line the Government have been taking during the past two years.  Many years ago I got into difficulty with my own party for espousing some of the things that I now hear Ministers say they are doing.  I remember losing the Whip for advocating the same things in public many years ago.  I suppose it is progress of a sort when eight years later we have come to the point from which we should have started in the first place.</P>
    <P>It might sound bigheaded but I could claim some of the responsibility for our pursuing the new rightwing economics we are now pursuing or that perhaps 90 per cent of the Members of this House are pursuing.  These policies are based on reality.  I said many years ago that if we continued on the road on which we had embarked at that time we would end up in financial ruin and would not be in a position as a State to provide health, education or any other services for any section of the population.</P>
    <P>People approach our economy from different standpoints but my policy is based on pragmatism and realism.  Our economic problems have been created because over the past 15 years successive Governments have failed to grasp the reality that we must live within our means.  We aspired to living standards of other countries but we would not recognise that we do not have the wealth of <Col N="856" /> other countries.  We provided ourselves with a level of public services which, although necessary and desirable, we could not afford.  Over the past 15 years in successive budgets we agreed to spend X on a current level of public services but we only proposed to collect Y in levels of taxation and to make up the difference in borrowing.  We successfully borrowed for donkeys' years resulting in higher and higher levels of taxation while still not reaching a point where we could pay off the debts we had accumulated.  As someone who has been to the forefront in this debate over a long number of years, I would maintain that the settling of the debt is not an end in itself.</P>
    <P>The current level of political activity is fraught with dangers.  It should not be an end in itself to have the books balanced. Until recently it was considered good politics for political parties to agree to provide an airport, a runway, a school or whatever during election time and to provide the money for these things.  In 1980 and 1981 I said that this was ridiculous from a financial point of view and that it was bad politics.  Nowadays it is considered good politics to promise more and more cuts.  Everybody wants to get in on the act by offering to cut deeper and deeper because that seems to be the politics of today.  It might be news to some people that I hold these views, but without any shadow of doubt I originated this type of debate on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, the debate about getting the economy back on the rails.  I remember that members of the Opposition party spoke about this before me or around the same time but on this side of the House I was in the forefront for a long number of years in saying that we had to live within our means.  It appears that today the way to get votes is to pile cutback upon cutback, to hit harder and harder, and to hell with the poor and the unemployed.  That is the danger of the new politics.  We should not regard the balancing of the books as an end in itself.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the light at the end of the tunnel but the reality is that we have not yet reached the point of equilibrium between the cost of public <Col N="857" /> services and taxation.  Until we do we will not improve the lot of many sectors of our society.  We have still not reached a point where the level of taxation in any one year will equal the level of current expenditure and until we do we will not solve the problem.  Comments from politicians and media people in the past couple of months seem to indicate that the debt problem has been solved and that we can now move onwards.  The problem is not solved, there is a danger that we will build up a level of expectation and that we will crash down and go down the same road again.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in suggesting that we have now solved the problem of the debt. Many times I have debated these issues with Deputy Higgins and I have always enjoyed the debates.  I do not mind saying that I am a capitalist and of the right wing in Irish society.  Deputy Higgins holds a different philosophy but at least I can always understand what he says although we approach things from a different point.  Although Deputies may talk about the light at the end of the tunnel, before we reach that point of equilibrium there is a danger that parties will be vying with each other to make tax cuts.  If we are going to make tax cuts surely they should apply at the lower end of the scale?  I have heard that we are going to reduce the top rates of taxation.  We should realise that the people who have suffered most from the economic measures we have taken over the past couple of years are the poor.  The services that have been cut back have impinged on them although it is not the poor who have caused the problem.  If we reach the point of equilibrium, surely at that stage we should restore some of the services to make things better for the poorer sections of society who have suffered most under the cutbacks.  However, even though we have not yet reached the point of equilibrium we have started to talk about giving tax cuts to the wealthy, the people who have jobs, people like me who pay tax at 58p in the pound.  Surely there is no moral justification for giving more to the haves than to the have nots?  The danger is that it is electorally appealing <Col N="858" /> because the poor do not vote in as large numbers as do the middle and upper classes.  The politicians appeal at election time to the haves in society.</P>
    <P>There would be no moral justification in engaging now in tax cuts for the better off in society without increasing the level of services.  There is no economic validity in the suggestion that we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Rubbish is being written by the politicians to the effect that these tax cuts would be the engine of new economic growth.  That is a load of nonsense.  We tried this before in 1977. We narrowed the tax base by giving effective tax cuts by way of reduced tax on motor cars and reduced rates to the people who have.  The poorer people do not have cars so doing away with motor tax did not mean anything to them.  Poor people did not pay huge rates on private houses because they did not have private houses, they were living in tenancies.  Yet we are talking about giving the well off people tax cuts.  We tried that philosophy before.  There is no moral justification at all for doing it again.  We must reach the point of equilibrium between the cost of public services and taxation.  When that is achieved, then we can look at policy decisions.  At that stage we have to decide that level of health service we want and whether we can improve it.  We must wait until we get to that point.</P>
    <P>I must profess an interest in the tax amnesty because I am a practising chartered accountant.  I have heard rubbish from some politicians speaking on the radio about this matter.  I have not heard one person congratulating the self-employed on the amount of money which has been coughed up.  People seem to think that £500 million was in back pockets, building societies or banks but the reality is that the majority of the self-employed people, who are finding life as tough as everybody else, had to go to banks and institutions and borrow to the hilt.  I know people who have had to mortgage their houses and put themselves into considerable debt.  I will not gain any votes by speaking on behalf of <Col N="859" /> the self-employed but I wish to congratulate them.</P>
    <P>I would sound two warnings about the tax amnesty.  I have great respect for the Department of Finance but they grossly underestimated the amount of money outstanding.  This leads me to believe that they may not be great at estimating the real state of the economy.  They also underestimated the amount of money expected to be raised by the national lottery.  If an estimate of £30 million is out by £5 million that is not too bad, but when the estimated yield is £30 million and the amount raised is £500 million, that is a serious miscalculation.  It is like backing a horse which was not even entered in a race.  The fact that £500 million has been taken out of the economy will, in my opinion, restrict growth next year in the retail sector.  The Department of Finance should be cautious in estimating figures for tax buoyancy and growth in the economy because of the impact of the tax amnesty.  There will be a depression of sorts due to the amnesty and the moneys collected.</P>
    <P>We have made some small progress during the past two years.  If the Government can keep their nerve and do not go off on a tangent regarding tax cuts we will arrive at a situation of equilibrium. Then we can start making progress. Expenditure is only one side of the equation and I look forward to seeing the taxation side when the budget is announced.  In general I welcome the Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how much I enjoyed the contributions of the previous two speakers, which were well worth listening to.  I will confine my remarks to the Health Estimate, which is my particular responsibility within Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timing of this debate is somewhat premature in so far as only the total amounts of money in the Health Estimate are available.  We do not know as yet the amount of money to be allocated to each individual health board and hospital. <Col N="860" /> This, coupled with the lack of information about any increased charges in the budget next January, make it only possible for Fine Gael to defer any final approval of the level of the Health Estimate for 1989 until this information becomes available and the outturn for 1988 is known.</P>
    <P>In overall terms we note a net increase of £26 million on the current side of the health budget and a reduction of £3 million on the capital side.  Within these subheads there are various increases and decreases, the broad pattern of which we support in so far as highest priority in terms of percentage increases seem to have been given to health boards and hospitals as opposed to general administration and other expenditure.  Fine Gael's priority is to ensure that the maximum amount of health expenditure actually goes into either preventing or curing illness.  As this debate occurs in the same week as the Private Members' motion on the health services, I have decided to take this opportunity not to reiterate some of those topics but to outline what I feel are major care gaps in our health services that need to be given priority consideration in 1989 and beyond as our coherent action plan is evolved in each area.  Unless we have such a clear focus on patient needs, as opposed necessarily to demands, we will not improve the quality or quantity of health in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that at no stage has the Minister set out goals in terms of health policy of increased life expectancy or improved quality of life in terms of health care and thus the very goals of the health service have not been clearly laid out. This overall sense of direction must be an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority is the area of waiting lists for hospital treatments.  We must immediately recognise the extent of this problem and deal with it effectively. I am concerned about the lack of training in medical schools for consultants in terms of management of waiting lists to ensure that priority is given on the basis <Col N="861" /> of clinical need alone.  There are, I understand, some 3,400 public patients on waiting lists related to the Mater Hospital. There are some 23,000 people awaiting orthodontic services and there is a two and a half to three year wait for 1,000 children for some ENT operations in children's hospitals.  The cardiac waiting list has grown from 20 to 100 in Crumlin since June.  I believe the only solution to this problem is to allow a certain proportion of the total health budget to be issued to certain hospitals on a contract basis to deal with severe waiting lists.  This would involve an independent evaluation of need and a set fee per operation paid to the particular hospital.  Unless we move radically in this direction urgently what were elective admissions to hospital will become urgent admissions and the whole system will become self-defeating with a spiral of unplanned, more expensive health care.  Through this contract system one can ensure the best value for money so that perhaps more routine treatments are not done in expensive teaching hospitals, principally in Dublin.  Under these proposals chief executive officers of health boards would have a discretionary option to shop around for health services to meet particular needs of patients in their area.  To ensure the maximum number of treatments for public patients I would ask the Minister to urgently review the current ratio of consultants to non-consultant hospital doctors, which I understand at the present time stands at 1 to 1.6. In my view this coupled with the loose terms of the common contract allow too much latitude for development to deal with private waiting lists as opposed to public ones.  Also as part of the review of waiting lists we could assess, on a national basis, if we have too many of the wrong type of beds and too few of other types of needed acute beds.</P>
    <P>The next area of priority in my view relates to the elderly.  Between now and the year 2006 figures from the CSO show that there will be a 7 per cent increase in the number of persons over 65 years of age and a 20 per cent increase in the number of persons over 75 years of age. <Col N="862" /> Fine Gael's priority is to ensure that elderly people live out their lives with dignity and independence.  It is estimated that only 4 per cent of the elderly require institutional care.  It has never been properly assessed what percentage of this requirement is hospice care.</P>
    <P>The direction, therefore, that I would like to see policy for the elderly taking is: (a) Special positive discrimination for target groups of old age pensioners living alone and those over 75 years in all circumstances; (b) An effective community health programme which would provide sheltered housing for those in need with the necessary back-up of public health nurse visitations and an alarm system within; (c) To redefine the role of &ldquo;carers&rdquo;, be they relatives or home helps, with special financial support for them other than the present restricted prescribed relatives allowance scheme and with the necessary back-up facilities by way of respite service for full time carers when they go on holidays and for weekends; (d) The provision within each community care area of a proper geriatric assessment unit involving co-ordination of all facets of health services, including consultant and general practitioner opinion, public health nurse and administrative personnel.  Based on the work of these assessment units, the provision for geriatric patients of adequate beds especially in the winter other than in acute hospital, for example, through the development of private nursing homes with high standards of exclusive geriatric facilities at low cost; and (e) A national network of day care centres with the necessary back-up transport facilities and occupational therapists in the region to ensure that elderly people can have the minimum level of institutional care.</P>
    <P>Our third area of care is the mentally handicapped.  The first problem in this area is the lack of adequate statistics to gauge the extent of the problem.  It is obvious, however, that the percentage of incidence of mental handicap in Ireland is higher than abroad.  It is estimated that there are some 23,000 people having some level of handicap and that there is an additional need for a day service for <Col N="863" /> some 2,000 persons, plus an additional 1,000 places for full time residential care and there are some 2,000 mentally handicapped patients who should not be but are currently in psychiatric hospitals.  All the while, the excellent Robbin's report of 1974 is gathering dust in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>National lottery funds should be earmared for the capital and current needs of the mentally handicapped as a matter of priority.  For this and other disabilities we must look at the area of greater genetic counselling on the preventative side because this is practically non-existent in the country at the present time.  Another area where I feel there can be ample development, given such high levels of unemployment, is in the area of voluntary helpers.  We need to bring some sort of structure and uniform remuneration especially for younger people providing back-up to residential or day care centres. There is adequate scope in existing schemes outside of the health care area such as the social employment scheme, Teamwork, etc., to provide badly needed assistance at reasonable cost to the State.</P>
    <P>My next area of priority is the disabled generally.  In the early eighties there was much debate and expectation concerning developments for the disabled who form 10 per cent of our population.  Unfortunately, the grasping of these issues was watered down subsequent to the publication of the Green Paper on the Disabled. There is an urgent need for a Bill of Rights for the disabled covering all ranges of disability.  This would include such issues as: rights of income maintenance; a 2 per cent quota for the disabled for all employers employing over 30 people; access to public buildings; a programme with EC support for sheltered employment given that so many of our vocational training establishments such as Rehab and others are simply silted-up due to the lack of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Minister has made no progress in these areas in spite of the fact that many of these issues do not <Col N="864" /> necessarily involve extra resources, but rather a political priority.</P>
    <P>My next area of concern relates to the dental services.  A classic example of the negative health care effect of applying cash limits to health boards is the casualty of non-statutory services, such as optical and dental services for medical card holders.  We see the effective abolition of the 1979 <i>ad hoc</i> scheme whereby many medical card holders were referred to dental practitioners for various treatments. At the present time, there is simply no service for adult medical card holders other than tooth extractions related to levels of pain.  This means that many old age pensioners are being asked to pay for the provision of dentures and for younger persons there is no immediate treatment of dental decay.  It is estimated that some 20 per cent of the population of over 35 years of age require dentures and obviously, as the demographic pattern rises, the incidence of demand is greater.  Our orthodontic service is virtually non-existent, with only one health board employing a salaried orthodontist and with exorbitant fees being charged for private patients.  To date, the Minister has relied on reference to the Working Party Report on the Dental Service.  I would call on him immediately to publish this report and to state what decisive measures he is going to take to implement some of the gaps that it recognises in our dental services.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will be shortly publishing a major policy document on our dental services which will address these major concerns.  Included in these proposals will be a rationalisation of dental schemes between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health, a proper career structure for dental auxiliaries, such as denturists, dental technicians, DSAs, etc., in order to promote a more costeffective service and a comprehensive emphasis on prevention among other matters.  I will freely acknowledge that this is one area that does require additional resources.  It is obligatory for the Minister for Health to recognise this and to provide, within any reallocation or <Col N="865" /> through the provision of extra resources, finance for this important area.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the child care services. In any definition of quality of health, dealing with child abuse must be of top priority.  It is estimated &mdash; and one must acknowledge that statistics are sketchy &mdash; that we have an abuse level of somewhere in the order of 50 per 100,000 children. Some of the necessary reforms will be dealt with in this Dáil session through the passage of the Child Care Bill.  This will place additional burdens on our health boards, both in terms of extra skilled personnel, improved residential facilities and perhaps legal costs.  Fine Gael will be setting out in the debate on the Bill our specific requirements in this area and how they should be financed.  It is imporant that more and more services are not simply tacked on to an already overburdened health service without the necessary re-organisation and planning. If this is allowed to continue, it will only result in a further overall deterioration in all facets of the health service, as opposed to trying to deal with new special and social problems.</P>
    <P>While referring to children, I am also concerned that some hospitals are not fully implementing the Department of Health's circular in relation to the welfare of children in hospital and would ask the Minister to carry out a review of this area through his Department to ensure that proper play areas are provided within hospitals and parents are given full and free access to their children.</P>
    <P>The next area of concern is that of the voluntary organisations.  Because of the changing and diverse health needs I believe the health services should retain the maximum flexibility in dealing with varied specialist problems.  Therefore I favour a greater contracting out to voluntary organisations to meet these specialist needs.  I am referring to such problems as autism, the needs of the deaf, the problem of arthritis, to name but two.  Excellent work is being done by a myriad of organisations many of which are under the umbrellas of UVOH, NAMHI and the mental health assocations. I am aware that many individual <Col N="866" /> organisations receive financial support under section 55 of the 1975 Health Act, in grants from health boards.  I support strongly this concept within the health services and would hope at overall governmental level that greater consideration would be given to tax exemption on covenants and donations to health related charities and that a clearer policy of support in overall terms from the national lottery should be given to help generally, which is strongly supported in recent opinion poll surveys.  It is remarkable to think that other facets of Irish life, such as sporting and cultural activities, receive more positive tax treatment than vital health care services.  Moreover, in order to harness the work of voluntary fund-raising the question of VAT on equipment should be written off, if there is prior approval, on any item of medical plant or equipment.  This would also ensure that such fund-raising would go into the most vital areas of need.</P>
    <P>Within the 56,000 people employed in the health service, there are special and unique problems for the nursing profession. I am most concerned about the problems of this profession.  I understand from An Bord Altranais that this year already the level of applications for emigration certification runs at 1,800.  There is a well documented problem of full-time temporary nurses requiring permanent appointments and a proper career structure. Morale is very low among student nurses.  In specialist hospital areas, for instance, cardiac surgery and some oncology work, there seems to be either a lack of organisation or adequate nursing staff to ensure that technicians are working at an optimum rate.  To meet these problems, the Minister should first acknowledge that in the short term it is cheaper to have permanent nurses rather than full-time temporary ones simply because of the PRSI structure whereby for temporary nurses the employer's share is 12.4 per cent and the employee's share is 7.5 per cent.  For permanent nurses the respective figures are 2.3 per cent of gross salary and 3.2 per cent of gross salary.  This comes to a net difference of 14.2 per cent of gross pay that <Col N="867" /> can be saved by appointing permanent nurses instead of temporary ones &mdash; a major saving in the short term.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge due to the incremental pay scale of nurses that there are medium-term costs through permanent appointments.  I also knowledge the Minister's recent appointment of 850 people generally in the health service, which proves that his embargo did not work and was totally unsuited to the health service with a high turnover of staff.  This number is simply inadequate for the nursing profession. I call on the Minister immediately to carry out a national study into nurse-patient needs and ratios, especially for specialist areas, to ensure the basis for norms and subsequent adequate staffing levels.  Such a study is a prerequisite to ensuring adequate staffing in the areas of operating theatres, intensive care units and casualty departments.  Also, at ward sister level the managerial role has been underestimated in terms of level of stock control for supplies and personnel deployment.  I would ask the Minister to urgently look at this area in terms of the necessary back-up training under An Bord Altranais.  The greatest cost factor in nursing arises from the nature of requirements through a 168 hour week. The most effective way to get better nursing levels at the same level of cost is through the maximum level of the fiveday week and day surgery facilities.  This is the way to ensure better care in terms of more nurses per patient at less cost. This policy direction is also the only way in my view to meet the difficulties in implementing the Labout Court decision relating to a maximum 65 hour week for junior doctors.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to EC initiatives.  I note that in 1988 the level of financial contributions from the EC for the health services is of the order of £26 million. Under new arrangements for the Structural Funds between now and 1992, I can see major opportunities in new finance for health infrastructure and I would call on the Minister to immediately integrate his Department's proposals with the Government's submissions in this regard <Col N="868" /> and made a clear statement to the House on this topic.  Specifically, I would like to see greater EC co-ordination and policy harmonisation in the following three areas.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it seems to me nonsensical that in each member state there is our equivalent on the National Drugs Advisory Board carrying out expensive and detailed studies and testing on new drugs that become available.  This work urgently needs to be co-ordinated and rationalised so that if approval is given in one country, such as France, it could apply commonly throughout the Community. Discussions should take place on a common approval system and we should initiate it immediately.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is no doubt that with technological developments the cost of certain treatments for very rare illnesses is so prohibitive as to prevent us from having such facilities in each EC member state.  The orderly development of such high tech facilities should be done at Community level with subsequent common access for public patients.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I have referred earlier to the difficulties of the disabled in finding employment.  It is illogical, and unfair, that European Social Funding is only available for vocational training as opposed to sheltered employment.  I would call on the Minister to ensure at EC level that at least on a pilot basis initially ESF funding is extended to sheltered work as it is negativing excellent work being done in the vocational training area due to lack of turnover of participants.</P>
    <P>These are but three examples of areas where an integrated EC approach can grapple more effectively with health care problems on a trans-national basis rather than each country individually finding it impossible to balance the equation of increased health care needs from static resources.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is clear that this Estimate only seeks to meet at best the level of medical inflation pay accounts for 70 per cent of all health expenditure.  Given the 2.5 per cent phase of the pay increase for 1989, the 3 per cent increase is only barely <Col N="869" /> adequate, if adequate, to meet these needs.  Given the overall budgetary situation and the fact that we have still some further progress to make before stabilising our debt-GNP ratio, I believe the best commitment that can be given to the health sector generally is to guarantee that increases in health expenditure will match increases in gross domestic product growth, thus being related to our level of ability to pay for these services.  In order to meet the needs I have already outlined, and the overall difficulties of the 45 per cent of the population who are just over the income eligibility for a medical card and are in the lower section of Category 2 of our health entitlement, it will be necessary for those with responsibility for health policy to seek a reallocation of resources within the health budget to create greater effectiveness and efficiency leading to a situation whereby much of the inequality of access of our health services can be overcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude with some quotations from the Official Report of previous Dáil debates on Health Estimates. On 2 June 1983 as reported at column 570 Deputy O'Hanlon said:</P>
    <P>I have never been over-enthusiastic about the way the staff embargo has been implemented.</P>
    <P>On 1 March 1984 &mdash; column 1182 &mdash; the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond said:</P>
    <P>It is no longer possible to cut back on the amount of finance being made available while expecting an adequate level of service.</P>
    <P>On 3 July 1985 &mdash; column 517 &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon called for a halt to the present dismantling of the health services and on 4 December &mdash; column 1594 &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon said:</P>
    <P>No health board has sufficient money to deliver the services that are their statutory obligation.</P>
    <P>Also on 4 December 1986, Deputy O'Hanlon said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> Fianna Fáil in Government will provide ... a proper and adequate level of health care.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that these considered comments from the present Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, were subsequently found in Government to be meaningless and hollow.  Fine Gael believe that the reorganisation of the health services to provide better patient care and better value for money can no longer be postponed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the 1989 Estimates, as proposed by the Government, we cannot take them in isolation. They should be placed alongside the efforts of the Government to come to grips with the financial difficulties which this country found itself in over many years and taken in the context of the Government's proposals for the future and their efforts in regard to transforming the Irish economy.  This is a fundamental part to be played by any Estimates which ultimately lead to the preparation and presentation of the budget.  The Taoiseach has consistently said, since coming to office in 1987, that he wishes to preside over a Government that restores confidence. Part of the process is the need to restore confidence in the Irish economy. It is not necessarily a book-keeping exercise in order to balance the books, to meet our repayment requirements, to service the national debt and so on but it is a fundamental part of our policy that leads to the creation of lasting jobs.  Any of us who has even a very small grasp of economics will understand that borrowing as we did in the past just to sustain day to day living is not an acceptable way forward if we want to create a sound economy which will provide the job opportunities that will keep our people at home and that will give our young people an opportunity to become involved in the employment field for the first time when they leave school.  It is all a question of transforming the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this Government living up to the demands made by the Taoiseach <Col N="871" /> has made substantial progress in that regard.  We see that inflation is at its lowest for over 20 years and is kept down to 2 per cent, that interest rates have dropped by over 6 per cent since we came into office, that the balance of payments is now moving into a surplus position for the first time since 1967, and that our monthly reports regarding exports over imports show a continued and sustained surplus leading to a £2 billion expected surplus by the end of 1988.  This is undoubtedly part of the transformation of the Irish economy.  These items, even in themselves, have made a significant impact on those of us involved in the Irish economy and on people who would have a need to look at falling interest rates. One need go no further than the householder who, since Fianna Fáil came into office, has saved considerably by virtue of the fact that interest rates have fallen and, consequently mortgage repayments, by a sum of up to 6.5 per cent.  This is a very substantial reduction that means a lot in the day to day financial affairs of ordinary families.  If we can maintain this level of progress through devising and developing Estimates such as those we are now discussing, the Taoiseach's aim of restoring confidence in the economy will lead to substantial lasting job creation. That is the fundamental part of Fianna Fáil policy in the preparation of any set of Estimates this year, last year or next year and in the preparation of the budget which will be coming before this House in January.</P>
    <P>The measures we have taken to date are what is required not only to balance the books but, more importantly, to create jobs throughout this country that are sustainable and which inevitably will lead to improving the economy, particularly in the area of exports.</P>
    <P>There are certain critical elements in the Estimates that will involve savings of £311 million for next year.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has satisfied himself with the preservation arrangements of the furniture collection in the National Museum, Dublin 2; where this collection is located at present in the museum; and when the <Col N="879" /> furniture collection room will be reopened to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>The Augusta Bender collection of Far Eastern artefacts was presented to the Irish people in 1934 and was on display in a specific room until 1973 when it had to be stored to facilitate work on the museum building.</P>
      <P>An extensive programme of renovation and refurbishment has been underway at the National Museum over a number of years.  This programme includes the rewiring of the building as well as structural works to eradicate a serious outbreak of dry rot.  A programme of refurbishment is now in hands to enable the greater part of the building to be re-opened on a phased basis over the next year or so.</P>
      <P>The development of a museum of decorative arts at the Custom House Docks site is also being planned.  It is proposed to include the Bender collection in the new displays to be mounted at this location.</P>
      <P>The room in which the 1916 collection of the National Museum was housed was closed to the public in 1987 to allow for extensive rewiring.  The displays are being reconstituted at present.  It is hoped to reopen the exhibition to the public by Easter, 1989.</P>
      <P>In relation to the furniture collection, the galleries where the collection was formerly displayed have been closed to public for some time to allow for the eradication of dry rot and for rewiring.  It is not proposed, in view of financial and staffing constraints, to reconstitute the furniture display on an interim basis in Kildare Street pending the relocation of the collection to the new museum of decorative arts at the Custom House Dock site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties regarding display of important material, including the furniture collection and the Augusta Bender collection are fully recognised by the Government.  It is against this background that a major portion of what is <Col N="880" /> called Stack A in the Custom House Docks site has been allocated to House the National Museum's Art and industry collections including the aforementioned collections.  In the meantime, the staff of the National Museum ensure the care and preservation of the collections under their responsibility to the highest standards possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Tánaiste saw fit to take these three questions together because they were separate and distinct.  Will he say whether failure to display the Augusta Bender collection &mdash; one of the most important and valuable collections of oriental art in western Europe &mdash; represents or reflects a lack of Government sophistication in regard to the arts in general?  Will the Tánaiste say why the 1916 collection has been under lock and key for the past two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern in regard to the importance of these collections but I thought I had fully answered his queries.  The new museum of decorative arts will be linked with the National Museum to cater for precisely the situation Deputy Enright raised. There is overcrowding, a lack of proper place for display and a number of other factors in the existing galleries and we can make arrangements, particularly in regard to industry collections, which would be very appropriate to the proposed development at the Custom House Docks site where place is being made available and plans being prepared. There will be a new museum located there which will fit in with the National Museum.  That is a constructive approach to the matter and seems to be the most positive arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the furniture collection in the museum is not covered, that articles are heaped one on top of the other and that it has been damaged because of problems regarding air control and damp, will the Tánaiste say why so few people are working there? I have been in there on a number of occasions and I noticed that only one or <Col N="881" /> two people seemed to be working on this project.  Is the Tánaiste aware that the Augusta Bender collection was supposed to be permanently and publicly displayed?  Why are the Government not meeting their commitments to the benefactor in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not enter into a debate on this matter because the arts are non-political.  Undoubtedly, there has been neglect over the years and we now have a chance to do something about that by relocating substantial collections which cannot be displayed at present in the National Museum because of lack of space.  The two museum presentations will be maintained with a different emphasis on the Custom House Docks site from the one in the National Museum.  There is no reason for not having two entities of that kind as the space is available and planning is underway. There is no point in talking here about it, the Government are doing something about it.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste may recall that on previous occasions the Taoiseach said that he would consider a proposal in the long term that the Custom House would become the headquarters for the National Museum.  Have there been any developments in that respect?  The proposal, in essence, would mean the transfer of the entire National Museum to the Custom House.  Of course, I do not want to get rid of the Minister for the Environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Ultimately, the option mentioned by Deputy Quinn will be open to whatever Government are in office to make that decision.</P>

On previous occasions the staff in the museum were told they were being allocated space in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, but those undertakings were not honoured.  What timescale has the Tánaiste in mind to have these items put on display at the Custom House Docks site?  Is it a two year period?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in the light of the failure of the Government to restore the allocation for the Council for the Status of Women to its level prior to 1988, he will make a statement on the future of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1988 the Council for the Status of Women received a grant of £90,000, an increase of £2,000 over their grant of £88,000 in 1987.  The 1989 Estimates for Public Services provide for an allocation of £93,000 to the council.  This will represent a further increase of £3,000 in funding for the council.  The fact that the funding of the council has been increased at a time of financial stringency shows the Government's recognition of the role of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State outline the areas in which the council will work in 1989?  Given the paltry increase of £3,000, is it a great disappointment to her that more money has not been made available to the Council for the Status of Women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a disappointment when we cannot get enough money but, as I said in my reply, at a time of financial stringency it shows a commitment that the amount of money available to the council has been increased this year.  The future priorities of the council are a matter for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is aware of these priorities.  Will she inform the House of what she sees as the priorities for the Council for the Status of Women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for me to decide for the Council for the Status of Women &mdash; or any other agencies under the Department of the Taoiseach &mdash; on the priorities.  My door has been open at all times since I became Minister to the Council for the Status of <Col N="884" /> Women for the executive of that council to come to me with any proposals they may have and to hear my views in relation to them.  However, at the end of the day it is a matter for the council to make a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister recollect that in 1986 the total amount given to the Council for the Status of Women &mdash; and other women's organisations &mdash; amounted to £189,000 and that in 1987 the amount was £140,000?  It came from a subhead of the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach where there was a Ministry for Women's Affairs with a subhead for women in their own right.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously that a subhead and a ministry be restored so that women will get a subhead in their own right and organisations outside the Council for the Status of Women will be allowed to continue to survive because in 1988 they are getting nothing and in 1989 they will get nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £140,000 which was made available in 1987 for women's organisations included the provision of £88,000 which was specially for the council.  I said in my reply that was increased last year by £2,000 and this year by £3,000.  Of the amount of money left out of the £140,000, Deputy Barnes will be aware that a substantial amount was spent on promotional activity of the Office of the Minister of State for Women's Affairs, not all of it, and it is incorrect to state that all of it is spent on women's organisations.  It is also not correct to give the impression that women's organisations, apart from the Council for the Status of Women, have been neglected over the years because responsibility has been assigned by the Taoiseach to the various Government Ministers to look after women's organisations and the rights of women in each of their Government Departments.  I indicated to the House some time ago that I was requesting on a six-monthly basis a report from each of the Government Ministers.  As Deputy Barnes is <Col N="885" /> aware, that report will be made available to this House and for publication before the end of next month.</P>

Ó thárla nár leor an soláthar sin, chinn Roinn na Gaeltachta ar threoirlínte áirithe a eisiúint i mí na Samhna 1987 maidir le reachtáil na scéime i 1988, d'fhonn a chinntiú go mbeifí in ann freastal ar éilimh na bliana sin agus fanúint laistigh den soláthar ceadaithe.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>In order to determine the actual numbers of inward and outward migrants in any period it would be necessary to have comprehensive documentary or other administrative procedures relating to the movement of persons into and out of the State.  As such procedures are not in force the only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration, that is the difference between the inward and outward flows, between successive censuses of population.</P>
      <P>Population estimates, which are subject to revision when the results of the next census become available, are made in respect of mid-April of each year from which estimates of net migration can be derived for the 12 months to mid-April. The latest available net migration estimate is that for the 12 months to mid-April 1988; for this period it is estimated that there was net outward migration of 32,000.</P>
      <P>Net migration estimates are not made on a monthly or other sub-annual basis.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State not acknowledge that since we are given the live register figures every month which gives us the unemployment rate and we periodically get the so-called employment and employment creation figures, that a vital component of the economic jigsaw, the actual number of people as against estimates given by the Minister of State, is missing from the total economic picture and that we are getting a totally flattering indication of economic performance, particularly our performance in relation to job creation, growth in the economy, emigration, unemployment etc?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have approved Dún Laoghaire Corporation's proposals to deal with the inadequate sewerage system serving the area by connecting the Dún Laoghaire system to the Ringsend treatment plant via a pipeline laid across the bay and below the seabed.  The treatment capacity at Ringsend has recently been doubled, and is more than adequate to cater for the maximum loading from Dún Laoghaire which should increase the present loading by no more than 10 per cent.  The project will ultimately eliminate all untreated sewage discharges to the sea along the entire Dún Laoghaire coastline and will thus ensure an improvement in the water quality of the bay.  At the same time, I am advised that, taking account of the more efficient treatment now available at Ringsend, there should be no increase in the level of nutrients in the treated outflow over that of recent years.  Similarly, the new project should have little or no effect on Dollymount and Sandymount strands.  There will, however, be a considerable improvement in water quality at the southern end of Sandymount strand and in the BlackrockDún Laoghaire areas.  In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the new <Col N="896" /> arrangements represent the best practicable environmental option at this time for improving water quality in the bay.</P>
    <P>Extensive surveys of Dublin Bay carried out in recent years on behalf of the Dublin local authorities indicate that the waters of the bay are relatively free from pollution.  However, Dublin Corporation are already giving preliminary consideration to what further measures may be necessary or desirable in the longer term to improve their sewerage treatment and disposal facilities.  Any measures of this kind will, of course, have to be determined in the context of the water quality management plan which is being prepared for Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>Tenders for the pipeline contract have recently been submitted to my Department and I expect to be in a position to give a decision on the proposal very soon. I would expect construction work to commence in the spring and the actual laying of the pipeline to be completed during the summer of 1989.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to apologise to the Minister for the length of the question I tabled but I am surprised that he has not dealt with one aspect of this question, that is, subparagraph (4), which asked in view of the proposed EC legislation banning sludge dumping at sea, what is going to happen to the sludge produced at Pigeon House?  Is the Minister's Department making any preparations to desist from dumping sewerage sludge at sea which I understand is the case at present?  What arrangements are the Department making?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>Let me ask two brief questions. The first relates to the water management studies which are being undertaken at present, can the Minister give me any indication of when the management plan will be available?  Secondly, in relation to the successful tender, and I do not want to interfere in the process, may I ask the Minister to positively consider in the light of very bad local experience in the past that positive discrimination in terms of local employment would be required or written into the successful tender?  That has not been the experience in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Both.  Dare I say it, but we have the extraordinary spectacle of <Col N="899" /> people coming from as far away as Mayo to work on sites in the middle of Ringsend and elsewhere and local people being told in advance that they are not to apply and are not required to apply.  What I am simply saying is that if taxpayers' money is going to be made available that local unemployed people should not be discriminated against in advance which is what has happened in the past.  In respect of that second question, I am asking the Minister to give some indication in accordance with tendering procedures that the successful bidder should, where possible, take on local people through the normal channels of FÁS and so on. The model is already in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Enviornment if it is the intention of his Department to provide a footpath from Listowel to Dirha Cottages in County Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the road in question is a non-national main road, the cost of any <Col N="900" /> improvement works would, in accordance with normal practice, fall to be financed by the local authority concerned from their own resources.  The local authority may, at their discretion, use the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department to supplement any expenditure from their own resources on such roads.</P>
      <P>In 1984, Kerry County Council submitted proposals to my Department for the improvement of the Listowel/ Ballybunion road, including the provision of footpaths, in the vicinity of Dirha Cottages.  In February 1985, the Department informed the local authority that special road grant assistance was not being provided to meet the cost of the work.  Because of constraints in public expenditure and other priority road schemes, it is not possible to pay a special road grant in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the last meeting of Kerry County Council a deputation from Dirha Cottages attended and, unfortunately, the impression was given that an application was with the Minister.  I am sure that if there is no such application that one will appear in the very near future.  I would ask the Minister to give this application very serious and sympathetic consideration as this stretch of road must be the most dangerous stretch of road in the country.  Over the past ten years 20 people have been killed while over 50 have been maimed or incapacitated in some fashion.  Scarcely a <Col N="901" /> family living within the estate have not been affected.  I would like the Minister to give this application very serious consideration because the local authority do not have the funds to carry out the necessary repairs.</P>

      <P>My Department carried out an immediate internal investigation into the publication of confidential information in the media report concerned. On the basis of this investigation, the Department were satisfied that the various procedures for protection of the confidentiality of the information had been observed in this instance.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is bizarre and unprecedented that <i>Aspect</i> magazine should publish not simply one Cabinet paper but a series of Cabinet papers which show an exchange of memoranda between the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance with regard to the imposition of a nationwide property tax?  Could the Minister indicate whether the Garda investigations are being conducted not only into the Department of the Environment but also into the Department of Finance?  Could he indicate which other Cabinet colleagues are being investigated? Are the two Ministers, other than himself and the Minister for Finance, who are named in this magazine also being interviewed by the Garda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to know how the Garda carry out such investigations. If the Deputy had a better and fuller understanding of Cabinet procedures he would not have made some of the allegations he made outside the House about Cabinet rows mentioned in the memoranda.  It is not for me to give Deputy Shatter a lesson in what happens around the Cabinet table but he might do well to ask some of his colleagues.  It is not accurate to say there was a Cabinet row.  All I am telling the Deputy is that the document found its way into the hands of a particular magazine and I am <Col N="908" /> not satisfied with the way it got there. Consequently, the Garda are investigating this matter.</P>

It is unprecedented that detailed documention of this nature relating to the imposition of a new nationwide tax would fall into the hands of a magazine or any other publication.  Can the Minister tell the House if any of his colleagues are subject to the investigation being conducted, and when he anticipates that investigation will be concluded?</P>

      <P>As I said, I do not know how the Garda deal with these matters. However, the leaked memoranda simply reflected the outcome of initial routine consultation with the Department of Finance and, by extension as the article stated, the Revenue Commissioners and the Valuation Office, of a particular reform option.  That is standard procedure followed before any proposals are formally submitted to Government.  Any suggestion regarding the attitude of any individual Ministers or whether their Departments were consulted cannot be accepted as having any basis in the context of the contents of a particular memorandum. I should not have to say that to a front bench spokesman of a large political party but I am telling him that is the procedure and he has to take it as such.</P>

There have been some significant changes over the past year which have helped.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I estimate that a total of approximately 16,000 new houses will be built in 1988 and the indications are that at least the same level of completions as in 1988 will be achieved in 1989.  The number of approved applicants on local authority waiting lists at 31 December 1987 was down to 18,561 compared to almost 30,000 in 1982.  The need represented by the current figure is less acute than it has been in the past.  The capital allocation for local authority housebuilding in 1988 is £36 million.  The Deputy's fears of a housing crisis are groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the housing situation is less acute than it has been in the past.  Does he accept that significant reductions in capital allocation for housing and growing housing waiting lists, which are a feature in most parts of the country at present, inevitably mean that a crisis of some kind in housing will occur and that in a sense he is simply being penny wise and pound foolish, as it were?  Surely the Minister must accept the evidence he is getting from councillors in various local authorities who will be preparing their estimates in the coming months?</P>

      <P>It is for that reason that I have agreed &mdash; I think it is the proper way to deal with the matter &mdash; to spend more money on remedial works next year.  Something needs to be done there and more money should be made available in that area.  It might very well come to pass that there will be a change in the demand and there will be a need for further completions.  I accept that but it is not indicated to me now by the independent consultancy advice or by those who tell me about these matters.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to use scarce resources on something that might not materialise.  That is the reason why the divide is being made in such a way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 61 and Question No. 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the House that the obligation to revise the constituencies is placed by the Constitution on the Oireachtas.  Having regard to the changes in population revealed by the 1986 census, a revision is now necessary.  Irrespective of terms of reference, the population changes alone require that virtually all the constituencies in the Dublin area must be changed and that some changes <Col N="915" /> elsewhere are also unavoidable.  Of the 41 existing constituencies 14 are now outside the widest tolerance allowed in the 1983 revision.</P>
    <P>I expect shortly to bring proposals for a revision before the House.  Following the practice at recent revisions, the proposals will be based on the recommendations of the commission set up for this purpose.  As at previous revisions, the terms of reference for the commission were drawn up by the Government.</P>
    <P>The commission are under the chairmanship of the President of the High Court.  The other members of the commission are the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and the Clerk of the Dáil.  Subject only to the constitutional requirements and the terms of reference, the commission are entirely independent in their operation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the terms of reference, these are essentially similar to those given to the two previous constituency commissions but the Government considered it desirable, in the interests of clarity, to include more specific guidelines in relation to constituency size.</P>
    <P>The guideline in this regard given to the previous commissions referred to the &ldquo;retention of the traditional pattern of three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies&rdquo;. The precise meaning of this guideline is very difficult to determine. Prior to 1980 there was, in fact, no fixed pattern of three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies.  Throughout all the revisions of constituencies carried out from the foundation of the State up to 1980, the one common trend was a continuing shift from larger to smaller constituencies. This trend applied not only in revisions prepared when this party were in Government: it applied also in relation to the revision prepared by the Coalition Government in 1974.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to the House to recall that the 1974 revision made provision for a total of 26 three-seat constituencies. In common with the immediately preceding revision which had taken place in 1969, this was the highest ever number of three-seaters.  In <Col N="916" /> view of the comment from various sources over recent weeks, it seems appropriate to recall that the 1974 revision did not provide for even one solitary fiveseater in the whole Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Deputies will also recall the debate initiated by the previous Government on the possible reform of the constitutional provisions relating to the electoral system.  Statements by the then Taoiseach and members of his Government at that time would indicate that they favoured the introduction of single member constituencies with or without some form of list system.</P>
    <P>As I have said the meaning of the guidelines given to the previous commissions about the retention of the &ldquo;traditional pattern&rdquo; is obscure.  It is clear that my predecessor as Minister for the Environment had problems about the meaning of this expression.  In the terms of reference given to the commission which he purported to set up, prematurely, in January, 1987 he substituted a guideline which required that &ldquo;the report of the Commission should provide for three-seat, four-seat and five-seat constituencies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is certain is that there is no evidence that either the Government or the Oireachtas took a formal decision in principle to reverse the trend towards smaller constituencies.  The very high number of five-seat constituencies now in existence simply emerged from the report of the first commission.</P>
    <P>The other change in the terms of reference, which has attracted rather less attention, is that the requirement that &ldquo;larger seat constituencies should preferably be situated in areas of greater population density&rdquo; has been omitted. The purpose of doing so was to allow the commission greater discretion in regard to the location of the different sizes of constituencies.</P>
    <P>I have not received the commission's report.  I have not seen a draft of it or a summary of it or any part of it or any interim report.</P>

      <P>What we have been hearing and reading up to now is nothing other than pure speculation.  I have, however, noted the contradictory nature of many of the claims made in relation to the alleged content of the draft of the report.</P>
      <P>When the report of the commission is received the question of publication and the preparation of a Bill to revise the constituencies will be considered by the Government.

Would the Minister agree that it was perceived that the commissions who produced reports pursuant to those terms of reference produced fair reports, reports which did not give rise to any political unease or to any possibility that the Government of the day were trying to gerrymander the constituencies?

    <Title>Estimates for the Public Services, 1989 and Public Capital Programme, 1989: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday, 26 October 1988:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1989 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1989 Summary Public Capital Programme.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;published by the Government on 18th October, 1988.  In noting the publication of the 1989 Estimates Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that they present only one part of the budgetary and financial picture for 1989, and resolves to have a full debate on each estimate as amended, as soon as possible after the 1989 Budget&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said this morning the Estimates represent a saving of £311 million for 1989.  This is a very substantial figure and will impinge significantly right across the board so far as the Government's <Col N="991" /> public capital programme expenditure is concerned.  Those who are saying that we have not gone far enough should recall their statements in five or six months time when the effects of the further savings begin to be felt.  It is important to realise that it is as part of our programme for getting our finances on a sound basis that these savings are suggested in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>It is important to establish a strong basis for economic development. We can only do that by continuing our efforts to reduce the borrowing and expenditure of moneys that are not really available to us.  We must try to reduce the national debt each year so that we can at least stabilise the debt and then reduce the amount required to fund debt service payments each year.  When one considers that it takes approximately £2 billion to service the national debt each year one can imagine the size of the financial drain on the Exchequer.  If this drain did not occur we would be able to proceed with the necessary expenditure on the capital side particularly in the further development of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>These Estimates represent continued progress in the Government's attempts to come to grips with the financial difficulties we have had for some time. There is confidence in the industrial sectors born out of what happened in the last 18 months as a result of the Government's firm grip on the financial management of the country.  The reduction in borrowings will eventually lead to the creation of substantial and sustainable jobs.  That is a fundamental part of the Government's attempt to cope with our difficult financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas there is a high level, much higher than the national average, of unemployment, for a whole variety of reasons including the concentration of local authority housing developments over the last number of years and the subsequent failure of successive administrations to make a special case for these areas in view of the substantial <Col N="992" /> movement of people to the newly developing areas.  I hope the Government will attempt to redress that problem this year and in the years ahead.  Areas like Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown need some special policy decisions by the Government to try to come to grips with their disadvantaged status.  These areas have been the subject of investigations and reports in the recent past, and all the reports indicate that all that has happened in these areas is that substantial low cost housing in the private sector and substantial local authority housing developments have been carried out without the commitment of resources and funds to the other aspects of new town developments, such as the provision of infrastructure, job opportunities and second and third level education accommodation, leisure facilities and so on.  All of these services need to be brought to these new areas.  The Government should begin to take policy decisions that will lead to improvement in these new towns. In the case of Tallaght there are 100,000 people where only 30 years ago there was a population of a few hundred people. Tremendous changes have occurred in those areas.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated that it is the Government's intention to continue the policy of helping the less well off.  As my colleague Deputy McCreevy said, it is necessary for us to understand that the poorer people deserve to receive a bigger share of the scarce resources available. We should concentrate our efforts in trying to improve the lot of the poor who depend on social welfare payments, on medical cards and on various State agencies. We must take account of their needs as the economy begins to develop.</P>
    <P>There is a new air of confidence about the economy.  I hope that the tremendous growth in exports will ultimately filter down into job creation which is really the kernel of the Government's policy.  The Ministers are working together in a team in an effort to provide the conditions whereby jobs will be created and whereby we will reverse the growing trend in emigration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> The latest survey referred to the fact that there are 6,000 additional jobs as a result of growth in exports.  We hope that some of them occurred as a result of the policies of this Government in terms of job creation and that more and more lasting jobs will be created.  It is all very well for Government policy to state that we hope to create 20,000 new jobs a year, but we also have a responsibility to try to protect existing jobs and industries, including indigenous industries which down through the years have served us well in terms of goods, services and equipment for sale at home and abroad. It is only when employment increases that the people who have made sacrifices will fully appreciate that the sacrifices were not in vain.  It is gratifying that people are prepared to accept cuts and perhaps a lower standard of living provided they can be assured that the economy is being managed properly.  We have convinced the electorate that we cannot revert to a situation in which we threw taxpayer' money at different projects and services in the belief that it would meet the needs of the country.  That approach is not acceptable any more.  It is understood by the population at large that that was not a correct way in which to set this economy on a sound basis again.</P>
    <P>When this time passes and the national debt has been considerably reduced, we will all have to consider how this situation arose in the first place and whether it is necessary to put legislation in place to prevent deficit budgeting in the future. We should not be afraid to take steps to ensure that no Government can take decisions which would have lasting effects to the detriment of the nation's finances.  These Estimates represent continued progress towards the regularisation of those finances.  Taken in the context of what has happened before and what is likely to happen next year and the year after, they will be seen as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the success of the tax amnesty.  An amnesty was offered before but it was not successful.  Its success on this occasion is due not only to the waiver of the interest development but to the <Col N="994" /> fact that other aspects of the tax collection system have been improved. These are important points to remember. The means of tax collecting were updated, the sheriffs were in position and taxpayers realised that once a date was set for the amnesty this Government would not change their minds.  The message must go out that no Government will tolerate a repeat of the withholding of such vast amounts of taxation.  The message must be loud and clear that if a person has a tax liability it must be discharged on time to the Government.  Vast amounts of outstanding taxes will not be allowed to build up.  The amnesty was successful for a variety of reasons but I hope the Government will make it clear that those who have not come forward cannot expect great mercy from the tax collecting régime.  They have had their opportunity and they had better make plans for remitting their tax liability, which has an effect on the financial management of the country.</P>
    <P>The Estimates represent another step in the process of regularising the difficult financial situation and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The comprehensive programme of the Estimates has come to hand only today, so we are dealing with the abridged version and it is not possible to be sure where the cuts and additions are being made.  I want to refer to some specific areas.  Vote 38 for the Department of Defence has caused a lot of us considerable concern because it shows only a 4 per cent increase for wages and salaries for members of the Defence Forces.  This is only a little more than would be allowed for the effects of inflation.  It is extremely disappointing. Last week I read in the editorial of the latest edition of the <i>Garda Review</i> that morale in the Garda Síochána has never been lower and that a crisis of confidence has arisen.  That is extremely disturbing. What would the rank and file members of the Defence Forces or the officers have to say if they had a publication to express their views?  I hate to think what it would be like.  These people deserve better. <Col N="995" /> Their problem has been highlighted considerably during the past six months and it is a disgrace that there has not been provision in these Estimates for a sizeable increase in their pay.</P>
      <P>I hope during the course of this debate that a logical explanation will be given by the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach as to why members of our Defence Forces are having to borrow from moneylenders and go deeply into debt with mortgages and overdrafts while resorting to the family income supplement.  It is a disgrace and is something which hits one between the eyes when reading the Book of Estimates. Something will have to be done to redress a very undesirable situation. We have considerable security problems and we should be willing to face up to the fact that we need to pay the people who deal with these problems in a manner which is just.  That is not being done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Vote 42 for the Department of Social Welfare, I refer to an anomaly which I have raised without success at Question Time.  It may appear not to be extremely significant but anomalies can be so unjust as to justifiably irritate people.  I do not hold any brief for people who express their bitterness because of certain malfunctions in the administration of the State, but when anomalies can easily be removed action should be taken to see that people do not have a reason to be bitter or cause to complain. The anomaly to which I refer relates to a person in receipt of unemployment assistance who has a number of children and part of whose allowance is discontinued if one of the children reaches the age of 18, even if that child is still receiving full-time education.  This is a regrettable system which should not be allowed to continue.  When I questioned the Minister he could not give a logical reason why the anomaly should be allowed to remain.  Let us imagine the position of a parent struggling on unemployment assistance of £80 or £90 a week for himself, his wife and three or four children when he suddenly finds the amount <Col N="996" /> reduced because his child, who is still totally dependent upon him, reaches 18 years of age and is still being educated.  I recently discovered in addition that if a child aged 18 or over is in full-time education and the father is in receipt of social assistance, the family do not qualify for the free fuel scheme.  What an appalling position and how easy it should be to rectify that terrible wrong.  It is the type of problem which should be rectified in the course of preparation of the Estimates. Any similar anomalies should be got rid of.</P>
    <P>On Vote 33, Department of Agriculture and Food, we have an alarming situation with regard to Coras Beostoic agus Feola, better known as the meat board.  Their funding has been reduced from £915,000 to £500,000.  That is a subsidiary type of funding, or grant-in-aid, but it is a significant amount of money for what is a relatively small board.  We here last June passed increases in levies on animals so that the revenue of that board would be considerably increased. We allowed for increases per head of cattle from £1 to £1.50, for a doubling in the levy on sheep from 10p to 20p and brought in a new levy on pigs from zero to 20p.  The funding provided by way of levies thereby increased from £1.9 million to £3.4 million.  That was a considerable increase to the board of £1.5 million.  The House unanimously passed those increases in the belief and in good faith and on the understanding that the Government would likewise increase the funding being granted to that board.  The Minister at the time gave a very distinct impression that that would be the case. What happened?  Not alone has there not been an increase, but the financing of the Board by the Government has been reduced by 45 per cent.  Over the years, marketing has been and is the Achille's heel of our agricultural industry, or agribusiness. Luckily enough, things are improving but they will not improve as they should when there is a mean and hamfisted effort such as this to reduce the funding of a board who are selling our agricultural products, our meat products, at home and abroad.  There is immense <Col N="997" /> scope for expansion of value added in those meat products.  That value added content has been increasing through the eighties.  It is a most retrograde step to pull back the financing of the marketing board.</P>
    <P>I noted at the weekend that the chairman of the board &mdash; it has been rumoured and that is as much as the newpaper said &mdash; was considering resigning because of the cutbacks.  That would be lamentable because he is also the chief executive of the Kerry Co-Operative Society, Mr. Denis Brosnan, who has worked wonders for that board and made it into a really viable business enterprise.  It would be a disgrace if that man felt obliged to resign because the Government had reduced rather than increased funding, this despite the fact that we all backed the Government here last June in increasing levies on farmers, distasteful as it might be for an Opposition to support the Government in that type of measure.  We recognise that it is necessary and in the farmer's own interests that they sell their products on the open marketplace and the way to do that is to promote a marketing board.  We are so far behind the Dutch, the Danes and the New Zealanders that it is not funny and when we are making a serious effort to catch up, the flow of money is reduced.  It should not have happened.</P>
    <P>We are all very concerned about the level of unemployment and, attached to that, the level of emigration, with its consequent heartbreak.  We are told by economists and statisticians that emigration is now running at the rate of 40,000 people a year.  Low and behold, I see in the Estimates, under Vote 40, that the amount of money which has been allocated &mdash; and I use the expression used in the summary here &mdash;&ldquo;for the repatriation and maintenance of distressed Irish persons abroad&rdquo; is being increased this year from £91,000 to £93,000.  That is a pittance.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into detail on the dispersion of the national lottery funds, which has got a little out of control.  I am not going to make a political argument of it.  It has almost come to the stage <Col N="998" /> where you might as well put the lottery funds back into the Central Fund and run the headed services, the Department of the Environment and all the other Departments, with the aid of those funds. That is not why the lottery was set up.  It was set up for specific purposes.  One of the main purposes was to aid sport and cultural activities, to provide stadia and halls in all types of areas in this country where we need cover, especially in weather such as this, to give people facilities so that they might compete against the best in the world, which unfortunately they are not able to do very successfully at the moment.  That was the major aspect taken into consideration in the setting up of the lottery.  When setting up that lottery and when in Government, we decided that a certain element of the funds should go to the health services, many very desirable elements of the health service which were not being covered.  There has been a tendency when the Government come under pressue, and Ministers also, to divert moneys from those areas into a whole range of areas for which the lottery funds were never intended.  That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>There is one area where a diversion of funds is desirable and that is to support emigrants who are in difficulty.  It was quoted to me today that one of the Irish newspapers in Britain printed a comment from an Augustinian priest in Hammersmith that the situation was now desperate. Anybody who has been recently in London or Birmingham will know what he means.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of Irish people, not all old or all male, they are men and women and young, sleeping and living out in the open, living rough.  Surely there is an onus on us here in this House and on the Government to see that we give those people a considerable amount of support, to bring them back and rehabilitate them in their families and if they do not want to return, to see that they are given a certain level of comfort and accommodation in Britain.  All one needs to do is go to any of the mainline stations in London, whether it be Victoria or Paddington, to the underground stations or <Col N="999" /> their environs.  Look under any of the bridges, such as Vauxhall Bridge at night and you will see them there in their thousands sleeping rough.  Many of them are alcoholics and many are not alcoholics but may be emotionally disturbed through the trauma of emigration and living away from their families.  If there is any area where the funds need to be diverted it is towards those emigrants. The sum of £93,000 is a miserly figure to give to all those social centres which are looking after those people, whether it is the Irish Centre in Camden Town, the centre run by Father Kiely in Hammersmith or numerous others in places such as Birmingham, Manchester or Liverpool.  It is a miserly sum and whether it is out of central funds or out of lottery funds I do not care but it should be increased.  What could be done with £93,000 when one is trying to cater for thousands, and probably tens of thousands of people in distress?  It is pitiful. Incidentally, that figure is contained in Vote 40, subhead D.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat bemused by the figure in the Estimates for capital expenditure for tourism and transport where there is an increase of £54 million.  I am bemused because I repeatedly see in the newspapers that Aer Lingus do not want any extra money from the Exchequer.  It is stated in the Summary Public Capital Programme 1989 on page 12 that it is non-voted and that it is for air companies but the increase is £54 million.  I would like an explanation for that.  Is it all for Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta or is some of it for the independent air companies such as Ryanair?  I doubt it very much.  I have used the expression in this House before and I will use it again; the public do not want to see the taxpayers' money being used against the best interests of the taxpayers. I would hate to think that what we call national air companies are being given moneys to put independent air companies out of business because that would be totally contrary to the best interests of the taxpayer and of the public in general.</P>
    <P>The air fares to and from this country <Col N="1000" /> were reduced not because of Aer Lingus but in spite of Aer Lingus.  If you want to keep the fares down and if you want to be able to go to London from Dublin for £60, you have got to maintain competition. Remember when Aer Lingus came into this House three years ago and lobbied all the Members in an endeavour to keep their return fare to London at £204; they said it could not be done for anything less but when they had to encounter competition they had to do it for less.  Let us not forget that the advent of competition in air travel and air fares has been responsible for the inflow of tourists to this country.  I would be extremely annoyed, and so should all members of the public, if they thought that certain companies were to be given preferential treatment and funded by the State so that they could put competitors out of business.  Competition is the essence of trade and we must see that it is retained.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm cur leis an díospóireacht seo are na Meastacháin, ach de bharr an ganntanas ama atá ann, leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Estimates. In doing so, I would like to make some broad comments about the Government's economic policy.  The proposals made in the Estimates must be seen in the context of the national economy and the restructuring and development programme that has been undertaken by the Government.</P>
      <P>The economic and social policy objective are aimed at substantially increasing sustainable employment opportunities as well as generating the wealth and resources necessary to improve the lot of our people.  To do this Government policy is designed to control public expenditure and re-establish growth in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have addressed the problems of high borrowing, inflation, interest rates and we have created an environment where business, industry and services can <Col N="1001" /> plan and develop their enterprises with confidence.  Building on that confidence, the development that we require will be achieved by improving the competitiveness of Irish industry and by creating the right conditions for investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>In the drive for growth we have adopted imaginative and innovative policies designed to harness the spirit of enterprise.  As we move towards 1992 and the completion of the internal market, we must recognise and grasp the tremendous opportunities which that offers.  To capitalise on the opportunities which the market will offer we must ensure that what we sell, be it products or services, come from the most efficient cost structures and regulatory arrangements we can devise.</P>
    <P>In the tourism and transport sectors we have clearly defined the roles of Government. First, the Government must act as the regulator of the sector.  Secondly, as the shareholder of the main companies in these sectors they must ensure that they provide an adequate return on the community's investment in them.  I am happy to say that we are beginning to see the results of the imaginative and innovative programmes and policies of which I spoke.</P>
    <P>In aviation, for example, the strategy of lowering air fares; providing more capacity on all major routes and encouraging competition is paying handsome dividends.  Moreover, the good results on the aviation side are being reflected also in our tourism figures.  Access travel is, of course, one of the main keys to improved tourism performance.  Therefore, it is essential that our transport policies as far as possible meet the demands of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I believe we have now got that policy right.  As the House will be aware, there have been significant reductions in air fares especially on the UK and continental routes and that a range of highly attractive fares from the US are also available.  The result of this strategy has been the spectacular growth in passenger numbers that we have seen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> This year we expect that up to six million passengers will have passed through Irish airports as compared to four million in the same period last year.  Few could deny that this magnificent performance demonstrates conclusively that the potential was there, is there and is now being tapped.</P>
    <P>An interesting by-product from the strategy of reducing air fares has, of course, been the impact on the performance of Aer Lingus.  The reduction in fares levels has been more than offset by increases in passenger numbers.  The success of the lower air fares policy is underlined by the fact that the company is now in the happy position of being able to fund its ongoing fleet replacement programme without recourse to the Exchequer.  I hope the previous speaker will not get annoyed as he said he might if it was otherwise.  The board next year will acquire four new aircraft, two Fokker 50s, two B737s and will lease in a Lockheed 1011 airbus.</P>
    <P>The targets for improvements in tourism performance combined with the results over the past two years clearly indicate the need to provide the maximum capacity on the various routes. The new aircraft will meet the demand for that increased capacity when it arises next year.  The Aer Lingus acquisition programme clearly demonstrates the company's ability to respond constructively to the market forces as well, of course, as showing the company's commitment to the Government's targets for tourism growth.</P>
    <P>It is not only Aer Lingus that have seen and grasped the opportunities.  Ryanair are in there too and this company carried its one millionth passenger recently.  This year they expect passenger numbers to be of the order of 600,000, double on what they had been in 1987.  As well as contributing their share to the growth in this sector Ryanair have, of course, brought the added element of competition to the market &mdash; a factor which is essential in helping all to look at cost and operating structures.  Only by the constant monitoring of performances in this way can we be sure of having the lean <Col N="1003" /> efficient productive operations that bring the levels of development we require.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I were not to mention that the increased passenger numbers have had a tremendous impact also on the fortunes of Aer Rianta.  The rate of return being earned by Aer Rianta is very strong and the company must be complimented for the entrepreneurial spirit they show.  I say this because it would be easy to sit back and passively accept the benefits coming their way by way of increased passenger numbers.  However, they have not been content to sit on their laurels but have gone out and chased the business wherever it might be.  In this respect I have in mind particularly their involvement with Aeroflot.  As the House may be aware, Aer Rianta now supply a wide range of services to Aeroflot, including the operation of a duty free shop at Moscow, the provision of duty free facilities on all Aeroflot routes, and their most recent venture, the aircraft painting contract at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Once again in 1988 Aer Rianta will return a large surplus to the Exchequer. With a throughput of almost six million passengers it is hardly surprising that the board are engaged in a major investment programme covering development and refurbishment at all three State airports. The largest development, a project costing some £32 million, is the provision of a new runway at Dublin Airport together with the relocation of the control tower and State services building at the west side of the airport.  At Shannon Airport, too, there is considerable development with the upgrading and extension of the passenger terminal facilities.</P>
    <P>The rapid expansion in traffic, the impact of which, I am glad to say, has been felt also at Cork, has resulted in a major upgrading of the facilities there. This has been long overdue in the 25 year life of Cork Airport.  I had the pleasure last July of opening phase 1 of the new terminal extension.  Up to the end of September passenger numbers increased by over 82,000 or 24 per cent on the same period last year and I am sure that the additional space provided has certainly <Col N="1004" /> relieved some of the pressure building.</P>
    <P>Of course the extension to the terminal is only part of the extension of the facilities at Cork Airport.  On what might be described as the operational side other major investments at the airport include an extension of 1,000 feet to the main runway which has been brought into use within the past week.  In the new year it is intended to provide a new instrument landing system and new navigational aids.  Also on the drawing boards for installation in the following years is a new modern integrated radar system to replace the existing facilities.  We will then have a very low to nil diversion rate from Cork which has bedevilled the region for far too long.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the technical facilities for Cork I should perhaps emphasise that these are part of a major upgrading programme for all radar, communications and navigational aids facilities in the State costing over £30 million.  In 1989 it is expected that £5.5 million will be spent. The renewal programme is timely because it will ensure that the technical capacity of our national airspace is adequate to meet the demands that will be placed on it by the developing commercial operations.</P>
    <P>In making sure that the State airports operate to maximum efficiency we have not overlooked the needs of, or opportunities offered by, the smaller local airports. Last August we announced a major development plan for regional airports. This will entail a total investment of £4 million over the period 1988-89 and will ensure that these airports are up to the standard which would meet necessary operational requirements.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that improvements in the regional airports could leave them in a position to handle 200,000 passengers on an annual basis.  In tourism terms this level of activity could generate revenues of the order of £50 million and create approximately 3,000 jobs.  These of course would be additional to the jobs created during the construction phase at the various locations around the country.</P>
    <P>I think it can be fairly said that the <Col N="1005" /> Government are sparing no effort in providing the facilities to bring the tourists to our doors.  The next question, therefore, is the tourism industry itself which has become a national movement with widespread interest and genuine enthusiasm by all our people.</P>
    <P>There is now a profound air of optimism within the Irish tourism industry. The new found confidence is not surprising when one considers that, following a 12 per cent growth in overseas numbers last year, we are now heading for a 15 per cent growth in 1988.  Such percentage levels of growth have not been seen for many years and are due in no small way to the Government's decision to prioritise the development of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government set ambitious targets for tourism for the following five years.  The objective is to create an extra 25,000 jobs and to attract an additional £500 million in revenue.  To achieve this we will have to double visitor numbers. Many have said that these targets are far too ambitious but with nearly two years behind us we are on course and I am certain that the targets can and will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The thrust on tourism has been amply demonstrated over the past 18 months or so through a wide ranging series of innovative measures in the areas of marketing and product development.  These include a special marketing programme in May 1987 and in 1988; the development of a more extensive and competitively priced access transport service; and the extension of the benefits of the business expansion scheme to the export tourism sector which up to then had only been available to manufacturing industry. Responses by the industry and investors to this particular initiative have been most encouraging.  Bord Fáilte have received some 4,000 inquiries and to date have approved marketing and development plans in respect of 24 projects involving investment of almost £19 million. These cover a broad range of tourism facilities and amenities.  A further 15 projects are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> Further innovative measures include the introduction of a £200,000 petrol voucher scheme for the summer of 1987 for UK motorists visiting Ireland; the autumn of 1988 car rental bonus scheme for North American visitors entitling them to a $50 rebate of the cost of car hire and the recent broadening of the scope of the VAT (Refund of Tax) Order, 1986, to enable a greater number of tour coaches to qualify for a reduced 10 per cent VAT rate.</P>
    <P>The Government underscored their commitment to encouraging the expansion of conference business by initiating the conference ambassador scheme as part of the £4 million marketing campaign for 1988.  This scheme was launched last May by the Taoiseach and was attended by over 1,000 industry executives.</P>
    <P>The objective was to encourage these industry leaders to actively promote Ireland abroad as an ideal conference venue.  There has been a very positive response to the Government's initiative and we are optimistic that 1989 will show substantial growth in the conference sector of the industry.</P>
    <P>The industry has reacted in a most positive and practical manner to these measures by providing additional funds for direct marketing and for the development of the tourism product.  Their continued backing for the Government's measures and leadership has again been manifested in their decision to match the Government's recent commitment of a further £5 million for marketing programmes to boost tourist traffic in 1989.</P>
    <P>This allocation on top of the £18,227 million grant in aid to Bord Fáilte for 1989, provided for in the Book of Estimates will mean that the Exchequer contribution to the Board's marketing and promotion programme for 1989 will be up £3 million on the 1988 provision.  The present Estimate provision underlines the Government's continuing determination to ensure that the tourism growth targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are realised.</P>
    <P>Increased investment by the industry <Col N="1007" /> itself in the tourism product and in marketing is crucial, given the global environment in which tourism operates.  By the turn of the century it is expected to be the world's largest industry.  It is, I hasten to add, one of the most aggressively competitive industries and we must be able to participate in that competition. Not only are the major traditional tourist destinations investing heavily for their share of the business but very many emerging countries now see tourism as a relatively fast way to increase their prosperity by gaining foreign revenue and to increase employment.</P>
    <P>The message, therefore, is clear to us all.  We must build on the growth that we have seen over the past two years.  There can be no room for complacency.  We must ensure that our product meets the demands and quality required by the marketplace and be prepared to sell that product effectively.  The industry must be sufficiently developed to meet and satisfy the expected growth in the years ahead and must have the flexibility to adapt its products to the changing tastes as well as having the innovative capacity to create new products.</P>
    <P>Every effort must be made to extend the season and to attract more customers &mdash; both domestic and overseas.  One way forward is to provide more all-weather facilities.  This year we have given practical recognition to the fact that activity and special interest holidays have become the fastest growing sectors in world tourism. With a generous headstart provided by our natural environment and uncrowded towns and countryside, we have put together our most extensive programme for special interest activities. Our national recreations of golf, angling and horse riding are now the beginning only of a very long list which even includes American Football in Dublin next month when Boston College and the Army hold their annual game.  The success of our sports representatives will be of considerable help in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is vital to offer tourists a quality service, value for money, hospitality and professional standards of service.  A <Col N="1008" /> ready smile and a willingness to oblige are essential.  By retaining consistently high standards only can we increase our share of the world's fastest growing industry. It is important also to understand the cultural background of our visitors.  The shift of emphasis on the part of the Department of Education from the mere literary aspect of languages to their practical usage &mdash; particularly German, Italian, Spanish and French &mdash; is welcome in that the people servicing our industries should avail of the opportunity to learn these continental languages and understand the cultural background of our visitors. That is now part and parcel of the necessary training for our tourism and catering industries, a welcome innovation.</P>
    <P>I should like now to move to surface transport modes, in particular, to the part to be played in our economy by the road haulage industry.  Transport has a vital part to play in the completion of the internal market.  Ireland's location on the periphery of the Community places us in a most disadvantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> access to continental markets.  Nevertheless, we have fought long and hard to have our plight recognised by our continental colleagues.  I am happy to say that considerable progress was made in the road freight transport are in the course of the Council of Ministers' meeting in June this year.</P>
    <P>Of more immediate significance to our haulage industry was the increase in Ireland's quota of multilateral haulage authorisations to 671 for 1988 and to 940 for 1989.  The impact of these increases will be appreciated when compared to the 1984 allocation of 88 authorisations. Perhaps I should explain that an EC multilateral authorisation allows the international carriage of goods by road for hire or reward from any member state, by any route, to any other member state.  Therefore it will be seen that this increase offers tremendous opportunities for our haulage industry in the context of 1992.</P>
    <P>The other major component of the surface transport industry which comes under the wing of my Department is CIE. <Col N="1009" /> When public finances have had to be tightly controlled CIE must share the general restraint and accept some reduction in State allocations.  The CIE subvention for 1989 &mdash; which amounts to £109.884 million &mdash; is almost £4 million less than the allocation of £113.605 million provided for the board in 1988.  In fact most of the reduction in the CIE subvention is due to the reduction in interest rates on the DART system.  CIE are engaged in a continuous programme of reducing costs, rationalising services and marketing their products aggressively. The creation of the three operating companies is designed to ensure generally a more responsive approach to consumer demands.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the balance struck in these Estimates.  Balancing the evident control of the public finances our strategy is aimed at stimulating the productive sectors where there is a real prospect of generating the wealth necessary to provide substainable employment.</P>

      <P>The Chair should not have any great problem.  I know that Deputy Desmond O'Malley indicated yesterday evening that he was hoping to contribute.  Deputy Taylor, early on, had words with the Chair.  The fact of the matter is that if both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Taylor are offering, then the arrangement here would give precedence to Deputy O'Malley because of the fact that, since their major speaker, they have not had any, whereas the Labour Party have had one.  In those circumstances I must do what is in accordance with the tradition of the Chair in this respect and call Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to Deputy Taylor but he realises that his party already had a speaker this morning.</P>
      <P>To put the Estimates we are now discussing into perspective it is necessary to begin with a quotation from an article entitled &ldquo;Money Matters&rdquo; by Mr. Paul Tansey in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 23 October 1988 when he stated the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Thus, the level of public spending next year is not being reduced by £311 million, nor by £224 million, nor even by £175 million but by something between £75 million and £125 million on the actual level of public spending in 1988.</P>
    <P>For their own reasons the Government have deliberately and dishonestly grossly overstated the extent and significance of these cuts.  No doubt there are those who feel that, even at the likely real figure of £75 million, they are still too much. Equally there will be those who would feel that these cuts are quite inadequate. Irrespective of the quantity of the cuts and of the arguments that can be made for or against them there is no question but that the minor savings effected in virtually no case go to the root of the real problem.  There is no reform brought about by these Estimates, even the most modest.  There is no real change when the overwhelming need clearly is for radical and fundamental change.</P>
    <P>All the unsuccessful, long established structures of central, local and agency administrations are left entirely intact, notwithstanding the fact that their inefficiency and unsuitability has been proven time and again.  Even where reductions are shown in the Book of Estimates, there is nothing to indicate that the thrust of fiscal policy being pursued makes any contribution to worthwhile economic and political policies.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Progressive Democrats has always been that just cutting widely and wildly with a surgeon's knife is not sufficient.  Any fool can effect large reductions if he does not care about the withdrawal of vital services.  In pruning expenditure, regard has to be had to the three vital factors of social responsibility, economic development and job creation.  What we are seeing pays little or no attention to these three prime requirements.  In fact, some at least of what is being done severely damages these three objectives without the compensatory factor of a worthwhile or significant reduction in an abnormally high level of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I have consistently advocated the necessity of redesigning the whole mechanism of the State apparatus in this country, its structures and costs, so as to ensure that the objectives of economic development, social equity and employment can be achieved.  In other words, we have always sought to ensure that the best possible use is made of taxpayers' money, that borrowing is used for real development and not for paying current bills and that such borrowing, is of its nature, self-liquidating.  The control and reduction of public expenditure is not just a mathematical exercise as the Government and some commentators would have us believe.  There is, at all times, a paramount necessity to maintain the delicate fabric of the economy and the equally delicate social fabric of a society in which up to one third of the people live in poverty.</P>
    <P>These Estimates are incomplete partly because they conceal some of the decisions that have been &mdash; or will be &mdash; made and partly because the figures to which they are compared are false and over stated.  An example, however, of one decision that it has apparently not been possible to conceal has been the incredible decision to increase employers' PRSI on employees' salaries from £16,200 to £20,000.  To some people this may not seem a tremendously significant move but to my mind, as someone who has constantly complained about our anxiety to tax employment, it is just about the craziest step that could be taken in a country that has nearly 250,000 people unemployed, another 40,000 or so on largely pointless training courses and a further gross 40,000 plus emigrating each year.  What it means in practical terms is that there are now tens of thousands more workers in respect of whom an employer will have to expend £3.29 in order to give them £1 more in their pockets.  This makes Irish based manufacturing firms extremely uncompetitive as against those who have the advantage of manufacturing in a country with normal taxation levels.  For many firms in difficulties at the moment, this latest <Col N="1012" /> idiotic move to increase PRSI will be the straw that breaks the camel's back and will drive more and more of them into liquidation and bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of fiscal policy should be in the opposite direction but there is an equally urgent requirement &mdash; and sufficient time has now passed for it to be responded to &mdash; for a type of hands on management which will dovetail and eliminate the various different strata of administration of whole sections of State related activities which consume scarce and valuable resources which could and should be devoted to the provision of services rather than just, as it is, to the welfare of the institution administering them.  We have, as a result, in our public administration generally, a multi-tiered sandwich consisting of slices of half baked bread with no money left to pay for the filling in the sandwich.  We would do better with fewer layers of unnecessary bread and more beef in between.  I will give a number of examples in a moment but I want to deal first with the different aspects of the same question.</P>
    <P>it is one thing to have unnecessarily complicated and expensive bureaucratic structures in respect of services and activities which the State must undertake, it is another thing to have the State involved, whether efficiently or not, in a whole load of activities where there is neither social nor economic necessity for its involvement.  It is time, therefore, that a serious look was taken by the Government &mdash; not just by the Progressive Democrats &mdash; at the whole question of privatisation and the withdrawal of the State from areas of activity in which it need not operate.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of this party, I have been advocating this.  In 1986 we were met with the usual derision but at last there are indications that something, however slowly and haltingly, is beginning to happen.  Within recent weeks it appears that the Government are moving towards the selling off of Cablelink which is a valuable subsidiary of RTE but quite unnecessary for the performance of RTE's function.  There has also been a move towards selling the Great Southern <Col N="1013" /> hotels, on which the State has spent an incredible amount of money over the years, principally in writing off their accumulated losses.  We have calculated that it is possible to realise, over a reasonably short number of years, proceeds of about £1,000 million from unnecessary but saleable activities in which the State is involved.  If these proceeds are put to the reduction of the national indebtedness the annual saving to the Exchequer will be in the region of £100 million, give or take a bit, depending on current interest rates.  Not to take this step &mdash; or to delay further in taking it &mdash; seems to be inexplicable.  We are alone in Europe in declining to divest ourselves as a State of what we do not need.</P>
    <P>Even the socialists of the world, from New Zealand to Paris, have been vying with one another in their anxiety to take a step that is a godsend to any hard pressed Government and their Exchequer.  The disposal of unnecessary State activities is in many respects even more valuable for us than for other countries for the simple reason that so many of the optional activities engaged in by the State here are seriously loss making.  Therefore, the net proceeds of privatisation consist not alone in the consideration realised but also in the annual subsidy that can now be foregone.</P>
    <P>The bus services in Dublin are an outstanding example of this.  Not alone can the buses and the right to provide the services be sold for a substantial sum, but the ongoing annual subsidy of £20 million or more can equally be foregone.  The capitalised value of not having to pay the subsidy is very substantial indeed, with the result that the annual net benefit to the Exchequer of a properly planned programme of privatisation is well in excess of the £100 million which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The employees of privatised firms would be among the first to benefit, as has been proved time and again in other countries, I doubt if anyone would claim that the wages paid to ordinary employees of CIE are attractive.  On the other hand, an efficiently run and profitable bus service could afford the payment <Col N="1014" /> of very much better wages and the provision of better conditions.</P>
    <P>Our local authorities, through no fault of their own, are in a pathetic state.  They are minor branch offices of a centralised bureaucracy largely dependent on central funds.  As a result of the further cut in the rate support grant, many of them are in imminent danger of breaking down altogether.  Their ability to continue to provide services, as they are at present structured and financed, is becoming increasingly doubtful.  The question must be asked as to why they are providing many of these services in any event.  Is the collection of refuse not something that is well within the capabilities of private contractors working for a fixed fee and taking the risks themselves?  Is the repair and maintenance of local authority houses, which is as expensive as it is deplorable, something that is beyond the capabilities of a contractor working to a specification for a fixed sum?</P>
    <P>Is it necessary that Dublin Corporation should have had, up to last week, to utilise the services of three men to change one light bulb?  I understand that the situation has changed in the past week and it now requires only two men to perform that function, which some might suggest is overstaffing by 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary that the State operating by local authorities should have to provide 100 per cent of our roads?  The Council of Ministers in the EC within the past week has approved the use of the Structural Funds of the Community in conjunction with private investment.  As we know, the grants from those funds have been increased from 55 per cent to a potential level of 75 per cent so far as Ireland is concerned.  No Exchequer funding whatsoever is now required to match these funds.  The EC has totally endorsed the use of private funds, as one would expect them to do.  Why do we, on the other hand, eschew the use of such funds and condemn ourselves for all time to, among other things, the worst roads in Europe?  For the State to control certain activities in the public interest, it does not need to own the institutions carrying on those activities.  The State does not <Col N="1015" /> own any of the Associated Banks but it controls them mostly by way of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There are many obvious candidates for privatisation.  Equally, when one looks at it, there are many other candidates, too, that are less conventional or less obvious. Why, for example, has the registration of land in this country to be a prerogative of the State?  Why not set up a consortium of lawyers, accountants, computer people and office managers to run the Land Registry under rules laid down by the State, making charges approved by the State?  There is no real reason why some, at least, of our prisons could not be provided and run privately under strict State supervision.  Why should the State not buy in the services it provides at present in the OPW?  Are not things as diverse as the restoration of buildings and the provision of arterial drainage well within the capabilities of existing specialist contractors?  Why should the State employ large numbers of people to provide these services when they can be done more efficently privately?  Why should the State and local authorities not buy in their service requirements in respect of architecture, engineering, law and many other services that they provide for themselves at the moment?</P>
    <P>To come back to the multi-layered sandwich, we see in the industrial development field often not just duplication but frequently triplication of costs with the extraordinary multiplicity of agencies whose achievements are minimal and hugely costly.  The recent report of Údarás na Gaeltachta is a case in point and I do not think it necessary to go into the detail of that which was fully reported in yesterday's newspapers and shows the frightening consequences.</P>
    <P>In every Department inevitably the bureaucratic structure will preserve itself at the expense of the recipients of the service and at the expense of the providers of the service at the coal face.  The Department of Defence have an elaborate bureaucracy largely untouched by the need to rationalise and largely untouched by the economic situation, but <Col N="1016" /> our serving soldiers on the Border, in the Lebanon and elsewhere throughout the service are dependent on the St. Vincent de Paul Society and social welfare allowances to enable them to keep their own and their families' bodies and souls together.  I was told recently of the case of a private soldier who did 110 hours of duty on the Border and at the end of that week got £135 for his trouble.  Are we now going too far in presuming on the eternal loyalty of such men?  Do we take it for granted that they will always be there?  Do we think of the consequences if they are not there or are replaced by men who have not the same dedication and loyalty as the present members of the Defence Forces have?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I might mention that these Estimates show a 13 per cent reduction in the grant-in-aid to the Arts Council.  Apparently the Arts Council have been told informally that moneys will be made available to the Arts in addition to this sum from the national lottery.  It is totally unsatisfactory that the Arts Council or any other statutory body with specific functions to fulfil should be dependent on the whims of individual Government Deputies, which is essentially what the disbursement of national lottery funds amounts to at the moment. How can a body such as this make any plans when their funding is so uncertain and so subjective?  They are deeply disturbed at the early likely closure of a number of theatres and art centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Belltable Arts Centre in Limerick, if I may be permitted to refer to it, in my own constituency is due to close down in a month's time after providing a tremendous service to the citizens of Limerick and all the surrounding counties and doing a very great deal for the cultural life of that city and region.  It is now expected, presumably, to approach some of the wellknown patrons of the arts in the political field in Limerick with its hat in its hand and take its place in the queue and no doubt at the 11th hour it will be bestowed with some generous gesture that, it is to be hoped, will prevent its closure.</P>

It is pretty awful that people who run some amenity like that which is of such obvious benefit to an entire region and to the cultural life of an entire region have to be beholden to certain types of individuals and have to go almost like peasants with cap in hand seeking assistance.  An independent board operating according to specified objective criteria as suggested by the Progressive Democrats in our Bill, shortly to be debated here, is the only real solution. If that or something very like it is not done, increasing numbers of people will ask themselves whether it is proper to contribute towards this lottery when its proceeds are so flagrantly abused at a time of great need in our society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Dr. McCarthy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government since coming to office have pursued a courageous and relentless policy towards rectifying the national finances.  This policy has been highly successful and we now have an economic climate in this country which is excellent for investment.  This is something that took a lot of hard work and thought to achieve.  We have had a very successful developmental programme because we recognise that there were areas in which this country could create employment. One of those was the area of science and technology and research and development. A sum of £10 million is being provided in 1989 as a grant-in-aid towards the administration and general expenses of EOLAS, the Irish Science and Technology Agency.  This is an increase of 3 per cent over the amount provided for 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency began its life on 1 January of this year, with the amalgamation of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the National Board for Science and Technology.  A lot of hard <Col N="1018" /> work over the last nine to ten months has gone into moulding the agency into the vibrant force necessary for the development and application of science and technology and much work still remains to be done.  In the Government's view, EOLAS has a particularly vital role to play in industrial development generally and in assisting Irish industry to gear up for the challenges of the 1990s by taking on board the advances being made in science and technology and producing the new quality products which industry needs for success.</P>
    <P>As was to be expected, in the amalgamation of two bodies and the creation of a new one there were, and indeed still are, many problems of a structural and organisation nature to be overcome.  I would like to congratulate the board and staff of the agency on the way in which they have set about their task and I would like to assure them of my continued support for their work.</P>
    <P>This will be confirmed by the fact that I see the agency as the main driving force in the successful implementation of the projects, both ongoing and now being initiated, in the Science and Technology Development Programme, a programme for which the Government will be providing £8.198 million in 1989, an increase of 164 per cent over this year.  I would like to give some details now on how the moneys being provided for this programme will be spent.</P>
    <P>Deputies will already know of the existence of the National Biotechnology Programme which is operated by a division of EOLAS.  The programme was established in June 1987 to commercialise the biotechnology research being undertaken in Irish universities and research institutes.  For marketing reasons it has been found convenient to refer to the unit of EOLAS involved as Bioresearch Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under this programme three centres were set up during 1987.  These are: the National Diagnostic Centre at UCG; the National Food Biotechnology Centre at UCC; the National Cell and Tissue Culture Centre at NIHE Dublin.</P>
    <P>The budget for the National Biotechnology <Col N="1019" /> Programme has been increased from £1.5 million to £2.25 million in 1989.  This extra funding will provide for the establishment of two new centres, one in UCD, the other in Trinity College, namely, the National Centre for Agricultural and Veterinary Biotechnology at UCD; and the National Centre for Pharmaceutical Biotechnology at TCD.  The proposed provision of £2.25 million for 1989 is intended to relate both to the needs of the two new centres as well as to the ongoing, and expanded, activities of the three centres already established.  It is intended, of course, that in a few years hence &mdash; say not more than five years &mdash; the entire programme should have become self-financing and the need for support from State funds would no longer arise.</P>
    <P>The Advanced Manufacturing Technology Programme was established to help overcome the deficiencies of Irish industry in so far as the quality and sophistication of design and manufacturing equipment is concerned.  In 1988 this programme had a provision of £200,000.  This was disproportionately small when compared to the magnitude of the problems to be overcome in this field.  I am happy to say that a provision of £500,000 has been made in 1989.</P>
    <P>There are now four fully functioning research units in AMT based at UCD, TCD, UCG and NIHE Limerick.  Each of these units specialises in complementary aspects of AMT: mecatronics, vision and sensors, computer integrated manufacturing and electronics AMT respectively. The expansion of moneys in this programme will assist these centres to build up their equipment and to augment their staffing.  I might add that the launching of special programmes for the development of strategic technologies such as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing technology and optoelectronics &mdash; to which I will refer later &mdash; is a feature of the approach currently being adopted by other European countries to industrial innovation and the enhancement of productivity. I might cite the Netherlands, <Col N="1020" /> Denmark, Greece and Finland in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Government also introduced a Technology Innovation Programme.  The budget for this programme has been increased by 20 per cent from £1.4 million in 1988 to £1.7 million in 1989.  This programme comprises a number of elements such as: the South East Pilot Programme; the Teaching Companies Programme; the RTC-Industry Partnership Scheme. These programmes are important for the transfer of technology into indigenous industry.  The South East Pilot Programme is also an integral part of Ireland's approach to the proposed new EC STRIDE programme and the expanded Structural Funds.  The name STRIDE stands for &ldquo;Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe&rdquo; and is intended to link regional development and the development of science and technology within the European Community in a way not previously attempted.  I recently hosted a major EC conference in Waterford dealing with the role of science and technology programmes in bringing about greater economic cohesion in the Community.  Considerable interest was expressed by the European Commission in our pilot technology programme in the south east region.</P>
    <P>The RTC-Industry Partnership Scheme has basically done two things. First, it has provided support for the appointment of industrial liaison officers in RTCs throughout the country.  Secondly, it has provided moneys for research teams in the RTCs to conduct joint research projects with local industry. The quality of the applications from the RTCs for this scheme was the subject of very favourable comment by the judging panel this year.  It has indicated to me the wealth of talent which is in the RTCs and the real desire of these people to make their contribution to the economic development of their regions.  Greater co-operation between the regional technical colleges and the industries in their vicinity is an important &mdash; and growing &mdash; element in what is usually called &mdash;<Col N="1021" /> for want of a better term &mdash; Higher Education-Industry co-operation.  The fostering of such co-operation is not only a major objective of my office; it is essential to our future industrial development and to the enhanced competitiveness that is needed.</P>
    <P>We are embarking on some new initiatives under the Science and Technology Development Programme and will be funding four new initiatives in 1989.  An allocation of £3.25 million has been made to cover the costs of these.</P>
    <P>One of these &mdash; the Lough Sheelin pig slurry proposal &mdash; has already been the subject of a public announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Minister for Tourism and Transport. As Deputies will have learned, it relates to finding a biotechnology-based solution to the serious pollution of the lakes in the Lough Sheelin area.  This project, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said, is a very good example of seeking to employ science and technology both to solve a serious problem and at the same time help agriculture and tourism in the locality.  As Deputy McGahon rightly mentioned, one can have contamination by pig slurry in any part of the country.  If this works in Lough Sheelin we will use it all over the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second new proposal relates to a development programme for the Irish contract mouldmaking industry.  Mouldmaking, which is defined as the manufacture of tools used in the conversion of plastic into finished components by a process of injection moulding, is an industry which is regarded as being particularly suitable for development in Ireland.  Mouldmaking involves once-off production to an individual specification and thus provides little scope for large scale production. The key skills required are the metalworking and tool making.  As the material costs involved account only for a small element of overall costs, the <Col N="1022" /> industry is both a high skill and high value added area.</P>
      <P>The market for mouldmaking, both at home and overseas, has been growing over the past number of years.  The Irish market is currently estimated to be worth £13 million, and is expected to grow at a rate of 15 per cent per annum to the end of the century.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year an inter-agency group of executives from EOLAS, the Industrial Development Authority, Coras Tráchtála and the ESRI was formed to examine potential developments in this industrial sector.  This group's report to myself and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce has led to the initiative in this field.</P>
      <P>The IDA, EOLAS and CTT will work together with companies, both on an individual and collective basis, to provide for the development of this sector.  This will be done through the co-ordination of existing schemes such as the company development programme, the technology transfer programme, management development grants, the provision of advisory and consultancy services on the application of advanced manufacturing technology in mouldmaking, and an examination of a group marketing scheme.</P>
      <P>A central feature of the programme will be the upgrading of the facilities at Sligo Regional Technical College to replace outdated equipment and to ensure that the college is a major training centre for toolmakers and tool designers. This particular step is an essential part of the programme.  It should not in any way be seen as a move into the funding of apprenticeship training generally.  That of course is for FÁS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Optoelectronics is now recognised as one of the strategic new technologies of the coming years and one in which there are considerable opportunities for development.  The fact is that while many countries are seeking, sometimes through special programmes, to develop a high level of competing in this technology no one country has as yet achieved a dominant position in the way that Japan and the United States have in the market <Col N="1023" /> for integrated circuits.  What is now envisaged is that an optoelectronics research and development organisation will be formed to commercialise the technological capabilities now available at third level colleges in this country and enable Ireland to get into this growing world market which is now estimated at £6 billion a year and growing at a rate of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent per annum.  The management structure for this programme will be based largely on the model of the biotechnology programme and will involve the expertise in our university centres.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that this optoelectronics programme would initially concern itself in designing and developing a range of optoelectronic devices which can be immediately utilised in the telecommunications industry.  It would also engage in contract research which, over the life of the programme, will lead to niche products suitable for manufacture is this country.  There are already a number of companies established in Ireland which have the manufacturing capability to make these products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <P>Where are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait and see.  I understand that Telecom Éireann plan to spend approximately £35 million on optoelectronics communications equipment over the next ten years.  This is one indication of the potential that exists both for manufacture for home needs and for building a strong Irish capability in this technology of the future.</P>
      <P>The Government have also embarked on a technology development programme in small and medium sized enterprises and a provision of £500,000 has been made available for this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The technology development proposal for small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, aims to confront firms with the consequences of their continuing to ignore technology developments in their sectors: firms will be shown that they must &ldquo;adapt or die.&rdquo;  This will be done using direct visits to firms and through <Col N="1024" /> formal technology audits in these enterprises. The technology audit report and recommendations will show each firm in graphic and direct language the immediate actions required to still be in business in 1992.</P>
    <P>In the seminars on preparing for 1992, in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister of State for Trade and Marketing and myself have taken part throughout the country over the past five weeks or so, technology audits have been highlighted as one of the means by which EOLAS should address the very real problem of enhancing the technological capacity of Irish industry, especially small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>In the first year, approximately 170 companies will be audited.  The cost of audits is estimated at £2,000 per company. Companies will be expected to pay 20 per cent of this up front, i.e. £400.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the programme, the implementation of the audit findings, will typically require actions such as training of staff, modification to capital equipment and further consultancies.  State assistance in support of these actions, e.g. IDA grants, will be available retrospectively on the achievement by the firm of a predetermined target such as attaining an internationally recognised quality standard.  The programme will be implemented by EOLAS in consultation with the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>A provision of £500,000 will be made to replace and upgrade essential capital equipment in EOLAS, so as to increase their commercial viability.</P>
    <P>The management and administration of programmes will be carried out by EOLAS, in conjunction with my own office, and they will play a key role in the management and administration of all these new programmes.  The management of the programmes initiated during the past two years under the science and technology development programme has demonstrated great commitment and skill on the part of those involved.  I am therefore confident that the new programmes I have just <Col N="1025" /> announced today will be equally successful in advancing and sustaining the economic resurgence now well under way.</P>
    <P>One of the tasks at present being worked on with great urgency by EOLAS is the preparation of a strategic plan that would address particularly our industrial development needs for the nineties.  I understand from the board that they hope to have completed by the end of the year, a draft of such a plan for consideration in the first place by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and myself.  I understand that this plan will seek to identify the future technologies on which Ireland should concentrate and focus the infrastructure on the dual tasks of supporting the development in Ireland of those new technologies and also of raising the level of technology and the innovative capacity of a significant number of existing firms especially indigenous small and medium sized companies.</P>
    <P>Within the broad outline I have just given, the issues to be dealt would include a more focused approach to industrial research and development and how to optimise the Irish involvement in the expanding collaborative research programme of the European Communities, under its second framework programme and otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the light of a report prepared by the former National Board for Science and Technology, representatives of EOLAS have been discussing over a number of months past the question of an integrated and more tightly focused approach to the question of industrial R and D.  I understand that agreement has now been reached on new arrangements that they hope to put in place from the beginning of 1989.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact that the level of Irish expenditure on industrial R and D expressed as a percentage of GNP is one of the lowest among EC countries.  Through the efforts of EOLAS and the other State agencies and through increasing involvement in European Communities and other transnational collaborative research programmes that position is I believe now beginning to <Col N="1026" /> change.  But we have still a long way to go.  We need to get a great many more of our industrial companies involved in R and D &mdash; both in-house and in European Community programmes.  But many firms must first address the problem, as already mentioned, of raising their technological capability and their capacity for innovation and new product development. In that way, apart from enhancing their competitiveness and their ability to survive, their appetite to undertake R and D will also be whetted.  It is against such a background that the new science and technology programmes being provided for in the Estimates for 1989 must be seen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to various Government speakers in the past number of hours one could not be blamed for thinking that the Government and the Government party have withdrawn into a cocoon of their own where they repeatedly reassure each other that everything is going well, that all is fair and that there is nothing to worry about.  Unfortunately, anybody who is among the people must be aware of something very different.  If we listened to previous Opposition speakers and checked with the media who have been monitoring the situation over the past number of months, and if we checked with the public who are affected by current policies, we would very quickly find a very different meaning to what the Government are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accepted and expected that economies would have to be made, and they are being made, but there seems to be a total disregard for the effects of those economies under virtually all budget headings.  That is the saddest part of all.  For instance, we are faced with the disgraceful spectacle of having the wives of our Army &mdash; these men cannot speak for themselves &mdash; protest outside the House of Parliament in an attempt to get a meagre increase for their husbands. That is tantamount to a national disgrace. our defence forces, who are called upon time and time again to do very necessary emergency jobs throughout the length <Col N="1027" /> and breadth of the country, have to use their relatives to lobby before the House of Parliament to beg for a meagre increase in their salaries, to get them off the breadline and to ensure that they do not have to depend on supplementary welfare or other supplemental income. Having listened to Government speakers one would believe this kind of thing did not exist.</P>
    <P>I live in a constituency where there are a large number of people in the Defence Forces.  This issue has been brought home very forcefully on numerous occasions over the past six months in particular.  I cannot understand why, at this stage, some action has not been taken or why we allow ourselves to be held up to ridicule in front of the world's television and radio, at a time when Government speakers claim we are doing well.</P>
    <P>Let us look at health and health services. Let one go into any of our hospitals and speak to any consultant or GP, or to the members of the health boards and ask if they are satisfied with the degree of services at the point of delivery.  Everybody, including the members of the health boards, accepted that economies had to be made, and should be made. They even indicated where economies could be made without immediately affecting the standard of service to be delivered to the public.  Go into our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, to the Children's Hospital in Temple Street or any other hospital and ask the staff if they have adequate resources, if there is adequate nursing staff on call at all times, and ask them the number of patients they are expected to cater for at present compared with the number a couple of years ago.</P>
    <P>We do not need to remind the Government that when they were sitting on this side of the House they were loud in their condemnation of what they saw as largescale heartless cuts right across the board in the health services.  The economies made a couple of years ago were minuscule compared to those now being made, and their effect was a very minor <Col N="1028" /> part of the day-to-day running of those hospitals and other health institutions.</P>
    <P>We appear to be scaling down the emergency services, the in-patient services, and the surgical and medical bed accommodation in virtually every corner of the country, but no attempt is being made to put in place the community care services which were always regarded as the ultimate in hospital and health services. I cannot understand why nobody seems to have addressed themselves to that aspect of the health services.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I could not agree with the Government speakers who come forward with a series of Estimates which appear on the surface to be all right, which probably sound very good at an after dinner speech or at a local cumann meeting, and which will probably gather the troops and increase their resolve to do battle once again, but which do nothing for the people who are immediately affected by the maladministration of the funds which are available.  I am not referring personally to anybody involved.  It is simply a question of indicating priorities.  The priorities must be, and should be, exactly where those services are being delivered to the public.  Unfortunately, there are too many grey areas and ultimately the people who suffer most are those at the hospital door and the people in the medical or surgical wards.  The people who are expected to provide nursing facilities and services in those hospitals are also suffering. Anybody in the nursing profession will tell you that the number of patients they are expected to cater for at any given time at present is far beyond what could be expected if one were to give an adequate or reasonable service.</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at the Estimate for the Department of the Environment.  As I have often said, this is one Estimate which affects, without exception, every local authority.  The previous Government speaker mentioned the importance of transport and communications in the context of 1992 and thereafter.  That is true but it is a pity somebody would not recognise that part and parcel of communication and transport is a proper road network.  We hear a lot about a roads <Col N="1029" /> authority and what is likely to happen in the future, but unfortunately many people are asking what is being done now.</P>
    <P>Nothing has happened in the last 18 months although much was promised. Many of our main and county roads have degenerated to such an extent that they are practically non-existent.  Various services have long been withdrawn &mdash; milk delivery and collection services, school bus services, ambulance services &mdash; in many areas.  In my constituency there have been numerous instances where such services have been withdrawn simply because no attention has been given to the very important issue of dealing with main and county roads.</P>
    <P>I accept there are block grants.  When one puts down a question to the Minister asking what will happen in the future one is told that is the responsibility of the local authorities and that they have a fund from which they can draw, and that it is their own prerogative.  We are well aware of that.  Unfortunately, we are equally aware of the meagre nature of the funds from which they draw and little or nothing has been done to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I have said on countless occasions.  There are a number of counties immediately adjacent to this capital city who have to face and accept the pressure of excessive traffic generated by virtue of their location and there has been no recognition, not a single iota of movement in the direction of recognising by way of a special financial allocation, the extra traffic those local authorities have to bear.  I am sorry I have to repeat that statement but I will continue to repeat it until it is recognised that something will have to be done.  I would not be doing my job properly if I did not raise this issue again and again.  The former Minister for the Environment, who has been much maligned by those in Government, made an attempt to give recognition to local authorities by allocating a grant which was commensurate with the amount collected in rates or service charges.  That grant gave local authorities an incentive <Col N="1030" /> to do something for themselves and to spend money on main and county roads.</P>
    <P>The education policy of the Government has received a lot of attention in recent times.  If one tables a question to the Minister for Education one does not receive a positive reply.  I put a question to the Minister about the quota of teachers available to the VEC in my constitutency and the reply I received was to the effect that the quota was in accordance with the request from the committee. I was told that everything was in order.  That is far from the case but it is a typical example of what is happening. The local VEC have lobbied public representatives and told them that they require at least two more teachers if they are to be able to provide a proper service. We also have had difficulties in regard to the primary school sector.  Last week I stressed the need for an extra teacher in a school in my constituency, as I did last year.  The appointment has since been made after a lot of delay but I should like to know why the Department should demean themselves by being mean and tightfisted about such an issue, particularly when the appointment is made eventually.  Had the Department acceded to the request in the first instance they would have generated some goodwill in the community.  I am referring to the senior school in Confey near Leixlip. That is not an isolated incident.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the funds of the national lottery has been referred to by many Members and I do not intend to dwell on that topic.  I should like to congratulate those who have received an allocation from the national lottery but I do not think the system is as fair as it should be.  Deserving organisations who have been involved in voluntary work for many years should be given financial assistance from the lottery funds, but, unfortunately, many of them have been passed over.  I notice that in response to probing parliamentary questions, and letters, some organisations have been told that applications from them did not exist in the Department.  I am sorry to hear that because I would have expected that a careful record would have been <Col N="1031" /> kept of all applications.  There should not be any possibility of an application being lost or mislaid.  I hope we do not hear of any further such losses.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Deasy referred to the reduction in grant-in-aid to CBF by £415,000.  That is a significant drop particularly since levies were increased little more than six months ago to replenish the funds of CBF and ensure that they embarked on a marketing drive.  It is sad that the Minister has cast his pen, or a more blunt instrument, over that subhead and withdrawn some of the money from CBF.  That amounts to a shortsighted policy that is not in the interests of a vital export industry.  It is the duty of CBF to market Irish beef products abroad and they must compete with others who may not have Ministers looking over their shoulders watching every penny spent in the promotion of their products.  That is a serious matter and the Minister should not have allowed a reduction in the grant-in-aid to CBF. He should have told the Department of Finance that that area could not bear a reduction in the amount of the allocation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House to compare the allocation to CBF with that for office premises and expenses.  There has been an increase in the latter of 43 per cent.  Admittedly it is 43 per cent of £911,000 but the increase is still significant. It is ridiculous to see an increase under that subhead when there has been a cut in the allocation to CBF.  It is generally accepted that if we must cut we are more likely to get away with it in the area of administration rather than services.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture allowed that cut to take place.  I note that research and testing will be increased by 70 per cent.  That is acceptable and progressive.  However, there is a decrease of 39 per cent on £434,000 for improvement of livestock at a time when the Minister is stressing the importance of a quality product.  Surely the obvious way to get a quality product is to ensure that our testing is adequate. If we are talking about a sales pitch in the agri-industry we have to produce the <Col N="1032" /> type of animal that consumers will buy. The way to do that is to spend money on testing and research.  We must improve the quality of the national herd.  If we do not we will suffer in the international arena.</P>
    <P>Other Members referred to a growth in the tourist industry.  I accept that there has been growth but it was not as significant as some Members would have us believe.  There is confusion between tourism and emigration.  In some quarters the same people are being counted twice. They leave the country and they are tourists going abroad.  When they come back for their summer holidays they are tourists returning home and when they go back again they are tourists returning to their place of work.  There is something very seriously wrong with the manner in which figures are being presented in relation to tourism and emigration.  This has been denied before but I do not accept such a denial.  Every town and parish in the country has suffered to a great extent the rigours of emigration to an extent that has not been witnessed since the forties and fifties.  I speak from personal experience and I am sure every other Member of this House can say the same: I have seen those people come back home for a couple of weeks during the summer and again at Christmas.  That is something I have not seen since I was a small boy.  I hope that this trend of emigration will not continue.</P>
    <P>Government speakers reassure themselves that everything in the garden is rosy and everything is going well, but that is not the case.  I implore the Government to consider the effects of some of their policies and to rejig their Estimates where possible to ensure that at least the most deserving cases are met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly) Brendan Daly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Roinn na Mara was established to enable the full potential of our marine economy to be utilised and exploited and in the past year a number of major developments have taken place in that regard. The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has identified sea <Col N="1033" /> fisheries as being capable of generating more wealth through increased output, employment and exports.  A plan for the accelerated development of this sector has been agreed and published and the programme for its realisation has been launched.  Aquaculture in Ireland, though a relatively young industry, is now going through a rapid phase of development. I have established the necessary support frame work in respect of the designation of areas, the issuing of licences and the provision of support services so as to facilitate and encourage the continued expansion of this exciting industry.</P>
      <P>We are working toward the rationalisation of inland fisheries and are putting the funding and the development of the industry on a more sound footing. We have set up a programme for the systematic investigation of the marine environment with a view to ensuring that the high quality of the environment continues to be maintained and protected.  I have directed that a programme to enhance marine safety be put in place.  I have Government approval for the establishment of a marine institute which will bring together under one body the activities carried out by a wide range of Statefunded organisations.  The heads of a Bill for the statutory establishment of the institute have been approved by the Government and have been sent to the parliamentary draftsman for preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the Government put particular emphasis on the potential of the fishing industry to generate growth in the economy. The Government's programme recognised that a properly planned approach to the exploitation of our sea fisheries was essential and offered a very significant opportunity for economic expansion and job creation.  The Government's central objective is the creation of lasting new employment.  This requires sound budgetary and fiscal management. It also requires selective development policies for key sectors.  The sea fishing industry and aquaculture was one of the key sectors targeted for special attention in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> We have now completed and published a development strategy for the sea fisheries industry and launched an ambitious programme for the full realisation of the industry's potential.  Significant benefits will accrue to the Irish economy from the successful implementation of this strategy. We aim by 1991 to virtually double fish production; to more than double exports and to create 4,400 new full time and part time jobs.  It is the Government's intention that the plan will revitalise all sectors involved in fishing and, above all, install a new confidence and competitiveness into the industry.</P>
    <P>I reject the allegations that have been made by the Fine Gael that this is a sham. That misinformed, ill-advised kind of comment is unnecessary and unhelpful at this time.  It demonstrates a clear lack of knowledge of what is contained in the plan and ignorance of the facts of the situation.  It shows a lack of realisation of the widespread commitment and support we have got from every sector of the industry for the plan which we launched a few days ago.  Fine Gael should reconsider their position on that because it is an excellent plan and one for which we would like their support rather than this off-the-cuff comment that the plan is a sham.  It is not a sham.  The objectives are attainable.  The industry supports it and I have no doubt that it will be a huge success in spite of this ill-advised comment we have heard in recent days.</P>
    <P>The plan covers a whole range of activities. One of the key strategies in the plan will be the whole modernisation of the fleet which is essential.  We have a fleet which is in need of modernisation.  It has a very high age profile.  It is necessary to improve its productivity and its profitability by modernising it and this is dealt with in the plan.</P>
    <P>The fish processing industry is a vital element in any strategy for this area. Supplies have been a major constraint to the development of the sector.  It is intended to pursue every possible means of increasing the availability of fish &mdash; quota fish, non-quota fish, fishing in third country waters, imports and aquaculture. All these combined will make it possible <Col N="1035" /> to maximise the supplies to the country's fish processing industry.  Through a sound marketing policy we will expand fish landings, develop secondary processing and provide further opportunities for sound jobs especially in the coastal districts. Naturally this type of planned development will entail a very significant level of investment by the industry.  The Government for their part will help to stimulate this investment through the provision of Exchequer financing and assistance. BIM's allocation for 1989 has been increased by £1.7 million which demonstrates the Government's commitment to the industry.  We are backing up what we are saying in the plan with the financial resources to enable it to be implemented and to carry out the work that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Central to the plan is that we operate under the common fisheries policy.  The single most important element of the policy from our point of view is, of course, the quotas or shares available to the Irish fishing fleet.  The quotas secured in December last year, after difficult and long negotiations, provide for the continued development and expansion of the fishing industry.  Management régimes have been introduced in respect of a number of sensitive stocks.  These are designed to provide for fair and equitable distribution of the allocations.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a lot of misunderstanding and misrepresentation about the situation in relation to quotas. Quotas relate to conservation and conservation relates to ensuring that we provide for the protection of stock for future generations.  Anyone who at this time does not recognise that some of the traditional stocks on which we have been depending are under threat because of over-fishing is living in a fool's paradise. The traditional varieties and species on which the Irish industry has been founded are all under severe pressure.  If we allow a situation to develop where the stocks will be over-fished and there will not be sufficient stock replenishment we will be putting the future livelihood of many people in the fishing industry in jeopardy. <Col N="1036" /> We cannot afford to do that and neither can the industry.</P>
    <P>We are asking for the support of the fishing industry and we are getting it in a broad way.  We want the industry to continue to work with us in managing our fisheries because management, conservation and quotas are essential for the long-term survival and prosperity of the people involved in the fishing industry.  It is vitally important that the fishermen, rather than anybody in Government Departments or politicians, undertake stock management and stock controls.  It is vital for their own security, for the security of their families if they want to stay in the business and for the security of the industry itself.  I cannot emphasise often enough the importance of fisheries conservation and fisheries management and the co-operation of the fishermen who will be the first to suffer if we fail to take the necessary steps to protect our fisheries stocks.  That is what quotas are about.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the difficulties experienced over the years by the Irish authorities arising from the activities of the so-called &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo; vessels.  The promoters of such vessels were no real contribution to the Irish economy but rather their activities generate deep resentment among genuine Irish fishermen.  I have pursued this matter vigorously both in the national and European Courts and was greatly encouraged by a decision of the European Court of Justice which found in our favour some time ago.  In addition, I have raised the matter on several occasions at Community level and pressed for a solution on a Community-wide basis, which is in my view essential if we are to find an effective and lasting solution to this problem.  I was, therefore, very happy when my colleagues and I, at the Council of Fisheries Ministers on 23 October 1988, agreed on a regulation to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>This decision almost went unnoticed. It had been called for for many years as there had been a great deal of difficulty especially in the south-west with regard to it.  I wish to direct the attention of the <Col N="1037" /> industry to this decision.  At last after protracted negotiations over a long number of years both in the Commission and in the courts we now seem to have found a solution.  We will keep a very close eye on this.  Our failure to tackle the problem of the &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo; arrangements which were working up to the time that I took office was undermining confidence in the fisheries industry. It was threatening the livelihood of the people involved and was certainly very damaging to the future of the industry. Now we have come to grips with that problem and we will ensure that this unsatisfactory aspect of the Common Fisheries Policy is finally dealt with.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to aquaculture.  It is a relatively new industry which has been making remarkable progress in recent years.  The particular strength of fish farming is that it gives opportunities for development and for employment in areas which are often lacking in them.  In addition, it draws on a unique natural resource which is provided by our still relatively unpolluted coasts.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to aquaculture is, in the broadest sense, to maximise its contribution to the task of national recovery in terms of output, jobs and exports in a manner which is consistent with the maintenance of a clean environment.  The principal measures which I am putting in place in order to achieve this objective include the provision of a sound legal framework for the development of the industry through the designation of areas for aquaculture under the Fisheries Act, 1980, and the licensing of projects within those areas consistent with their ecological carrying capacity.  In the 1989 Estimates we have an increased provision for holding inquiries, as part of the designation process.</P>
    <P>There have been some complaints that the slowing down of the designation of areas has hampered the development of the industry and has led to the hold up of a number of applications and a number of viable projects which could go ahead. It is hoped to speed up the designation process this year and I have provided the necessary finance to enable us to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> We are also working in liaison with the EC Commission in order to maximise assistance for the development of aquaculture. In addition we are working with the industry to ensure that the applications to Brussels are properly presented and supported so that they have the possibility of success.  We have to bear in mind that they have to compete with projects from other member states who are also paying a great deal of attention to this area.  It is important from our point of view that our best projects are properly presented and supported by the necessary documentation to enable us to qualify for the EC funding.</P>
    <P>The main trust will be to promote the production of priority species &mdash; salmon, trout, oysters and mussels which are felt to offer the best prospects for commercial success.</P>
    <P>We expect to achieve an output level in aquaculture by 1991 which will be worth £71 million.  We think this target is achievable and will encourage jobs and economic prosperity.  This will encourage not only the provision of jobs in the aquaculture area but will provide jobs in a whole range of service areas connected with it.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the policy that the Department are following with regard to aquaculture is that aquaculture develops in harmony with other water users and not in opposition to them.  I wish to repeat here that commercial fish farms will not be allowed in what have been traditional wild salmon and trout fisheries.  This has been an area of contention for some time.  We had a situation in the Department where a number of applications were pending for commercial fish farms in what were traditionally wild salmon and trout fisheries. In the past year I, together with the Department, took the first positive steps to put a stop to that.  We indicated that we would not support, encourage or license commercial fish farm operations in what were traditional wild salmon and trout fisheries.  In spite of all the assurances we have given we still find that our position has been misrepresented in that regard. No matter how often we repeat these <Col N="1039" /> assurances, they seem to fall on deaf ears, but let me repeat, lest there be any misunderstandings, that commercial fish farms will not be allowed in what have been traditional wild salmon and trout fisheries.</P>
    <P>We have been able to use the money from my Vote, through our promotional agency, to prime an industry which has the possibility of developing a momentum of its own and which has important linkages with other sectors in the economy in terms of the supply of cages, feed and other inputs.  This generates other employment opportunities.  Recently I was at the launching of a boat in Wicklow which was being used for fish farming on the west coast.  This is an excellent development for the boat yard and is a support service for the aquaculture industry.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's campaign to radically improve the image and status of Irish fish and fishery <Col N="1040" /> products both nationally and internationally was launched by me in 1987 and continued and intensified during 1988.  It is planned to build further upon and consolidate the considerable progress and gains we have made to date. We are embarking upon new quality standards; and the advanced sampling and testing protocols covering fish exports already fully comply with what is at this stage only a proposal by the Commission as part of their plans to harmonise the fish health laws governing intra-Community trade.</P>
      <P>While the preparation of new national hygiene and quality legislation by the Department of the Marine is now well advanced, of equal importance for the industry here will be the impact of the various proposed new EC regulations and directives governing fish and fish health. I wish to repeat, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we are far advanced in terms of Community directives and we propose to take measures and to introduce new legislation to improve the quality standards that are essential.  We are working in co-operation with the industry who are very supportive of our stand.</P>
      <P>In line with our policy of improving the quality standards, the Department have already finalised arrangements designed to put the national ice supply network on a firm footing around our coastline.  The provision of ice and facilities of that nature are essential if we are to get the best possible value from our fish catches. We believe that the availability of ice to fishermen nationally is essential and will ensure that the quality of the product will be enhanced significantly during 1989.</P>
      <P>As I said about inland fisheries yesterday, there is a general acceptance that this resource has tremendous potential for development and will provide tremendous back-up support for the tourism industry as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year we have consistently urged all those who are interested in and who have benefited from inland fisheries to co-operate fully with the fisheries boards with a view to protecting, conserving, developing and <Col N="1041" /> improving the resource.  I am again appealing for that now.</P>
    <P>The Government's objective of setting up a single administrative planning unit for all harbours &mdash; commercial and fishery &mdash; has been largely achieved by the integration of the harbours division of the former Department of Communications and the fishery harbours division of the new Department of the Marine.  The objective will be fully realised in January, 1989 with the transfer of Dún Laoghaire Harbour and the major fishery harbours at Howth and Dunmore East from the Office of Public Works to my Department. I am confident that the centralising of control will facilitate the orderly development of our harbours and will result in the best use of natural resources and limited funds.</P>
    <P>However, the Government decision that European Regional Development Fund assistance may now be sought for public sector entities other than the Exchequer is already proving of major benefit to future necessary harbour development.  The Commission of the European Communities has recently approved commitment in regional aid totalling £3.5 million for two projects in Cork and Dublin harbours.  I have asked harbour authorities to submit further necessary harbour development projects to me and a number of these projects are under consideration in my Department with a view to having them included in the national development plan which Ireland is required to submit to the European Commission in order to qualify for assistance from reformed and enlarged Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Drogheda was mentioned.  We have already provided the capital money for the town for this year.  A major part of the work on harbours this year has been done in Drogheda.  As the Deputy knows I visited the town and was enlightened by him as to the necessity for its development. We recognised that necessity and provided the money.  The work is about to get underway there and the finished project will provide a major instrument by which it will be possible to create new <Col N="1042" /> economic prosperity and job opportunities in Drogheda.  I hope that project will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I have circulated a script which covers a whole range of other activities with which we in the Department are involved showing very clearly that in the short time since the Department was established we have made great progress.  As Deputies are aware, establishing a new Department is not like walking into a Department already in existence.  We had to do a lot of reorganisation in the Department bring together the various section scattered in other agencies and bodies.  We have now completed the reorganisation of Roinn na Mara.  We have a very competent Department capable of responding quickly to the demands placed on us. Anyone who cares to examine the records of the Department will have to admit that we have made fairly major advances in the short time since we were established.  We will continue to make advances during the coming year.  I look forward to the co-operation of the Deputies and I thank them for their co-operation during the past year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate tonight.  I am disappointed with the Government's presentation of the Book of Estimates.  On investigation the figures do not add up.  Independent commentators are claiming in banner headlines that the cuts of £300 million do not add up and that a third of that figure would be much closer to reality.  The last thing we should do in this House is to mislead the people with regard to what we are trying to do to reorganise our finances.  It took years of Fine Gael Government to convince the people that we were living beyond our means and that it could not go on.  We got very little support from the then Opposition for our view.  I was not in the House during that <Col N="1043" /> period but I was involved in local politics and was fully aware of what was happening. When the people finally accepted that we could not continue with the wilful waste of public moneys and the policies followed from 1977 to 1981 in which we tried to spend our way out of our difficulties, which had led us to a crisis in the economy at the end of 1979-80, this minority Government with our support produced a budget in 1987 and another in 1988 but they now find that they have not the heart to continue and complete the job and restore the nation's finances to the sound footing which would enable us to take the opportunities that lie ahead in 1992.  A number of our spokesmen have highlighted the serious problem that has arisen with regard to these Estimates and we now must be wary as to how the budget will be presented.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the budget and especially about education.  The Minister said that in the area of education, languages would be a high priority in her proposals and she promised that teachers would be available to teach the modern continental languages of French, German and Spanish.  That is not the case.  In a vocational school in Cavan which my children attend, French has been dropped from the lower grades because a teacher is not available.  We have made representations to the Minister to make a teacher immediately available to that school so as to restore that very important language for our children if they are to be able to take the opportunities that will present themselves in an enlarged and more open Europe.  If that is happening in the school of which I am aware, I presume it is happening in other schools throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In national schools there is a deplorable amount of hair splitting.  I know of a case where a school bus was withdrawn in a very rural area in County Cavan because they were short of one pupil. That is not good management nor is it the way to make education available to all our children whether they be in rural Ireland or in the cities.  The same opportunity should be available to all children <Col N="1044" /> but that is not the case.  Many of the children in the school catering for children from Clifferna and Stradone live four miles from the school and they have to travel to school on very bad roads. They are being deprived of this necessary service.</P>
    <P>I fault the Government on the day to day management of the schools.  This area is breaking down and is causing disquiet among the people.  In another national school in Annayalla in County Monaghan a teacher has been withdrawn because the school was short one pupil. The school in question is very old and dilapidated.  A prefab was added to it some years ago to alleviate bad conditions. About 30 pupils were put into this prefab because some of the rooms in the old school were not suitable.  Because the school was short one pupil the children were taken from the prefab which was then closed and they are now all cramped into the old school in unhygienic, unhealthy conditions.  The teachers cannot operate effectively because there are no aisles between the desks to allow access to the children at the back of the class.  I made representations to the Minister, to no avail, to have that teacher restored.</P>
    <P>In relation to the environment, there is a major problem in the way the Government's priorities are being thought out.  It is obvious that the Government have no policy with regard to county roads.  There is a total breakdown of infrastructure in the constituency I represent and from talking to Deputies in this House I know it is widespread.  In Cavan and Monaghan we have no means of transport other than by road.  Services are breaking down.  Many school bus drivers, for instance, are reluctant to travel some of the roads and have threatened to withdraw service.  Likewise services from commercial businesses to households are being withdrawn.  People are being asked to come in and collect their goods because it is no longer profitable for commercial businesses to make deliveries in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>We have a very important dairying <Col N="1045" /> industry where a system of bulk collection has been developed, but there are umpteen cases where bulk tankers cannot gain access to farms to collect milk on a daily basis but only two or three times a week.  The cost of breakdowns makes a daily service impossible.  This is a serious problem in a county which is so dependent on agriculture, the primary industry of a country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The state of rural cottages and pre-fabs is a major problem.  We have sent numerous requests to the Department of the Environment for finance to build rural cottages and to make some small improvements to the pre-fabs, quite a number of which exist in our county.  We have been refused the extra funding, yet I heard the Minister for the Environment say today that there is no problem with regard to housing.  If there is no housing problem in the towns and cities, there is certainly a major problem in the rural areas of Cavan and Monaghan.  The Minister's claim that the housing programme is well ahead is not based on any increased Government expenditure but is due to the number of young people who have left the country owing to the policies being pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Vote for Agriculture. The Government are failing to back up the substantial grants available from the EC for the western package and farm improvement programmes.  Obviously there is a major cutback in these areas. We have heard much today about the need for drainage because of the flooding which has occurred all over the country, but no grants are now available for farm drainage under the western package.  We are not taking advantage of the moneys available from the EC because we are not prepared to match that money pound for pound.  If we were prepared to negotiate I believe we could possibly get a 70 per cent refund.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the thorny problem of our application to have the whole of Counties Cavan and Monaghan included in the severely handicapped areas.  The Estimate shows a reduction in the amount being made available to match the <Col N="1046" /> moneys which can be made available under the scheme.  This leads me to believe that the Government do not intend to pursue that application this year.  This is tragic because it is costing the economy of County Cavan an estimated £2.5 million or £3 million per annum.  A sum of between £700 and £1,000 per farm has been lost in headage payments because the Government have not pursued the application which was made initially by Deputy Deasy.  It was subsequently withdrawn and submitted again by the current Minister for Agriculture and Food in what I believe to be a watered down version.  We have not been given the details of that application but I know it is not being pursued and that much needed finance is being lost which would boost the economy of County Cavan.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem with regard to cross-Border trade.  There is a regular flow of traffic, particularly for the purchase of petrol.  Any little effort towards reducing the price differential between North and South would, I believe, stop that flow of traffic.  It must come about by 1992 but why should we wait until the eve of 1992 to introduce this change? Why not move gradually towards it and give the garages who are dependent on petrol sales the opportunity to survive? It is unfortunate that when people travel North they then decide to do their shopping there and an amount of money is being spent unnecessarily across the Border.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the smuggling of red diesel and home heating oil on a major scale.  I have been advised by reputable oil dealers that the problem could easily be solved by the introduction of a dye in the red diesel and home heating oil being used on this side of the Border and that this would put an end to the racket.  I compliment the Minister, the Garda and the Customs officials who stopped the racket whereby red diesel was being bleached.</P>

      <P>I used to be able to do it quicker.  I am grateful to you and to Deputy Boylan for the opportunity to come here as I have done for the past six years to lament the forgotten county of Ireland, County Louth.  It is the county that nobody gives a tinker's dam about, either in this Government or in the previous Government.  No county has suffered as badly as Louth over the past 20 years and the unemployment figures in Dundalk bear testimony to that.  The unemployment rate in Dundalk is 32 per cent, the highest in Ireland.  The national average is 18 per cent.  There are people in Dundalk who say that America has Ronald Reagan, Johnny Cash, Bob Hope <Col N="1048" /> and Stevie Wonder, while Ireland has Charlie Haughey, no cash, no hope and no bloody wonder.  That sums up the attitude of all Governments in the recent past, certainly in the six years I have had the privilege of representing the unfortunate people of County Louth.</P>
      <P>The most recent major crime against these unfortunate people was the decision by this Government that County Louth should no longer qualify as a Border county for EC classification.  The decision is indefensible and inexplicable. That can only be explained by a psychiatrist. County Louth, the foremost Border county which everybody from here to Strasbourg knows has suffered so desperately as a result of economic policies pursued by different Governments and as a result of the Ulster troubles, has been dropped as a Border county and, incredibly, included as a midland county.  That has been done to make way for County Sligo, which is 28 miles from the Border.  That Tammany Hall political decision is an example of how little the Fianna Fáil Government care about the people of County Louth.</P>
      <P>My two constituency colleagues contributed. Deputy Kirk spoke of mushroom growing.  What will that do for the 4,200 unemployed people in Dundalk? Deputy Dermot Ahern, my other colleague, spoke of the good news of the Irish economy but he had no news for the unfortunate people in his own county. He could have given a weather forecast of icy blasts to continue against the unfortunate and hapless people who live in that neglected area.  I have been consistent over the last six years in coming here and, when it is warranted, attacking my own Government for their failure to address the problem in that area.</P>

I echo the sentiments of my Border colleague, Deputy Boylan, in pointing to the tremendous level of cross-Border smuggling which is a huge haemorrhage on our very slender resources.  I ask the Government to do something for the legitimate traders who continue to struggle to exist against very difficult odds in the Border region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that I have this opportunity to speak about the Justice group of Estimates. I am responsible for six Votes in all.  Between them the Votes account for some £375 million out of a total of £6.226 billion for the net Estimates for the Supply Services.  As such, they are quite an important element in the Government's plan to strengthen the public finances.  Each of the six Votes shows a single figure percentage increase in the provision, as compared with the provision for this year.  Overall, the increase is in the order of 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The overall net Estimates provision for the Garda Síochána in 1989 is £277,240,000, which represents an increase of 2 per cent on the 1988 allocation of £273,053,000.  Salaries, allowances and overtime account for some £210 million of this amount and the superannuation provision is £44.6 million.  The other major items are £9.36 million for travelling, subsistence, compensation and miscellaneous expenses, £6.84 million for Garda transport, £3.79 million for the purchase, rental and leasing of radio, computer and other equipment, £5.12 million for postal and telecommunications services, £3.56 million for station services and £1.75 million for uniforms and accessories.  The provision for Garda overtime in 1989 is £7.65 million, as compared with an allocation of £8.3 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for salaries and allowances allows for the resumption of recruitment to the Garda Síochána in 1989.  A recruitment competition is already under way, from which it is proposed to make up to 1,000 appointments to the Garda Síochána over the threeyear period 1989 to 1991.  Applicants <Col N="1050" /> have undergone written tests and the results of these tests are expected before the end of next month.  Interviewing of the candidates is expected to commence early in the New Year and the first group of trainees are expected to be appointed during the spring.  The new recruits will be the first to undergo the new training system approved by the Government. The new system takes into account the recommendations of the Walsh committee, who are conducting a review of all aspects of Garda training, in particular the recommendation that training should be ongoing over a period of two years.</P>
    <P>The maximum economies have to be made again this year in all areas of expenditure on the Garda Síochána.  The provision for communications shows a reduction of £400,000 on the 1988 allocation. This reflects the spin-off by way of greater efficiencies in the use of telephones which is attributable to recent capital investment in new telephone systems. The reduction of £500,000 over this year's allocation for uniforms is in keeping with the reduced demand for uniforms now that the initial period of high expenditure necessary to outfit the force in their new uniform is coming to a close.  The reduction in the provision for Garda transport, £810,000, reflects a saving of £500,000 in the allocation for the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet and the abolition of an annual payment to the Department of the Environment in lieu of motor tax on the Garda fleet. The 1989 allocation also reflects a reduction in the price of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Garda accommodation, a major development programme designed to bring accommodation at the Garda Training Centre in Templemore up to modern standards has been approved and the initial phase &mdash; the demolition and clearance of old and dilapidated buildings &mdash; is already under way.  The actual construction and refurbishment element of the programme will be getting under way early next year and is expected to be completed within <Col N="1051" /> three years.  The modernisation programme will provide single bedroom accommodation, new classrooms and a range of other necessary facilities bringing accommodation at the training centre up to the standards required of a modern police college.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1.75 million is provided in the Capital Programme for the Garda national communications network project and this amount is sufficient to cover the expenditure which will arise at this stage of the project.  The network consists of three phases.  These are (1) the system for the 18 divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area; (2) the system for the Dublin Metropolitan Area; and (3) a microwave system to link all divisional headquarter stations with each other and with Garda headquarters.  Phase I has been fully in operation for over the past two years.  The radio element of phase 2 is due to come into operation very shortly and this will be backed up by a sophisticated computerised command and control system which is scheduled to come into operation early next year.  As regards phase 3, work on the planning of this system is already under way and it is expected that some expenditure will be incurred on it next year.</P>
      <P>The Estimate includes adequate provision to meet the non-capital expenditure which will arise next year in respect of Garda computer projects.  The provision of £240,000 in the capital programme will allow further significant development of new computer systems for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding on the Estimate's provisions for the Garda Síochána for the coming year, the Government were acutely aware of the vital importance of the police service to the community.  While there is a continuing need to restrict expenditure on the Garda Síochána Vote to comply with overall public expenditure targets, the necessary economies are being applied in such a way as to maintain essential police services at the best possible level and to ensure that the operational efficiency of the Force remains <Col N="1052" /> unimpaired.  I am satisfied that the Estimate's provisions for the Garda Síochána in 1989 will allow all essential policy requirements to be fully met and that the Garda Síochána in common with the other areas of the public service will continue to respond to the need to get our public finances back in order.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the Garda, of course, is the prevention and detection of crime.  The purpose of the Government's investments in the Force is to fight crime and to maintain order.  The Garda, and indeed our whole community, have for some years now been faced with a very serious challenge posed by increased violence and organised crime.  I have no wish to play down the seriousness of the crime problem.  Far from it.  However, I do believe that it is important to keep the situation in perspective.  The fact of the matter is that over the past four years the trends have been encouraging.  Between 1984 and 1987 the level of recorded indictable crime in this country fell by about 17 per cent.  In referring to these trends I and my predecessors have been at pains to emphasise that they give no cause for complacency and that the extent of the problem that remains to be tackled must never be underestimated for one moment.</P>
    <P>Preliminary indications are that the level of recorded indictable crime has risen somewhat in the first eight months of this year particularly in the Dublin area.  The figures are only provisional as yet and it is important to bear in mind that statistics on the incidence of crime over relatively short periods of time are only of limited value as indicators of long term trends.  However, the figures do give cause for concern and I want to assure the House and the public that crime trends are being continually monitored by the Garda authorities and that they are regularly evaluating and adapting their strategies for the prevention and detection of crime to meet those trends.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the Garda will continue to achieve the very considerable degree of success they have had in dealing both with crime in general and with certain types of crime.  A particularly <Col N="1053" /> serious threat to our society is posed by armed raids.</P>
    <P>A good example of successful Garda activity in this respect was the surveillance operation mounted late last year which resulted in a number of targeted criminals being dealt with by the courts and receiving significant custodial sentences.</P>
    <P>I am of course pleased with such success. However, we must never lose sight of the fact that the best solution to crime is crime prevention.  I am pleased that I am in the position to continue to support Garda crime prevention policies.  The Estimate provides for 28 crime prevention officers &mdash; ten in the DMA and 18 in other divisions.  These officers are available to give advice to the public on how to reduce the chances of success for the would-be burglar, vandal etc. by taking simple but effective precautions. Such precautions as adequate locks on windows and doors, ensuring that cars are locked when left unattended and that valuables are never left on view in unattended cars are all aimed at ensuring that the would be thief or vandal is not given the opportunity to act.  I would urge the public to use this service by consulting their local crime prevention officer and seeking advice on securing their homes and property.</P>
    <P>I have great faith in the value of co-operation between the public and the Garda to combat crime, so much so that I have provided in the Estimate for 23 community police officers.  This will enable the pilot community policing schemes introduced early this year to continue.  These schemes which aim at improving communications between gardaí and the community, also provide a visible Garda presence where it is most needed.  I am hopeful that these schemes will help to reduce such crimes as vandalism and burglary as well as assisting gardaí generally in the investigation of crime.  I am observing the progress of the schemes with great interest and I am hopeful that they will be as successful as the neighbourhood watch schemes have been.</P>
    <P>There are now 672 neighbourhood <Col N="1054" /> watch schemes involving 156,753 house-holds throughout the country.  The Garda authorities consider that these schemes have had a deterring effect on the criminal, have improved co-operation and communication between the public and the garda, have increased public awareness of home security and have lessened anxiety among participants about crime. I believe that the public were for too long an untapped and unrecognised crime prevention source.  This and other community based schemes have begun to harness this resource in the fight against crime.  I am glad to say that the number of schemes now in existence and the overwhelming public response to the Garda is evidence of the public's willingness to work with the Garda.  Long may this effective partnership continue to flourish.</P>
    <P>Not quite 12 months ago I had the duty to report to the House the knowledge that, almost certainly, four shipments of arms and ammunition had been brought into the country during the years 1985 and 1986.  The extent of these shipments and the sophistication of some of the weaponry meant that the Government have had to face a potentially very serious situation.  Deputies will be aware of the nationwide arms search conducted 11 months ago and which, I might mention to the House, is still on-going and will be until we have secured those weapons. The Government will not shirk their obligations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Garda are continuing their search in every Garda division and district in this country.  I want to again take this opportunity of asking members of the public to co-operate with the Garda in their search for arms.  I would also request people to exercise forebearance in this matter.  There have been some complaints that premises and homes have been searched where it was not warranted. However, the Garda have to follow every lead and it would be remiss of them not to do so.  If members of the public would try to imagine themselves in the position the Garda are in, they might understand the situation better. Searching houses and premises is in many ways a thankless task, but it has produced <Col N="1055" /> results.  In the first six months of this year alone over 250 firearms and 137,000 rounds of ammunition have been recovered during the searches.  The amount of ammunition recovered was greater than all that had been recovered in the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>While I congratulate the Garda on their success and would ask the House to join with me in so doing, I would remind Deputies that the quantity of arms which remains unaccounted for and which has not yet been found is far greater.  We have a duty as protectors of democracy to ensure that those arms and ammunition which were brought ashore in 1985-86 are seized by our security forces from the men of violence.  The search effort must and will continue.</P>
    <P>The Government's allocation of a capital outlay of £4.28 million to upgrading security and services and to improving facilities generally in nearly all the prisons and places of detention indicates continuing commitment to overtaking existing shortcomings.  The new custodial accommodation for 320 at Wheatfield was completed in February 1988 and has now been furnished, equipped and commissioned.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £42.048 million for prisons pay shows an increase of 11 per cent over that for 1988.  This provision will enable the prison service to continue to respond to the various and wide ranging demands being made on it, which with rising committal rates, are constantly increasing.  In particular, the provision will enable staff to be provided to cater for additonal accommodation due to come on stream shortly.</P>
    <P>This additional accommodation is in two areas.  First, additional accommodation is now ready at Fort Mitchel, Spike Island and the allocation will allow the assignment of 19 additional staff there.  This accommodation will mean that Fort Mitchel will be catering for about 110 prisoners, and this will, of course, ease the pressure on accommodation which exists in other institutions.</P>
    <P>The second area is, of course, the new <Col N="1056" /> institution at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin and the allocation allows for it to be brought into operation during next year.  I have not yet made a final decision on the use to which the institution will be put.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that, following the recent industrial action a review of rostering arrangements in the prison service has been carried out by Professor Basil Chubb.  I have recently received his report and it is at present being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Estimates also make provision for education and work training programmes in the prisons.  The allocations are £250,000 and £600,000, respectively.  I attach great importance to these programmes as it is through them that efforts are made to improve the prisoner both as a person and in regard to his responsibilities to others, as well as providing him with skills which he did not have.  On the education side, there are now the equivalent of 97 full time teachers, mainly from local vocational education committees, providing tuition to offenders in all the institutions.  General school subjects are taught but considerable attention is paid to subject areas such as literacy, social education, art, physical education, languages, wood-work, drama and music.  In addition, a number of offenders are pursuing degree courses in the Open Universities.</P>
    <P>The work training programmes provide industrial training and occupational activity which are designed to prepare offenders for employment, which we hope will be available to them, after imprisonment.  A variety of workshop and agricultural activities are also available which enable a wide range of aptitudes and interests among offenders to be catered for.  The importance of work training in the prisons is borne out by the fact that such programmes have been grant-aided from the European Social Fund in recent years.</P>
    <P>I believe that the wider use of alternatives to prison is necessary to stem the flow of committals to custody.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, which I initiated, provides that <Col N="1057" /> offenders can be required by the courts to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work for the benefit of the community.  The work is performed under the general supervision of the probation and welfare service of my Department. The community service order scheme is being widely implemented by the courts.  To date, more than 3,000 orders have been made in criminal cases throughout the country in respect of offenders who would otherwise have received a custodial sentence on conviction. These orders, as well as providing a socially constructive, humane and progressive alternative to imprisonment, are also seen to be cost effective.</P>
    <P>Another area in which modest investment is being amply repaid is the establishment of probation and welfare projects in the community.  Several probation hostels, workshops and resource centres have been set up around the country by voluntary committees in association with the probation and welfare service, for the benefit of offenders on release from prison and young people at risk of getting into trouble with the law. My Department provide 100 per cent grants towards the capital cost of establishing such projects and up to 95 per cent in grants towards their running costs.  The total provision in the Estimate of £1,385,000 underlines the Government's commitment to the continuation and development, where possible, of such probation projects as a viable alternative to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in the provision on the courts Vote is 5 per cent which is accounted for mainly by staff cost increases.  The increase is in line with the general range of increases in the Votes for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is an overall increase does not mean, however, that the court service is not being effected by cutbacks in resources.  In some areas there has been a reduction in staffing levels.  Courts must continue to function at an equal if not greater level than previously in order to cope with greater volume of cases and the courts must be provided with a back-up service.  The only <Col N="1058" /> way of coping is through greater efficiency.  I am glad to say that the courts service has been coping well in this situation. I mentioned on previous occasions my desire to see greater efficiency in the court service through a combination of improved working practices and computerisation.  A great deal of progress has been made in providing a sound basis for future computerisation of court service operations.  Planning for the future is at present under way and in the meantime there is provision in the Vote for next year to enable a certain amount of development work to take place.  The provision is not, of course, as great as some would wish bearing in mind that a substantial amount of next year's provision is required to support existing installations.  I am optimistic, however, that in the not too distant future conditions will be right for major developments in this whole area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to state that the 1989 Estimates provision for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds shows a 9 per cent increase over the provision for 1988.  Delays in registration of property in the Land Registry have been a matter of serious concern to me.  The delays are, of course, due to a reduced number of staff and a higher intake of work.  To deal with the problem I have made arrangements under the Government's redeployment programme for the allocation of extra staff to the Land Registry and I am confident that this measure will lead to a considerable improvement in the arrears situation there.</P>
    <P>I am confident also that the application of modern technology has a considerable part to play in the provision of an efficient and effective service by both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.  The computerisation of the folio records which is currently fully operational in respect of Dublin is being extended to incorporate all the counties of Connacht and County Clare.  The computerisation of the abstracts in the Registry of Deeds is also under active consideration at present and I envisage that we can implement <Col N="1059" /> such a programme in the latter half of next year.</P>

      <P>Vote 20, Office of the Minister for Justice, contains a provision of £2 million for compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  This represents an increase of 1 per cent on the £1,975 million in this year's Estimate. I have given careful consideration to the funding of the scheme for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  As I have told this House in reply to parliamentary questions, there is a considerable delay at present between the date on which an applicant agrees to accept an award and the date he receives payment: at the moment the gap is approximately one year.</P>
      <P>The reason for the delay in making payment is that the provision for awards in the Estimates in recent years has not been sufficient to enable payment to be made in respect of all awards.  Prior to the amendment of this scheme with effect from 1 April 1986 the number of applications has been building up steadily year by year.  As documentation became available to enable the Criminal Injuries Tribunal to make awards in these cases the cumulative amount of awards made outstripped the annual provision in the Estimates. As a result a time lag developed between the acceptance of the amount of an award by an applicant and the time by which he received payment.  As time went by the time lag got longer and, as I already said, it has now stretched to approximately one year.</P>

      <P>To deal with that problem, which I accept is causing hardship to certain people, I will shortly be seeking the agreement of this House for a Supplementary Estimate of £4 million to enable payment to be made this year in respect of all cases in which applicants have accepted awards to date.  I am confident that the House will agree with me that this is a reasonable approach to the current problem of funding for the scheme and one which will have a substantial impact on arrears.</P>
      <P>A total provision of £4.238 million is included in the Estimates for my office in respect of criminal and civil legal aid. That represents an increase of about £290,000 on the allocation for legal aid in 1988.  The increase is due mainly to an expected speeding-up of payments of claims submitted by lawyers under the criminal legal aid scheme arising from computerisation.</P>
      <P>The Estimates include provision of £254,000 for the first full year of the operation of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The office of the commissioner was created under the Data Protection Act, 1988, which seeks to protect the privacy of individuals about whom personal data are kept without excessive regulations or the imposition of undue burdens on industry.  The success of the legislation will depend to a large extent on the independent commissioner who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act. The Government have already appointed the commissioner and it is proposed that the Act will be brought into full effect in or around April of next year when persons affected will have had sufficient time to adjust to the requirements of the legislation. In line with Government policy it is intended that the staff costs at the office will be met by redeployment and that the fees generated by the registration system established by the Act will go towards the non-pay costs of the office.</P>

    <P>I wish to put on record my satisfaction at the success of the Government's financial policy.  The 1989 Estimates for the Public Service and the 1989 Summary Capital Programme will lead to further <Col N="1061" /> successes and, accordingly, this should be noted by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, sharing the serious public concern about the quality of health care, calls for a fundamental re-organisation of the delivery of health services, in order to free resources which could then be used selectively to improve the quality of service and expand the provision for priority needs.  The following reforms are required:</P>
      <P>1.  The establishment of An Bord Sláinte, a semi-State body, to replace the Health Boards and stremline the management and delivery of health services.</P>
      <P>2.  Cost-cutting reforms in the areas of administration, the purchase of medical and non-medical supplies, certain consultants fees, the rationalisation of laboratory facilities, the greater use of computerisation and better property management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  A revision of the method of funding voluntary public hospitals by the introduction of clinical budgeting <Col N="1062" /> and separate ear-marked allocations for National Tertiary Services.</P>
    <P>4.  The appointment in each hospital of a general manager.</P>
    <P>5.  Hospital managers and An Bord Sláinte should be specifically charged with ensuring much greater co-ordination between hospitals and Community and Primary Care Services.</P>
    <P>6.  An Bord Sláinte should draw up and implement a National Hospital Plan for acute services, including the concentration of the most modern equipment and advanced skills in regional centres of excellence, where they can be fully utilised to the benefit of the community.  These centres should be backed up by the complementary provision of local hospitals with specified levels of care.</P>
    <P>7.  Improved medical management through greater development of General Practitioner Services including improved access to Hospital Diagnostic Services and Consultant opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate some of the points I made last night.  The first important one is that we must always remember that the health services are about people and patient care.  When people criticise our health services it is important to remember that in 1987 500,000 people were inpatients in hospitals and 1,500,000 people attended hospital as out-patients and that those people had a quality service available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1063" /> I accept that there are gaps in the service. During my 25 years in general practice and my 16 years as a member of a health board there were always gaps in the service and the same gaps were there which are there now &mdash; waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery and the unavailability of orthodontists in the dental service. I should like to reply to something Deputy Yates said last night.  Five health boards advertised for orthodontists but because they did not make themselves available only one health board was able to recruit an orthodontist from that competition.</P>
    <P>On the question of Bord Sláinte, we heard last night about local managers, regional managers and general managers in hospitals.  This is a whole new layer of bureaucracy that would cost quite an amount of money and more increased administration.  I should like to know how many frontline staff would have to be displaced to allow for this administrative structure.</P>
    <P>There was no word of what would happen to community care.  I believe that there must be a local health board to provide community care for people.  The health services are totally different from commercial organisations such as the ESB or Bord Telecom which are in the main providing one product and a uniform supply.  Health services are totally different and I think the Deputy has fallen into the trap of seeing the delivery of health care in a very simplistic fashion. In this way one does not take account of patient needs and of the vulnerability of patients when they are ill.  I believe that must be of prime consideration and I do not believe it is possible to run a health service similar to a big commercial organisation which responds to the forces of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we have a first-class quality service which compares favourably with any other country in Europe.  I am also satisfied that the Government will ensure that they continue to make that service available to the people who need it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;priority needs&rdquo; in the fourth line and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recognising that it is now estimated that in excess of 10,000 public patients are on waiting lists for hospital admission, many of whom are awaiting hospitalisation for over 12 months, calls on the Minister for Health to:</P>
      <P>1.  Introduce a new funding system for hospitals which would guarantee equality of access to essential services for public and private patients.</P>
      <P>2.  Alter the present arrangements whereby a large number of hospital beds are currently occupied by long stay patients at a cost of up to £1,400.00 per week, many of whom could be more appropriately cared for in properly regulated nursing homes for a quarter of the cost.</P>
      <P>3.  Improve the incentives for General Practitioners to become more involved in many diagnostic services and thereby releasing much of the unnecessary pressure on hospital services.</P>
      <P>4.  Promote practical proposals for the development of community health care, involving an expansion of the home-help and community nursing services, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.  Rationalise the number of Health Boards given that one of the existing eight, the Eastern Health <Col N="1066" /> Board, caters for 41 per cent of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have to say at the outset that, by and large, I agree with 90 to 95 per cent of what Deputy Yates had to say in his opening contribution last evening.  It is extremely important, at a time when this country is spending over £1.2 billion of public expenditure on the provision of health care, that we do everything we can to ensure that the health services are delivered in a cost-efficient and effective manner.  This year we will spend double what we spent six years ago on the health services.  If that rate of expenditure continues by 1994 this country will be spending something in the region of £2.4 billion on the provision of health care.  Nobody in this House or country could argue that the doubling of expenditure in six years has resulted in our population being twice as healthy or in the quality of the service being twice as good.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read in the first page of the Minister's contribution last evening that he rejected utterly the comments of those who say that the quality of care in the health service is not up to the highest standard.  He drew a distinction between what he called the quality of the health care available and the gaps obtaining in the service.  While I respect the Minister's right to do that, to those who cannot get health care when they need it very badly, the high quality of the health care available to those who can get it is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>The main problem in the health service is not a lack of resources but rather a total lack of direction and leadership, as the Minister for Health abandons his responsibility and watches public money being squandered by refusing to put in place the procedures necessary to ensure that all our citizens have essential health care when it is required.</P>
    <P>This Government rightly have received the support of the public in their efforts to curtail Government expenditure and restore order to the public finances. Indeed there was scope for public expenditure cuts in areas like health.  But in the implementation of the more cuts approach to health, this Government and <Col N="1067" /> Minister have gone about it in advance of setting in place the kinds of procedures and management structure that would ensure that our citizens would have easy access to a caring, high quality health care service.  The Government's approach to health has resulted in many people being subjected to unnecessary hardship.  I refer in particular to the old and to sick children.  We have now arrived at the point &mdash; it is difficult to get accurate figures on exactly how many people are on waiting lists &mdash; that I am told reliably there are 10,000 people awaiting essential hospitalisation today, many of whom have been a hospital waiting lists for over 12 months.</P>
    <P>The present position in Dublin is so bad that, generally speaking emergencies only can now be admitted to hospital. For example, there are 4,000 people on a waiting list at the Mater Hospital and 2,000 at St. Vincent's.  In the Mater Hospital a total of 390 of the 450 beds have been put at the disposal of the accident and emergency services.  Even the 20 beds in the coronary care unit frequently are filled by accident and emergency cases.  What is particularly worrying is that the position should be so bad at the onset of the winter.  With the bed shortages affecting accident and emergency services and resort to trolleys to accommodate patients overnight the position is likely to worsen as the winter unfolds with its inevitable unbelievable increase in illness and hospital admissions. At this time the really vulnerable people are the elderly and children. When we see such appalling problems &mdash; with elderly patients being detained overnight on trolleys &mdash; we must ask what will be the situation in the months of December and January next.</P>
    <P>Equally it is appalling and insensitive that children should have to be detained overnight on trolleys, as has happened in Temple Street Children's Hospital.  The position in children's hospital in Dublin has become so critical that, on several nights in the month of September, there were no beds available in Temple Street Hospital, Harcourt Street Hospital or <Col N="1068" /> Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin.  As a result sick children were accommodated on trolleys in casualty at Temple Street Hospital even in cases where they were on intravenous drips.</P>
    <P>There is now a three year waiting list for ear, nose and throat operations at Temple Street Hospital.  That hospital now has to function with two-thirds of the beds and staff they had two years ago. Although Temple Street is the busiest children's casualty hospital in Ireland or Great Britain &mdash; dealing with over 56,000 casualty patients last year &mdash; a detailed report submitted to the Department by the hospital still awaits action.  I am pleased that some of the professional medics working in Temple Street Hospital saw fit to speak out.  To those who tell them that they must remain quiet in order to remain open I say they are being responsible when they make the public, and particularly politicians, aware of the chronic conditions under which they have to work and the serious implications for sick children in this country.</P>
    <P>In any re-examination of the future role of Temple Street Children's Hospital &mdash; and there is much speculation about its future &mdash; the Minister for Health must realise that that hospital is situated in a deprived part of Dublin city.  There are virtually no general practitioners living in that huge catchment area.  I believe the expenditure of the £3 million necessary to refurbish Temple Street Children's Hospital is urgently required.  I hope the Government will see their way to approving that expenditure.  It is wrong that this Government, or any Minister, should see fit to allow a situation develop in which many children are now being referred to adult hospitals that have no paediatricians, no paediatric nurses, with expert knowledge in the area of child care.  That is inappropriate.  It is also bad for the development of the health services in this city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tragedy if it does. Another matter that deserves to be <Col N="1069" /> brought to the attention of this House is something that has been brought to my attention.  Recently, I understand that two women gave birth in the casualty ward of Ennis General Hospital.  They did so while male patients lay in adjacent beds.  In my view that is a disgrace and is totally unacceptable.  Regardless of the position of our national finances I do not believe it is necessary for women to give birth in circumstances in which there are male patients in adjacent beds in the same ward.</P>
      <P>I drew attention also in the course of the Estimates debate in this House some months ago to the difficult position obtaining in the surgical wing of the Coombe Hospital in Dublin.  That position appears to have deteriorated since I drew attention to it in this House.  Many public patients' appointments are being cancelled by telephone on the morning they are due to attend or to be submitted for vital operations.  One can imagine the way women feel who are subjected to such treatment &mdash; the trauma of the operation alone, the kinds of arrangements they must make to have their children cared for, all of the planning that goes into preparation for a stay in hospital. One can imagine how they feel when appointments are cancelled not just once but, in some cases, twice or even three times.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that more and more of existing hospital beds are being preempted for accident and emergency cases reducing continuously the number of beds available for elective admissions. The accident and emergency services are so disorganised, with no overall direction or plan, they require urgent attention particularly in the Dublin area.  Some months ago when this problem was brought to the attention of the public by the national media the Minister promised to set up a committee and I believe it is only this week that committee are to meet and to get down to work.  In addition I am told they have been given no time limit to their deliberations; if they sit forever it will not make any difference to this Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that one of the main <Col N="1070" /> problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the crisis that has arisen in relation to hospital admissions results from the manner in which our hospitals are funded.  At the beginning of each year hospitals are allocated block grants.  There seems to be little or no control over how they use this money and there seems to be no direction from the Department or the Government as to which area of the hospital service various amounts of money are to be applied.  The result is there is no incentive for hospitals to treat public patients, in fact there is a clear disincentive to treat them.  Every public patient costs them more, every private patient brings them in more money.  That is why St. Vincent's Hospital recently converted one whole floor from public to pay beds.  It is wrong to have instant hospital treatment for those who can afford it and a long waiting list for the less well off.  This two-tier approach to essential health care is unacceptable and it is only by introducing a fundamentally different method of funding hospitals that the current conflict between public and private patients will be resolved.</P>
    <P>Many hospital beds are currently occupied by long-stay patients at a cost of up to £1,400 per week but many of whom could be more appropriately cared for in private nursing homes for as little as £200 to £300 per week.  We need to introduce new and comprehensive regulations for private nursing homes and fund the placement in such homes of those long-stay patients who do not require beds in high tech hospitals.  Families too, if given a little incentive, could be encouraged to take home many of their elderly relatives. There is a tendency on the part of some general practitioners to refer patients to hospital for treatment which could be carried out in a well organised doctor's surgery.  Recently, when visiting a GP friend, I noticed that somebody came to his door asking for a letter of referral to a hospital.  It seems to be too easy to write the letter and send the person off to a hospital.</P>
    <P>The tax incentives currently available to GPs need to be more widely publicised <Col N="1071" /> to encourage them to improve the facilities in their surgeries.  Many routine diagnostic tests, cardiographs, blood, urine and chest tests can be conducted in a surgery for about 20 per cent of the cost in a hospital.  Movement in this direction would greatly relieve much of the pressure on the hospital service.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the situation in relation to Cavan Hospital which was built at a cost of £26 million to the Exchequer and is costing £500,000 per annum to maintain and heat.  I understand that perhaps overnight the Minister may be allocating some money for the opening of the hospital, which would be a good thing.  However, I wonder if he will bite the bullet in relation to a decision that needs to be made regarding Monaghan Hospital.  I am sorry that the Minister has left the House.  When Deputies in other parts of the country saw fit to criticise decisions made in their areas, the Minister has always been very brave and courageous in telling them how cowardly they are and so on.  I look forward to seeing whether this Minister will take his courage in his hands and take the necessary decisions in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>In a debate like this it is appropriate to refer to the present problems being experienced by the VHI.  I understand that the annual report for February 1987 to February 1988 which is currently before the Minister for Health and which he has taken a long time to lay before the Dáil, will show an underwriting loss of approximately £15 million.  If this is the case it is an alarming figure and one which threatens the viability of the company. The underwriting losses for 1986-87 were £5.3 million and if the figure of £15 million is accurate for 1987-88, it is almost a threefold increase in their underwriting losses in one year alone.  This comes in a year when the VHI subscription increased by over three times the rate of inflation.  These losses have occurred because of the increased demand for VHI cover.  People heretofore entitled to free hospitalisation have opted for VHI cover in order to get the much needed hospital <Col N="1072" /> bed.  The increased cost of private beds in public hospitals is also a contributory factor and, of course, the huge cost of de luxe health care in the Mater Private Hospital and Blackrock Clinic.  The combination of the above three reasons have resulted in the VHI facing a serious financial crisis and that is why they have applied to the Minister for an increase in the premium.  They are also trying to get the private hospital to agree to a new average daily cost payment system.  The VHI subscriber will obviously now be asked to pay more money for less cover. The problems are urgent and require immediate Government intervention.  I also ask the Minister to make available to the Members of the House the VHI report for the year 1987-88.</P>
    <P>I also want to briefly refer to the new capitation system which the Minister proposes to introduce for the GMS scheme. This new system will replace the present fee per visit method.  While I agree that it was time for a review of the present way of remunerating doctors participating in the GMS scheme, we are going from one extreme to the other.  The present openended system, whereby doctors were paid for every time they visited their public patients was aften an incentive to see a patient when it was unnecessary to do so.  However, to go to the other scheme is equally wrong and will cause a lot of hardship, to medical card holders in particular.  The GP scheme in general works very well; it is the one area of the health service about which I never get a complaint.  People have easy access when required to their GP.  It is interesting to note that fewer than 40 per cent of GPs in the GMS scheme have voted in favour of the new proposals and only 58 per cent of doctors voted in the recent IMO ballot on the proposed new scheme.</P>
    <P>There is widespread concern among GPs about the new proposals and particular concern in areas like my own constituency where a high number of people are dependent on the GMS scheme and where there are many medical card holders. It is not just the reservations of the GPs themselves; their own professional college of general practitioners, the body <Col N="1073" /> who are concerned about professional standards in the GMS scheme, have expressed their concern at the lack of specific incentives to continue domiciliary visiting of the terminally ill, the chronically ill, the elderly and the handicapped in the community.  Their criticism is worth taking on board and the Minister must look again at his new proposals.</P>
    <P>On examining the memorandum, I note that there are many unanswered questions.  For example, the doctors operating the scheme will be expected to work for 40 hours per week but, an additional payment will be made to them if they see a patient between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. I wonder what kind of remuneration doctors will get for people they see after their normal finishing hour and before 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>There are also problems in relation to the doctors who will not agree to go into the new scheme.  Does the Minister propose to end their present contracts?  What action does he propose to take in that regard?  I also note that women working in the GMS scheme will be entitled to only 14 weeks paid maternity leave if they have lists of over 500 patients, yet study and other leave will be available to those who have only 100 patients.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week there was a lot of publicity about the introduction of the new MMR vaccine.  The level of publicity led to a huge flow of interest and many GPs were contacted by their patients inquiring if they could avail of the new vaccine.  Doctors in the Dublin area have informed me that, on making inquiries, they were told they could only have three vaccines for both this week and next week.  I know there are difficulties in introducing such a scheme but if it is widely publicised it is important that all the necessary back-up facilities are available because if people demand something like this and do not get it they lose interest.  It is a question of better organisation. That seems to be the problem throughout the health services.  There is great scope for a reduction in the amount of people working in administration.  The Minister criticised Deputy Yates's call for various managers.  I might not necessarily <Col N="1074" /> agree with Deputy Yates but we badly need a new management structure throughout the health service.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the introduction of a Bord Sláinte recommended by Deputy Yates.  I cannot see what role a semi-State body such as a Bord Sláinte could carry out which the Department of Health could not undertake.  I agree that there is great scope for an amalgamation or a reduction in the number of health boards.  If one health board can cover one-third of the population, surely we do not need seven health boards to cover the remining two-thirds of the population? There is scope for rationalisation there, although I am not sure if the abolition of all the health boards is the answer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister took on board a suggestion made by my party some time ago to abolish the local health committees.  I served on a local health committee for quite some time and I could never understand its relevance.  It unnecessarily tied up administrators and professional people who should have been involved in other levels of the health service.  We have come to a time of great opportunity and we must all reassess the manner in which public expenditure is used and the manner in which health care services and others are delivered.  The Government should not miss the opportunity to set in place the kind of structure and to take on board the many suggestions that have been made by many people for change.</P>
    <P>I accept that making changes in the health service because of the power of vested interests is fraught with difficulties in relation to vested interests.  Everybody wants to protect their own corner, but at a time of financial restraint it is imperative on all of us who are responsible and realise there is not a limitless pond of money to come up with practical suggestions for change to take on board many of the difficulties that could be resolved if politicians showed a little courage, a little leadership and gave a little bit of direction.  Many corns may have to be stood on if the right decisions are to be made, and if this Minister sets about doing that he will have my support and <Col N="1075" /> that of my party.  Above all else we must ensure that the citizens of this country, the sick and those who are vulnerable and cannot afford to pay for health care, are not deprived and do not have to put up with an inferior or second class health service.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The amendment proposed by The Workers' Party reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;health care&rdquo; in line two, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and while noting the need for a fundamental re-organisation of the delivery of health services, recognises that the immediate crisis in the health service and particularly in our public hospitals, arises from the cutbacks imposed by the Government, and therefore calls on the Government to end its policy of indiscriminate cutbacks and to ensure that hospitals and other areas of the health services are provided with the finance and resources necessary to provide an acceptable and effective level of health care.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The whole issue is that the level of health care being provided is not adequate, therefore, perhaps resulting in the death of people who should be admitted to hospital at a much earlier date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I would like to refer to is the inequity in the distribution of the funds in present circumstances when the health board get their allocation.  In regard to the Cork area, whoever would have thought about the planning of a 600 bed regional hospital just a few years ago while at the same time we were told there was a need for a second general hospital on the north side of Cork city?  This is where the planners of our health services have wasted public money, resulting now in the level of service provided not being <Col N="1076" /> adequate by any means.  In that regard, lack of equity in distribution, I mention our own hospital, Mallow General Hospital, a 101 bed hospital which £2.5 million would run for a year.  In the Cork city area the voluntary hospitals can get their allocation.  I refer to this because of the duplication of services.  I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear me because the present Minister for Health said to the Southern Health Board and the hospitals in Cork in 1987: &ldquo;In the duplication rationalise the services.&rdquo;  I am talking about the Regional Hospital, the Bon Secours, the Mercy Hospital, the South Infirmary, the Victoria Hospital, all providing duplication of service.  The proof of that is that the Minister's Department approved the expenditure for a CAT scanner for the Mercy Hospital in Cork and one month later he had to provide the finance for the same service, a CAT scanner for the regional hospital.  I ask the Minister to tell us when he is replying what he was doing about the policy he had insisted on, that is rationalisation of the services in the Cork city area.</P>
    <P>At the same time our general hospital in Mallow was cut in a non-pay budget by 25 per cent.  Where is the equity?  We were advised that that was attributed to the amount of work of the previous year. Months ago the Minister said it was not beds that were necessary, and the volume of work, the amount of day care work provided at that hospital was not provided for.  Let me say from this position that if the Southern Health Board, the Minister, or the executive of the Southern Health Board think that by stealth they are going to reduce Mallow hospital to provide a lesser service than is required for that 72,000 population, they have another think coming.</P>
    <P>I understand that 954 people have accepted voluntary redundancy within the health service.  We have 7,000 temporary workers in the health services, and the offer of 850 permanent jobs has no significance in the light of that fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister has previously stated his concern about community care.  I understand that in Cork we would need at least 50 district health nurses to bring the figure <Col N="1077" /> in the Southern Health Board area up to meet the national average.  Is community care being provided there?  People cannot be provided for at home when they reach the stage of needing constant care and attention and instead of getting them from the Southern Health Board they are getting them from private institutions which are springing up all over the place in the towns and villages where families of working class people have to pool their resources to pay for their relations who cannot be catered for at home.  That is the level of service in community care.</P>
    <P>A most iniquitous system of this State is the fact that the PAYE sector's tax is not deductible before assessing eligibility for medical cards.  What justice does the Minister see in that system?  The eligibility is based on the gross income which bears no relation to the net pay.  That is resulting in the mothers of small children going to the doctor only if they can afford to pay the doctor.  Very often they do not and end up in hospital.  In many instances they will not go to a chemist simply because they cannot afford to pay.  That is scandalous.  I am giving those examples to highlight the inadequacy of the level of health care being provided as a result of the cuts that are taking place.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to mention again what is now tantamount to a scandal. Consultants are paid a salary by the health boards, but because there are no beds or maybe not sufficient beds they are treating certain people as private patients and forcing people to take out VHI.  Last year the estimated loss for VHI was £18 million.  That went to subsidise private medical care.  We should not have any doubt about that because the consultants who were forcing people to take out VHI and treating them and being paid by the VHI are the same people who are being paid a salary and should have been treating those people in the public service. That must not be allowed to continue. For all patients to have the right of access to treatment and control over their care the role of the VHI must be changed.  The consultants' contract must be changed to ensure that consultant doctors have an economic interest in seeing and treating <Col N="1078" /> all patients on the same basis.  A charter of patients' rights should be agreed, introduced and promoted, and democratic accountability of the health services should be strengthened at national and local level.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to take this opportunity of welcoming Deputy Ivan Yates as Opposition spokesman on health for Fine Gael and I wish him a very long stay in that august position. Indeed, I wish Deputy Allen the best in his role as mayor of Cork which is the reason he cannot be here as spokesman.</P>
      <P>I must confess to being somewhat mystified as to the source of the Labour Party's figures for GNP.  I am not sure whether the 1986 figure used relates to the approved expenditure for that year or if it takes account of the unapproved excess expenditure which occurred in that year, due to the mismanagement of the health services by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has already stated, over-expenditure of £55 million was allowed to accumulate by the end of 1986 in the health agencies by this mismanagement and the annual level of recurring over-expenditure had reached a figure of £35 million.  The defence presented last night that health boards simply overspent is admission of a complete reneging by Government of their responsibility to govern.  This led to the walk out of that Minister at that time because he was not prepared to grasp the nettle and manage the Department of Health in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of this irresponsibility was that, in regularising the expenditure position, Exchequer funds, which should have been used to provide services, had to be used to meet interest charges and to reduce overdrafts.  We are still paying for that over-expenditure which was not authorised and would not have been approved by any other Minister.  The factual position in relation to 1989 is that total public expenditure on health will be 7.1 per cent of GNP and not 6.2 per cent. This is a most acceptable figure for a <Col N="1079" /> country at Ireland's stage of development, and particularly in the context of our current financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to Ireland's position as regards other OECD countries. International comparisons of health expenditure can be misleading.  Expenditure classified as health expenditure varies widely from country to country. For example, cash allowances such as the disabled person's maintenance allowance are classified as health expenditure in Ireland but not so in the UK.  It is also extremely difficult to measure expenditure on health outside the publicly funded services.  The OECD recognises that analysis, based on public expenditure only, will not provide a complete picture of overall health expenditure.  In at least seven OECD countries the privately funded element accounts for over 25 per cent of total health spending.</P>
    <P>The OECD also recognises that analysis of changes in real expenditure relative to real GDP &ldquo;cannot be used to compare real quantities of health services across countries&rdquo;.  The amendment also refers to our dependency ratio in the context of international health expenditure comparisons. Yet, the OECD admits that detailed spending weights for the very old and very young are not generally available, and that these are necessary for better estimates.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Labour Party insists on using these comparisons, let me point out that Public Health Expenditure expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is one basis of comparison used by the OECD is higher in Ireland than in countries such as Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, we will spend about 7.1 per cent of GNP on public health services in 1989.  This is a decline in the level obtaining in the earlier part of this decade.  However, it is in line with the international trend.  The OECD confirms that for all countries, over a four year period real health expenditure increased only half as fast as real gross domestic product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> Having said that the provision now determined for 1989 is the most we can afford, let me add that this Government are making every effort to ensure that this provision, which will allow expenditure of over £1,350 million to be generated, is used with maximum efficiency. I know that the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;, in the context of the health services, is viewed with scepticism by many.  Efficiency is not, and should not be, the overriding consideration but is foolish to imply that it is irrelevent.</P>
    <P>If services are less costly in inevitably follows that scarce resources can be freed up for other areas.  Realistically, more efficient management of existing resources is the only way in which future developments can be funded.  The Department are engaged, with the full co-operation of the major health agencies, in a comprehensive cost containment exercise.  This pooling of knowledge and resources will be or great importance in the achievement of value for money.  In addition, detailed work is underway in examining the allocation process, again to ensure that resources are so distributed as to gain the maximum benefit.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party amending motion refers specifically to receipts from the amnesty scheme.  These receipts are very welcome indeed.  However, it must be clearly recognised that they are once-off boost for the Exchequer and will result in a lower Exchequer borrowing requirement this year.  This is something that the Coalition Government, and particularly the Labour element of it, were not prepared to tackle.  We have succeeded where they failed.  I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Finance and his staff on their excellent results in collecting £500 million as a result of the amnesty.</P>
    <P>While an easy option would be to spend this once-off source of funding we simply cannot afford to do so.  Notwithstanding this revenue, we are still borrowing huge amounts this year to meet day-to-day spending &mdash; too much of our resources are still going to pay debt servicing costs, about £2 billion in 1988 and even with <Col N="1081" /> the lower Exchequer borrowing requirement the ratio of debt to GNP will continue to increase this year.  One can realise what we could do if we had £2 billion available for job creation at this stage.  It would be dramatic and remarkable. Nevertheless we must point out that the national debt increased from 1972 to 1977 by about £12 billion, an extraordinary increase in such a short time, more than the total increase in the previous ten years.</P>
    <P>The national debt currently stands at over £24 billion.  Even taking into account the results of the amnesty, the opening budgetary position for 1989 is well above the range of 5-7 per cent of GNP needed to stabilise the debt GNP ratio.  The determination of this Government in meeting their financial and economic targets and improving the economy and employment projects have rightly received widespread praise throughout the community.  If we do not carry on with the present policy then the whole health service will be undermined.  It is in the national interest that we have decided to use the £500 million from the amnesty to reduce our borrowing requirements.  We are not prepared to slacken in our efforts and indeed the general public do not wish us to do so.  While I may criticise aspects of Deputy Yates' perspectives on our health services and his proposed solutions, I acknowledge that his motion is realistic to the extent that he, unlike the Labour Party, accepts that the additional resources over and above those which have been approved are not the answer to the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I admit to a certain level of puzzlement arising from the references in the printed media this morning to a speech delivered by Deputy Harney on the debate on health care in this House last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that I correct this.  At least RTE realise who make speeches and who do not make speeches in this House.  It is very important that I make that point.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, spoke on this debate here last night in great detail but I do not think his speech got the coverage it deserved in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning.  In fact he made an excellent contribution to this debate but it was a speech which was not made which received coverage it did not deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary measures which have been taken and which the Minister for <Col N="1083" /> Health referred to last night are clearly aimed at achieving the maximum efficiency in our health care system, including our hospital sector.  I would like to place on the record at this stage my admiration for my colleague, the Minister for Health, Dr. O'Hanlon, and the work he has put in in the Department over the last 18 months.  It is extraordinary what he has achieved in that period.  It is only fair that I should say that because I appreciate more than most, having worked with him since March 1987, the amount of effort he has put into his portfolio in the Department of Health.  He has been an outstanding success and I would have to go back some years to be able to name another very prominent Minister in this field.</P>
    <P>This very rationale is underpinned by the fundamental truth that the greater the level of efficiency and effectiveness in the system, the greater the benefits to patient care, the greater the number of patients who can be treated and the greater the response can be to non-urgent elective interventions.  It is true that if we do not provide medical care efficiently we are actually depriving potential patients of care from which they could benefit.  This truth is not a conceptual issue which has no basis in the reality of how we manage and determine the direction of our health services.</P>
    <P>The message of this Government not only in the area of health resources but in general economic and social policies is that we should strive to become more productive and more efficient, not as an end in itself nor as an objective divorced from a wider strategy, but rather as a part of the strategy in the health services, for example, which ensures that a procedure or process can be performed better and this means that more people within the system will benefit.  This message is beginning to become part of the everyday actions of our health sector managers; clinicians and para-medical staff and this is directly as a result of the Minister's and the Department's initiatives in the positive management and discretion which has been applied to the system as <Col N="1084" /> a whole.  It is very important that the public realise that the system is far more efficient and that efficiency is vitally important in the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>We cannot live under the idea that we can give everybody all the health care they demand.  Rationing of health care is inevitable as society cannot nor will not pay for all of the services modern medicine can provide.  The burden on society would be too great.  This truth has emerged, not fully and not universally, I hasten to add, in our approach to the health services.</P>
    <P>At the macro-political level there is little difficulty with what I have said.  The consensus which has emerged in political opinion ensures its success.  It must be emphasised that limited resources actually means a limitation of services and on the capacity of the State to intervene in the manner and, more importantly, to the extent to which society would ideally wish.  In the democratic process, the parameters of society's investment in its health services is as approved by the Dáil. In deciding on the financial resources allocated to health, Dáil Éireann, on behalf of the citizens it represents has set the parameters beyond which it is not prepared to go in the interests of services generally.  The overall figures approved, despite what Deputies have said, are sufficient to provide a quality service to those most in need and this is accepted by the major political parties.</P>
    <P>A global figure for health services approved at national level has emphasised in recent years that there is a unity in the diversity of health services in that additional resources devoted to specific services in reality means an equivalent reduction in other areas.  The concept of opportunity cost has been given a very real and practical expression in the last two years.  I am convinced that there are still many further practical lessons to be learned in properly applying this concept. The Minister and the Department at the centre have a particular responsibility to the health services as a whole and in the equitable manner in which they ensure a balanced development throughout the <Col N="1085" /> services generally.  The Minister and the Department have exercised their responsibilities admirably.  I must say that we, in this country, are fortunate to have the level of services we have; we compare favourably with any other country in the world.  We should keep that fact in mind at all times when people criticise the health services.</P>
    <P>A consequence of limited resources is that there are greater demands to determine priority services and an acceptance that meeting priority needs implies that services cannot be provided in areas of marginal need.  This is so in order to ensure that those most in need of care receive such care in an appropriate and timely manner.  In addition, it is imperative that those who avail of health care that arises from investment by the State and can afford to pay for such resources should make an appropriate contribution. This contribution on those who can reasonably afford to pay is used primarily to improve hospital services, expand their development and ensure that sufficient income is available to hospitals to continue to provide services for those who are unable to pay.  In that regard it should be noted by the House that the Labour Party when in Government did not levy charges sufficiently on the categories of persons who could and should make a greater contribution to the use of State funded facilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The extensive reorganisation of the acute hospital services undertaken in the last 18 months or so was badly needed.  We must recognise that the problem had to be tackled and we were prepared to take the appropriate action, which we have taken over the last 18 months.  It was simply not possible to sustain all the hospitals and all the beds which we had in the system within the level of the resources which this House accepted as being adequate to fund a viable and effective health care system, in particular, it was not possible to meet <Col N="1086" /> the demands which advances in medical science and technology make at the scarce resources at our disposal.</P>
      <P>The motive for initiating the review was positive.  This was to ensure the provision of a hospital service which could cope in a caring way with all the genuine demands placed upon it which is efficient and effective and which is in line with our ability to fund it.  Unfortunately, much of the debate and media coverage centred on what were perceived to be the negative aspects such as bed and hospital closures. This I can well appreciate since the public at large and in particular local communities can be alarmed if they see hospitals being closed and bed numbers being reduced.  I can fully sympathise with their concerns and worries at particular times and can appreciate the trauma which these closures cause in a community.</P>
      <P>In a period when funding has to be restricted in the interests of the economy as a whole it is necessary to concentrate the available funding to maximum effect. For example, it is more efficient and effective to ensure that the number of beds in the system are adequately funded rather than to spread the available funding too thinly over the greater number of beds.  What is important is the quality of the care and attention provided in hospitals.</P>
      <P>I am now satisfied there are sufficient hospital beds to meet all genuine demands apart from a few cases where there have been traditional long waiting lists, such as orthopaedics and ENT.  I am very well aware that our hospital services have had a difficult two years and it is now necessary to consolidate and capitalise on the initiatives which had to be taken &mdash; particularly in areas where large-scale reorganisation has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the general hospitals' programme consumes approximately 50 per cent of all spending in health, it is absolutely necessary that these services are organised in a way which enables us to deliver an adequate and acceptable level of service at reasonable cost so that funds can <Col N="1087" /> be made available for the necessary strengthening of the other services.</P>
    <P>A point which is frequently overlooked is that the delivery of health care in hospitals is a dynamic rather than a static system.  Advances in technology have had a huge impact on hospitals and thus have, in turn, forced hospitals to critically evaluate their methods of operation. There is a greater emphasis now than in the past on concentrating resources on out-patient and day facilities.</P>
    <P>I am greatly heartened to see that practically all hospitals are now adopting this approach with the result that far more patients than heretofore can be treated at a substantially reduced cost.  Also the developing technology and improved management of patients means that the length of time patients spend in hospital has been considerably reduced.</P>
    <P>I think it is very significant that, while practically all hospitals reduced their bed capacity in 1987, very many of them in fact treated more patients than in 1986. That is a fact of life and should be recognised. These innovations indicate that the actual bed complement of a hospital is not in itself the critical factor.  Other factors, such as diagnostic support facilities and improved patient management, can be and are of greater importance and these are the areas on which our attention should be focused rather than on bed numbers as such.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the situation in my own constituency.  The rationalisation which took place ensured the survival of the county hospital in Roscommon.  I had to face great difficulties in relation to that issue.</P>

      <P>I think the media have concentrated too much on bad news.  They have not recognised the excellent work that has been done in the health area.  In my view, they have been used by others for their own ends.  Unfortunately, good news does not make the headlines.  I hope the media will be more responsive to good news.</P>

      <P>Funds were also provided which will enable other new hospital developments to be commissioned at an early date.  These include the new hospital at Cavan and the new developments at St. James's, the Mater, Mullingar and Castlebar, all positive developments which have not been recognised at this stage.  These facilities will add greatly to the hospital services in these areas and are further evidence of the commitment of the Government to ensure that we will continue to have a strong and vibrant general hospital service in which the people of Ireland can have confidence and pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particular attention has been given to the long-standing problems concerning elective orthopaedics.  I would point out that the recent rationalisation of services in the Dublin area has allowed the Minister and the Department to greatly <Col N="1090" /> improve the elective orthopaedic services previously at Dr. Steevens Hospital now provided by the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals.</P>
    <P>A development programme has been agreed with the hospital authorities in Cappagh and the Arthritis Foundation by which the theatre facilities in the hospital can be improved.  This will further enhance the services available.  I can sympathise with the people involved, but this problem did not arise under this Government. It has been there for some time, but we are committed to improving the situation.</P>
    <P>We are moving towards shaping a health service which is affordable and sustainable.  Two critical areas are being addressed.  We must have an acute hospital system which is geared to our ability to pay, which is effective and caring and which is efficient.  Alongside it and linked to it at all vital points, we must have a primary health care system which is capable of doing many of the things now done in hospitals.</P>
    <P>In adapting the acute hospital system to our present circumstances, we must take a number of important decisions. We must decide on the level of funding we are prepared to devote to this sector of the service.  In making this decision, we must ensure that there are adequate funds for other services, including primary health care.  We must organise the system so that each hospital within it is medically viable and gives a quality service in a businesslike manner.  We must also quickly develop a form of primary health care which provides a real and available alternative to hospital care.</P>
    <P>Specific guidelines were set down for health agencies on how they should frame their budget to ensure that the basic fabric of our health care system remains intact while at the same time ensuring that the best possible service is delivered within the amounts available.</P>
    <P>We are now telling the health boards their funding for 1989.  This is efficiency, and will ensure that they can plan ahead. They will have plenty of opportunity to meet and discuss the allocations which will be decided by the Minister, the <Col N="1091" /> Government and the Department and which will be notified to the health boards in early November.</P>

      <P>As I said, we took over in March 1987 and had to produce a budget for the remainder of 1987, and we made the allocations in April of that year. That has changed dramatically.  Since I was elected to the Dáil in 1977, I cannot recall, up to now, Estimates being discussed in the House in October.  The Government are now giving Members an opportunity to put forward positive viewpoints on the Estimates before the budget.  I am delighted that we are getting an opportunity to discuss in the House the health services on a regular basis.  We are being given an opportunity to outline future strategy.  I am satisfied with the work being carried out by the Minister and the Department of Health.  I should like to pay tribute to the officials of my Department for the work they are doing. Everybody in the Department is working hard to ensure the best possible delivery of health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my contribution will have a similar effect.  The amendment in the name of the Labour Party reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;care&rdquo; in the second line and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  notes the Exchequer expenditure on the health services has been progressively cut back each year, from 7 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 6.6 per cent of GNP in 1987, 6.4 per cent of GNP in 1988, and to an expected 6.2 per cent in 1989;</P>
      <P>(ii)  further notes that as a consequence, health expenditure in Ireland, which was higher than the OECD average until 1986, is now substantially below the OECD average, particularly having regard to the high dependency ratio in Ireland;</P>
      <P>(iii)  believes that there is now a major crisis in the health services, which will, in the absence of emergency action, cause loss of life and very considerable hardship throughout the community;</P>
      <P>(iv)  believes also that there are gross inequalities in the delivery of care, as a result of the emergence of a two-tier system of health care, which has already been condemned by many organisations including the Churches;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(v)  asserts that these crises must be resolved immediately, and cannot be resolved in the short term by improvements in administration, <Col N="1093" /> however desirable they may be in the longer term;</P>
    <P>(vi)  notes that the Government, in addition to making substantial savings as a result of underspending (in overall terms) in the current year, has also received substantial amounts of revenue over and above expectations, through the Tax Amnesty and other sources;</P>
    <P>(vii)  resolves therefore that a proportion of those savings and additional revenue, at least sufficient to restore health expenditure to its 1986 level of 7 per cent of GNP, should be set aside and allocated to the Health Estimate for 1989, and instructs the Government to make this additional allocation immediately.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It must be clear from the framing of the motion before the House that there is a fundamental difference between us and the parties of the Right about how the present crisis in the health services should be resolved.  We believe that the crisis is fundamentally a problem of resources and that it cannot be resolved by a kind of tinkering around with the system or a sleight of hand proposed by Fine Gael in their motion.  Last night we heard a long and detailed speech by the Fine Gael spokesman on health in support of his party's motion.  I can think of no more damning indictment of that speech than that it enabled the Minister for Health of all people to point out that the Health Estimate was about people and patients and that it was impossible to talk at length about health care without mentioning people.  The Minister repeated those comments tonight and similar comments were included in the contribution of the Minister of State. How bereft Fine Gael are of compassion if they allow the Minister to point that out to the House.  The major difference between them, so far as I can see, is that Fine Gael are able to ignore the whole concept of care in everything they say about the health services while Fianna <Col N="1094" /> Fáil ignore that concept in everything they do.</P>
    <P>I read with amazement the opening lines of the Minister's speech last night. He said that we must reject utterly the suggestion that there is a problem about the quality of health care.  Where does the man live?  Later, the Minister said we have an excellent service and that it was unfair and alarmist to suggest otherwise. I should like to suggest to the Minister that it is not alarmist politicians who say that we have a crisis in the health service.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 8 October last reported that:</P>
    <P>Delegates to the fifth Irish Medical Organisation conference in Galway heard of the chronic situation in hospitals caused by lack of beds, difficulties in admitting patients, early discharges and inexperienced temporary nursing staff.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 5 October reported:</P>
    <P>In a major development, the Irish Association of Hospital Consultants entered the debate to highlight its &ldquo;grave concern&rdquo; at what it described as the &ldquo;accelerating&rdquo; fall-off in patient care.</P>
    <P>The serious deterioration in patient care was now &ldquo;evident throughout the country&rdquo; and the people mainly affected were &ldquo;those least able to provide their own medical care&rdquo;, it said.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 6 October stated:</P>
    <P>INO general secretary, P.J. Madden, said last night they would be seeking immediate action from matrons on a resolution at their recent conference aimed at bringing home to the public the scale of the cuts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We want matrons to take a stand by refusing accommodation to people left waiting on trolleys.  They should not attempt to set up extra beds of temporary accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of 7 October carried a <Col N="1095" /> statement from the Irish Matrons' Association and added:</P>
    <P>The group which represents hospital matrons yesterday called on everybody in the care of patients to make a stand on what it called &ldquo;the worsening situation in our hospitals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We feel, therefore, that a stand must be taken by everyone involved in the care of patients &mdash; including nurse managers &mdash; to ensure that resources are made available to cope with the worsening situation in our hospitals &mdash; brought about by the drastic reduction in hospital budgets &mdash; and the restrictions on the employment of staff&rdquo;, the statement ends.</P>
    <P>I have a full folder of statements along similar lines and I quoted four moderate, conservative and responsible organisations representing those at the front of the delivery of our health service and every one of them underlined one fact, we have an unprecedented crisis in health care.  For the Minister, and the Minister of State, to say in the House that we do not have such a crisis, and to tell us that to say there is a crisis is alarmist represents to me a gross dereliction of duty. The Minister is either irresponsible and does not care or he is out of touch with what is happening.</P>
    <P>We need to get back to some basic facts.  The last time international comparisons about health spending were gathered was in 1984 when the OECD published a major study on the subject. At that time they found that Ireland spent 6.9 per cent of GDP on health when the OECD average was 5.6 per cent and the UK spent 5.5 per cent.  It might appear from those figures that Ireland is well up in the league of health spending but the truth is that the only reason we are spending a higher proportion of our national wealth on health care is because our national wealth is considerably smaller. When <i>per capita</i> figures of spending are looked at the true picture emerges.  The <i>per capita</i> figure for Ireland in 1984 in US dollars was $514; the OECD average was $722 and the UK figure was $585.  In <Col N="1096" /> other words, we spent less on health than the Government of Mrs. Thatcher which had been systematically dismantling the national health service for four years at that time.  We spent about 75 per cent of the average of OECD countries.  Whatever else can be said about health spending, no one can convincingly argue that we spend too little by comparison with other countries in the western world.</P>
    <P>Throughout the years that Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for Health, spending on health services was kept absolutely constant at 7 per cent of gross national product.  He was not just criticised for that; he was pilloried by the Members &mdash; I do them an honour in saying that &mdash; on that side of the House who now grace the Government benches. Day after day they came into this House, led by the present Minister for Health, and predicted the direst of consequences if health spending was not significantly increased.  When Deputy Barry Desmond resigned from office rather than implement the draconian cuts insisted on by Fine Gael, they got their first opportunity to undo the damage that Fine Gael were proposing to inflict on the health services in the budget of 1987.  What did they do?  Did they take that opportunity?</P>

Instead of charging the poorest sections of the population for each prescription, as Fine Gael proposed to do, they decided to charge them instead for each hospital visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My blood pressure was raised again during the contribution of the Minister of State earlier when he talked about the over-expenditure of the last number of years, over-expenditure of £55 million. Every single health board with their Fianna Fáil majority ignored the directions of the Minister for Health and decided to run deficits that were illegal, instructed of course by the chief attacker <Col N="1097" /> of the Minister in the House, the present Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who encouraged Fianna Fáil to over-spend in every Department.  It is an outrage for the Minister of State to come in here tonight and say that there is a new discovery, that Fianna Fáil over-spent by £55 million.  I think the Minister would blush with shame if I re-read into the record again his statements of the last four years in which he attacked the Minister for an under-expenditure in health.  But of course everything changes and immediatley after the election health cuts no longer affected the old, the sick and the handicapped because Fianna Fáil were in power and they could turn everything on its head.</P>
      <P>What have Fianna Fáil done in their 18 months in power?  Eighteen hospitals with a total of 1,470 beds, have been closed; 3,617 beds have been closed throughout the country &mdash; 2,659 acute beds, 349 geriatric beds and 609 psychiatric beds.  Up to the end of 1987 the staffing of health baords had been reduced by 3,163.  The voluntary hospitals have lost 1,936 staff and specialist agencies have had to suffer the loss of 113 staff, 10 per cent of their total.  The only area of the health service where staff was increased between 1984 and 1987 was in the mental handicap area and all of that increase occurred between 1984 and 1986.  Between 1986 and 1987 there was a reduction in staff of 143 in this vital area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The health services of our people do not need another review.  What is needed is resources.  A two-tiered health service of the kind favoured by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is one that will further disadvantage the poorest and the weakest in our community.  What is happening now in our health service is not just a scandal; it is a series of scandals piled one on top of the other.  We know about the deaths that have been publicised and about the elderly patients who have had to lie on trolleys for hours on end, only because they have relatives who are willing and determined to speak out about them.  We can never be sure about the legion of old people who have died alone or the patients who suffer in silence. In too many cases there is no-one to tell us about the real human dimensions of the tragedy that is unfolding and <Col N="1099" /> being inflicted by this administration on the Irish people.</P>
      <P>One of the most serious aspects of what is happening in our health services is the scandal of the way in which some of our hospitals are being forced by cutbacks to treat people.  Only today I have come across evidence of a most disturbing kind concerning one of our major hospitals, where patients are being subjected to a practice which is little short of theft.  I am told that in this hospital pensioners admitted to public wards &mdash; patients with full medical card entitlements &mdash; are forced to give up their pension books. The pension is drawn for each week of their stay in the hospital and kept in the hospital.  I intend to suppy full details of this practice to the Minister for Health, since it is in clear contravention of the Health Acts.  I will be pressing him to ensure that not only is this practice fully investigated but that full restitution is made in any case where this contribution has been extracted.  What is unique about this case, in my experience, is that it is happening to public patients in acute beds for relatively short stays.  We all know there are instances where long-term patients are forced to pay for the services provided to them in county hospitals by yielding up their pension books.  In many situations old age pensioners are left with £5 per week or less after these deductions to provide themselves with the basic necessities not provided by the health boards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Indignity and cruelty are features of the service that Fianna Fáil have created. I know the Minister for Health will attempt to dismiss this charge as being emotive and alarmist.  Both he and Fine Gael are much happier arguing about <Col N="1100" /> the arithmetic than they are about the devastation and the cost in human terms. It is time we cut through the smokescreen they want to build around this subject. All the talk about pathologists earning £250,000 a year is just that &mdash; talk.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Estimates for Public Services 1989 and Summary Public Capital Programme 1989: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Finance on Tuesday, 25 October 1988:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann takes note of the 1989 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged Version) and of the 1989 Summary Public Capital Programme.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>After &ldquo;Programme&rdquo; to add to the Motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;published by the Government on 18th October, 1988.  In noting the publication of the 1989 Estimates Dáil Éireann draws attention to the fact that they present only one part of the budgetary and financial picture for 1989, and resolves to have a full debate on each estimate as amended, as soon as possible after the 1989 Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East.)</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the 1989 Estimates more as a holding operation than a serious effort to make progress with regard to the economy.  Judging from the media coverage and public interest generally in the Estimates debates, I think the Estimates could be described as a <Col N="1101" /> non-event.  There are no real policy changes reflected in them.</P>
      <P>Most aspects of the Estimates have been discussed at this stage but I would like to make a few observations which I consider very important.  Despite numerous promises from various Government spokespersons to emigrant groups, the amount of money provided in this year's Estimates for emigrant services is the same as last year and indeed the previous year.  The figures released today by the Central Statistics Office show that emigration increased by over 5,000 for the year ending April 1988.  This reflects a major increase since 1986.  At the same time, however, the amount of funding for the various services abroad has remained the same.  We must also consider that the value of £250,000 is not the same as it was two years ago when we take account of inflation in England which is about 14 per cent.  Therefore, this sum will not have the same effectiveness in providing the necessary services.</P>
      <P>Again, I wish to reiterate the various viewpoints of the people involved in the emigrant centres.  At present they are allowed only to give advice but I think their brief should be extended to providing accommodation as well.  Without the voluntary efforts of associations in England, New York and other centres to where large numbers of our people emigrate, the emigrants would be left to their own.  If they were to depend on the Government or even on the previous Government to look after their interests, they would be left out on the streets of New York and other centres.</P>
      <P>DION are an agency who give grants to emigrant agencies in England.  I suggest that their remit be extended to include New York and other American cities.  It is rather ironic that the city of New York had to provide the Irish Emigration Reform Movement with a grant to man their centre and provide the hotline to it.  It is a sad day for this country when we have to depend on Government agencies abroad to look after our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Government and to the Minister for Labour that a special allocation in the region of <Col N="1102" /> £500,000 be made from the national lottery funds so that we can make some effort towards discharging our responsibility to our young people who have been forced to leave Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Estimates that would indicate there are job creation possibilities that would help to keep our people at home.  The Irish Episcopal Council came out strongly on this aspect and pointed out that jobs are not being created to the extent that they should be in order to make an impact on emigration. I know their figures were disputed but subsequently they were shown to be accurate.  People such as Padraig White, are doing their best to cloud the problem of emigration.</P>
    <P>We are making no effort whatsoever to provide any form of education for our young people before they travel abroad, whether it is forced or voluntary emigration. Information is provided by the Department of Labour and other agencies but it is not getting through to the young people who are leaving, otherwise we would not see reports that young people are being picked up and exploited in various ways on the streets of New York.  It is about time we impressed on those involved in education that they have a responsibility to impart as much knowledge as possible in order to prepare our young people for emigration. Nobody likes to recognise that people have to emigrate but the reality is that people are emigrating and will continue to do so.  Indeed, a recent report by the ESRI suggests that over 130,000 people will emigrate in the next four years. There is no reason to think this figure will change.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £250,000 is paltry and a total insult to the voluntary groups in England who are making great efforts to provide advice and information to emigrants. This figure will have to be buttressed in some way by money from the national lottery.  I feel that we in this House would all agree to a substantial sum of money being given to emigrant services.  This would also get the approval of the entire population who are concerned about the emigration issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> I would like to refer to the decrease in funding for school transport.  It can no longer be said that there is free transport to school because young people have to pay a sizeable sum for this service.  It is no longer the luxury service it was in the past.  Many parents find they are not getting value for money.  When these charges were introduced some years ago, those who are now in Government opposed them vehemently.  Now they have no option but to increase the charges to make up the sum of £6 million.  I am very concerned also about the number of young people who have no school transport service.  I am aware of four cases of young handicapped people who cannot go for special education because transport will not be provided.  I appeal to the Government to ensure that the most vulnerable people in our society should not be affected by the cuts.  It is a crying shame that four handicapped people cannot get transport to schools which are not too far away from them.  In one instance it would only be a case of rerouting the transport to the extent of five miles but the Department of Education will not consent to this.  When this creeps into the system it only turns people off. The disadvantaged have very few people to speak out for them.  Every effort should be made to ensure that the handicapped are provided with adequate transport facilities to enable them to attend special schools.  I appeal to the Minister for Education to have this matter reviewed.  I will bring it up with her at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a well received announcement from the Department of Industry and Commerce that the brief of SFADCo would be extended to include north Kerry.  That is something that I have campaigned for since I came into politics.  Many politicians have campaigned for this over the last 20 years. Despite the fact that the SFADCo brief has been extended into north Kerry the Government have decreased the amount of funding for administrative costs from £2 million to £1.5 million.  I do not know if this decision was made before the <Col N="1104" /> Government decided to extend the brief of north Kerry to SFADCo.  When one considers that SFADCo's resources will have to stretch further than before, we cannot expect the same effectiveness from SFADCo if they have to cover north Kerry as well as their original brief on a smaller budget.  Will the Minister ensure that SFADCo is adequately funded as otherwise their effectiveness will be reduced?  The reason north Kerry wanted to be included in the SFADCo region is because they are not happy with the support from the IDA.  We always felt that we were the poor relations <i>vis-à-vis</i> Cork.  Now expectations have been raised and we want better treatment under SFADCo.  If the money is not there we will not get better treatment.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the cutbacks in local authorities in lieu of rate support grants. I know that the Government have taken over responsibility from county councils for certain loan repayments.  I hope that the cutback in the grants to local authorities will not affect the overall funding of county councils as county councils are hard pressed to provide funding for the repair of county roads, for instance. Almost all rural TDs who spoke on the Estimates referred to county roads.  In County Kerry there are over 2,400 miles of county roads and we are a major tourist county.  Local people know which roads to avoid but tourists will be totally turned off Kerry because of the condition of the roads.  Many of the bad roads are in our most scenic areas where there is the greatest concentration of tourists.  I appeal to the Minister to take account of the wishes of county councils and ensure that adequate funding is available to maintain county roads.  The reduction in support grants will mean a deterioration in county roads as county roads are always the last item on the agenda of most county councils to be allocated money.  If there is a reduction of 8 per cent in local authority funding I fear that next year there will be a further deterioration in county roads.  Will the Minister ensure that our county roads system does not deteriorate further?</P>
    <P>In relation to the Estimate for the <Col N="1105" /> Department of Labour I am very concerned about the decrease in funding for the social employment schemes.  For the remainder of this year sufficient social employment schemes have been sanctioned in Kerry so as to provide 300 jobs.  Unfortunately these jobs cannot be activated because Kerry has used up its quota of funds.  They have used up their quota because they are in the same region as Cork which has been allocated a greater amount of money for social employment schemes.  One scheme I know of would employ 20 men.  The men were recruited and their expectations were raised.  They wanted to get off the dole queue at little expense to the taxpayer. However, last week they were told that the scheme could not go ahead due to lack of funds.  That is ridiculous, especially when people are willing to work in the sort of weather we have been having lately.  It is an indictment of our system that money cannot be provided for worthwhile schemes.  Apart from that scheme a number of school principals find that due to the cutbacks, they cannot take on caretakers or secretaries in the schools under the social employment scheme.  In the interests of creating worthwhile employment I would appeal to the Government to review the funding for social employment schemes.  I know that the decrease here is only 1 per cent but we should increase this allowance substantially.</P>
    <P>In relation to the funding for DION, the committee in charge of emigration, it is vitally important that the sum already provided is supplemented by a grant from the national lottery.  I appeal especially to the Minister for Labour and to his Government colleagues to ensure that this occurs.</P>

      <P>The economy is on the path of recovery, which is based on the widespread consensus on the need to bring public borrowing under control and the restoration of investor confidence.  We are now seen internationally as an investment opportunity economy with a stable currency.</P>
      <P>Our success has been acknowledged by most commentators and financial institutions at home and abroad.  Indeed the confidence restored to the economy is clear from all the economic indicators &mdash; low inflation, lower interest rates, surplus balance of payments, lower foreign borrowings, increased investment and so on. The one remaining problem area is the level of unemployment but that is now beginning to respond to Government initiatives.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there is always a considerable time lag between a resumption of growth in the economy and an increase in employment.  This is because unused capacity and under-employment have first to be aborted.</P>
      <P>Our utilisation of industrial machinery has increased significantly in the past 18 months.  We should now see a speeding up of job creation and as a result, the levels of unemployment continuing to fall.</P>
      <P>The recent publication of the CSO's 1988 labour force estimates show a rise in the numbers at work.  This is indeed a very encouraging sign.  It is backed up by the end of September live register figure of unemployment which reached its lowest level since October, 1986 and confirms the downward trend which began in mid-1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the level of unemployment is still too high and the Government will <Col N="1107" /> continue the strategy set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of increasing employment through investment and economic activity.</P>
    <P>The indicators for the medium term are encouraging with an improvement in the business environment.  Output in manufacturing industry is rising and there is increased investment.  There is also evidence of progress being made on new job creation this year in the major economic sectors of the economy.  This is a very positive sign for the future.  The Government are well on their way to reaching the target set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> of creating 20,000 new jobs per year in the manufacturing industry. Now is the time to consolidate these gains and to build further on the progress made.</P>
    <P>However, we must still have regard to the underlying causes of our financial problems &mdash; the mountain of debt and the annual cost of servicing it which the Government inherited from the Coalition Government.  Nevertheless we have made enormous progress on our <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> in particular the reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>

      <P>It is essential that the process of reducing the Exchequer borrowing requirement continues so that the confidence of investors in the Irish economy is sustained.  The process has not been deflationary and has led to a recovery in economic growth.</P>
      <P>The Estimates before the House are part only of the Government's strategy and must not be considered in isolation. We must now look to the future with renewed confidence in the country's ability to recover lost ground.  We must become more efficient and cost competitive if we are to succeed in the new Europe.</P>
      <P>To enable the country to grasp the opportunities which will become available in the lead-up to the single European market, the Government must continue to plan and manage the public finances so as to stabilise the debt GNP ratio. Success in this matter is vital if we are to create the conditions necessary to encourage development and initiative, which will in turn generate the impetus for increased economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as my Department are concerned, the 1989 Environment Estimate shows a reduction of some £66 million or 11 per cent.  At first sight this is a large amount but it includes savings resulting from schemes and grants that were terminated in earlier years where expenditure is falling rapidly &mdash; for instance, <Col N="1109" /> expenditure on housing grants is down some £25 million on the 1988 provision.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's efforts on the broader economic front provides the impetus for recovery in the construction industry.  The general economic outlook is now brighter than it has been for many years, giving confidence to investors, to industry and to the man in the street.  Low inflation, low interest rates and a surplus in our balance of payments all mean a better climate for increased private investment and increased employment.</P>
    <P>Although the public capital programme expenditure affecting the industry is forecast to decline in 1989, the impact on the industry will be more than compensated for by the increase in private investment made possible by the success of the Government's economic policies.  Indeed, taking account of both public and private investment in the industry we are, for the first time in many years, looking realistically to an increase in construction output in 1989.</P>
    <P>In the past two years, we have seen a number of positive developments to encourage and stimulate growth in the construction industry including the substantial fall in the cost of borrowing, including mortgage interest rates; the extent of investment involved in the redevelopment of the Custom House Docks site, including the National Sports Centre &mdash; £285 million over a five-year period; output in the industrial, commercial and retail sector will record a substantial increase in volume in 1988; this year's budget measures, including the reintroduction of section 23 incentives, a reduction from 6 per cent to 5 per cent in stamp duty for houses in the £50,000 to £60,000 band and the extension of time limits for availing of the urban renewal incentives; the extension last year of the scheme of financial incentives for urban renewal to an additional nine centres thus generating construction activity in strategic locations throughout the country; the establishment of a special revolving fund to enable the NBA to undertake urban redevelopment works in conjunction with private interests. <Col N="1110" /> Initial projects include one at Westgate/Selskar in Wexford involving residential units, a shop and restaurant and a new private housing development at St. John's Mews, Douglas Street, Cork. In addition, the agency recently commenced work on an office development on Ormond Quay in Dublin.  This development should encourage other developers to commence work on large derelict quayside areas of our capital city.</P>
    <P>The single most important development which will affect the Irish construction industry over the next few years is the completion of the single European market by 1992.  This will open up the vast European Community construction market to the Irish construction industry, presenting a great opportunity for our manufacturers, contractors and professionals, and a great challenge too.  The industry must be prepared to grasp these opportunities and meet the challenge.</P>
    <P>As part of the awareness and preparation campaign for the completion of the single European market, my Department recently hosted a seminar in Dublin entitled &ldquo;The Construction Industry &mdash; 1992&rdquo;.  We will be holding further seminars in Cork on 14 November and in Galway on 21 November.</P>
    <P>I recently received the first annual report of the Construction Industry Development Board which I established in July 1987.  The report sets out the recommendations made to date by the board and I will give full consideration to them in formulating future policy for the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The Government's economic policy has resulted in the lowest mortgage interest rates for 20 years.  Healthy competition between the building societies and the banks means there is a plentiful supply of mortgage finance at reasonable interest rates.  I would like to refute the suggestion that the enormous success of the Government's initiative under the tax amnesty could result in a shortage of mortgage finance.  Talk of &ldquo;mortgage famine&rdquo; flies in the face of the facts. Overall, the success of the amnesty has had little impact on the net funding position of the building societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> During this session I intend to bring before the House a major Bill on building societies.  This Bill represents the most comprehensive overhaul ever of the legislation governing the societies.  The societies will be given new powers to engage in a wide range of activities under the supervision of the Central Bank.  This legislation will enable the societies to adapt and expand their role in the rapidly changing financial services sector while continuing to make a valuable contribution to the economy as a whole.  I look forward to the commitment and cooperation of all parties on the other side of the House in dealing with this important legislation.</P>
    <P>The success of public housing policy in recent years and demographic and social changes have affected both the level of demand for local authority housing and the nature of that demand.  The overall numbers on local authority waiting lists have fallen and the needs of specific categories like the elderly and homeless persons have assumed much greater significance.  Greater emphasis has also been given to improving the living conditions of local authority tenants, particularly those in larger run-down estates in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Estimate provision for local authority housing is £39 million, including provision for remedial works to existing local authority houses and serviced caravan parks for travellers.</P>
    <P>Building new local authority houses is not the only way to meet social housing needs.  1989 will be the first full year in which local authorities will have available to them the new powers of the 1988 Housing Act to provide accommodation for homeless persons, otherwise than in their own rented housing stock.  Social housing needs are now being satisfied in a variety of other ways also, including the level of completions and vacancies occurring in the local authority rented stock and the continued expansion of the voluntary housing sector.</P>
    <P>The allocation next year for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly is increased from £1.5 million to £2 <Col N="1112" /> million.  This worthwhile scheme makes essential improvements in the housing conditions of the elderly and enables many of them to remain in their homes, rather than seek rehousing by the local authority, or institutional care from the health board.  Next year this cost-effective and well targeted scheme will improve the housing conditions of up to 2,000 elderly persons living alone.</P>
    <P>The road network is of major importance to the economic and social well being of the country.  This role is set to assume even greater significance with our renewed economic growth, the completion of the Single European Market by 1992 and the implementation of the economic and social cohesion provisions of the Single European Act.  These developments will have a major impact on future road development policy.  I have already carried out a comprehensive review of the road development programme and having consulted the recently established National Roads Authority, I am now putting the finishing touches to the Blueprint for Road Development.  The blueprint will set out a medium to long-term strategy for the development of the entire road network from national to county roads.  It will also address the question of the financing of the programme, through a partnership of the State, the local authorities, the EC and the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Estimates include £150 million for road improvement and maintenance grants next year.  I am providing within this overall amount £20 million for county road strengthening grants, which is an increase of £5 million or one-third on the amount available this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

In just a couple of short years I have given £50 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey may very well be right that there is something wrong but at least I want him to know that the increase next year over this year's allocation, which was a huge increase over the two previous years' allocation, is £5 million extra, £20 million <i>in toto.</i> This will enable local authorities to accelerate their work programmes to bring the most important county roads up to an acceptable standard.</P>
      <P>Additional expenditure on major road improvement works is one area which is being considered at present in the discussions concerning the increased funds that will be available from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I will be urging the highest possible recoupment rates from the EC Structural Fund for State expenditure on roadworks, especially 75 per cent for major improvements to national roads.  We have also obtained widespread Community support for aiding projects such as roads and bridges from the Structural Funds which are funded by or with the assistance of private funds.  This is a major breakthrough which will ensure that we will be able to draw down all the funds that will become available in the next few years.  I will, of course, be taking the necessary steps to ensure that schemes carried out with private sector <Col N="1114" /> funding meet the criteria laid down by the EC.</P>
    <P>The Estimates include a number of areas dealing with environmental matters. As time is limited, I will confine my remarks to air pollution and unleaded petrol.  Dublin's Millennium Year has seen an intensification of measures to tackle its smoke problem.  The results of monitoring for the winter of 1987-88 show a slight improvement in the overall situation.  However, I want to make sure that that underlying problem is tackled.</P>
    <P>The Government allocated £250,000 in 1988 to develop a scheme of financial assistance towards the cost of smoke control measures in Dublin.  The allocation will be used to fund a scheme to allow householders to change their existing heating arrangements to smokeless appliances and fuels.  An outline of the scheme was announced on 26 June this year.</P>
    <P>Before the scheme can take effect, however, I must decide on the special control area order made in April by Dublin Corporation for Ballyfermot, one of the worst affected areas in the city. Following an oral hearing of all objections to the order, which took place between 28 June and 4 July, I am now considering the written report of the hearing before deciding whether or not to confirm the order, or to confirm it with modifications.  The Estimates include one million pounds for the scheme of financial assistance in 1989.  It is my intention to announce my decision in the matter inside the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I launched a new campaign designed to increase the use of unleaded petrol in this country.  There must be a complete changeover to unleaded petrol and we have to create a climate of opinion that favours such a changeover.  This is necessary for environmental and health reasons and also to encourage motorists from Europe where unleaded petrol is much in use.  The Government gave the lead in the budget when it reduced the excise duty on unleaded petrol so that it retails at the same price as leaded petrol. The establishment of a reasonable network of unleaded outlets around the <Col N="1115" /> country is well under way and further outlets will be available before the end of this year.  I have sought the assistance of the motor trade in the campaign and I intend to make regulations as soon as possible requiring that all new petrol engined vehicles placed on the market must be designed and constructed to run on unleaded petrol.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about local authority finances. This area has been subject to various comments from Deputies and others.  In 1988, the total current expenditure of local authorities is expected to be approximately £959 million, but the rate support grant will only meet one-fifth of that expenditure.  Income from rates on commercial property, amounting to almost £193 million, is as important as the rate support grant.  I want to make this comparison to lay at rest the notion that a cut of over 6 per cent in 1989 in the rate support grant, as compared with 1988, will cause a comparable reduction in the authorities current expenditure. This is patent nonsense and totally misleading of the factual position.  To put the matter into perspective, the reduction of £13 million represents less than 1.4 per cent of local authorities' 1988 current expenditure.</P>
    <P>At a time when all areas of public expenditure are under review to reduce public expenditure in the national interest, the reduction in the rate support grant is not excessive, especially when the following factors are taken into account: the Government's early decision on the Estimates will allow local authorities to hold their estimates meetings before the end of the year.  As a result, authorities can arrange their expenditure and revenue collection programmes before the year starts, to match the funds available. It also provides management with sufficient time to review working practices so that maximum efficiency is achieved; I am making an extra £5 million available next year for county road strengthening grants; staff costs in 1989 will be substantially reduced as a result of the voluntary redundancy scheme and other <Col N="1116" /> controls on staffing levels; and local authorities have benefited substantially from the reduced interest rates brought about by the Government's good management of the economy.</P>
    <P>In 1987, local authorities generally halted their slippage into increased deficit and in many cases improved their position in this respect to some degree.  I am looking forward to a further improvement in 1988.  This Government have restored realism to all aspects of public finance and local authorities have responded to the Government's courageous lead in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These Estimates represent a betrayal by Fianna Fáil of the thousands of people who had put their trust in them. They have managed to convey an impression in many sections of the media that they are in some sense mild, or at least milder than expected &mdash; but nothing could in fact be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>The first thing that has to be remembered about the spending cuts we are discussing this week is that they are part of a series of cuts more savage than anything in the economic history of this country. Essential services which have already been pared to the bone are going to be cut further next year.  We cannot afford to be under any illusions about this.  There is no breathing space here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our health services, which have already suffered far too much, will suffer again next year.  More beds will be forced to close, more staff will be forced to leave, more patients will be forced to wait.  The development of a two-tier health service will continue apace &mdash; with wards now covered in lino being carpeted in order to fleece the VHI, and deepen the financial crisis which is about to engulf that organisation.  We have already reached the point in our health services <Col N="1117" /> where people must be in grave risk of their lives before they can be guaranteed any level of access.  How many have to die before we see a change of policy by this Government?</P>
    <P>There are a great many lies told about health spending in this country.  How often have we heard people who should know better talking about the imperative need for us to tighten our belt, and telling us that we can only provide whatever level of health service we can afford?  Who is to say what that is?  If we are waiting for the parties of the Right to specify what we can afford, people will die.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that according to the best international comparisons available, nobody can accuse this State of spending too much on health.  The OECD figures in this area are particularly instructive. According to them, in the most recent year for which figures are available, we spent $514 <i>per capita</i> on health.  The United Kingdom Government &mdash; Mrs. Thatcher's Government &mdash; spent $585 <i>per capita</i>, and the average for the OECD as a whole was $722.  Given those simple statistics, how can we do anything other than hang our heads in shame at what we have allowed to happen to our health services since 1984, the year in which those figures were gathered?</P>
    <P>What makes the picture even worse is the fact that our health services are inevitably going to require more resources than those of other countries. The reason for this is simple &mdash; if a population has a very high number of dependent people, either very young or very old, the provision that must be made is greater than otherwise.  Our population has a very high dependency ratio &mdash; considerably higher than the OECD average &mdash; and we have to face up to that reality. The reality we must face is the one on which Fianna Fáil campaigned fairly successfully in the last election campaign when they said: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick, and the handicapped&rdquo;.  It was true then but Fianna Fáil have been living a lie ever since.  They have systematically cut health spending from the 7 per cent of GNP at which it was maintained during all the years that Deputy <Col N="1118" /> Desmond was Minister for Health.  By the end of the next year, it will, according to their own estimates, represent 6.2 per cent of GNP.  By any objective standards, that is a savage cut and a substantial part of that cut is going to be brought about as a direct result of the Book of Estimates published last week, despite all the hype about extra money for health.</P>
    <P>Health is only one area that has suffered grievously under this Administration. Who can forget the torrent of protest that was generated by Fianna Fáil's infamous attempts to reintroduce the educational standards of the thirties through the notorious Circular 20/87? And who can forget the cynical compromises that the Minister for Education arranged, to present thousands of parents with a <i>fait accompli</i> when this school year started?  Above all, who can forget the crocodile tears shed by the Ministers for Social Welfare and Education when they were presented with the sight of parents who were literally unable to send their children to school in September because of the ever-increasing cost of books, uniforms, and other requirements?  They shed crocodile tears on television but in the secrecy of the Cabinet room they agree to further impositions on parents with their increases in school transport costs and their massive hikes in third level fees.  These Ministers, let us not forget, are members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the party who stake a claim to history because of the introduction of free post-primary education.  For the last two years they have been systematically dismantling the education system they inherited, instead of equipping it to meet the challenges that lie ahead of this country. Donogh O'Malley must be turning in his grave.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subjects of health and education, there is one point in particular that I must make.  For many years now the people I represent in Tallaght have been told that their claims for a hospital and for a regional technical college are receiving priority attention. There is no argument about the justice of these claims.  It has long been recognised as a scandal that the fastest-growing <Col N="1119" /> area of population in the country and indeed in western Europe &mdash; now some 80,000 people &mdash; has no hospital and no third-level education centre.  It has unemployment, of course, and it has suffered from Establishment neglect for years. The commitment to providing these basic facilities generated a sense of hope and purpose in Tallaght that was tangible. The betrayal of that commitment by this Government has led to a feeling of outrage which Fianna Fáil will have reason to remember whenever they face the people of Tallaght again.  The massive cuts in the Public Capital Programme for next year will ensure that Tallaght, in common with other disadvantaged areas of the country, will have to wait for one more year at least to see some progress on these essential requirements.</P>
    <P>The cutting of the Public Capital Programme will, of course, have economic as well as social consequences all over the country.  The Minister for Finance, in his speech yesterday, said that he had cut £106 million from the Public Capital Programme.  In net terms, he is in fact cutting a great deal more.  The reason I say this is simple: there is a huge provision in the Public Capital Programme for Aer Lingus fleet replacement, which accounts for an increase in the allocation for transport of more than £55 million.  Now, I am not arguing that that allocation is unnecessary, but I am saying that every penny of that money will be invested abroad.  It will go to create and protect jobs in Seattle, rather than contribute to the thousands of jobs we need here at home.  If that money were not in the Public Capital Programme, the real cut in that programme would be £163 million. By any measurement, it is impossible to cut that amount of money from the Public Capital Programme without generating increased unemployment.  We estimate that the job losses arising from this set of cuts alone will run to more than 12,000.</P>
    <P>Many reputable independent commentators including, for instance, the ESRI have argued that one of the major policy instruments available to the Government to generate growth in our <Col N="1120" /> economy was the Public Capital Programme. In their medium-term review, when they predicted that the economy could return to high rates of growth next year, they did so on the assumption that Fianna Fáil would not implement further cuts at the end of 1988 &mdash; and particularly that the Public Capital Programme would not be cut again.  They reckoned without the mandarins of the Department of Finance, and the slavish hold they have over this Government.  They reckoned without the obsessive urge of the Minister for Finance to project a macho image as he grooms himself for Europe.  Above all, they reckoned without the political calculation of the Taoiseach, who knows that the way to protect the largest majority in Europe in this House is to keep Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats off balance.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, I would have to say that he has succeeded very well.  Fine Gael do not seem to know whether they are coming or going.  Their spokesperson on finance is quite capable of saying in the same sentence, that the Government have not gone far enough and that the cuts in these Estimates will cause major hardship.  The Progressive Democrats will no doubt do what they have always done &mdash; speak in favour of the cuts and vote against the specifics.</P>
    <P>What none of these parties will do is to pause long enough to consider the human impact of the decisions they are making.  It seems that to the parties of the Right this is all a game.  If they have any familiarity with the trauma of unemployment, the misery of queues for health services when you are in pain or the indignity of charges for basic health care when you have to live on a small pension, it does not show.  What does show is a callous indifference to the real price that people have to pay so that the ideologues of the Right can play their games of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this price more evident than in the series of mean and petty cuts that the Government have implemented in the social welfare area.  In this area, they have not just received the tacit approval of the Opposition Right-wing <Col N="1121" /> parties &mdash; support from the Right has been whole-hearted to the point of being blood-curdling and acquiesced in the cuts, but they have also conspired together to ensure that there is little, if any, public debate on this sustained attack on the rights of working people. The cuts in social welfare have, as a result, gone almost unnoticed, except of course by those people who have had to bear the brunt of them.</P>
    <P>Let us examine, for a moment, Fianna Fáil's record in this area.  The cuts I record are those arising from Fianna Fáil's budgetary decisions in 1987 and 1988.  (1) If a family is in receipt of child benefit they will have received no increase in 1987 and will receive none in 1988. This is an effective cut of £12.75 million, affecting all families with children.  The child benefit scheme was introduced by the Labour Party in 1986 &mdash; and it is recognised by anybody who cares, as a prime instrument of policy available to any government who want to alleviate poverty.  (2) If you have to claim long term disability benefit you now need 260 stamps, five years' constant employment, as against 156 in January 1987.  This is a cut of £9.25 million affecting many thousands of claimants.  The Labour Party maintained and improved these basic entitlements all during the seventies and eighties.  (3) If you have to claim unemployment benefit, maternity benefit or disability benefit your number of paid or credited contributions has been increased from 26 to 39.  This, in effect, is a cut of £6.75 million, affecting thousands of people.  (4) If you are a widow, deserted wife, single parent, or prisoner's wife, you will no longer be entitled to claim the half-rate payment of disability benefit, maternity allowance or unemployment supplement from January 1988.  It was the Labour Party who introduced these major benefits for women in the seventies. (5) If you need dental or optical treatment you must have 207 paid or credited contributions, as against 156 in January 1987 and 39 contributions in the claim year as against 26 in January 1987. (6) If you avail of the social employment scheme the allowance payable to a single <Col N="1122" /> person has been reduced from £70 to £60 per week.  The allowance under the teamwork scheme has been reduced also by Fianna Fáil, from £70 per week to £60 per week.  Both these schemes were introduced by the Labour Party, and further cuts are inevitable next year in these areas as a consequence of the miserly allocation in the Minister for Labour's Estimate.  (7) The 11 per cent increase for the long term unemployed in July 1988 works out at a bare 7 per cent for a married couple with three children.  The Labour Party first introduced special increases for the long term unemployed in 1983.  Many families will now see their increases clawed back in increased local authority rents, particularly following this year's cut in the rates support grant. (8) If you are entitled to claim pay-related benefit with unemployment, disability, or maternity benefit, your entitlement has been cut in half.  The rates of 25 per cent and 20 per cent have been reduced to 12 per cent, and the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; for PRB has been raised to £68 per week, which means that the maximum PRB has been reduced again.  The Labour Party were largely responsible for the introduction of PRB in the seventies.  This is a cut of £20 million.</P>
    <P>This is the record since Fianna Fáil took office.  The provision made this year means that the record will almost certainly get worse.  There are hidden social welfare cuts in the Book of Estimates &mdash; make no mistake about it.  We need not take seriously the Minister for Social Welfare's assurance that all rights are protected in his Estimate.  He always gives that assurance.  He never publicises the cuts he is actually making.  Instead he sends out circulars to the social welfare offices and community welfare officers and hopes that nobody will notice. Almost none of the cuts I have outlined above would have come to public attention were it not for the efforts of the Labour Party in highlighting them.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me, it is not possible to go into all the aspects of the Estimates that need to be covered.  There is, however, one area that cannot be allowed to pass without comment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The cut in the rates support grant that has now been imposed by the Minister for the Environment is intolerable.  Alone, it will lead to nearly 2,000 job losses and major cuts in services that are essential to the quality of life.  I know that there are now local authority managers who are at their wits end to know how they can possibly cope with a cut of this dimension.</P>
    <P>All the information available suggests that a disproportionate amount of that cut is being inflicted in Dublin.  This Minister is, on the one hand, telling his Fianna Fáil councillors in Dublin that they should not impose charges for services and on the other, he is telling them that they are to be punished for not imposing charges in the past.  This is the same Minister who wined and dined his European counterparts &mdash; at our expense &mdash; in the most expensive hotel in his constituency not too long ago and then told us all that in future he was going to arrange things so that local authorities would be engines for growth and development.  This is also the Minister who has intoned solemnly time and again that he is committed to adequate financing for the provision of local authority services.  He has done a kind of Lanigan's Ball with his junior Ministers about the reintroduction of rates, stepping out the proposition to test the wind and then stepping in again when he discovers how cold the wind is blowing.</P>
    <P>The local authority service over which he presides is dying on its feet and he seems to be content to be the undertaker. The result will be serious damage to the quality of life of our people &mdash; of old people who depend on street lighting and on the public library, of children who depend on the recreational facilities provided by local authorities, facilities which are overgrown, not developed and many in a dangerous condition.  Everyone who depends on sanitary services will suffer.</P>
    <P>Perhaps those who will suffer most are those who look to our local authorities for shelter.  A few days ago I predicted, before the Estimates were published, that unless the Government changed policy immediately a major housing crisis <Col N="1124" /> is inevitable, I have to say now that the cuts outlined in the housing area in the Book of Estimates brings that crisis considerably closer.</P>
    <P>To give one example: there are more than 6,000 families on the housing waiting lists in Dublin and Cork cities now.  That is a 50 per cent increase in the last 12 months.  How many houses were started by those two local authorities to deal with this massively growing problem?  The unbelievable answer is two &mdash; not 2,000, or even 200, but two.  To add to that, the local authorities concerned have lost several hundred houses from their housing stock altogether as a result of the tenant purchase scheme.  Altogether, over the whole country, enough money has been allocated for approximately 160 houses.  At the same time, according to returns furnished by the local authorities, there are 17,000 families in urgent need of accommodation &mdash; families who have been approved for rehousing, but must stay in their present conditions because Fianna Fáil will not provide any money.</P>
    <P>This is exacerbated by two additional features.  First, the present housing stock is being allowed to run down to an appalling condition through lack of finance for maintenance.  Secondly, there is a growing problem of &ldquo;ghettoisation&rdquo; in parts of the country, particularly in Dublin, as a result of families with jobs leaving areas, and those areas being used to house new families with a range of social problems.  As a result, communities are beginning to come under great strain.  In overall terms the neglect of housing by Fianna Fáil is sowing the seeds of enormous damage.  They, and they alone, must carry responsibility for the very damaging consequences that will inevitably follow.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, these Estimates, taken together with everything that this Government have done since assuming office, are a terrible reflection on a civilised society.  They reflect a headlong rush into Thatcherite greed and selfishness. When the Irish people are invited to pass judgment on them I believe they will reject these policies roundly and the political parties that espouse them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just a little over one and a half years since we assumed office.  We did so at a time when the country faced very serious economic and financial difficulties, when the entire country was in the grips of a malaise of despondency, when foreign debts were spiralling upwards and the current budget deficit, as a percentage of GNP, was dangerously high.  The servicing of the national debt was absorbing, and still does, money which could otherwise be put to good use in areas which would stimulate economic growth and development.  In the present year the servicing of that debt will cost some £2,000 million.</P>
      <P>It has now become apparent to everyone that the measures devised and implemented by this Government since March 1987 are the only ones that will redress our financial problems, give rise to economic growth and an environment conducive to job creation.  At the same time there is much extra work we must tackle.  However, our economic climate has improved dramatically since March 1987.  The target reductions in the 1988 budget for Exchequer borrowing and for the current budget deficit will be exceeded this year.</P>
      <P>Reduced Exchequer borrowing and improved confidence in the Irish economy have resulted in reductions in interest rates.  This, coupled with a low inflation rate, has increased our competitiveness in international markets. Indeed our exports are at an all-time high and our inflation rate, running at 2 per cent per annum, is much lower than virtually all of our trading partners.</P>
      <P>Our financial and social objectives can be realised only by maintaining a strict budgetary discipline and continuing with our financial reform strategies.  Correcting the current budget deficit &mdash; stabilising it at between 5 per cent and 7 per cent &mdash; must remain our first priority. Never again can we revert to the time when the Exchequer borrowing requirement was 13.2 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the success of this Government's economic and fiscal policies to <Col N="1126" /> date the outlay by the Exchequer on non-capital supply services in 1988 of £5,683 million, and a projected outlay in 1989 of £5,565 million, are still much in excess of current revenue.  As a result Government must continue to borrow a significant amount each year to meet current services which otherwise could be used for infrastructural development projects and productive investment.  The 1989 Estimates for all Government Departments have been framed on the basis that further measures are necessary to reduce public expenditure in real terms, thereby reducing our dependency on borrowing and freeing money for essential services.</P>
    <P>The 1989 Estimates for non-capital services, of £5,565 million and for the Public Capital Programme, of £1,319 million, result in a total reduction of £311 million in the expenditure which would have been incurred in 1989 had this Government not taken certain corrective measures. Of course, in order to achieve savings of this order, it was necessary to analyse carefully and review critically proposed public expenditure.</P>
    <P>The net provision for the four Education Votes in the Abridged Estimates Volume for Public Services for 1989 is approximately £1,169 million, the gross provision being in excess of £1,256 million. The allocation for pay and pensions in the gross provision is £1,026 million approximately corresponding to 82 per cent of gross expenditure.  It includes the cost of the second phase of the 1987 Public Service Pay Agreement, the payment of special increases due in 1989 and the remaining phase of the <i>ex-gratia</i> award to teachers.  Over £6 million more is required in 1989 than in 1988 to meet the cost of third level student support.</P>
    <P>The total provision of £1,256 million is a substantial level of expenditure on education.  It constitutes a clear indication of Government commitment to maintaining and developing the quality of our education system.  For example, in 1989, 18.8 per cent of Exchequer expenditure will be spent on education services. Of course that means that £18.80 out of every £100 Exchequer expenditure in 1989 will be spent on education.  The <Col N="1127" /> expenditure on education amounts to almost 6.2 per cent of GNP, which is much higher than for virtually all other member states in the European Community. We should like to spend more but our present financial difficulties do not make that possible.  Indeed we must continue to strive to achieve a greater effectiveness and efficiency, obtaining greater benefits and results from our already high investment in education.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the need to strive for greater efficiency in the education process.  The potential of information technologies and computerisation will be apparent to everybody.  I have arranged for additional funds to be made available in 1989 to accelerate the computerisation of the examination process in Athlone.  My Department have issued a detailed request for proposals for the provision of suitable hardware, software and application development services to the market.  The latest date for receipt of replies is Friday next, when it is hoped that the relevant contract will be signed and the work commenced.  The benefits which will accrue from this first phase will include the production, by computer, of provisional statements of results for each candidate, certificates for candidates, computer readable results data and examination statistics.  We shall also be updating office system facilities.</P>
    <P>In our budget there is provision for an allocation in 1989 of £291,000 for the expenses of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &mdash; the NCCA. This will allow for increased activities in relation to the review of primary and post-primary curricula.  We have already done a lot of work in this area.  From September 1989 all students commencing the junior post-primary cycle will follow programmes of study leading to the new junior certificate which will replace the existing intermediate and day vocational group certificates.  The new certificate programmes constitute a positive response to the changing needs of society and will enable our young people to prepare better for entry into society and working life.  I might put on record this <Col N="1128" /> evening my appreciation of the huge input and commitment of Deputy Hussey, my predecessor, to curricula reform particularly at post-primary level. However, much work still requires to be done to update post-primary programmes, in particular to revise modern language syllabi, to develop a technology programme suited to the needs of all junior cycle pupils, to review assessment procedures and senior cycle programmes.</P>
    <P>The Primary School Curriculum Review Body, under the chairmanship of Moya Quinlan, which operates under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, are continuing their work.  I expect to receive their report next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the national school building programme I am happy to say that the 1989 allocation will be adequate to meet priority needs.  It will enable my Department to provide grants to meet contractual commitments in respect of approximately 70 building projects authorised in 1988.  In the coming months it will be possible also to authorise approximately 40 additional primary school building projects.  A substantial sum is being provided to meet the ongoing work of improving existing schools.  I should say that school managements are cooperating fully with the approach of my Department in giving priority grants for essential classrooms in schools experiencing acute problems of accommodation. In that way a considerable impact will be made on the waiting list of grants for classrooms.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy of not providing capital for new accommodation in areas where there is already sufficient suitable accommodation available in existing schools will be continued in 1989, a policy which will have particular reference to urban areas where scarce capital resources will not be expended on duplication.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and in order to ensure that pupils from disadvantaged groups are given assistance to meet necessary expenditure on school textbooks, the aid <Col N="1129" /> towards the cost of school books for necessitous pupils is being increased at primary and post-primary levels.  At primary level the book grant for necessitous pupils in 1989 will increase from £6 to £7 while the total grant to secondary schools will increase by £195,000 to £1,150,000. A similar level of increases will be made in the grants to VECs and to community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The cost of running the State examinations at post-primary level in 1988 will amount to some £8 million.  Very often people do not realise that State examinations cost that much.  There has continued to be a significant increase in the number of candidates sitting the leaving, intermediate and group certificate examinations. For example, in 1980, some 41,000 candidates sat the leaving certificate examination and 70,500 sat the intermediate and group certificate examinations. The corresponding figures for 1988 were 57,500 and 78,500 respectively. On average 11 papers per candidate are processed resulting in almost 1.5 million scripts being assessed annually. Some measures aimed at increasing the efficiency of the examination process were implemented this year.  They will be accelerated in 1989 and are expected to yield savings of some £500,000.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in order to lower the net cost of the examinations to the Exchequer, the Government have decided for 1988-89 to increase the examination fees which were last increased in 1986-87.  The fee for the group certificate examination will increase from £19 to £20.  The fees for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations will increase from £30 and £33 respectively to £32 and £35.</P>
    <P>I have again made provision in 1989 for adult literacy and community education which is provided free of charge or at nominal cost by vocational education committees.  The financial allocation made in the 1989 Estimates for this activity is £400,000 &mdash; the same amount as for 1988.  A study on the effectiveness <Col N="1130" /> of this scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Irish Vocational Education Association and future initiatives will be based on the outcome of this study.  Provision is also made in the 1989 Estimates to continue with the pilot education opportunities scheme which caters for the long term unemployed over 23 years of age to come back into formal schooling and to take State examinations.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month the Minister for Labour and I launched the Youth Reach scheme.  This scheme is the first major initiative undertaken for the 10 per cent of school leavers who drop out of school early without gaining any formal qualification. The scheme will operate in centres in 11 VEC areas around the country and is designed for young people who have dropped out of school for at least six months.  Such people will be offered up to two years education and training and will receive a training allowance based on various criteria of £20 to £25 per week.</P>
    <P>General studies, vocational studies and work experience will be three distinct elements in the scheme.  It is anticipated that there will be 1,000 places available for young people on 1 January 1989 and 2,000 in the following year.  The cost of the programme in 1989 will be £11.2 million but the Exchequer will not be required to provide additional finance as the cost will be met by a reallocation of existing resources, targeting on those truly in need.</P>
    <P>The 1989 allocation of £18.625 million for the post-primary capital programme will enable existing contractual commitments to be met and fully covers the cost of the construction work in respect of a programme of nine major school building projects which was authorised this year.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention that this public investment will be augmented by funding from private sources.  With this in mind, I am initiating a scheme which will be <Col N="1131" /> attractive to private investors.  The Minister for Finance has already given his approval for the introduction on a trial basis of a privatisation scheme under which developers will be invited to design, finance and build three second level school buildings.  The schools selected which are located at Cashel, Castlerea and Newcastlewest are participating in a rationalisation process.  At a time, therefore, when funds under the State's capital programme are limited, this scheme enables me and the Department to maintain the momentum of that rationalisation.  Funding, as I said, will take place outside the State sector and no payment by the State will arise until the buildings are completed and handed over.</P>
    <P>My Department will be inviting applications shortly by public advertisement from developers.  I know, from inquiries, that there will be a ready response to that advertisement and that the pilot scheme will prove a successful vehicle both for investment and for the creation of additional employment in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The gross allocation provided in the 1989 Estimates for third level and further education is £242.716 million.  At present some 59,000 students participate in third level education and it is projected that enrolments will increase by 10 per cent by the start of the next century &mdash; after which enrolments are likely to fall if participation rates remain reasonably constant. In such circumstances careful planning is required to ensure that optimum return is got from investment in this area and that no expensive permanent physical facilities be provided which would be surplus to requirements in a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee are reviewing the sector generally with a view to making recommendations on the rationalisation of Departments and institutions, on their funding arrangements and on the provision of third-level places. I look forward to their report in the near <Col N="1132" /> future.  A committee are also examining the duration, type and throughput of courses, including courses in VEC colleges, leading to NCEA awards and considering their relevance and effectiveness in meeting the needs of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In the past third level institutions have made great contributions to society, they have readily introduced innovations and were quick to respond to the changing needs.  They can be justly proud of their achievement records.  I have no doubt that the financial allocations to third level institutions will cause some difficulties, but I have also no doubt, given the goodwill of the management authorities of these institutions, that these difficulties will be overcome.</P>
    <P>At present, when financial constraints are great, the institutions must respond to new challenges and new opportunities. They will have to appraise and evaluate all their operational activities and examine every area of spending critically with a view to making the best use of existing resources.  They must innovate and find ways to make our higher education more productive and cost effective.  They must also avoid wasteful duplication.</P>
    <P>A number of interesting developments have already taken place in the field of co-operative endeavour.  For example, the Government as part of their science and technology policy have designated UCD, TCD, UCG, NIHE Dublin and NIHE Limerick as research centres under the national biotechnology research programme and the work of these centres focuses on different aspects of biotechnology and complement each other. Other third level colleges, notably the RTC's have also received substantial funds to update specialist facilities in the applied science and technology areas which have job creation potential.</P>
    <P>Efforts in these and other areas not only enhance teaching programmes at the institutions but also make a major contribution to technological and economic development.  Co-operative arrangements will be fostered and encouraged by my <Col N="1133" /> own Department, by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by EOLAS.</P>
    <P>The allocation in the 1989 Estimates for third level capital projects is £11.44 million.  It is sufficient to meet all existing contractual commitments.  In recent years there have been considerable building developments such as new buildings and major extensions in the universities and other third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 my Department have operated a special scheme of grants for mature women who have completed at least one year of a higher level course and who are either unemployed or in poor financial circumstances.  To date £10,000 per annum has been allocated for this scheme.  The scheme will be continued in 1989 and as it has been so successful in helping mature women in need of financial support to acquire third level qualifications I have arranged to provide £15,000 for the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the education sector measures have been taken to achieve savings as part of the Government's strategy to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement. None of the measures, however, will reduce essential education services.  At the same time, in accordance with the Government's commitment, extra resources are being allocated to the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates, as I have stated earlier, the Government have provided a gross allocation of over £1,256 million to Education despite difficult financial circumstances. With this amount and with the co-operation of the many committed persons in the education sector it will be possible to maintain and improve the quality of the education services provided by our schools, colleges and third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I commend these Estimates to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally make a contribution to the debate on the Estimates when they come before the House.  I commend the Government for introducing <Col N="1134" /> them in the period before Christmas. However, the House should be able to make a critical analysis of the Estimates and, in a democratic way, to change some of the figures which the Departments and the Government have compiled if they consider it necessary.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has been just another boring sequence of long scripts being read by various speakers, not just on the Government side of the House.  We are failing to put on record the challenges that face the public in general because of the decisions which have been arrived at in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>Other speakers, particularly Deputy Taylor, illustrated that there is a substantial consensus in the House that our financial affairs must be in order.  I have listened to the contributions of the various Ministers and each has given his or her reason as to why they should be considered Santa Claus or a miracle worker who has brought in a proper Estimate because the previous Government did not have the courage to do what was asked of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education has a commendable script, probably the best presented.  Its contents are intemised from one to 18.  It was delivered well by the Minister.  She started off with the economic commentary that:</P>
      <P>It is just a little over one and a half years since this Government came to power.  We assumed office at a time when this country faced very serious economic problems and financial difficulties due to previous Governments failing to implement sound policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government lost power because at the election they put before the people a set of Estimates which were rejected totally by Fianna Fáil who, in so doing, gave the impression to the electorate that the manna would come from Heaven when they got into power, it was to be more of this and more of that, they were going to shovel out the goodies.  In <Col N="1135" /> fairness, I think the Government recognised their numerical position in this House as a minority Government.  The people decided how this Government would work and they saw the only way in which this nation would tackle the financial difficulties would be to implement the budget and the Estimates that had been presented by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton.  I am not making the case for Deputy Bruton's budget, but I am saying that its implementation was the reason the financial institutions responded.</P>
    <P>My party had identified the real problems facing this country and set an agenda.  We are talking about the Estimates as they come up here from time to time.  The Minister said there had been a lack of resolve and insufficient commitment. I do not know what she meant by that because I do not believe it can stand up.  The Fianna Fáil Government will not go to the country on a budget or Estimates calculated as Deputy Bruton's Estimates were calculated when we fought the 1987 election.  It is clear from the documents presented in this House that the Fianna Fáil Government are now trying to ameliorate things, to say they are not in Government to cut in the way they were supposed to.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, across the way. He is trying to take out the harder and coarser end of things for his Government. He is going around giving out little grants from the lottery&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some big grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to him being nice and handing out money from the lottery, but I object to Ministers on the other side of the House intimating that the financial crisis is all over and that this country is now on the way back. This country has a long way to go and in fairness I think the Government realise that but do they accuse my party of lack <Col N="1136" /> of courage &mdash; or of insufficient commitment, as the Minister said &mdash; to take the decisions and measures necessary to solve the economic crisis?  I recall when Deputy Bruton produced his measures the cry that came from the then Opposition about the awesome impact they were going to have.  We were considered &ldquo;Thatcherites.&rdquo;  I am glad to see that the Fianna Fáil Party realise that that was the way back from the financial crisis we were in then.  The recognition of that and of the courage of this party should be mirrored when we face the electorate again because as I see it in these Estimates the resolve of the Government is slipping.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Noonan, our financial spokesman, was in here the other day he told the Minister for Finance that he was not accepting the Estimates because as he saw it they were only one side of a chapter.  He said that you have to wait until the budget and see the revenue side and what decisions are being taken.  I think he believes, although the Government side are not saying so, that there is some buoyancy of revenue there, but this buoyancy of revenue must be put to the proper use.  After all, the single objective of 83 per cent of this Parliament is to see that the financial status of this country is preserved, that for the long haul for the future we will have a sound economy, that we will be able to hold our heads high and will not have to stand back watching the young emigrate by the boatload every day.  Mind you, I heard Deputy Fahey when he was on this side of the House, saying that Fianna Fáil would cure the emigration problem when returned to power.  It was a hobbyhorse of the Minister of State when he was over here and he made several emotional contributions about the terrible emigration and the haemorrhage in the west and his concern for them.  The same haemorrhage is taking place today.  The same numbers are going.</P>

      <P>They are going and politicians, trade unions and all sides in this country have to admit at long last that there is a financial crisis.  Fianna Fáil have to admit it.  They still have not come to terms with the fact that there is one, that it is still there.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor gave a commentary on behalf of the Labour Party and spoke about the Rightwing parties in this House, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the PDs.  The consensus in this country also includes, so far as I know, the trade unions.  The ICTU who represent the vast majority of workers in this country took part in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  That is even more than the 83 per cent representation here in the Dáil which is just leaving the Labour Party and the parties of the Left to their minority position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even since the change of Government and the 1987 election has there not been a major change in the attitude of the ICTU?  Are they shouting now about firms closing down?  Are they calling on the Government to bail them out?  Are Fianna Fáil Deputies rushing to the Minister's office to save the redundant workers?  The figure for redundancy last year and this year is very high.  It is ignored by Ministers and does not seem to be a major issue.  Already 15,000 people have been made redundant in the first nine months of this year.  That is a <Col N="1138" /> major problem and a major source of worry, certainly to young people looking on.  It is probably one of the prime reasons for their deciding to emigrate.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at what the Minister announced the other day.  The Minister taxed the employer by bringing his contribution up substantially for the coming year.  I see no sense in taxing employment further.  We talk about making the best use of resources.  The Minister for Education spoke about making the best use of resources and went down through each category.  We want employers to employ more people, and the Minister for the Environment was in here telling us about the upsurge in employment.  Yet, he is part of a Government who are putting a further tax on employment.  That is a cynical exercise.</P>
    <P>This Government should think again before the budget and at least recognise the cost of employing one person.  Foreign companies coming in here and taking on a workforce are not told by the promoting agencies about sustantial welfare costs, pension schemes, VHI subsidies, labour agreements and so on.  That is all forgotten and when these companies come in they get a surprise.  I believe that is the reason they stop at 100 employees when it was projected that they would provide jobs for 200.  The cost of employment is a major factor.  In the future the Estimates should be geared towards keeping costs down with a view to 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment spoke about his road programme.  His lack of a road programme is one of the major reasons companies here will go to the wall after 1992.  There are some areas of the national primary routes that are now deteriorating.  If the secondary routes continue to deteriorate too there will be substantial job losses in the long run.  The condition of transport facilities here will be the making or the breaking of companies, and we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very eloquent in his <Col N="1139" /> praise of himself.  One would think he was Santa Claus when he spoke about the additional £20 million and how he had improved what he called the road strengthening programme.  He said it was better than the Coalition.  The previous Government did not do so well either.  I am not here to praise the previous Government's record in environment either, but at least they fully maintained the national primary routes and the national secondary routes.  Indeed, in my county we had substantial road strengthening programmes.  We had the benefit of EC allocations which helped substantially but the current position in my constituency is that roads are collapsing. Farmers themselves have to dump the aggregate on what are described as farmer roads.  If they did not do that at night some of them would not have access to their houses.  Other Deputies tell me that in what is described as the jewel constituency, North Tipperary, the lanes have not had any aggregate at all this year, so maybe we are doing a little bit better in County Clare.  The Minister should be under no illusion.  He is well able to give funds to County Mayo.  When it came to the national lottery he gave £450,000 to his own county.  What did he give to Counties Clare and Louth?</P>

As far as the contribution made by the Minister for the Environment is concerned, it was a farce for him to say that there has been an improvement in the roads or will be an improvement in the county roads here during 1988 when what will happen is the direct opposite.  That is the truth of the matter.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Estimates and the overall strategy of the Government which underlies the Estimates for the year 1989.  The other speakers today have generally approved the strategy and dealt with it.  As part of the evidence of that strategy I find in my own constituency that even in 1987, which was a year of adjustment, manufacturing jobs in the Mullingar area in County Westmeath grew by 75 which was the greatest growth for many years and signified a reversal of the fall in the number of manufacturing jobs in the previous year.  I took that as a good sign that the Government's strategy was working last year and I look forward to an even greater increase in manufacturing jobs in that area and in the surrounding areas for 1988.  I think that increase in employment in manufacturing, on which our young people depend so much for their future, will continue into next year and be sustained in future years if we hold to this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking first at the Estimate for the Department of the Environment, I congratulate the Minister on recognising the valuable work which has been done by the housing for the elderly task force and increasing their budget by 33 per cent.  In my experience as a county councillor I have found that the housing needs of the elderly could be catered for by that scheme if the scheme were to be <Col N="1141" /> extended.  In many cases the housing needs of elderly people who were requested to move into OPDs could easily have been catered for if certain modest repairs and modifications had been carried out to their existing accommodation. Old people do not like to leave their native surroundings or move into a new estate or even a group of very pleasing OPDs.  Many of those who are on the waiting list in my constituency and the waiting lists in other constituencies will take heart from the fact that the few little jobs which they wish to have done, perhaps the installation of a water supply or a bathroom, can be carried out with much more certainly in 1989 than they possibly could have expected if funding had remained the same.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have already dealt with the position in regard to our roads.  There is certainly a glaring need to do something about the cul-de-sacs, the farmers' roads, lanes or whatever they might be called from county to county.  I take great heart from the fact that the Minister for the Environment has increased the road strengthening grant from £15 million to £20 million for 1989.  I request the Minister to encourage his officials to loosen the strings somewhat in respect of the strengthening grant so as to allow some of this money to be used in improving selected and high priority cul-de-sac roads.  We must remember that along many of these cul-de-sac roads we have some of the highest producing farms and highest populations in rural Ireland.  I am very fearful that we will continue to go along as we have done for the last ten years in local government circles by disregarding the interests of the people who live along these cul-de-sac roads and perhaps in the process consign them to the hidden Ireland to their detriment and to the detriment of the country.  I hope that in the future we can reverse this trend. There seems to be a consensus among rural Deputies on the need for this work and I am confident that local government officials throughout the country will <Col N="1142" /> respect the need to keep using road strengthening moneys in the very efficient way they have been used up to now.  There is not one county councillor who is not amazed at the value we have got from these grants over the past few years.  It may well have been necessary to isolate this money from other programmes in local government so as to ensure that the main county and regional roads were brought up to an adequate standard.  There may have been inefficiencies in local government in the past but certainly the targeting of money for the strengthening of roads has got rid of a certain amount of these inefficiencies.</P>
    <P>It is very heartening to note that the western package is being extended, for practical purposes, to cover the western side of County Westmeath.  It was previously extended to cover a large part of County Longford and will be extended to cover all of County Longford in 1989. This will prove very important as funding will be made available for group water schemes from increased EC funds.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that priority sewerage schemes, such as the Kinnegad, Moate and Castlepollard schemes will benefit from the funding which will be made available under the Department of the Environment Vote.  I would also like to think that they might benefit from some EC funding under the revised Regional Fund arrangements in 1989.</P>
    <P>Let me highlight a concern of mine in regard to the increase in Regional Fund moneys for Ireland, a disadvantaged area within the EC.  We have been privileged to have been put among the category one countries along with Greece, Portugal and Spain, meriting particular attention from EC Regional Fund moneys.  From my information it appears that EC funding for roads in Ireland will exceed our expectations.  It would appear from this Estimate that we should fight harder to take advantage of this increased funding. It appears that the funding which will be available to category one countries will not be taken up by the other countries <Col N="1143" /> and that Ireland is in a highly favourable position to take up these funds because of its preparedness relative to the other countries, Spain, Greece and Portugal.  I would like to think that there will be the necessary flexibility in order to allow us to take up this money not only for the national primary and secondary routes and the major urban routes but also for county and regional roads which, notwithstanding the good work which has been done through the use of the road strengthening moneys, still need the expenditure of substantial funding to bring them up to the standards required in the 20th century and to leave them in a better state as we approach the 21st century.</P>
    <P>We face difficulties in relation to our ability to take up this EC funding for roads if we in this House continue to flog dead horses as many Deputies have done in respect of matters in dispute which by reason of the financial constraints on the various Ministers concerned are matters of academic debate.  We should be looking at areas where we possibly can get movement and where money is available from the EC.  We should do that while the fund is available to us.  On looking at the arrangements made by the EC for a doubling of the Regional Fund moneys available to Ireland over a five year period, it strikes me that this and the other countries concerned might let the opportunity pass because of overall budgetary strategy, dictated by a mounting national debt which has only just been brought under control through very courageous Government action, and that we would let that fund run without taking up funds over the five year period and find when it came up for renewal that our power of negotiation had been considerably diminished.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Deputies in the Opposition to encourage the Government to get up and go after this money and not to leave the Brussels bureaucrats with their arms dangling wondering where we <Col N="1144" /> are.  Spain and Portugal and the other countries may well not be as active as we are in pursuing this money.  We may move out of category one at the end of five years.  We may because of the growth we probably will experience as a result of prudent Government management during the next five years move out of category one and find ourselves in an inferior position <i>vis-á-vis</i> EC Regional Fund grants for road construction and so on.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for the Department of Education, I congratulate the Government for maintaining the basic essential educational services.  It was an area of some controversy some time ago but on seeing how the services are delivered in my constituency and in others, I am satisfied the changes are being brought about with the minimum of disruption.  In certain areas in my constituency I detect a visible improvement.  The number of courses being offered is being expanded.  One finds that the German option is being taken up increasingly in the linguistic field.  One also finds that, through economies in the capital budget, more modest extensions can be planned for national schools, and more modest extensions consistent with the actual needs of the pupils can be planned for vocational schools like Killucan, Castlepollard, Moate, Mullingar and Athlone. That is the approach which is being applied throughout the country where scarce resources are being distributed and planned better so that service can be provided in a shorter time.</P>
    <P>In the area of adult education, despite screams from interest groups and Opposition politicians, one finds that one can satisfy local needs.  Only recently I came across a man of 50 years of age &mdash; an electrician &mdash; who had been unemployed for the past ten years.  He was finding it more difficult to get a job as he got into middle age.  Last year, through the good efforts of FÁS and their incentive schemes he set up his own business and happily he is going from strength to <Col N="1145" /> strength servicing industrial concerns in north-west Meath and Longford.  I was thrilled when that man came to me the other day and pointed out a hi-tech adult education course for electricians being run by the City of Dublin VEC.  He said he would like to go on that course.  I told him I would help him as much as I could, but I asked him if he would try to organise local electricians in the Westmeath area so that a similar course could be run by the Westmeath VEC.  This would save them the expense of travelling to and from Dublin.  It is very satisfying to see that this man, despite his misfortunes, has organised a number of his colleagues in the electrical trade to take up that course.  They will be learning about the hi-tech micro-chip technology that all practical electricians must learn.</P>
    <P>This is indicative of the vibrant attitude adopted by people in the workplace. They see in adult education the possibility to respond to the better economic times ahead, to respond to the challenge of more economic activity through a sounder Government economic strategy and through opening further opportunities in the EC in 1992.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy representing a hospital town, it would be remiss of me not to mention health.  Health has been an issue of national controversy over the last couple of years.  It is an issue on which the Government have been attacked many times, but in the Midland Health Board area, every effort has been made by the doctors, nurses and administrative staff to ensure the optimum level of service for the people of Westmeath and Longford. The health board in that area have gone from strength to strength in efficiency and in delivering better services as a result of the changes brought about by the budget.</P>
    <P>One looks forward to the equipping and staffing of phase I of Mullingar General Hospital, and to the construction of phases 2A and 2B of Mullingar General Hospital, as well as the continued planning of the upgrading of the admission unit of St. Loman's mental hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> In the agricultural field, I would welcome the extension of the western package grants to Westmeath and the installation of the Finney basin rural integration development pilot scheme.  I see great prospects in this area if one can get the co-operation of the various State and private bodies involved.</P>
    <P>The Estimates presented by the Government will provide the opportunity for dynamism in the economy and provide the opportunity for debate and discussion on how best to face the future.  I welcome all debates which will help us ensure that the best resources of this House are pooled to provide a better future for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSMcCoy" hpid="Mr. McCoy Mr. McCoy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCoy</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that most economic indicators are moving in the right direction, the spectre and problem of unemployment remains stubbornly high.  No matter what statistics are used to create the illusion that 20,000 new jobs are created this year, the position on the ground does not substantiate these claims.  Figures published today indicate that by the end of the year, actual recorded redundancies will have outpaced the job target creation set by the Government.  There is a mass exodus of our young people to Britain and the USA because many of them are being denied a paltry few pounds dole on the basis of means testing their parents who are often in poor circumstances.  This despicable procedure has taken many of these young people out of the unemployment statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural Estimate shows an overall increase of 2 per cent.  This is immediately explained and accounted for under the heading &ldquo;General Administration&rdquo;. This shows an increase in real terms greater than the overall increase in the whole Estimate.  The conclusion can therefore be drawn that the overall Estimate net of administration overheads is down from last year's figure.  Of the total <Col N="1147" /> of £156 million, £70 million is for administration and £86 million is the Exchequer's contribution to agriculture. This figure of £86 million must be considered against increased levies on produce and the progressive reduction of VAT refunds in the last two years from 2.4 per cent to 1.4 per cent.  This reduction of VAT refunds has cumulatively brought £50 million into the Exchequer from the agricultural side. This shows that, over the last two years, the net amount in real terms accruing to farmers from the Exchequer will be of the order of about £36 million.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the VAT refunds.  These legitimate refunds &mdash; the refund of VAT on inputs to agricultural production &mdash; were agreed many years ago by the farming organisations and the Government of the day.  The justification given for decreasing the refunds was to collect the outstanding moneys in terms of health and other charges from the farming community notwithstanding the fact that in many cases those people had already settled their own bills.  Now that those arrears have been collected there is no justification for maintaining this reduction in VAT refunds on the basis that it is to collect outstanding health and youth employment levies.  I note there is no provision in the Estimate to extend the scope of the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>Since my first attempt to raise the matter in the House it has been brought to my notice that the Minister <Col N="1149" /> for the Environment has agreed to travel to Cork tomorrow to see the nature and scale of the damage done in the Cork region through excessive flooding.  I am delighted the Minister has agreed to make the journey.  That was the fit and proper thing for a caring Minister for the Environment to do.  Damage in the region exceeds £1 million and it is only right and proper that the Minister whose Department is directly involved should visit the region to evaluate the extent of the damage.  He will then be in a better position to decide, in conjunction with the local authorities, the remedial work that must be carried out in the short and long term.  It is worth noting that when flooding on a smaller scale occured in the Dodder river valley in Dublin two years ago the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, visited the region and spoke to the stricken families.  He instigated remedial action.  The precedent for such a visit exists.  It is only fit and proper that taxpayers and ratepayers in places like Blackpool in Cork should get similar treatment from a Minister or a Prime Minister as taxpayers and ratepayers received in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the catchment areas along the rivers Lee and Blackwater. The problems in those areas vary from place to place.  What will solve the problems in Mallow town will not address the problems in Cork city, as the Minister will learn when he visits the city tomorrow. However, one thing the areas have in common is that in recent days shopkeepers and residents have had their property damaged and lost goods to the extent of £1 million.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to offer to the people of the affected areas short term relief measures that will help to offset the worst excesses of the floods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend in the case of shopkeepers in Cork city whose stock has been damaged on many occasions over the years that they be given some rates relief as a once-off measure.  For householders some type of hardship fund <Col N="1150" /> should be established to give them relief. Owing to the persistent nature of the flooding in those areas householders have great difficulty in obtaining any type of insurance cover.  They have had to make so many claims that they are finding it impossible to get full cover and in some cases the premiums are too high for them. Many of them do not have insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to recognise those facts and offer to the people in the stricken areas relief funding on a shortterm basis.  Such a move would be appreciated.  However, having given relief to householders and shopkeepers the Minister should go on to consider the position Cork Corporation and Cork County Council find themselves in. Extensive damage has been done to roads and bridges in their areas and they will not be in a position to carry out repair work from existing budgets.  An immense amount of work will have to be done to make roads and bridges safe and the Minister should recognise that and make a once-off allocation to those authorities to enable them to carry out essential repairs.</P>
    <P>The most important single challenge facing us all is to put together a package of remedial works that will ensure that such flooding will not occur again.  Places like Blackpool, the flat of the city, Mallow, Kanturk and Fermoy have been subjected to regular flooding in the past 20 to 25 years but very little drainage or engineering work has been carried out to eliminate some of the causes of the flooding.  The time has long passed when those people can tolerate that flooding. The Minister, in co-operation with the engineers from the two local authorities, should identify the source of the problems and prepare a package of measures that will eliminate them.</P>
    <P>Having agreed on such a package the Minister should cost it and seek the necessary funding from the Exchequer or the EC.  In conjunction with the local managers and engineers he should prepare <Col N="1151" /> an action programme of engineering and drainage works to help remedy the causes of these persistent problems.  If he does that he will have done a good day's work and he will have given great hope to the people of the areas affected.  More than that needs to be done.  There are a number of schemes with the Department of the Environment for sanction.  If they were sanctioned and costed and the works carried out much of the flooding of recent days would have been averted without a doubt.</P>
    <P>I refer specifically to one scheme that has come in from Cork Corporation, that is the Whitechurch-Mallow Road drainage scheme.  Coincidentally, almost as if I had anticipated this flooding, I had a parliamentary question down on this scheme to the Minister today.  That scheme has been designed and planned by the engineers of Cork Corporation.  It has been submitted to the Department for sanction and that sanction is still awaited.  If that scheme had been sanctioned and the works carried out under the scheme, a great deal of the flooding that took place in Cork city this week and last week would have been averted.  I appeal to the Minister to look at that scheme and not let any trivial demand keep him from getting it off the ground.</P>
    <P>When I rang officials of his Department today and also officials of Cork Corporation I was told that the scheme was referred back to Cork Corporation for further information.  When I further investigated the information I discovered that the nature of the information sought is trivial and not at all sufficient to interfere with the carrying out of that scheme. There is an old saying that delay is the deadliest form of denial.  I appeal to the Minister not to delay any longer but to sanction that scheme, to provide the funds and to enable Cork Corporation to carry out those works.  If that was done a whole shoulder of the hill on the north-side of Cork city would be relieved of <Col N="1152" /> excessive flooding forever.  The need to do that was there 20 years ago and it is there now more urgent than ever.  I appeal to the Minister to bite the bullet and to get that work done.</P>
    <P>Equally, there are a number of schemes that ought to put in place in the centre of Cork city.  I acknowledge quite freely that a good deal of interceptor sewer work has been done in the channels of the river.  Much money has been spent providing interceptor sewers to channel the debris and so to help to keep the bed of the river free so that it could take the flood.  A good deal of that work has already been done but as of now no effort has been made and no works have been attempted to channel the centre island of Cork city.  There is no system of interceptor sewers in that part of the city and it is mainly there that this excessive flooding is happening repeatedly.  I say to the Minister now, and I will certainly be saying to the city manager in Cork next week, to have designed as quickly as possible a system of interceptor sewers for the centre island of the city of Cork.  If that were done a great deal of flooding would be eliminated and a great deal of damage would be averted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to come to Cork tomorrow. I hope he will visit the Mallow and Fermoy areas in view of the major damage done in recent days by the serious flooding in those areas.  I hope he will consider providing the financial assistance for the homes and properties that have been damaged because many of those people have been unable to get insurance.  Due to the fact that these areas have been hit on a regular basis by serious flooding the Minister should initiate urgent discussions with the local authorities in the area with a view to finding a solution to the repeated flooding. The question of seeking EC aid should also be considered.  Bridge Street in Mallow is flooded by the Blackwater at the Spaw Stream.  It is contended that to lower the bed of the Blackwater in the vicinity of Mallow Bridge could be a help. It was recommended in 1979 by the then town engineer that the Spaw Stream should be diverted and that should be considered.</P>
      <P>The local authorities are helpless in this whole matter.  People's homes and businesses are under a sea of water for 15 to 20 hours and that is a terrible situation. The management and staff of local authorities in the area from which I come must be congratulated on the work they have done for the people who were affected by the flooding.  They worked night and day to help those people.  That applies to the Mallow and Fermoy areas, especially the Ashe Quay area of Fermoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to one other matter.  It has been made clear from discussions at local level that there is not sufficient council staff to keep gulleys clean.  This has contributed in no uncertain manner to the flooding in the Spaw area of Mallow.  Flooding makes roads dangerous and impassable.  That kind of flooding never occurred previously because council staff worked on the roads and kept the drains open.  I thank the Minister for taking an interest in this matter and for <Col N="1154" /> deciding to visit the area.  I hope he will find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been allowed a few minutes and I will do the very best I can in that time to deal with this very serious problem.  It is very clear that the floods have brought devastating consequences for Cork city and county and indeed other parts of the south-west.  The people of Cork are crying out for a positive response from the Government.  This is a cry from the heart on behalf of our people.  The Government response should be at a number of levels.  First, it should be by way of support for the restoration work.  The figure of £1 million is, I believe, a conservative one.  The second point to be put to the Minister is the question of relief for the individuals who have been seriously affected by these floods.</P>
      <P>Perhaps more important is the making of provision for the future.  This must involve the preparation of flood relief plans designed to prevent a recurrence, or at least to minimise the consequences of any such recurrence.  I am convinced that EC funding will be available to support such plans but there is no possibility of access to such funding without having plans prepared and ready.  Now is the time for action and it is up to the Minister, Deputy Flynn, to take real action and to do it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I would also like to thank some of the Deputies on my own side for bringing these matters to my attention over the past days.  If it were not for my involvement in the House today in the Estimates debate and on Questions, for the first time in this session, I would have been in Cork today. That was my original intention but it could not be accommodated.  I will take the opportunity to visit Cork tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can sympathise with the Deputies who expressed views on behalf of their <Col N="1155" /> constituents.  That would be expected of them and they have done so very adequately.  At this stage it is not possible to establish the exact nature or the full extent of the damage caused by the recent severe weather in certain counties.  The recent flooding has caused serious damage in varying degrees in Cork, Kerry, Clare, Waterford, Monaghan, Cavan and Louth, but it would appear that County Cork was worse affected. County Cork is the most seriously affected area, but it is fair that I should put on record that many other areas have brought this matter to my attention as well.</P>
    <P>I had been doing something about the problem even before the matter was raised today.  I have asked the local authorities in all the affected areas I have mentioned to prepare reports.  The first thing any Minister should do is to find out precisely from the local authorities the extent of the flood damage that has occurred in their areas of responsibility. I have also sought their views with regard to immediate remedial measures which they consider necessary and other works that might usefully be undertaken to prevent a recurrence of flooding in the future.  I have already asked for this information in recent days.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have asked the local authorities involved to carry out as a matter of urgency an investigation into the extent of the flood damage to homes and buildings in order to quantify the remedial works required and to identify the householders, who through lack of insurance cover or otherwise, may be experiencing hardship.  I appreciate Deputy Quill's remark that she thinks I may be a caring Minister in some ways. I am not unmindful of news bulletins outlining events that have caused hardship to people.  My response was immediate and even if this matter had not been raised in this House it would still be a matter of concern to me.  I have some quite close friends in the Cork area who <Col N="1156" /> acquainted me with the matter.  Also, my colleagues on this side of the House brought me up to date about the difficulties and I knew that their concern was shared by everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>When the reports I have sought come to hand, particularly those about the urgent remedial works I have referred to, I will be in a better position to know what can be done.  It will not be possible for me to speak to the stricken families tomorrow. Although one would like to do that, I have a schedule that I have to comply with, as I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe would appreciate.  I am cutting out a half day from that schedule to go down to see for myself at first hand what has to be done and to speak with those who are responsible for the reports I have requested and who would know what is the real situation on the ground.  I propose to take some of the engineers and some of my expert staff with me and together with some of the local engineers we will take a trip over Fermoy, Mallow, the Blackwater and the Lee Basins to see exactly what the situation is from on high. Then we will go to City Hall to talk with the various people acquainted with the damage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> I am a little concerned about those who have no insurance.  I am not going to go into this matter in any great depth this evening except to say that it is a long established practice that the Exchequer cannot meet the losses incurred by businesses across the country as a result of their being uninsured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot get insurance cover because of previous flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  However, that matter was clarified by the former Leader of your Party, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, during the Bray disaster in 1986.  Dr. FitzGerald was quite forthcoming on the matter but unfortunately he had to find himself in the same position where the question of non-insurance caused him a big problem.  I do not think the situation has altered dramatically since then.</P>
      <P>I have noted what Deputy Quill said about the Whitechurch drainage.  I do not know offhand whether it would influence matters to that great an extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be pleased to hear that.  I presume I will hear about the spas as well.  I do not think that the flooding in County Cork during these past days has been caused by blocked gullies.  If I thought it was that easy to get rid of the difficulties, having the gullies cleared, I would be very happy indeed but the tradition of flooding in County Cork and in the south west region is much more serious than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Deputy <Col N="1158" /> only raised that as a point, I am sure that all matters will be addressed tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The question of EC aid was raised.  The EC make some little money available for victims of natural catastrophes but I think the interpretation the EC put on a natural catastrophe does not quite cover what we are talking about.  Indeed the amount of money that has been made available over the years for that when spread throughout all the member states would not address this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

In consultation with the good people who run your affairs in the region, together with your expertise and input, we will discuss the problem.

      <P>The projected construction period for the Lucan by-pass, as set out in the 1985 Road Plan, was 1985-87.  Work started in July 1986.  The scheme will be opened officially next month.</P>
      <P>The delay in carrying out these schemes is due mainly to the need to reduce the projected expenditure on major schemes generally since 1985, due to constraints on public expenditure and other work priorities.  In addition, in the case of the Chapelizod scheme, construction is being phased to ensure that it will be completed the same time as the adjoining Johns Bridge scheme, which was due to start last year.  This phasing is required so as to avoid bringing significant additional traffic volumes onto the Johns Bridge junction before the bridgeworks are completed.  The commencement of the latter scheme was delayed because of the need to readvertise the contract.  Tenders originally received in June 1988 were qualified contrary to the express terms of the contract documents.  The contract has been readvertised and the closing date for receipt of tenders is 28 October 1988.</P>

      <P>In relation to the export of hazardous wastes, a new control régime provided for in the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Waste) Regulations, 1988, will come into operation on 1 November 1988.  These regulations give effect to EC Directives of 1984 and 1986 and provide the legal framework for this country's participation in a Community-wide control system under which hazardous waste movements &mdash; including those to or from third states &mdash; will be subject to prenotification and documentation requirements from production stage to final disposal. The regulations apply both to exports and imports of hazardous waste. For export purposes, the designated competent authority is the local authority from whose area a transfrontier shipment commences.  My Department have no direct statutory function in relation to waste exports but is the designated competent authority for waste import purposes, should that ever arise, and for any transit of hazardous waste through the State for disposal in another state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prenotification of an export consignment from this country must be in the form of a prescribed consignment note and must include information on the mode of transport as well as the form of packaging.  The notification must be <Col N="929" /> accompanied by information on the measures to be taken to ensure the safe transportation of the waste and to ensure compliance by the carrier with the requirements of any member state concerned in relation to the transport of the waste.  Evidence of a contractual agreement with the consignee of the waste and of the existence of adequate technical capacity for disposal of the waste must also be furnished.  Where a local authority is notified of a proposed transfrontier shipment, it may specify such conditions as it considers appropriate in relation to the transportation of the waste concerned.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, a copy of the completed consignment note, acknowledged by the relevant competent authority, must accompany each consignment of waste.  In addition, the holder of the waste is obliged to take measures to ensure that the consignee, within 15 days of receipt of the waste, forwards a copy of the duly completed consignment note to the holder, to the local authority concerned and to the relevant authorities of other states concerned.</P>

      <P>The need for and commercial viability of contract incineration facilities in this country is the subject of a feasibility study which I commissioned in July last.  The study is due to be completed <Col N="932" /> and reported in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>In January of this year, I announced that earlier proposals to provide a central waste facility at Baldonnel were being abandoned.  Instead, I introduced a scheme of capital grants to encourage private sector interests operating in the hazardous waste disposal field to develop and extend their range of services to a level at which they can cater more satisfactorily for the treatment, recovery and disposal of hazardous waste arising in this country.  I made it clear at the time that the grant scheme did not apply to incineration facilities because I felt that a special in-depth study was first needed to establish the range and extent of the hazardous wastes arising in this country which would be likely to avail of a contract incineration facility and to evaluate the likely future demand of new industry for contract incineration.</P>
      <P>While national waste policy is directed towards achieving the maximum degree of self-sufficiency in hazardous waste disposal, I should point out that considerably less than one third of the hazardous wastes produced here are now being exported for disposal.  Most of these exports go to the United Kingdom but small quantities are shipped to France and Finland.  While there is a movement of opinion at international level towards the view that the transfrontier movement of hazardous wastes should be minimised, there is nothing to suggest that the export outlets available at present are unlikely to be available in the short or medium term.  In this connection, I should add that new regulations to control the export of hazardous wastes to EC member states and other states will come into operation on 1 November next.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1983 all aspects of the disposal of toxic and dangerous waste have been subject to control under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982. The exercise of control functions under these regulations is a matter for the local authority in whose area the waste is located and any person storing, treating or depositing such a waste needs a permit from the local authority.  The regulations introduced a consignment note procedure for both domestic and export waste movements.  While domestic waste movements will continue to be subject to control under the 1982 Regulations, a new control regime for export and import movements is provided for in the European Communities (Transfrontier Shipment of Hazardous Wastes) Regulations, 1988, which come into operation on 1 November 1988.

      <P>Under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, a person treating, tipping or storing waste on behalf of another person requires a permit from the local authority.  A similar obligation arises under the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982 for a person storing, treating or depositing toxic waste, whether on his own behalf or for another person.  The implementation of these regulations is a matter for the local authority in whose functional area the operation takes place.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken a number of steps to encourage the use of unleaded petrol by Irish motorists.</P>
      <P>Unleaded petrol was introduced to this country in October 1986.  It is more expensive to produce than leaded petrol and, on this account, there was a price differential at the pumps for over a year after its introduction.  Following a submission made by me, an adjustment was made in the excise duty applying to unleaded petrol in the 1988 Budget, which removed the price disincentive.</P>
      <P>I have established a steering committee to devise and oversee measures to promote wider availability of unleaded petrol.  The oil distribution companies, the motor trade and a number of Government Departments are represented on the committee.  The first task was to secure the establishment of a reasonable network of outlets throughout the country. The number of petrol stations selling unleaded petrol at the end of January 1988 was 14.  By the end of September, it had risen to 36 outlets and by the end of January 1989 I expect that unleaded petrol will be available at 95 outlets. Although there are some gaps to fill in the network, I am pleased at the progress being made to date in this first phase of the programme.</P>
      <P>The second element was to inform motorists as to whether their cars can use unleaded petrol.  A list of cars which can use leaded or unleaded petrol without adjustment has been prepared by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and was launched on 25 October.</P>
      <P>The third element involved a publicity campaign which I launched on 25 October, with the objective of getting the required information across to the motoring public on the use of unleaded petrol and on where they can get it, and so encourage those who can to change over to unleaded petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A radio advertising campaign has commenced and widespread distribution of <Col N="940" /> information leaflets, posters and car stickers is underway.  I intend to step up this publicity effort in the months to come, according as more progress is made in extending the network of unleaded petrol stations.</P>
    <P>While I am not yet satisfied with the rate of progress here compared to some other European countries, I believe that the action I have taken, in co-operation with the other interests concerned, to encourage the use of unleaded petrol will ensure its greater acceptance and wider availability here by 1 October 1989, the date by which, under the terms of EC Directive 85/210, each member state is required to ensure the availability and balanced distribution of unleaded petrol.</P>

    <P>*These estimates are very tentative and are subject to a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P>No account is taken of the fact that but for most of the above incentives, many of the enterprises involved might not have been set up in this <Col N="952" /> country.  To the extent that the profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes part of the cost figures shown might therefore be regarded as notional.</P>
    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1)  <i>Export sales relief and &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief</i></P>
    <P>The figures for each year include the tax relief relevant to accounting periods which ended in that year and to earlier accounting periods in so far as such relief was allowed in that year.</P>
    <P>(2)  <i>Manufacturing profits</i></P>
    <P>These figures represent the estimated loss to the Exchequer arising from the charging of manufacturing and other qualifying profits at reduced rates of corporation tax instead of at normal rates.</P>
    <P>(3)  <i>Stock relief</i></P>
    <P>Stock relief was not renewed in 1986 for any sector other than farming.</P>
    <P>(4)  <i>Capital allowances</i></P>
    <P>The figures shown relate to the cost of the relief granted to companies and self-employed individuals.  The cost included for companies is by reference to accounting periods ending in the year ended 5 April immediately preceding each of the years in question, e.g. year ended 5 April 1986 relates to the column headed 1986-87 (6/4/1986 to 5/4/1987).</P>
    <P>(5)  <i>&ldquo;Section 84&rdquo; loans</i></P>
    <P>This figure includes preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on Section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded £5.13 million in 1986 and £14.4 million in 1987.</P>

    <P>Figures of tax paid on income assessed under Case III of Schedule D are included under the appropriate headings in the table.  Statistics are not available which would enable these figures to be separately identified.</P>
    <P>Notes</P>
    <P>(1)  The figures cover more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  They include tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.</P>
    <P>(2)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are, to some extent, estimated.  The figures shown are estimates of the tax paid by full-time farmers together with tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>(3)  This includes tax paid on income from trades and professions (other than farming) together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified. The estimate for 1988 is net of the credit to be allowed in respect of withholding tax on professional fees which was deducted at source between 6 June 1987 and 5 April 1988.</P>
    <P>The figures also take into account tax repayments made to exempt individuals and bodies (such as charities and pension funds) in respect of tax deducted at source (such as income paid under covenants) or of tax credits attaching to company distributions.</P>
    <P>(4)  The figures shown are in respect of tax deducted by building societies under the composite rate arrangement.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of tax referable to building society interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(5)  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of deposit interest retention tax referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(6)  The heading of &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo; includes tax payments made in respect of back duty settlements and income of Irish residents arising in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply yesterday to Question No. 45 about the problem caused by wandering horses in a number of areas in Dublin, including Finglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make the point that the impounding of wandering animals is not a matter for the Garda only.  It is a function which is conferred by statute on the local authorities also.  The Garda have to cope with very heavy demands on the wide range of services which they provide, and priority has to be given to certain aspects of their work &mdash; for example the prevention and detection of serious crime. There is therefore a limit to the amount of Garda time and resources that can be allocated to dealing with the problem caused by wandering animals.  These <Col N="960" /> problems are fully recognised of course and the Garda have informed me that they are taking all practicable steps that they can to deal with them.  But the local authorities have a major role in the matter too, as provided for in the relevant statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>There is no pound in the vicinity of Finglas and the impounding of animals found wandering in the area is dependent on the provision of transport facilities by the local authority.  In reply to a previous question by the Deputy on 21 June last I indicated that the Garda authorities had said that a recent undertaking from Dublin Corporation to provide improved transport facilities for the impounding of animals in Finglas and nearby areas should lead to an improvement in the situation.  However, the Garda authorities have informed me that certain difficulties in relation to the provision of such facilities have been encountered by Dublin Corporation and that this has affected the level of impounding of horses found wandering in this area.  Since 1 June last there have been nine such impoundings and there have been no prosecutions for offences involving horses wandering in the area.  Urgent discussions are taking place between the Garda authorities and Dublin Corporation with a view to resolving the difficulties referred to as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional pounds is a matter for the local authority concerned. I understand that the question of providing a pound in north Dublin has been raised with Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council by the County Registrar who also has functions in this matter.</P>

      <P>What is at issue in this case is not off-farm income but the fact that the herds of the person named and his father were being worked as a single unit and consequently the two separate applications made under the 1986 disadvantaged areas scheme were amalgamated for grant payment purposes. All cattle headage grants due on foot of the amalgamated applications have already been paid and any further apportionment of the payments made is a matter for settlement between father and son.  No grants under the 1986 EC suckler cow premium scheme were paid in this case due to failure to comply with the six month retention period specified in that scheme.</P>

      <P>The total number of grants paid was 2,084 &mdash; to the value of £2 million.  The provision of a detailed breakdown of these payments would make severe demands on staff resources.

      <P>Appeals may be dealt with either on the basis of an oral hearing or they may be dealt with summarily.  Where cases which are deemed suitable to be dealt with summarily they are normally determined within four to six weeks from date of submission to the appeals officer to date of decision.  Each appeal is determined on the basis of its own particular merit.  An appellant is required to state the grounds on which the appeal is based and where the contentions are at variance with the information already available a further investigation has to be made.  In many cases this may result in prolonged inquiries by a social welfare officer before the case can be submitted to an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>Where no further investigation is required by the appeals officer it is estimated that the time taken to process an oral hearing from the date of submission to the appeals officer to the date of hearing is normally six to eight weeks in Dublin and somewhat longer in provincial areas.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the networks of non-national main and county roads rests with the local authorities. Under existing arrangements, the cost of works on these roads falls to be financed by a combination of local <Col N="981" /> resources and State road grants, including the block grant, the county road strengthening grant and special improvement grants.</P>
      <P>The extent to which local resources are used for roadworks is a matter for determination by the local authority. Because of my concern about the condition of county roads, the provision for the county road strengthening grant for 1987 was £15 million compared with £5 million in 1986.  A further £15 million has been provided for 1988 and I have allocated £19.5 million for county road strengthening in 1989.  This grant may also be used, at the discretion of local authorities, for strengthening works on non-national main roads.  I have also decided to allocate £500,000 next year for improvement works on access roads to forests.</P>
      <P>In the case of Kildare County Council, the road grant allocations for county and non-national main roads in 1988 total £1.204 million, which is 18 per cent greater than the amount paid under the corresponding grants in 1987.</P>
      <P>Detailed information about the condition of the network of county roads together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network, was received from all county councils in response to a departmental circular letter issued in May 1987.  This information is being considered in the context of the proposed blueprint for road development.  The blueprint will outline future policy on non-national main and county roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint labour committee system at present provides statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers in certain sectors of the economy, which were traditionally poorly paid or where trade union organisation was weak.  It is open to a trade <Col N="984" /> union or any organisation or group of workers claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of a new joint labour committee. My proposals on industrial relations reform contain provisions aimed at improving the operation of joint labour committees and the procedures for establishing new committees.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the JLC system can be a flexible and effective means of tackling the problem of low pay and poor conditions of employment, which can take account of the particular economic and industrial relations circumstances of different sectors.</P>

      <P>I have received a very considerable number of requests for assistance from the national lottery proceeds available to my Department.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it has been possible to accede to only a relatively small number of these requests because of the limited funds available.  In these circumstances I can hold out little hope of being in a position to assist Clonmel Rape Crisis Centre in the current year.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy may be interested to note that a large number of projects in the South Eastern Health Board area have received grants from my Department's 1987-88 lottery allocation including a grant of £80,000 for the provision of improved services for the assessment of alleged cases of child sexual abuse in the South Eastern Health Board area.  Similar grants have been made available in all health board areas along with a number of smaller grants to voluntary agencies which provide similar services for women and children.</P>
