      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in relation to the Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries established to co-ordinate Ireland's approach to the EC Structural Fund if he will give the following: (1) the number of times the committee have met, (2) whether the secretariat of the committee is provided by the Department of Finance or by his Department, and (3) if he proposes to make a statement to the Oireachtas in relation to the work of the committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 17 May of this year I chair the Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries which has been established to deal with the overall co-ordination of our efforts on the completion of the European Single Market <Col N="203" /> and the effective use of the expanded European Structural Fund.  The other members of the committee are the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Tourism and Transport, Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce and Communications, the Environment, Labour and Energy and our appropriate departmental secretaries.</P>
      <P>The committee meets weekly.  The secretariat of the committee is provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee is to ensure a clear strategic approach to upholding Ireland's interests in relation to European Community negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the clarity of his reply.  Would the Taoiseach explain how the work of that particular committee relates to the Government's work in the preparation of the various integrated programmes, that is, the national community programmes of interest for the European Structural Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates very much to it.  The purpose of the Ministers and Departmental Secretaries Committee is to supervise everything &mdash; all aspects of the work, particularly the preparation for the use of the Structural Fund and to co-ordinate our attitude and our position on all these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, could he indicate in what way the structure he has just described to me has been changed by his announcement last week, of the appointment of the Minister for the Environment with special responsibility for co-ordination and planning in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been changed at all.  The Minister for the Environment is a member of the general committee, but as the Deputy will appreciate, in the approach to the use of the Structural Fund and indeed in the approach to planning generally, the physical infrastructure will occupy a very important <Col N="204" /> central part.  Therefore, I thought it would be helpful if the Minister for the Environment would take an over-view of all activities, particularly activities which had to do with the material infrastructure. The particular assignment the Minister has is, first, to ensure that there is co-ordination across the infrastructural scene; and, second, to be alert to any situation where some important aspect of infrastructure might be ignored or overlooked in the general milieu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach perhaps may be able to clarify the position to my satisfaction and that of the rest of the House.  I understand from his reply to Question No. 7 that the Cabinet Committee is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which co-ordinates everything. I understand that the Minister for Finance is responsible for the preparation of the programmes for integrated planning etc. for the Structural Fund.  Now I note the Minister for the Environment has a special role co-ordinating the first committee, the second committee or co-ordinating something else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach readily knows, I have a serious interest in this matter.  I am simply asking the Taoiseach to avail himself of this opportunity to tell the House who is co-ordinating what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a valid point.  First, there is the general committee in which all relevant Ministers, and their secretaries are represented.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of that committee is to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and <Col N="205" /> that each Department is fully aware of what other Departments are planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, in charge of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance have particular responsibility for preparing the overall national plan which will be submitted to Brussels early in the New Year.  He also has responsibility for co-ordinating into that overall national plan the sub-regional plans, so the Department of Finance have responsibility for that aspect of the overall planning and the co-ordination of the plans. The Deputy will understand that makes sense, because whatever resources we receive from Europe through the Structural Fund will naturally have to be matched with and related to the resources we can provide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very natural function for the Department of Finance to have that central role.  However, as I said, because we envisage that a great deal of this new work will be in the infrastructural area it was decided that the Minister for the Environment should be asked to keep an overall view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically every Department.  For instance, the Department of Tourism and Transport will be involved in some very important aspects of the infrastructure such as local airports and harbours &mdash; that sector.  The Deputy will understand that systems of communication, roads and communications generally, will occupy a major, central part and that is why the Minister for the Environment was asked to keep this overview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give in respect of the Government's information programme on 1992 EUROPEN the following information: (1) the overall budget provision in 1989 for the campaign, (2) the number of events which have been directly or indirectly assisted by the campaign, (3) the number of events-meetings at which Government Ministers have attended, (4) the number of officials in his Department who are directly involved in monitoring this campaign; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of £300,000 is being provided in 1988 in the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach for certain central costs related to the EUROPEN campaign and a Supplementary Estimate covering this amount will be brought before the Dáil later today.  It is anticipated that the full allocation will have been spent by 31 December.  Provision is also being made for a similar amount in the 1989 Estimates.  The International Division is responsible for such monitoring of the campaign as is required in so far as my Department are concerned. With regard to parts 2 and 3 of his question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his written Question No. 67 today.</P>

      <P>Let me, if I may, compliment the Government on the success of the campaign to date in arousing the awareness of the community at large in relation to 1992.  Having said that, let me <Col N="208" /> ask the Government and the Taoiseach if they are satisfied that the level of awareness &mdash; on which I compliment them &mdash; which they have succeeded in generating will percolate through all the various enterprises and that the rights of individuals in any enterprise are likely to be affected either positively or adversely by the completion of the internal market. Will the rights of those people be respected and will they have the possibility of access to ensure that their future will be secured?  Will the campaign now take on the direction of ensuring that such people, having been made aware of the implications of 1992, will have the means of assuring themselves that their position will be safeguarded and consolidated?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be fairly reassuring to the Deputy on that matter.  He is probably aware the trade unions are fully involved in this work.  We arranged when President Delors was over here that he would address the Congress.  President Delors has a keen personal interest in ensuring that the position and rights of workers are fully protected.  Also, we are ensuring through the monitoring committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that everything that is happening is being brought to attention and discussed at that central committee. Therefore, the Deputy can be assured that workers through their representatives are being made fully aware of what is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there have been quite a few meetings since he last answered questions on this matter?  Notwithstanding the facts in relation to the frequency of those meetings or the numbers of people participating, would the Taoiseach not agree that at most of those meetings, certainly the ones of which I have received reports, the rights of workers in private enterprise companies to have access to the implications of what is happening in their firms <Col N="209" /> has not been fully or adequately enunciated either by the private sector organisations or by Government sector organisations along the lines President Delors has expressed?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i> asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the fact that on the basis of the returns from firms covering three-quarters of the industrial work force, the Central Statistics Office in its quarterly industrial inquiry found that employment in Irish Industry declined from 205,700 in March 1987 to 199,500 in March 1988; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this is contrary to the trend indicated in the Central Statistic Office's labour force survey; if he has requested the Central Statistics Office to give the reason their surveys are showing divergent trends in industrial employment over the past year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two surveys mentioned by the Deputy are of fundamentally different types.</P>
      <P>The employment estimates derived from the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry relate to persons engaged in industrial establishments with three or more persons engaged.  They are based on the trend shown by direct returns from establishments accounting for over 85 per cent of the employment involved.  An industrial establishment is defined as a specific industrial activity conducted at a particular location.  The inquiry is restricted to the total number of workers directly engaged in the particular industrial activity including those providing support services (e.g. managerial, clerical, sales and transport staff, etc.).  Other persons engaged at the same location in non-industrial activities (e.g. wholesale factoring) are excluded as are self-employed persons working for the enterprise on a contract or fee basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a large sample household survey carried out on an annual basis in April-May and covering about 45,000 households with some 150,000 persons.  Information is obtained from direct household interviews by field staff.  In principle any formal or informal activity which may <Col N="212" /> be outside the scope of the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry is covered by the survey.  In the LFS all persons at work are coded by sector on the basis of the descriptions they give of the nature of the activity conducted at their place of employment.</P>
    <P>Because of its wider scope, the level of the LFS estimates of industrial employment is always above that of the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry.  Differences in trend which arise from time to time can be attributed to a number of different factors such as:</P>
    <P>(1)  a different trend in the employment levels of those small establishments excluded from the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry compared with larger establishments;</P>
    <P>(2)  own-account work for larger industrial firms of a contract/fee basis becoming more widespread;</P>
    <P>(3)  sampling variability or response errors in both the LFS and the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry;</P>
    <P>(4)  the unavoidable lag in the inclusion of some new industrial establishments on the register used for the industrial inquiries.</P>
    <P>(5)  Government employment/training schemes and voluntary rehabilitation schemes may impact differently in the two surveys.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister of State for his very lengthy reply.  I did not ask the Taoiseach to explain the different levels of industrial employment.  It is quite obvious that two different surveys will show different levels of industrial employment if they are organised on a different basis; but it is extraordinary that the two surveys should show different trends and I would like to ask the Minister of State if he is happy with the situation where one survey supplied by the Central Statistics Office shows an increase in industrial employment of approximately 3 per cent and the other survey shows a decrease in industrial employment of approximately 3 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two different <Col N="213" /> types of survey involved here.  The first survey referred to, the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry, relates specifically to certain types of industry which employ three or more persons.  The Labour Force Survey refers to smaller enterprises employing two or less and it is also conducted on an overall basis taking into consideration all aspects of every type of employment. Hence there is a very obvious difference here.  Both surveys are entirely different in so far as they show the number of small businesses increasing as a result of the present economic climate, and this is something we should all be very pleased about.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister again for the information supplied; but we all know the surveys were conducted on different bases and this explains the different levels of industrial employment thrown up by each individual survey.  It does not explain contrary trends.  I would like to ask again what I asked in the question. Has the Taoiseach requested the Central Statistics Office to make these surveys compatible or to explain why the trends are different?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's attention has been drawn to the difference in the figures shown in both surveys.  As I have already explained, they are two entirely different surveys and the first one, the Quarterly Industrial Inquiry, does not take into consideration persons engaged in non-industrial activities such as wholesale factoring or small businesses employing two people or fewer.  The Labour Force Survey does that, hence the difference. It is very simple and I believe I have answered the question very adequately.</P>

      <P>The South Eastern Health Board at their meeting on 14 July decided to centralise acute hospital services for South Tipperary in Cashel.</P>
      <P>I have already sought and obtained certain additional information from the board in relation to their decision. However, it is necessary for me to seek further clarification of certain aspects of the decision and I will be writing to the board shortly about these.</P>

      <P>I respect the decision of the South Eastern Health Board.  One of the factors that influenced me is a feasibility study that was carried out showing the following financial considerations: the cost of centralising Clonmel was estimated to be in the region of £2 million, whereas the cost of the alternative transfer of St. Joseph's, Clonmel, to Cashel was estimated to be approximately £10 million.</P>

I should like to point out to Deputies Howlin, Yates and Cullen who have questions in regard to this, that there are serious implications for the developments at Ardkeen and Wexford if we transfer £10 million to Cashel hospital because the amount of capital moneys is limited.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health his present views on the Clinical Trials Act, 1987 which came into effect on 1 December 1988; and if, in view of the fact that it would appear to leave members of ethical committees who approve clinical trials liable if anything goes wrong, he is considering amending the legislation to ensure that this Act does not halt clinical research in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 provides a balanced framework to facilitate clinical research and to protect those who participate in clinical trials.  I am aware of legal opinion on the lines of that mentioned by the Deputy in her question and I have taken steps to try to reassure the members of ethics committees that on the basis of the legal advice available to me the Act is structured in a manner that effectively defines the duty of care of the ethics committee and its members, a duty of <Col N="219" /> care that would be limited to foreseeable potential risks and that it would be extremely unlikely that liability would fall on an ethics committee or its individual members unless negligence on their part were established.</P>
      <P>In this context, sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Act are particularly relevant in relation to defining the duty of care of an ethics committee towards participants in a clinical trial.  Under section 8, an ethics committee would consider the justification for a trial and assess the potential risks to be incurred by participants in relation to the objectives of the trial. Under section 9, a participant in a clinical trial would consent to participate having been informed and advised beforehand of full details about the trial, including any potential risks, discomfort or possible side-effects involved and inherent in this is an acceptance by the participant that there is a degree of risk involved in the trial.  Under section 10, an ethics committee have to satisfy themselves that sufficient security is set aside to compensate a participant who may suffer injury or loss as a result of a clinical trial.</P>
      <P>Specifically in relation to security for compensation for participants who suffer injury of loss as a result of a trial, I am advised that consideration of the limit of duty of care which an ethics committee owe to a participant has to be made in the context of the Act as a whole and with particular reference to sections 8 and 9.  If an ethics committee are satisfied reasonably that adequate security is available having regard to the nature and risk of a particular trial based on a reasonable estimate of possible loss or damage, they would have properly carried out their duty and the question of their being negligent would not arise.  In this regard, it would not be reasonable to expect an ethics committee to provide for anything beyond what could be deemed to be the possible foreseeable risks associated with a particular trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation referred to in the question is limited to a small number of hospitals and I am hopeful that it can be resolved so that clinical research will <Col N="220" /> continue in those hospitals.  I will of course keep the Act under review in the light of its operation towards achieving its twin objectives of facilitating research and protecting participants.  If, after a reasonable period of its implementation, the Act is shown not to be achieving both of these objectives I will propose an amendment to it to ensure that it does so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the decision was taken to transfer services from the North Infirmary to <Col N="221" /> the Mercy Hospital at the end of last year, I agreed that a casualty service at the North Infirmary should continue pending the improvement of accident and emergency facilities for the people of north Cork city.  In practice the number of patients attending the casualty department at the North Infirmary has been very small &mdash; an average of less than two patients per day.  From 1 to 24 November this year, only five new patients attended the casualty department of the North Infirmary, all of whom were referred to the Mercy Hospital.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I felt that the proposed expenditure of £100,000 on the casualty unit at the North Infirmary could not be justified and that the best way to improve accident and emergency facilities for the people of the north city was to improve the cramped facilities at the Mercy Hospital.  I increased the level of the proposed capital grant to £335,000 to provide for renovations to the accident and emergency department at the Mercy Hospital and to provide a separate out-patient department.  The new casualty department will open next week and will be fully operational by the middle of January. This will provide a much improved accident and emergency service for the people in north Cork city and I am satisfied that a separate casualty service at the North Infirmary will no longer be required.</P>
    <P>On the question of accident and emergency services in Cork city generally, I am concerned that there should be close co-operation between the three general hospitals in Cork so that services are provided as effectively as possible.  Officials of my Department have held a series of meetings this year with representatives of the two voluntary hospitals and the Southern Health Board to explore the potential for closer co-operation, including the co-ordination of accident and emergency services.  The work of the accident and emergency departments has been analysed closely and a number of organisational changes has already taken place.  The relationship between the work of the departments and the role of general <Col N="222" /> practitioner services is also under examination. I would like to assure the Deputy that my, and my officials sole concern is to improve the quality of accident and emergency services in Cork through the closest possible co-operation between the three general hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>Would the Minister accept that the reason the casualty unit that was promised for the North Infirmary Hospital never functioned, as it ought to have functioned, was because a doctor was never appointed to the casualty unit despite the fact that when the hospital was closed down and the beds had been taken out a firm commitment was given by the Minister that a proper accident and emergency service would be set up in that hospital?  When and why did the Minister change his mind and break his promise to the people to whom he made the promise at that time?</P>

      <P>In November 1987, it was decided to transfer in-patient services in the North Infirmary to the Mercy Hospital.  It was agreed that the Mercy Hospital would maintain a casualty service at the North Infirmary on an interim basis.  In the event, the Mercy Hospital experienced great difficulty in providing a full casualty service at the North Infirmary.  It proved impossible to attract medical staff of a sufficiently high calibre to fill the post of casualty officer.  Casualty sisters and a radiographer with clerical support have provided a minor casualty service, referring those who require medical attention to the Mercy Hospital.</P>

      <P>I have no quarrel with what the Minister is proposing to do in the Mercy Hospital, it is quite welcome.  In relation to the appointment that was promised, but never made, in the North Infirmary, may I ask the Minister if the post was advertised, if so, what qualifications were stipulated in the advertisement and why the post was never filled?</P>

      <P>My information is that the Mercy Hospital were unable to attract <Col N="223" /> medical staff of a sufficiently high calibre for that post in the North Infirmary. Obviously, on the basis of the numbers attending &mdash; five new patients between 1 November and 24 November &mdash; I do not think anyone in the House would consider it justifiable to spend £100,000 in the casualty department of the North Infirmary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 183 together.  I have established a national co-ordinating group to plan and oversee activities for 1989 which will highlight the cancer problem in Ireland.  The group includes representatives of my Department, the Department of Labour, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, General Practitioner groups, An Bord Altranais and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The group are preparing a programme of activities which aims to focus public attention on cancer during 1989.  This programme will include elements dealing with each of the ten points in the European Cancer Code.  Activities under this programme will include a new public information campaign, conferences on various cancer related topics, a school programme and a mobile cancer education unit among others.  The full details of the programme will be announced publicly in January.</P>
      <P>I hope that the outcome of this co-operative programme in 1989 will increase public awareness of risk factors for cancer and that this will ultimately lead to a reduction in the incidence of cancer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that comprehensive reply.  This subject has been so taboo that many people refuse to refer to it by name.  May I ask the Minister if the public information campaign will emphasise the degree to which cancers are treated and curable in <Col N="226" /> view of the general public perception of cancer at present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>That certainly will be one of the issues addressed.  I will bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the national co-ordinating committee. The aim, as the Deputy is aware, of the European Year for Cancer is to try to reduce the incidence of cancer by 15 per cent by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>Because a number of different departments and agencies are involved, in the European Cancer Year and as I did not have notice of that question, we have not prepared the budget for all the agencies that will be involved. On the question of the oncology unit in Crumlin, we will be making the allocation to Crumlin Hospital later this week or at the beginning of next week.  We will be giving them sufficient money to ensure that they are able to provide the necessary level of service for the people.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the serious crisis facing many of our public hospitals, such as St. James's in Dublin 8, Galway Regional Hospital, County Galway and Temple Street Children's Hospital, Dublin 1, which has led to patients having to spend hours waiting on trolleys and has led to increased waiting lists for urgent treatment, he will indicate the measures he intends to take to deal with the crisis; if he will increase the financial allocation for these hospitals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Deputy's allegation that there is a serious crisis facing many of our public hospitals: in fact, we continue to have an excellent hospital service comparable with any in the developed world.  There has been a lot of media exaggeration in the recent past regarding patients on &ldquo;trolleys&rdquo; and waiting lists for &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; treatment.  I would like to set the record straight however in regard to trolleys.  Trolleys <Col N="228" /> have always been a normal feature of Accident and Emergency departments in general hospitals.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of the casualty department is to have observation beds or trolleys to accommodate patients who require observation.  While these people are being maintained on trolleys all appropriate medical attention is provided. People on waiting lists are those who are not regarded as emergency cases.  Where people are in urgent need of immediate medical attention they are treated promptly in acute general hospitals.</P>
      <P>Deputies will know that I have instituted a major rationalisation programme which continues to address any difficulty in our hospital services.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's statement amazing in view of the number of complaints I have received and which I am sure every other Deputy in this House has received in regard to waiting lists and so forth in hospitals.  Is the Minister aware that a child of five years of age cannot have an urgent operation for two-and-a-half years in Temple Street Children's Hospital to save his hearing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the point that allegations have been made both inside and outside of this House about patients being left on trolleys at Temple Street Children's Hospital, but the reality is that there are no trolleys.  I accept that there are delays for certain specific procedures, such as, tonsils and adenoid and orthopaedic procedures.  There have been such delays for many years and they have not just started occurring over the past 18 months.  I would point out to the Deputy and for the benefit of the other Deputies in the House that 500,000 people were treated as in-patients in hospitals while 1.5 million people attended out-patients clinics in 1987. These figures do not include patients who attended their own general practitioners and were not referred to hospitals or those who attended consultants privately or those who were admitted to private <Col N="229" /> hospitals.  Those are sizeable figures when we consider that our population is 3.5 million and they support my view and the view of most Members of this House that there are adequate and proper services available for the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there are long waiting lists, both for children and adults, for urgent operations and that in many cases casualty patients are left lying on trolleys in public hospitals because there are no beds available for them and because there are no nurses to man the wards?  Would the Minister also accept that the decision he has made to peg the allocations to health boards for 1989 at the 1988 level, an effective 3 per cent cut, is going to mean we are going to have longer queues and more problems in our public hospitals as a result?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that patients are left lying for a long time on trolleys while awaiting beds in hospitals. In one instance during the current year while a number of patients were lying on trolleys there were vacant beds available in a sister hospital in the same group. That was a matter between the two hospitals.  As I have already stated in answer to Deputy Mac Giolla's question, trolleys have always been a feature of casualty and out-patients departments. One reason for this is that it may be necessary to observe patients for some time and another reason is that it is easy to move a patient on a trolley to the appropriate area of the hospital if they need immediate treatment.  It may be necessary to move patients to specific areas of the hospital from accident and emergency departments as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that reputable consultants, objectively stating their views, have confirmed that waiting lists in public hospitals for <Col N="230" /> cancer and cardiac investigations have grown enormously during the past 18 months and that the waiting lists for many other specialities, particularly of an investigative nature, are now dangerously long and that very serious concern is being expressed, particularly by the medical profession, by a wide range of consultants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that no matter which public hospital one goes into one will find consultants who will stand over the length of the lists when they cannot get patients into hospital to have these particular investigations carried out.  This is leaving aside orthopaedic and ENP procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Desmond is putting forward, as from time to time I have seen consultants make public announcements which, when the facts were analysed, did not always stand up.  For example in St. James's Hospital where the number of beds has been reduced by 25 per cent the throughput of patients has increased by 7 per cent.  In this country we perform one and a half times the number of cardiac by-pass operations per 1,000 people than they do in Britain.  I accept that there is a problem with admissions in the major hospitals, particularly in the Dublin area and to a lesser extent in Cork and Galway, because of the impact of the accident and emergency departments on those hospitals, where a major accident and emergency service is provided.  This is a problem we are addressing and we are trying to see how the accident and emergency service can be improved having regard to the level of consultant staff in the accident and emergency unit and having regard to the general practitioner service that is available.  We are also looking at the area of prevention, as many people who find themselves in accident and emergency departments, if they had taken a little bit more care would not have found themselves there.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the serious concern which has been expressed on more than one occasion by the senior consultants in the hospital and is he also aware that it is now accepted that the only way to gain admittance to the hospital is to go into the casualty department?</P>

Indeed, Galway Regional Hospital is one of the hospitals where throughput has increased in the current year.  I accept that in order to live within the allocation the Western Health Board have been obliged to close a number of beds for the remainder of this year.  This is a temporary measure and, hopefully, those beds will be opened at the end of this month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 39 together.  Comprehensive detailed information along the lines requested by the Deputy has not been available on a routine basis for all specialties to my Department in the past. The practice has been to monitor waiting lists only in respect of specialties where there was known to be a particular problem in relation to service provision.  These include orthopaedics, cardiac surgery and ophthalmology.  The information available in relation to these specialities does not indicate any overall increase in the number on their waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Similarly, the general information available to my Department from ongoing and regular contact with hospitals does not suggest a significant increase in the number on waiting lists.  Where increases have occurred they tend to be where new procedures or treatments are developed but available facilities have not expanded sufficiently to provide a comprehensive service immediately.</P>
    <P>Health boards have been notified of their non-capital revenue allocation for 1989 last week and the voluntary hospitals will be advised of their allocations within a few days.  Officials of my Department will be meeting with health board and hospital managements to discuss their plans for containing expenditure within allocation.  Hospitals will be asked to re-examine priorities and where long waiting lists exist to make efforts to ensure that unnecessary delays in treating patients do not occur.</P>
    <P>Hospital management and medical staff have been encouraged to be innovative in their approach to the delivery of services to the public.  Increased emphasis on the use of day medical and surgical techniques in hospitals has resulted in increased patient throughput leaving more beds available for those treatments which still require in-patient facilities.</P>

      <P>I want to remind Deputies that there are five questions nominated for priority to be disposed of within the prescribed time, which is 3.45 p.m.  I need the co-operation of the Deputies so that I may deal with the five questions.  Therefore, brevity is of the essence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what you have said, a Cheann Comhairle.  Would the Minister not agree that the problem of waiting lists is the most serious hardship suffered by patients, that there is a three-year waiting period for orthopaedic hip operations for some 8,000 public patients and there can be up to a two and a half year waiting period for certain cardiac procedures?  These waiting lists are unprecedented and if one looks at the <Col N="234" /> annual report of the Mater Public Hospital one can see that they are carrying out fewer cardiac procedures than in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated this afternoon, I accept that there are long waiting lists for some procedures, one of them being the orthopaedic hip replacement operations referred to by Deputy Yates.  This problem has existed for a number of years and is not something new which has developed.  We are addressing that problem in the Dublin area, in conjunction with The Arthritis Foundation of Ireland, through the provision of two extra theatres in Cappagh Orthopaedic Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the backlog in a number of cases would the Minister consider issuing in 1989 contract allocations to specific hospitals to clear certain waiting lists?  As the Minister knows, contract allocations for specific levels of work have already been undertaken in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said in reply to the question, we do not have detailed waiting lists for specific hospitals nor indeed for specific procedures.  It is very hard to get accurate information on waiting lists because there can be patients presenting for the first time, patients coming back for return visits, patients who have received in-patient treatment returning to out-patient clinics for followup treatment, patients who have already been seen at out-patient clinics called back for further investigation perhaps to other clinics, patients on more than one consultant's list and on the waiting lists of a number of hospitals and the waiting lists of a number of consultants in the same hospital for the same procedure.  It is very difficult to get accurate information on waiting lists.  I monitor very carefully what is happening.  I accept that there are delays for certain specific procedures but we are trying to address these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has refused foreign health insurance organisations access to the Irish market; if the Government will be seeking a derogation from the concept of open competition in health insurance at EC level in the context of 1992 and the subsequent deregulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive governments to restrict licences issued under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, to small schemes associated with particular firms or organisations.  The basis of this restriction has been the desire to protect VHI's &ldquo;community-rating&rdquo; approach, under which older age groups and other higher risk categories of subscriber can avail of insurance cover on the same terms as the rest of the population.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that I appointed a consultant to examine all aspects of the VHI board's operation, taking particular account of the implications of the completion of the internal market in 1992. The question of VHI's monopoly status, and of whether it is necessary to seek an exemption from European Community legislation, will be considered by the Government in the light of the consultant's report.</P>

      <P>Yes, applications were refused by my Department.  I have an open mind on competition but I am anxious to ensure that community rating would be available to all people.  I would not like to see a situation develop whereby an insurance company would come in and sell health insurance but exclude everybody who is vulnerable. This would put an intolerable burden on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board <Col N="236" /> and they would probably not be able to deliver a service.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's view that those under 50 years of age should not be given cheaper insurance so that the VHI would be left with the lame ducks in terms of people who are more likely to claim.

In fact, his terms of reference in regard to 1992 were to report on the entire range of functions performed by the VHI and the extent to which these would require modification in the light of possible competition from other European health insurance companies in a free market situation from 1992 onwards.  When I receive the consultant's report at the end of the year I will look at it and make whatever recommendations I consider necessary.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Midland Health Board is operating a policy of withdrawing medical cards immediately on the admission of patients to long-stay hospitals and homes in order to justify levying daily <Col N="237" /> maintenance charges for in-patient services on persons with full Health Act eligibility; that the Midland Health Board is further levying daily charges from the patient's date of admission rather than after 30 days; whether similar policies are in operation by other health boards; if so, the health boards in question; if he will issue an immediate directive to health boards to desist from these practices; the total amounts of moneys thus collected by each health board for each of the past three years; the way in which he proposes to have money thus demanded refunded by health boards to the patients concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 214, column 1287 of the Official Report of 22 November 1988 from which it will be quite clear that the Midland Health Board is not acting illegally in this matter.</P>
      <P>Persons who are in receipt of institutional assistance in long-stay homes may be required to contribute towards the cost of their maintenance from the day of their admission under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1954, as amended by the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965.  Persons with full eligibility are also liable to make this contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister regard this as acceptable policy?  Does he accept that old age pensioners on non-contributory pensions should merely have pocket money returned to them and that they should be expected to make that level of contribution to health board finances?  Does he propose to allow such practice to continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is an acceptable practice and has been acceptable to my predecessors right back to 1954 when the institutional assistance regulations were first brought in.  Indeed, I might point out that apart from the Midland Health Board area, the South-Eastern and Eastern Health Board areas take 75 <Col N="238" /> per cent of the income, 25 per cent being left to the patient for personal needs.  The Southern Health Board take 80 per cent. The North-Western Health Board give the patient £7.50 a week.  The Western Health Board patient receives £8.50 a week.  The North-Eastern Health Board patient receives £12 a week.  The Mid-Western Health Board patient receives £13 a week.  It is normal practice throughout the eight health board areas and has been for many years and I accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister find it acceptable practice that the Midland Health Board should cancel medical cards for all long-stay patients admitted to designated hospitals and return these to them once they have been released from such hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  When patients are in long-stay residential care, their maintenance is provided and also their medical care.  It is not necessary for them to be in receipt of a medical card or, indeed, to have a medical card.  The boards, when deciding how much of the pension will be taken, make allowance for any commitments the patient might have, such as rent, mortgage, insurance premiums, hire purchase payments.  A reasonable amount, as I have already pointed out, is left to the person to meet his or her personal needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will clarify the variation in charges for geriatric care in different hospitals throughout the country and specifically in relation to the £50 weekly voluntary charge for respite services at Baggot Street Hospital, Dublin 2 by the Eastern Health Board; and if he has any proposals to standardise such charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before getting to the detail of my reply to the Deputy's question let me say, first of all that Baggot Street Hospital was planned for total closure before I took office.  Because of my concern for the community formerly served by the hospital I insisted that Baggot Street be retained as a community hospital to service the needs of the elderly in particular.</P>
      <P>Under the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1954 as amended by the Institutional Assistance Regulations, 1965, persons who are in receipt of institutional assistance in long-stay homes and who are in receipt of an income in money exceeding £1 per week may be required to contribute towards the cost of their maintenance from the day of their admission. Persons who otherwise have full eligibility may also be liable to make this contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed in any particular case, health boards have full regard to the person's circumstances.  Allowance is made for any commitments the person may have, for example, rent, mortgage, insurance premiums, hire purchase payments etc., and a reasonable amount is left to the person to meet their personal needs. Because of the wide variation in the circumstances of persons in receipt of institutional assistance, I do not consider that <Col N="240" /> it would be feasible to introduce standard charges.</P>
    <P>A small number of beds in Baggot Street Hospital are used as respite beds to accommodate elderly persons for a two week period.  These are elderly persons who are normally cared for at home.  The service exists to allow persons looking after elderly patients at home to take a holiday or other break and to be reassured that the elderly persons will be cared for in comfortable circumstances while they are away.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board encourage the families or carers of those patients to make a voluntary contribution of £50 a week towards the cost of maintenance. No actual bills are issued for this money and nobody is denied care due to inability to pay.  The board do not regard the charge as excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it grossly unfair that, depending on the part of the country in which the old age pensioner looks for care, there will be a different level of charges?  It is essentially unfair.  Will the Minister also agree that a voluntary charge is totally unfair in terms of not being clear cut and of putting undue pressure on some families who could not afford it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No. In this instance the voluntary charge is reasonable in so far as nobody is obliged to pay.  Accounts are not sent to those who do not pay.  In the retention of Baggot Street Hospital as a hospital providing a very high level of service for the elderly, the health board are justified in proposing this voluntary charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of women who died from cervical cancer in this country over the past five years is as follows: 1983, 57; 1984, 55; 1985, 70; 1986, 58; 1987, 65.</P>
      <P>Cervical screening is readily available to all women on request from their general practitioners and at family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and clinics organised by health boards.  In 1987, 165,000 smears were analysed, the majority of which were taken by general practitioners.  Smear tests are available free of charge to medical card holders and to women receiving services in respect of motherhood.</P>
      <P>The majority of smears taken in the Dublin area from public patients are analysed in St. Luke's Hospital.  Over the years there were delays in reporting results, but now, I am glad to say, results are available within one week.</P>
      <P>In January of this year I set up a working group to prepare detailed proposals on the further improvement of the cervical screening service throughout the country.  The working group recently submitted their report to me.  I intend to implement the recommendations of the working group and I am confident that screening service will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>Before you put the procedure, could you give the House some indication as to why you have come to that conclusion in the past half hour? Perhaps the House could adjourn, by agreement, to enable you and the Whips, the Minister and the Taoiseach to reflect on what exactly it is we are proposing to discuss.  Otherwise we cannot agree to the Order of Business as tabulated.</P>

      <P>For the advice of the House and in reply to Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Malley, as far as the Chair is concerned the motion in question &mdash; No. 8 &mdash; relates solely to the continuation of the operation on the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, after 14 December 1988.  The amendments proposed by Deputy Desmond's party and by Deputy O'Malley's party are not relevant to this motion as they do not confine themselves to the continuation of the operation of the Act. That is why they have been disallowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make the point that quite exceptional constitutional advice has been available to Deputy O'Malley and to the Leader of my party to the effect that it is not possible to amend the Act by way of motion and that accordingly the motion, which is supposed to be in order, is manifestly not in order and would be unconstitutional relative to the Act if passed tonight. Accordingly, before we get into any further confusion on this matter, I do not think the Taoiseach would demur, nor would the Leader of my party, if the House were to adjourn so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is done by way of introducing Standing Order 89 to cover the definition of groups.

      <P>Twelve months ago almost to the day this House passed the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1987.  The Bill then went to Seanad Éireann where it was passed without further amendment and was enacted on 14 December when it was signed by the President.  That Act is now to be considered by this House again today in accordance with section 7 (4). That section provides that the Act will expire on the day that is 12 months after the date of its passing unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas before that day declaring that it should continue in operation after that day.</P>

    <P>Extradition from this State is governed <Col N="380" /> by the Extradition Acts, 1965 to 1987. Our extradition law comprises three separate statutes: the Extradition Act, 1965, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 which was passed by Dáil Éireann in December 1986, and finally, the legislation promoted by this Government last December, namely the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>The Extradition Act, 1965, provides for the main substance of the special backing of warrants arrangements we operate with Britain and the North as well as giving effect to the European Convention on Extradition of 1957.  The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 gives effect to the convention of that name.  The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, contains the new safeguards which were introduced last December into our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North.  I will be detailing those safeguards shortly but first I want to clarify what the effect will be of the motion before the House today.</P>
    <P>Today's motion proposes to renew the safeguards contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  That is its only purpose and that will be its single effect. If the motion were not adopted, this would not mean that our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North would be suspended.  Those arrangements would remain because the Extradition Act, 1965 and the Extradition (European Convention of the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 would still be part of our law.  Those two Acts are not subject to renewal.  If today's motion were not passed, therefore, the effect would be that the 1965 Act and the Act which gave effect to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism would continue in force but without the additional safeguards provided in the 1987 Amendment Act.  These would cease to apply because rejection of the motion would mean that that Act would lapse in a week's time.  The motion today is about those safeguards and about those safeguards only.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned today, either, <Col N="381" /> with a general review of the operation of the extradition arrangements we have with Britain and the North.  Issues affecting the operation of those arrangements as a whole will be a matter for another day when we come to debate the report which the Government are required under section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 to make to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the operation of Part III of the 1965 Act.  That review of the operation of Part III in its entirety is a quite separate matter from the renewal of the 1987 Amendment Act which is what today's motion is about.</P>
    <P>I would also like to express the hope that our debate today will not be overshadowed by the events of recent days. It is inevitable that the case of Father Patrick Ryan will be in the forefront of our minds at the present time but it is important to keep it in perspective. Despite much of the heat that has been generated, this case refers to one individual only under the terms of the 1987 Act.  We should not lose sight of that fact. I want to confine my comments on that case to saying that this House may be assured that the full requirements of our law will be complied with in relation to it and that the relevant papers are being considered by the Attorney General at present.</P>
    <P>We in this House have been critical, and justifiably so, of comments which have been made elsewhere about this case &mdash; comments which were clearly unwarranted and unjustified.  I would earnestly hope that in our debate in this House we would not follow that course. I would ask for restraint in what may be said about individual cases.  That is the proper approach for us to take and the one that is in keeping with the legal process which is in train at the moment.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would also like to remind the House again of the content of section 7 (4) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  That section prohibits communications with the Attorney General and other specified persons for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision to give a direction under that Act &mdash; that is, of course, communications <Col N="382" /> other than the proper communication of information relevant to the giving of a direction.  I am confident that the spirit of that provision will be observed in the course of the debate here today.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the specific terms of the motion before the House.  In accordance with section 7 (4), the House is being asked to declare that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 shall continue in operation after 14 December. I am moving this motion because the concerns which prompted the Government to introduce the safeguards contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act continue to exist and because the Government are satisfied that the arrangements which give effect to these safeguards are being upheld and adhered to and are functioning satisfactorily.  I would suggest these are the issues which we should be addressing in the debate on this resolution today; how the safeguards which the Act provides have been functioning and whether they should be maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (4) represents the result of the deliberations of this House and I would like to remind the House of that. It has its origins in an assurance which I gave to the House in my opening statement in the debate on the legislation a year ago.  Stating that public opinion would wish to be assured that extradition worked fairly and properly and that the new arrangements which the Bill was proposing to provide were upheld both in letter and spirit, I gave an undertaking that the new arrangements would be carefully monitored by the authorities here.</P>
    <P>That undertaking and a desire to give the Oireachtas some input into the monitoring process prompted the principal Opposition Party to table an amendment on Committee Stage along the lines of what is now contained in section 7 (4). The Government were happy to accept that suggestion in principle and was able to respond to it by bringing forward their own amendment on Report Stage. That amendment became section 7 (4) of the Act.  By virtue of that section, both Houses of the Oireachtas are given an <Col N="383" /> important role in the process of monitoring and review which I had indicated was the Government's intention.  That role is further reinforced by section 6 of the Act, to which I have already referred and which requires the Government to submit an annual report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation of our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North.  A report will be made in accordance with that section early in the new year.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the changes which the 1987 Act made to our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland.  The main purpose of that Act was to meet public concern which existed about extradition.  I am confident this House will acknowledge that such concern continues to exist.</P>
    <P>Extradition raises important questions to which public opinion is very sensitive. Public interest of this kind is by no means confined to this country and it tends to focus elsewhere on the same specific issues which have given rise to concern here.</P>
    <P>How then does the 1987 Act address those concerns?  First, the Act dealt with the concern that before a person is extradited there should be a means by which it is possible for the relevant authorities here to be satisfied that extradition is not taking place in an unreasonable way. What that means in practice is that it should be possible for the relevant authorities here to satisfy themselves that there is an intention to prosecute and that the person sought has a case to answer. That concern has been met in the Act.</P>
    <P>The important provisions for this purpose are sections 44A and 44B which section 2 of the 1987 Act inserted into Part III of the 1965 Act.  Section 44A provides that a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of an offence shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs.  Section 44B provides that the Attorney General shall give a direction to the Commissioner not to endorse a warrant unless, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, he is of opinion, first, that there is a clear <Col N="384" /> intention to prosecute the person sought or to continue a prosecution of that person for the offence specified in the warrant and, second, that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  These provisions ensure that, where the evidence against the person sought has not been examined by a court in the requesting jurisdiction, the question of sufficiency of evidence is examined by the Attorney General here.  Thus it provides an important safeguard against arbitrary extradition or extradition for purposes which would not be recognised internationally as legitimate &mdash; such as questioning the person sought in order to obtain evidence to bring a charge.</P>
    <P>The 1987 Amendment Act also amended the 1965 Act so as to enable a person whose extradition is sought to apply to the High Court to have his extradition refused on a new ground additional to these on which such an application could already have been made.  That new ground is that by reason of the lapse of time since he is alleged to have committed the offence or been convicted of it and other exceptional circumstances it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite the person sought. This change is contained in section 2 (1) (b) of the Act.</P>
    <P>The background to this provision is that it was intended to meet a particular concern which had been expressed arising from the coming into force of the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act 1987.  That concern was related to the possibility that persons who might be sought in connection with incidents which had happened many years ago, and who would not have been extraditable except for the coming into force of that Act, would be unfairly prejudiced.  The provision which is made in the Act gives statutory expression to an approach the courts had already taken in this regard.  The provision does not make mere passage of time itself a ground for refusal of extradition by the High Court &mdash; there must also be particular circumstances which, <Col N="385" /> taken in conjuction with the lapse of time, make it unjust, oppressive or invidious to extradite the person.</P>
    <P>The third important safeguard which the Act provides for is contained in section 3.  This deals with the rule of specialty and restrictions on re-extradition of extradited persons.  What the section does is to empower the Minister for Justice, to provide by order for the application of various sections in Part II of the 1965 Act to extradition arrangements under Part III &mdash; that is, arrangements with the North and Britain.  The rule of specialty operates to protect persons against being charged, following their extradition, with offences which are not themselves extraditable.  The rule is not designed to prevent persons being charged with additional offences as such. It does ensure, however, that such charges may only be brought with the consent of the State which has granted extradition and enables that State to refuse to consent to charges being added for offences which would not themselves have been extraditable.  The relevant sections for these purposes in Part II of the 1965 Act are sections 20, 21 and 39.  Section 20 gives effect in the State to the rule of specialty for the purposes of extradition from the State while section 39 provides for the application of the same rule where a person has been surrendered to the State.  Section 21 of the Act imposes restrictions of a related kind on the right of a country to which a person has been extradited to re-extradite that person to a third country.</P>
    <P>Those then are the main safeguards which the 1987 Act created in our extradition law.  It is to the operation of those provisions that I now wish to turn my attention.</P>
    <P>The first and most important safeguard created by the Act is the one which relates to sufficiency of evidence.  Under the arrangements which apply since the coming into force of the 1987 Amendment Act, the Garda Commissioner refers all warrants which are received from Britain and the North to the Attorney General.  No action is taken by the Commissioner in respect of such a <Col N="386" /> warrant until he is informed that the Attorney General does not intend to issue a direction under section 44A or that the warrant does not come within the terms of that Act and that there is otherwise no legal impediment to the Commissioner's endorsing the warrant for execution here.</P>
    <P>In the case of warrants which come within the terms of the 1987 Amendment Act, the Attorney General must satisfy himself that there is an intention to prosecute the person sought and that that intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.  Arrangements to give effect to the provisions of the 1987 Act were the subject of discussions between the Attorney General and the British Attorney General and these are now implemented in all cases to which the 1987 Act applies.  Under these arrangements the British Attorney General provides the Attorney General with such information as the Attorney Genreal deems appropriate and necessary to enable him to discharge his statutory function.  Those arrangements have applied in all the cases to date which have been within the scope of the 1987 Amendment Act.  In no case has it yet been necessary for the Attorney General to issue a direction under section 44A.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the number of extradition applications received since the 1987 Act came into force, I should explain the distinction between warrants which come within the terms of the new procedures under section 44A and warrants which fall outside the scope of that new procedure.  The Attorney General's function under that section apply to warrants for the arrest of a person accused of an offence.  The section does not confer any function on him in relation to a warrant for an offence for which a person has been ordered by a judicial authority, following an examination of the evidence, to stand trial.  Thus, for example, a warrant which is received in respect of a person who has already been convicted of the offence in question does not come within the scope of this new procedure. In addition, for the new procedure to apply the warrant must be one which had <Col N="387" /> not been endorsed before the Act came into force, on 14 December 1987.</P>
    <P>Since that date warrants have been received in respect of 17 persons.  Of these, warrants in respect of four persons were recalled before there was an opportunity to establish whether the provisions of the 1987 Act applied.  In seven of the remaining 13 cases the warrant related to persons who had already been convicted and therefore these warrants fell outside the scope of the 1987 Act.  The Act does apply to the remaining six cases.</P>
    <P>In four of these cases the Attorney General informed the Garda Commissioner that he did not intend to issue a direction under section 44A and warrants in those cases were cleared for endorsement.  The papers are still under consideration in the remaining two cases.</P>
    <P>In the cases falling within the scope of the 1987 amendment Act where the warrants were endorsed, extradition proceedings were subsequently instituted in two cases.  In the first case the District Court ordered the return of the person concerned to Britain, and this was done. In the second case orders for the return of the person were refused by the District Court for reasons which had nothing to do with the 1987 Act and this decision is now the subject of an appeal by way of case stated to the High Court.  In the remaining two cases the warrants were subsequently withdrawn for reasons unconnected with the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>I also want to mention that in two cases warrants were furnished prior to the coming into operation of the Act but are now covered by it because they were not endorsed.  The reason they were not endorsed was that the persons concerned were wanted for and were charged with offences in this jurisdication.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to emphasise that in regard to all cases in which warrants were withdrawn they have been withdrawn for reasons unconnected with the 1987 Act.  These have included the arrest of the person sought in the requesting jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other safeguards, I am not aware of any person having yet <Col N="388" /> relied on the provision relating to lapse of time and other exceptional circumstances in any court proceedings.  The concern that motivated that particular amendment has not, therefore, arisen in practice to date.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has yet to make an order under section 3 applying the rule of specialty and similar safeguards on re-extradition to our arrangements with Britain and the North. Discussions are continuing with the British Government at official level in regard to the means to give effect to that section. In the meantime, administrative arrangements which ensure that the rule of specialty is observed in our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The statistics I outlined a moment ago demonstrate that the procedures which the 1987 Act provides are working.  There is no question of them having acted as an obstacle to extradition in legitimate cases.  The important point to be taken from those statistics is that in all the cases to date in which the Attorney General has been required to form a view under the 1987 amendment Act and in which he has formed a view, it has been possible for the British authorities to satisfy him of the matters required by the Act.</P>
    <P>The Government do not accept the view expressed by the British Prime Minister last Saturday after the meeting of EC Heads of Government in Rhodes to the effect that the new procedures are not working properly.  Such a view seems to be based very largely on the British Government's perception of one extradition application which has recently been received and on which the Attorney General has yet to make his decision. Indeed, the kind of comment on individual cases that we have seen in sections of the British press and heard from some speakers in the House of Commons demonstrates the need to have safeguards in the extradition process.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to report annually to the Oireachtas under section 6 on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the 1965 Act as a whole. This will mean that our entire extradition <Col N="389" /> arrangements with the North and Britain, including the procedures provided for in the 1987 Act, will be subject to regular monitoring by the Government and full account will be taken of ongoing experience of how these arrangements operate. Any views which the British Government may put to us about the operation of the arrangements will also be considered as part of that review process.</P>
    <P>If after more experience of the working of the arrangements provided for in the 1987 Act it becomes clear that they are not working satisfactorily, either to safeguard the rights of persons wanted for extradition or to ensure that there are not unjustifiable obstacles in the way of extradition, remedial action will be taken by way of amending legislation.  This is in accordance with the assurances I gave to the Dáil this time last year.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the motion adopted here today should provide for the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, being subject to a further review in 12 months time.  That is simply not possible under the terms of section 7 (4) of the Act itself.  The only kind of resolution which that provision allows for is a resolution declaring that the Act should continue in operation after 14 December next.</P>
    <P>A resolution which would seek to make the continued operation of the Act after 14 December subject to a further resolution a year from now would be <i>ultra vires</i> section 7 (4).  You cannot amend an Act of the Oireachtas by way of a motion. The Attorney General has advised accordingly.  We are very strongly advised that the effect of the passing of an <i>ultra vires</i> motion would be that the Act and the safeguards contained in it would lapse.  Let us all be clear about what would happen.  It is not that the operation of the 1987 Act would be postponed for 12 months or anything of that kind.  In fact, the 1987 Act and the safeguards therein would disappear out of our law.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the amendment tabled by the Leader of the Labour Party but which was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  It is <Col N="390" /> implicit that the report procedure provided for in the 1987 amendment Act would cover the points mentioned in the first part of the Deputy's amendment.  It would have been wrong, however, at this stage, to pre-empt the action the Government and the Dáil might decide to take in the event that the safeguards were not operating satisfactorily, as it would depend in what respect this was happening. The introduction of a formal <i>prima facie</i> requirement would almost certainly require a derogation from the European Convention on Extradition, to which we have been party for over 20 years.</P>
    <P>Extradition is an accepted instrument in the fight against serious crime and international terrorism.  It is an important legal weapon in that fight and this State, in common with civilised states generally has assumed international obligations in the matter of extradition.  However, public acceptance and support is essential if extradition is to operate effectively. Our extradition procedures will only command the necessary public support and confidence if they are subject to reasonable safeguards.  That was the balance which the Government sought to strike in bringing forward the safeguards contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Bill 12 months ago.  That was the balance which the Dáil and the other House struck in passing that Bill.</P>
    <P>Our experience of the operation of our extradition arrangements with the neighbouring jurisdictions in the past year has confirmed that approach.  That is why the Government remain firmly of the view that the safeguards provided in the Act continue to be necessary and should be renewed.  The 1987 amendment Act served to re-inforce our extradition arrangements by addressing very real public concerns.  It is important, therefore, that those safeguards are maintained and the Act renewed.</P>
    <P>Extradition is not, of course, the only means of legal co-operation available for dealing with fugitive offenders.  Under existing Irish and UK legislation, there is another method by which persons who are alleged to have committed serious <Col N="391" /> crimes in one jurisdiction in Ireland and who are found in the other jurisdiction can be brought to trial.  That is the extra-territorial method whereby, under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and the UK Criminal Jurisdiction Act, 1975, the courts in either part of Ireland have jurisdiction to try persons for certain serious offences committed in the other part.  Both Governments are committed to the use of that legislation in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>The record of prosecutions under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, in such cases is impressive.  Of 13 persons tried in this State under the Act, ten were convicted in respect of such charges as murder, firearms and explosives offences.  Nine out of ten persons tried in Northern Ireland under the parallel UK legislation have also been convicted.  The most recent prosecution in Northern Ireland resulted in the conviction earlier this year of a number of persons for offences arising from the fire bombing of shops in Dublin in 1987.  Deputies will also be aware that a prosecution under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act has been initiated recently in this jurisdiction. The Government believe that greater use should be made of that legislation in future and that by invoking its provisions in appropriate cases it will be possible to find an appropriate way of tackling the common problem of the fugitive offender.</P>
    <P>The objective of international legal co-operation in criminal matters is to fight crime and terrorism, which have an increasingly international dimension to them because of greater ease of present day travel and communication.  We must do what we can to protect our own people and our neighbours in the wider international community against the suffering caused by international crime and terrorism. At the same time, the rights and liberties of suspected persons must be safeguarded.  The adoption of the motion before the House today will ensure that the balance between these two desirable objectives is maintained.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Col N="392" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To insert the following words after `operation' &ldquo;for a further period of twelve months&rdquo;; and to add to the Motion &ldquo;unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas before the 14th December, 1989 declaring that it shall continue in operation after that day&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to what the Taoiseach said about our amendment, but I am not convinced by his argument. If this House agrees with the wording of our amendment, and if subsequently the courts find that that law can no longer remain in existence, there is nothing to stop the Government immediately introducing a short piece of legislation extending the safeguards of that Act.  I can give the Taoiseach a guarantee that if the new legislation is in accordance with what is already in the Act, we on this side of the House will be prepared to let it go through without debate.  Therefore, the argument as to whether our amendment is legally in order can be very quickly dealt with if the courts subsequently so decide.  I ask my colleagues on the Opposition benches not to be put off by the warning we have been given because, in the space of half an hour, we can pass legislation to correct the situation.</P>
      <P>I would like to put on record straight away the reasons I am moving this amendment, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, which has the effect of extending the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, for a further period of 12 months.  I have no intention of trying to make political capital at a very sensitive time in Anglo-Irish relations, and particularly after the hysterical outbursts of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, and other British politicians.  The atmosphere has been further polluted by the way in which some of the British press have been covering cases involving Irish people who are, or it is intended will be, accused of terrorist offences, whether extradition is involved or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coverage given to the present <Col N="393" /> Patrick Ryan case by some sections of the British media is one aspect of a broader problem.  Some of the British media appear to be consciously exploiting the fact that in the eyes of the English courts Patrick Ryan is not an accused person, and therefore the laws of contempt do not apply.</P>
    <P>But in other cases where the laws of contempt did apply, the law officers did not see fit to cite for contempt any of the persons responsible for this outrageous and biased coverage.  When will the English authorities realise that the more instances there are of this type the less likely it is that we can normalise extradition procedures between the two countries. The more these hysterical campaigns are conducted in Britain, the less likely it is that the issue can be depoliticised. One of the tests of any legal system is that it ensures that not only is justice done but it is seen to be done.  If an accused person is not guaranteed a fair trial by a jury whose minds have not been clouded by prior publicity, justice is not done nor can it be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>The reason for today's important debate arises out of a Fine Gael amendment, which was accepted by the Government, which had the effect of restricting the life of this legislation to a period of 12 months, unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas declaring that it shall comtinue in operation. We said at the time that it is inappropriate to place any Attorney General in a judicial role, as this legislation does, particularly as he is appointed by the Taoiseach of the day and is perceived by the public as a political figure.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that Article 30.1. of the Constitution provides that there will be an Attorney General &ldquo;who shall be the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion,&rdquo;.  I am also aware that it is generally accepted that in the discharge of his legal and discretionary duties the Attorney General is completely divorced from party political considerations and from any kind of political control.</P>
    <P>I fully support these principles, and long may they remain.  That is why steps <Col N="394" /> taken by any Government should not endanger these principles.  It was for these reasons that we proposed back in December 1987 that instead of involving the Attorney General in the day-to-day process of dealing with extradition warrants, it would be more appropriate if the Director of Public Prosecutions took on this role.  Nothing has happened since the passing of this legislation to suggest that the opinion we held 12 months ago should have changed.  In fact, circumstances surrounding the recent Patrick Ryan case would appear to vindicate what we said on this side of the House 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The day after the warrant was received from Britain we saw on our television screens pictures of a demonstration held by members of the anti-extradition group outside the home of the Attorney General. We received reports of comments from some of the British media &mdash; and indeed some British politicians &mdash; stating that there is not the political will to deal with extradition requests from Britain and castigating the Attorney General for delaying his decision on the case, as if he was not in any way required by the provisions of the 1987 Act to proceed in a particular manner.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, the perception is still abroad, because of the involvement of the Attorney General in the day-to-day handling of extradition cases, that the political will of the Government will decide the issue.  I am not suggesting that that is the case, but what I am saying is that is the public perception, certainly in Britain and to some extent here.  Would the same things have happened if it was the DPP or a judge who was involved in assessing whether there is sufficient evidence to found an intention to prosecute?  The answer must clearly be `no'.</P>
    <P>If the Attorney General is expected to continue in this role, ways must be found to ensure that he is allowed to carry out his duties in accordance with the law without being subjected to continuous pressures, whether they come from Britain, Northern Ireland or here.  We cannot say it often enough so that some day it might get through to people who <Col N="395" /> think otherwise, that the Attorney General, and he alone, is obliged by law to decide whether there is sufficient evidence to found an intention to prosecute.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that in accordance with section 4 of the 1987 Act, it is unlawful to communicate with the Attorney General for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision as required by the provisions of the Act. On this point, and referring again to the Patrick Ryan case, I am extremely concerned at reports in various Irish Sunday newspapers published on 27 November which would suggest that briefings were given by a Government source indicating that the Irish Attorney General would refuse this extradition request on the grounds of insufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Tribune,</i> for example, the following statement appeared in an article by that paper's political correspondent:</P>
    <P>But Irish Government sources are sceptical of the chances that the extradition will be granted, in view of the vague charges of conspiracy which the British applied to Belgium.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> we find the following:</P>
    <P>According to senior Government sources last night, it could take `some days' to get the Attorney General's ruling.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Sunday Press</i> we find an abundance of statements attributed to Government sources.  The headline on the front page of <i>The Sunday Press</i> reads: &ldquo;AG to block British bid on Father Ryan.&rdquo;  In the same article we read:</P>
    <P>... The indications in Dublin last night were that the Irish Attorney General will refuse the request.</P>
    <P>Further on, we read:</P>
    <P>... On the evidence available to date the British request for Ryan's extradition is likely to fail at the first hurdle.</P>
    <P>Still further on, we read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> However, the issue is unlikely to come to Court because under the safeguards written into the Extradition Act last year, the Attorney General has first to be satisfied that there is a real basis for the extradition of an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>Finally, we read:</P>
    <P>However, if as appears likely the Attorney General refuses the extradition request...</P>
    <P>There is abundant evidence here that, during the course of that weekend, what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;Government sources&rdquo; were prejudging the outcome of the Attorney General's examination of the case, even before the Attorney General could have had a proper opportunity of considering the matters that came before him.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Government now to explain how and why this happened.  In the absence of an explanation, we can only speculate that the ambivalence which has for so long been so apparent within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party on the whole issue of extradition may now have begun to infect the Government.  If this is not the case, the Government must now explain clearly why &ldquo;Government sources&rdquo; have so misled the media and set out clearly what action they propose to take, first to retrieve the situation and, second, to ensure that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>We have every reason to be extremely annoyed at the attitude of some of the British media, and indeed some British politicians, in the manner in which they have handled the Patrick Ryan case to date but there is every reason to be concerned also at the behaviour of some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, both inside and outside of Government, in what must be seen as attempts to influence the outcome of the Attorney General's deliberations. Only last Sunday evening on the television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;, a member of the Government party was giving his view in public as to what should be done in this case.  As the Taoiseach rightly said in his address, <Col N="397" /> section 6 of this Act makes it illegal to communicate with the Attorney General. It does not say, however, that you have to communicate with him by writing a letter: communication can be over the airwaves, or by way of Government sources making statements to the press.  There are various ways of communicating with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are not yet satisfied that the provisions contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 which cast the Attorney General in a particular role will not have the undesired effect of politicising that very important office.  I hope sincerely that that day never arrives and that after a further period of 12 months we can come into the House and say, &ldquo;Yes, we are satisfied that the Attorney General can do his job without interference from anybody.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another reason for seeking the 12 months' extension of this Act is that it has not yet been established to our satisfaction that the procedures now to be followed under the provisions of the 1987 Act have operated or will operate in an effective manner.  The reply given by the Minister for Justice on 23 November 1988 to a parliamentary question indicates that warrants have been received in respect of five persons to whom the provisions of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, apply.  One of those persons has been returned to Britain in accordance with an order of the District Court made under section 47 of the 1965 Act.  In addition warrants in respect of a further six persons were received and subsequently recalled by the requesting authorities. The 1987 Act provisions applied to two of these cases and the warrants in respect of the remaining four were recalled before there was an opportunity to establish whether the provisions of the 1987 Act applied.  As we are all aware, section 6 of the 1987 Act obliges the Government to make an annual report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the 1965 Act.  As this debate comes before the expiry of the 12 month period, it is not possible, therefore, for the Government <Col N="398" /> to make such a report, that is to make the report before this debate.  We feel, therefore, that before making a final decision whether this Act should continue in operation we should at least have had an opportunity of examining the Government's first report on the operation of this Act and of questioning the reasons why only one person has been extradited under the provisions of the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>It is important that I put on the record of this House what the Minister for Justice said in reply to the Second Stage debate on this Bill in December 1987, and I quote from the Official Report, 1 December 1987, volume 376, column 357:</P>
    <P>...it would not be acceptable if we were to impose a requirement in our extradition law which would have the effect of causing considerable expense and delay in extradition proceedings and would result in the failure of legitimate requests...</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House share the Minister's sentiments and, given the fact that this Act has not had a fair period to be judged, I think it only right and proper that we postpone our final decision until this time 12 months.</P>
    <P>Another fear which we expressed 12 months ago and which we still hold is that we have not been satisfied that the manner in which the Attorney General makes his decisions under the Act will not in itself become the subject of judicial scrutiny involving highly undesirable consequences from a security standpoint. This is a matter of real concern to us and again I feel that allowing a further period of 12 months to elapse could tell us a great deal in relation to this.</P>
    <P>At this point in my contribution I would like to put on record the following points: (1) Fine Gael support the need for extradition with built-in safeguards in order to protect the principle that accused persons are innocent until proven guilty, (2) Fine Gael wish to co-operate with other civilised states in the fight against terrorism and regard extradition as an essential part of that process; <Col N="399" /> (3) in our anxiety to provide adequate and proper safeguards no unreasonable obstacles should be placed in the way of extradition; and (4) as a matter of general principle it must be accepted that persons accused of offences should be tried in the place where the offence has been alleged to have been committed.</P>
    <P>The basic principles I have outlined are very much in accord with the views expressed by the Minister for Justice in reply to the Second Stage debate on this Bill back in December 1987.  To illustrate this I would like to quote from what the Minister said on that occasion.  I quote from column 349 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>The Government are anxious that the new requirement should not act as an obstacle to legitimate extradition requests.</P>
    <P>Here is another quote from column 345:</P>
    <P>Our concern in drafting the provisions governing the issues of sufficiency of evidence and specialty has been to respond to the legitimate concern of many responsible people in this country that our extradition arrangements should protect the rights of the accused to the greatest possible extent. We wanted to do this without at the same time undermining the principle that those against whom there is a well-founded serious charge to answer should, where possible, come before the courts of the country in which the alleged offence occurred.</P>
    <P>While reiterating our concern that the extradition arrangements between here and Great Britain must have built-in safeguards which adhere to the principle that accused persons are innocent until proven guilty, we should never forget the loss of life, the sadness and heartbreak caused to so many families Catholic and Protestant, the damage to our economy and the divisions caused on this island by the activities of the IRA, Loyalist paramilitaries and other subversive groups over the past 20 years in particular. The bombings at Enniskillen and other atrocities bring home to us the need <Col N="400" /> for a combined effort by all civilised states in their fight against terrorism, that is, it is esential that all necessary steps be taken to defeat the men of violence whether they come from the IRA or Loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>It is true to say there is a great deal of public disquiet and, indeed, public disagreement between the British and Irish Governments over the handling of the present Patrick Ryan case but when all this dies away the reality is that both Governments must find a way of working together to ensure that the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement are working to the full.  With this in mind I would like to put a suggestion to our Government that they might consider and take up through the Anglo-Irish Conference at the first available opportunity.  We have in this country a Special Criminal Court where three judges sit without a jury. I have heard no public disquiet being expressed about the manner in which this court goes about its business.  I would like to suggest that the British consider introducing a similar court in Britain to deal with the same type of offences as the Special Criminal Court deals with.  The same, of course, would apply to Northern Ireland.  If this was to happen I feel it would eliminate many of the fears being expressed by many Irish people of moderate disposition who feel that under the present circumstances it is difficult for any Irish person coming before a British jury to get a fair trial.</P>
    <P>The problems surrounding extradition could also be discussed at European level.  After all it is 31 years since the European Convention on Extradition was drafted.  Many things have changed in that period and Europe as a whole faces the many problems associated with the escalation of terrorist activities.  Perhaps we could even consider the involvement of a European court in the extradition process.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like to ask the Minister for Justice to clarify the position with regard to the issue of provisional warrants under certain conditions as provided for under section 49 of the 1965 Act.  The central condition is that a <Col N="401" /> member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector must be in a position to swear he has reason to believe that a warrant has been issued by a judicial authority for the arrest of a person accused or convicted of an indictable offence but that the warrant is not yet in his possession.  Where such a warrant is issued the person requested may be remanded either in custody or on bail for not more than three days.  There have been suggestions in recent days that this provisional warrant procedure can no longer apply given the function of the Attorney General under the terms of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987. This seems somewhat improbable. Under the terms of the 1965 Act the person can be held for up to three days. That does not in any way prejudice the person's right to go before a court nor does it in any way limit the freedom of the court to make a decision on the case as presented to it.</P>
    <P>It seems that by extension the same would apply even where the Attorney General is carrying out the functions assigned to him by the 1987 Act.  Where a difference does arise is in relation to the time available to the Attorney General to satisfy himself under the provisions of the 1987 Act.  There could well be cases in which an interval of three days is not sufficient but where the urgency required in order to justify a provisional warrant could well be held to exist.  It seems to me, therefore, that there is need to re-examine the provisions governing the application for the issuing of provisional warrants in the light of the statutory function now given to the Attorney General under the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would ask the Minister for Justice to state whether in the Patrick Ryan case a request was received from the British authorities for the issue of a provisional warrant.  It is necessary to clear up this point in order to allay fears that the Irish authorities were not prepared to co-operate in this regard.  I await with interest the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>That completes the major part of my contribution to this debate.  I did not have <Col N="402" /> an opportunity to examine the Taoiseach's contribution in detail.  Speakers after me, including the spokesman on foreign affairs and the Leader of the party will no doubt have the opportunity of examining in detail the various points made by the Taoiseach in his address, particularly in relation to the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act which seems to be gaining momentum at the moment despite it being convenient for people to ignore the fact that the main provisions of that Act apply solely to Northern Ireland and that there is now a general belief that the simplest thing to do would be to use this Act instead of extradition.  That will be difficult in relation to some offences committed in Britain.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I appeal to all members on the Opposition benches to consider the points I have made here this afternooon.  I hope they will be accepted as constructive and positive and that Deputies will see the need for a continuation of this Act for a further trial period of 12 months.  If at the end of that period all of the points that are still left unanswered can be answered by the Government of the day, we can think again.  In the meantime, it would be foolish and unwise to allow this to become a permanent feature of our law without having had an opportunity to see if these provisions work in a proper fashion, and an opportunity to see if extradition can be continued with proper safeguards ensuring that only people who have a case to answer are extraditied and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the charge.  We could also use that period in trying to rebuild a constructive relationship with our neighbours across the Irish Sea because, when all the hullabaloo is over we have to work together and people living in Northern Ireland are depending on us as responsible politicians to try to bring an end to their misery.  I am not entitled, either as a member of a political party nor as an individual, to do anything that would destroy the possibility of bringing an end to that misery. If constructive proposals are produced that will help to resolve those problems we in Fine Gael will not take the short term political advantage of opposing for <Col N="403" /> the sake of opposition.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will see extradition operating properly with safeguards and a positive, constructive approach from both Governments to working the Anglo-Irish Agreement and trying to find a solution to the extradition problem so that Irish people will get a fair trial if they have to face a British jury.</P>
    <P>That said, there are ways and means to find solutions if the resolve is there. The Anglo-Irish Conference is the ideal means for seeking those changes.  I sincerely hope the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice will use that vehicle to try to bring an end to the present impasse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On page 4 of his script this afternoon the Taoiseach said that the matter we should be addressing the debate on this resolution today is how the safeguards which the Act of 1987 provides have been functioning and whether they should be maintained.  I agree fully with him that that is precisely what we should be doing; but it is almost impossible to discuss how the safeguards which the Act provides have been functioning and whether they should be maintained for the simple reason that the Act has scarcely come into use at all.  The Taoiseach mentioned that we had 17 or so extradition cases in the past year, but in his speech he confirms what I already suspected, that only one person to whom this Act applies has in fact been extradited in the past 12 months and that person did not challenge any aspect of the Act and was not a terrorist.  His extradition was not being sought for any terrorist type offence but for some ordinary straightforward criminal offence whereby the man was accused of stealing a sum of money.  When the District Court made an order against him and informed him of his rights to go to the High Court he said that he was not interested in all of that but wanted to go back to England as soon as he could and signed a document foregoing all his various rights.  The result is that this Act of 1987 which we <Col N="404" /> are seeking to extend today has never in fact been argued before the High Court. No decision has been made in relation to any aspect of it before the High Court. Worse than that, unfortunately, no point that arises under the Act has even been argued before the High Court.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Taoiseach's invitation, while it is a valid one, is not valid in practice because we have nothing to discuss. We know as much about the legal effects of the 1987 Act as we knew when we were discussing it at length here one year ago.  There were a lot of views expressed then about different aspects of it which might or might not be constitutional or workable.  We know no more about it today because apart from this one non-terrorist type who agreed to his own extradition, nobody has been extradited under the terms of the Act.</P>
      <P>The ideal therefore would be, because nothing has happened in a year, to take another year to see these matters argued and decided on by the superior courts here who have not even heard an argument about them yet; but we cannot do that.  That was the thought that struck me a week ago when I heard about this motion.  I thought we should put down an amendment to have it extended for another year or two to see how it works and then we would be in a position to made an assessment as to whether it should be retained or allowed to drop but on looking as section 7 (4) I saw one could not do that.  One either had to let it drop and go out of effect on 14 December or one had to keep it indefinitely; there was no halfway house. Anyone who reads the Act with half an eye in his head will see that.</P>
      <P>It is a bit misleading, to put it at its most charitable, for Fine Gael to put down this amendment that they know is futile, which they know cannot have any effect and which is a direct negative.  They would be more honest, if they want to propose a direct negative, to say so and vote against the motion.  They are trying to give one impression on the one hand and another on the other.</P>

      <P>The amendment may be in order so far as the rules of this House are concerned but it is not in order so far as the law is concerned and that has been made abundantly clear.  Anyone who went to the trouble of inquiring about it would find that that was so. Given the major difficulty that we have, that we are supposed to be reviewing something after one year of its operation when, in fact, it has not operated at all and has never been argued or decided on, we are therefore, back in the same position as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make some general remarks about extradition and I will return to the Bill later.  Extradition for terrorist type offences has always been a problem in western Europe.  Many states, such as France and most of the countries in Europe, will not extradite their own nationals for any purpose.  The United Kingdom happens to be the only European country to whom we are prepared to extradite our own nationals.  That is a matter that, perhaps, the British should think about.  It is also a matter that we should think about because I do not think it is fully realised here.  I was in some doubt about this and I was trying to check all the Treaties.  Within the last two hours I was fortunate enough to get a draft of the new orders ratifying all the treaties which are being brought forward tomorrow in another debate on extradition under the auspices of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I checked the very long order relating to Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965, and I did not find anything in it to say that any one of the long list of European countries with whom we have extradition arrangements under Part II has a corresponding agreement with us to extradite nationals as between ourselves and themselves.  Section 14 of the Extradition Act, 1965, makes it quite clear that we cannot extradite our own nationals to a Part II country unless the extradition treaty with that country so provides.  In <Col N="406" /> none of them, so far as I can see, is it so provided within Europe.</P>
    <P>There are only two countries, apart from Britain with whom we have no treaty at all but with whom we have corresponding laws, where we are obliged, if the courts so decide, to extradite our own nationals, and they are the United States of America and Australia.  In both of those we have negotiated treaties in the last three or four years.  Unfortunately, one of them, although it was ratified by the House, has been found to be invalid and must be re-ratified tomorrow. Many treaties that the House ratified have been found to be invalid again. Is it any wonder that some people outside of our shores become a little exasperated with extradition?  Is it any wonder, indeed, that people within these shores become exasperated with it and the way it seems to operate?  Is it any wonder that we have had all the copious errors that seem to be made on both sides of the Irish Sea in relation to different aspects of extradition.</P>
    <P>It is because the UK happens to be the only European country to whom we are prepared to extradite our own nationals that it is only right that at least some of the safeguards which apply to Part II countries, that is countries other than Britain, should apply to extradition to the United Kingdom also, particularly in the light of the experience of the last year or two and, perhaps, most especially in the light of some of the comments that were made within the last week or so.  At the same time, I have to say that I am profoundly unhappy about the particular type of safeguard that is contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  I am unhappy for all the reasons that I, and my colleagues, detailed at length just one year ago.  We do not know whether our concern was correctly based in law or not because no case has been decided, or even argued, on the Act before a court.  That is an indication of the ponderous nature of extradition here.</P>
    <P>The major difficulties with extradition relate to, (1) safeguards; (2) disparity of standards within the various legal systems and (3) the fear that certain types of <Col N="407" /> person will not receive a fair trial in other countries.  The rules which obtain in Britain in relation to matters such as (a) powers of arrest; (b) right to bail; (c) the reception of illegally obtained evidence and (d) the operation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule, all differ fundamentally from the principles to which we are accustomed in corresponding matters here.  For example, bail is practically unheard of in extradition cases in Britain and it is not specifically provided for in extradition cases under their Bail Act, 1976.  Here, a person before the courts on an extradition warrant has a constitutional right to bail unless it can be shown that he will abscond or interfere with witnesses.</P>
    <P>In Gilliland's case in 1985 the Supreme Court confirmed that these constitutional principles apply just as much to extradition cases as to persons charged with ordinary or non-extraditable crimes. Therefore, a person awaiting extradition has the same right to bail as anybody else charged with an offence.  The exclusionary rule, such as serves to exclude evidence obtained by unconstitutional or illegal means, has been abolished for all practical purposes by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, in Britain. Yet, this principle is regularly applied by the Irish courts and by all indications, it will continue indefinitely to be applied. For example, in Trimbole in 1985, the Supreme Court held that the wrongful arrest of the applicant, in order to ensure that he would be &ldquo;available&rdquo; when fresh extradition warrants arrived from the Australian authorities, invalidated the entire extradition procedure, as Trimbole's constitutional rights had been deliberately and illegally infringed.  This would never happen in the English courts.  Indeed, I can give a recent example, in Regina <i>v.</i> the Plymouth Justices, <i>ex parte</i> Driver (1985), when the English courts, faced with a similar set of facts to those that pertained in the Trimbole case here, expressly rejected the idea that a false arrest, or other deliberate illegality, could prevent the court from ordering the extradition of the person named in the warrant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Much of the acrimony and wrangling over extradition matters seems to stem from this clash of legal cultures; individual civil liberties do not seem to carry the same weight with the British judiciary as they do here.  Irish judges are less indentifiably part of what one might call, &ldquo;the establishment&rdquo; than their British counterparts.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom has been found guilty of breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, on 19 separate occasions.  There record is by far the worst of any member state within the Council of Europe.  We were found guilty on three occasions, Airey in 1979 in regard to the provision of legal aid; Johnston in 1986 in connection with the law on illegitimacy and Norris in 1988 in connection with the law on homosexuality. On the other hand, we have allowed open access to our citizens to the court at Strasbourg since 1953, and were the very first state to do so.  We have been doing this for 12 years longer than the British.</P>
    <P>In connection with the attitude of Britain to the European Convention on Human Rights and the judgments of the European Court, one cannot but be profoundly concerned at what was reported in today's newspapers on the apparent decision of the British Government to defy a judgment last week of the European court in regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the length of time a person can be detained without trial.  I understand that some announcement is to be made in London this afternoon in relation to that.</P>
    <P>If the newspaper reports and the BBC reports to the effect that Britain is going to defy the judgment of the court the order of the court, and, therefore, the Convention on Human Rights are correct, whatever reservations I have about the technicalities of safeguards &mdash; I see the need for them in practical terms &mdash; Britain has only itself to blame for driving a lot of moderate people, who have no more time for the contemptible IRA than I have, into an area of doubt and concern, even where the rights of people like that <Col N="409" /> are concerned, and anxiety that no unconvicted person should be exposed to some of the difficulties that they might well be faced with in a trial in that jurisdiction. My fears in this regard will be underlined if this morning's reports prove to be correct.  All of this tends to argue in favour of a new idea to deal with the very real problem of terrorism.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind ourselves of what it is like and what the effects of it are.  Sometimes we are almost inured to horrors and we forget very rapidly about them.  This time last year what we were conscious of and, perhaps, very much influenced by, were the kidnap and mutilation of Mr. John O'Grady by Irish so-called patriots, the murder of 11 innocent people praying at a memorial service in Enniskillen for the dead who had saved this country and many others in western Europe from, perhaps, the greatest scourge that Europe has known in the twentieth century.  We were also conscious of the <i>Eksund</i> where there were several hundred tonnes of very modern weapons destined for this country in order to inflict death and suffering on people in this island.  If you go back a couple of years to a similar period of the year, in 1983, Mr. Don Tidey was kidnapped and seriously ill treated.  In connection with his rescue Garda Sheehan and Private Kelly were murdered by these keepers of the Fenian flame.</P>

      <P>One suggestion, therefore, because of the international quality of terrorism nowadays, that is worth exploring, is that of a new community criminal court based at Luxembourg. Some of the details of this court would or might include non-jury court composed of senior permanent judges drawn from the Judiciary in each member <Col N="410" /> state.  It would be bound by the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would try a limited type of case; for example, only terrorism cases with an international dimension and serious drug cases with a similar element of trans-national activity.  The national courts would have no jurisdiction to interfere with the workings of the court.  There could be a community code of criminal procedure prescribing rules on topics such as bail, sentencing policy and rules of evidence, etc.  There should be a right of appeal to, I suggest, the present European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  It seems to me that this is a logical next step in the development of Europe after 1992, an appropriate community response to international crime in a diminishing world with disappearing borders.</P>
      <P>The court should be given power to determine where the sentence imposed should be served.  I would envisage that normally it would be in the defendant's home country.  It is, I suggest, a practical way of dealing with international terrorism and drug trading and yet avoids the difficulties&mdash;the obvious, continuous and ongoing difficulties &mdash; that are presented by extradition for this country, for Britain and indeed for many others. The idea is well worth considering deeply.  It would, of course, involve an amendment to the Treaty of Rome by way of an additional treaty and it would require a constitutional amendment in this jurisdiction because, unfortunately, the opportunity was not grasped at the time of the Crotty case to have a more blanket amendment at that time.  It is not unthinkable.  There is a common interest in all the states of the European Community in trying to deal with terrorism and with international drug trading and trafficking.  To my mind it is an obvious follow on to 1992.  This is the sort of area in which the Community should now develop rather than confining itself solely to economic matters, as has been the case for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the foolish and counter productive comments made by the British Prime Minister recently, the British have, however, in my opinion, <Col N="411" /> justifiable complaints in respect of at least two matters relating to extradition here. The first is delay.  It is notorious that the processing of extradition cases here takes a long time.  The very fact that we are debating this Act today, one year after it has been passed and that there has not been a single case that has been argued before a court arising out of it is proof of that fact.  Given that justice may be evaded by people wanted for extradition jumping bail, it is imperative that such cases be heard speedily.  The following list of four cases illustrates this point I am making.  In the Russell case it took four and a quarter years before this man was finally extradited this summer.  He was arrested on an extradition warrant in this jurisdiction in May 1984.  He was finally extradited in August 1988.  This is unquestionably far too long.  In the case of Kane, a Maze escaper who was arrested on an extradition warrant in December 1987, his appeal has still not been heard by the High Court.  Administratively this is not good enough.  The third case is that of Carron.  He was arrested almost 12 months ago and is thus similar to Kane in that this case has not yet even begun to be heard in the High Court.  The fourth case is that of McVeigh in respect of whom the case stated still has not been heard by the High Court. This was where the District Justice in Portlaoise held last June that there was not positive identification of McVeigh.  In a subsequent Dáil debate, on 28 June 1988, the Minister for Justice promised a quick case stated on this point to the High Court but the case has still not been heard.  McVeigh is at large.</P>
    <P>The only real way around these difficulties would be to amend the 1965 Extradition Act to ensure that the District Court was by-passed in this sort of case.  Such cases should commence in the High Court, where all the relevant matters can be addressed &mdash; and where they will end up in any case &mdash; and from whose decisions there is a further appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>To substitute the Circuit Court for the District Court, as suggested in a motion <Col N="412" /> earlier this year by Fine Gael, would only amount to a cosmetic change and would not deal with the issue of delay.  In fact, because the Circuit Court does not sit as regularly as the District Court it might well increase the factor of delay which is already at an unacceptable level.</P>
    <P>The second point where I think there is justifiable concern on the part of those waiting for people to be extradited is the requirement in our law, in the 1965 Act, for departure from a specified place in the State.  The provisions of section 47 of the 1965 Act which require the District Court to nominate a particular place for the hand over of the extraditee have caused difficulty.  This means that attempts to obstruct the hand-over can be organised.  If this provision were simplified it would mean that an extraditee could be handed over in the most convenient fashion which, nowadays, would always be by helicopter from anywhere at all within the State and not from a specific place where so many difficulties arise.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has been confirmed in the Taoiseach's speech here today is that no order was made by the Minister for Justice under section 3 (4) relating to the rule of specialty in people being extradited to the United Kingdom under Part III.  This may sound unimportant but he gave all kinds of assurances when this Act was being put through here last year.  In fact, the Taoiseach read it out today as one of the three major safeguards within the Act but it has never been operated.  What this means is that if we extradite somebody under the European Convention the country which takes him cannot charge him with anything other than the offences on which he was extradited.  That rule does not apply to Britain or Northern Ireland who are free to charge someone extradited from here with an extra offence, which may have nothing to do with the charge on which he was extradited.  It seems that a compelling case can be made to have that rule made.</P>
    <P>In section 3 of this Act the Minister for Justice is empowered to do so but he has not done so.  It is not enough to say that <Col N="413" /> it will be done sometime in the future or that we are talking to the British about it.  This was put forward as one of the guarantees but it is a guarantee which has not operated.  I wonder if those who were promised that safeguard last year and accepted that it was going to be operated are aware of this fact?  No explanation as to why it has not been operated has been given.</P>
    <P>Yesterday and again last night I read the debate which took place on this Act last year.  Sometimes it can be interesting to read a debate with a year's hindsight, although not very useful in this case for the simple reason that the law has not been clarified, but at least it is easier to see the arguments which were made in a slightly cooler light than in the hurly-burly of debate here.  In that debate no one seemed to deny or disagree with, even though differing views were expressed on other matters, that the Attorney General's actions are open to judicial review and because they are I think that remains the greatest weakness in this Act which we are making indefinite today.  In the case Daly <i>v.</i> the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Justice Barron held in relation to the powers of the Minister which are exactly the same powers the Attorney General has in a matter of this kind and I refer to the Irish Law Reports Monthly Vol. 8, No. 3, that such powers may only be exercised in accordance with the Constitution, that the courts must ensure that the material upon which the Minister acts is capable of supporting his decision and since the Minister had failed to disclose the material upon which he acted or the reasons for his actions there was no material from which the court could determine whether or not such material was capable of supporting his decision.  Accordingly, his decision was set aside.  Unless the Attorney General is prepared to produce all the documentation on which he based his view, under section 44a, the courts can set it aside.  While there was disagreement from Deputy Kelly and many others on the question as to whether the Attorney General's actions constituted the exercise of a judicial function, I could not find <Col N="414" /> anyone who disagreed with the view that the Attorney General's actions were open to judicial review.  This is going to lead to chaos.</P>
    <P>There are various other points that one would like to make.  It is entirely unsatisfactory that we have to make this fundamental decision about it here and now. I am unhappy about it.  I am as unhappy about it as I was last year but, frankly, when I see this relating to Part III of the 1965 Act, and therefore, to the United Kingdom, I find it very hard to stand up in this House on the very day that country says it will repudiate the European Convention on Human Rights and say that some form of safeguard, however second best I might see it, is not needed.  I cannot say it is not needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the decision to be made here tonight is a relatively simple one.  Because of the construction of the 1987 Act, it boils down to a simple choice, we either vote to preserve the safeguards that are in the law, inappropriate as they might be, or we vote to remove them.  A vote against this motion would have the effect, however, of forcing the Government immediately to set about the task of putting adequate and proper safeguards in place of the existing ones.</P>
      <P>There are many of us in this House who believe that the safeguards in the law as at present framed are inadequate and inappropriate.  It is for that reason that I tabled the addendum which I very much regret has been ruled out of order.  I have to say, in relation to that addendum, that I simply cannot understand the reasoning which disallowed it and which allowed an amendment which is clearly improper in so far as it attempts to amend the legislation.  I suggest that it is in the interests of the Office of the Ceann Comhairle that a mechanism be put in place to allow him to explain the reasoning behind a decision of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as our addendum is concerned, the reason it was put forward is that there is a provision in the existing law which compels the Government to place before us a report on the operation <Col N="415" /> of extradition between this country and Britain in 1988 and that report must come before us early next January.  As things stand, in so far as politically-motivated offences are concerned, that report will deal with a number of warrants issued under the 1965 Act and only one issued under the 1987 Act, which may or may not have been dealt with by the time the report is laid before us.  It may point out that a certain proportion of warrants were implemented and persons extradited on foot of them.  It may point out that others were not effective in securing extradition, perhaps because of decisions made in the courts or for other reasons. It might run to no more than a page, littered with a few statistics.</P>
    <P>It will almost certainly not contain any value judgments.  It is extremely unlikely that the Government will express any view in that report which will enable the House to make a judgment about either the effective operation of the Act or the safeguarding of human rights under the Act.  If the addendum we placed in front of the House had been allowed that situation would change.</P>
    <P>It would mean that, effectively, instead of a bland and statistical annual report we would be presented in future with a more detailed annual review in which the Government's views would be contained, and we would be in a position to assess much more accurately whether or not there is a need for new or different safeguards and to act on that assessment.</P>
    <P>It is not open to us tonight, whether we want to or not, to amend the existing legislation.  To attempt to do so in the context of a motion would clearly be out of order, but it is open to us to make sure that the Government's resolve is as firm as it needs to be in dealing with both sides of this question.  We should, in my view, take that step.  That is why the Labour Party will vote against both the amendment and the motion tonight.</P>
    <P>No doubt there will be some who will try to interpret that vote as a simplistic &ldquo;anti-extradition&rdquo; vote.  It is nothing of the kind.  Extradition is, of course, an issue that is bound up inextricably with <Col N="416" /> human liberty and with the right of the individual to fair treatment before the law, but it is also a mark of our sovereignty. We want to live as part of the community of nations.  We do not ever want to become a country that is seen as a haven for terrorism, a sort of Paraguay of western Europe.</P>
    <P>For as long as we wish to be part of that community, we must accept the obligation to extradite people charged with crimes in another jurisdiction.  No Member of this House would consciously offer shelter and security to those who perpetrated the Enniskillen massacre, or the Darkley killings, or any of a hundred other horrible atrocities.  For that reason, we must keep fixed in our minds that extradition is an essential component of the unremitting struggle to rid the world of people who use killing and maiming as weapons of persuasion.  If we forget that, we lose the right to call ourselves a democracy, because we will end up sheltering those who believe only in coercion.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary amount of misinformation surrounding this subject. All week long, my office &mdash; and I am sure this applies to many other Deputies &mdash; has been inundated with phone calls from people who declare themselves to be &ldquo;anti-extradition&rdquo; and who are urging us to vote against the motion tonight.  Some of these phone calls are part of an orchestrated campaign, of course, but many are genuine, sincere callers, who have come to the view that it is no longer possible to trust the extradition process.  They believe in all cases that if this motion is defeated tonight extradition will no longer be possible.</P>
    <P>Other callers have passed on the information that since the &ldquo;political offence&rdquo; exemption was removed extradition has become a weapon for attacking people simply for the things they believe in.  They appear not to know that it is still not possible to extradite someone if he or she can claim that the offence for which they are sought is a political offence as opposed to a terrorist one.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that even in the course of this debate some of these fallacies will be trotted out again.  There may even be <Col N="417" /> some Deputies who would like to vote against the motion because they are aware of the amount of misinformation and will, therefore, be perceived as being &ldquo;anti-extradition&rdquo; by voting for the removal of safeguards.  In relation to this issue, let us try to avoid that sort of cynicism and instead let us make the decision that is best for our country.</P>
    <P>For the record, let me restate these basic facts.  First, we are voting tonight on whether those safeguards which are already there should be retained or dropped. Second, our extradition law does not permit extradition on the grounds of political offences.  The law does now make a distinction between political and terrorist offences, and it is an important distinction but it is not accurate to imply, as the Anti-Extradition Committee do, that the political offence exemption has been removed from our law.  I have to say that this has been a very bad week for those of us who believe that extradition is an essential weapon in the armoury of international relations and in the fight against international terrorism.  This debate should be taking place in a cool, reasonable atmosphere which would enable us to assess logically whether we passed an effective and safe piece of legislation in 1987.  Instead it is taking place following a week of hysteria which has been whipped up by elements both within and without this country.</P>
    <P>While the debate goes on, the Attorney General, whom we entrusted with the task, is assessing whether enough evidence exists for him to give a direction that a warrant for the extradition of one individual should be endorsed.  Speaking a year ago in the debate on the Act we are now considering, Labour Party speakers warned of the dangers of entrusting the Attorney General with that task.  We did not do so because of any lack of confidence in the Attorney General's personal qualities.  We did so because we believed it was wrong and dangerous to entrust a judicial task of that sort to a politically-appointed officer, who holds a position which is essentially political in all other important respects.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the case which <Col N="418" /> the Attorney General is now studying is the first case under the 1987 Act &mdash; certainly the first case involving an individual charged with politically motivated crimes.  Yet even though it is the first such case, it is already easy to see that a fundamental mistake was made in assigning this task to the politically-appointed legal adviser to the Government.  Whatever decision he makes in this case will have far-reaching political ramifications. If the Attorney General decides to give a direction that the warrant should be executed, he could be unleashing a hurricane of political activity and protest that could do terrible damage to this country, at least in the short term.  If he decides not to give a direction, he could be ensuring that the possibility of securing progress towards peace and reconciliation on this island is set back for years.</P>
    <P>Whatever decision he makes &mdash; and he must make his decision based only on his consideration of the law, and nothing else &mdash; his is an unenviable position.  And what makes matters worse for him is that the position in which he finds himself is not of his own making.  The fault for this situation lies elsewhere.  In the first place, the fault for it lies in the blatant politicisation of the entire process.  We have reached a point in relation to Father Ryan where, in my view, he cannot safely be extradited.  His right to a fair trial in the British courts has been prejudiced beyond recall, most notably by the British Prime Minister, who has been unable to mention his name without using the word &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; in the same sentence and also by the British media, who have convicted him several times over.  It is not my place to pass judgment on his guilt or innocence, but I must express the view, since I believe it to be the case, that his rights&mdash; the rights he shares with every Member of this House and every citizen of this island &mdash; have been compromised to a point where they would not exist if he were extradicted to the British jurisdiction.  If he is to face trial, therefore, it must be in this jurisdiction.  That gives rise to a very peculiar situation which is not adequately provided for in the law.  It is entirely possible that the Attorney General, for <Col N="419" /> reasons other than the one I have outlined above, may decide not to direct the execution of the warrant against Father Ryan but it may well be the same Attorney General who prosecutes Father Ryan in an Irish Court.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second area of fault in this case and in the management of our extradition process.  The law as developed is bad law.  We made this case in the debate last year, and I am not going to repeat it here, but I do want to make a number of points that are relevant to the decision we have to make tonight.</P>
    <P>Our Attorney General may well come to the view, in his examination of the case against Father Ryan that there is a case to be answered.  But he may well come to the view also that the case cannot be fairly dealt with in a British court because of the circumstances of the past week and the continuing campaign in some sections of the British media.  Under the law of the land, even if he does hold the view that the man is not guaranteed fair treatment, he must seek to extradite him anyway.  This is both ludicrous and dangerous and it is compounded by the fact that the courts are also debarred from making any judgment as to the likelihood of a fair trial.  As long as the courts are satisfied that the offence is one recognised by Irish law, that is not covered by the political exemption, that there is an intention to prosecute, and that the relevant documentation is in order, they have no discretion.  The courts will not even have sight of the evidence which has been given to the Attorney General, nor can they inquire from him as to the basis for his decision.  In the final analysis, therefore, this entire process may well come down to the other safeguard which is built in to both the 1965 Act and the 1987 Act.  It is an important one even though it has been given very little attention in the media or by those who are concerned to see justice done in this case.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, after the process of extradition has been completed, the Minister for Justice has the power to set a prisoner free, if &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances, it would be unjust, <Col N="420" /> oppressive, or invidious to deliver him up&rdquo;.  It is possible, as I understand it, for that to happen and for the person concerned to then be charged with the same offences and tried in an Irish court. Clearly, if at the end of the day the Minister for Justice is of the view that any prisoner is unlikely to receive a fair trial, he can and must exercise his right to take this course.  If he does it in this case, it will have repercussions for our relations with Britain but no-one can fairly argue that the British Prime Minister has anyone to blame but herself.  The Belgian Government have already established the precedent which is open to us to follow.  What we, as legislators, have to do is to develop laws that will stand up to the most critical examination over time.  In my view the law we have fails that test.  If we are voting on this Act tonight, I would be voting against it, as I did a year ago.  And my conviction is stronger than ever that we need legislation in this area which removes the issue from being a political football to being one that makes effective extradition consistent with fair treatment, a routine matter for our courts.  There is no reason this should be particularly difficult.  In the United States, for instance, it is normal practice for trials to be moved from one jurisdiction to another if that is considered necessary to a fair trial.  In Britain, nobody is sent to trial on a serious charge unless the courts are first satisfied that there is a case to answer.  It is ironic to think that if Father Ryan had been arrested in England, the question of whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case against him would have been one of the first questions asked by the courts.</P>
    <P>At the end of our examination of all these issues, we must try to ensure that the law we develop is one that is capable of taking account of individual circumstances but is not a law dictated by the last controversy.  In order to do that, we need a fundamental review of the situation that now exists.  We need detailed analytical reports of what has happened in the operation of our law. We need to be able to test our opinions and even our prejudices against the facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> For that reason, I would like to conclude by calling on the Government to reject any demand from Britain for easier extradition.  They must also resist any pressure from within their own ranks to scrap extradition altogether.  Although I have argued that the 1987 Act does not strike the correct balance, our aim must be to improve that balance and not to let the pendulum swing too far in either direction.  What we need to do instead is to ensure that the legislation, and the record arising from that legislation, is constantly re-examined to ensure that the effective extradition, consistent with the need for fair treatment, is the result of our legislative efforts.  We have not yet arrived at that point and that is why we will be voting against this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by reminding Deputies what it is we are debating today.  This is not a debate about the current case of Father Patrick Ryan or any other specific case.  Indeed, it cannot be as it is not lawful to communicate with the Attorney General and other specified persons for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision in this or any other case.  All extradition cases must be dealt with on their own merits and on a legal basis.  If we have reason to be critical of emotional comment on extradition cases in Britain, we have all the more reason to conduct this debate &mdash; and indeed all debates on extradition &mdash; in a calm manner without commenting on the operation of the legal process until, of course, that process is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extradition is a sensitive matter in all countries.  People everywhere are concerned for the treatment of their nationals extradited to foreign jurisdictions. British people are not less concerned than others as the controversy over the Heysel case in Belgium demonstrated. One important point which has clearly emerged is that people in this country are now more aware that extradition is not simply an Anglo-Irish difficulty. It is a problem which occurs in relations between many other countries, <Col N="422" /> including the countries of the European Community.  What we all have to do is try to find ways of balancing that natural concern for our nationals with the vital effort to combat terrorism and serious crime which, increasingly, recognises no frontiers.</P>
    <P>This debate today is about the continuance or otherwise of the safeguards enacted last year in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  At that time the Government agreed to accept the view put forward in the House that the operation of the Act should be limited to one year after the date of its passing unless both Houses of the Oireachtas declared that it should continue in operation after that year.  The terms of the motion, therefore, call upon Dáil Éireann to declare that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 should continue in operation.  If the Dáil should decide that the Act should not continue in operation, the effect would be to leave extradition arrangements in place but without the safeguards contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Act of 1987 provides that a warrant from Britain or Northern Ireland for the arrest of a person accused of an offence shall not be endorsed if the Attorney General so directs.  The Act goes on to state that he shall give a direction not to endorse unless he is of the opinion, having considered such information as he deems appropriate, that there is a clear intention to prosecute and that such an intention is founded on the existence of sufficient evidence.</P>
    <P>The details of the procedures contained in the Act have been explained by the Taoiseach and it is not necessary for me to repeat them.  I would urge that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, which established the role of the Attorney General and a number of other procedures to which the Taoiseach has referred in the interests of providing safeguards that were considered necessary by the Dáil last December, should continue to be a feature of our extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> A number of points have been made in the debate about the courts and wider aspects of the extradition law.  These are points which the House will have an opportunity to discuss early next year when the Government make their report on all matters in the Extradition Act, 1965, Part III, which they are now obliged to do under legislation.  The debate today is separate from the wider aspects of extradition law.  Various other points can be debated at a later stage since this debate concerns only the safeguards in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Deputies will forgive me if I do not follow them on some of the points which have been raised because in my view they can be more legitimately raised when we come to review, as we are obliged to do, the whole operation of the Act.  The pertinent points made by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the appropriate courts in which extradition proceedings should be initiated can then be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We are debating today the safeguards we wrote into the legislation of last December and if we do not pass the Government motion to extend that Act, which was laid down for 12 months, the net effect will be to suspend the operation of the safeguards and leave us in the situation which obtained under the 1965 legislation.  The effect would be that the 1965 Act would operate the safeguards so desired by this House as a whole last December, which we are seeking to enshrine on a permanent basis.  Side by side with that, we can have the overall review of the extradition procedures in this House early next year.</P>

      <P>I am addressing myself to the kernel of the legislation we are renewing, the safeguard aspects we wrote into our amendment to the 1965 Extradition Act last year.  If not reviewed, these safeguards will lapse automatically, contrary to the will of the House expressed 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>The powers of Government in this State are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of the State established by the Constitution &mdash; the Oireachtas, the Executive and the courts. These powers of Government derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirement of the common good.  We are a parliamentary democracy holding regular and free elections.  There is no doubt that the will of the people is expressed in our elected Legislature, in the Taoiseach and his Government and in our independent judges who are duly appointed according to law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> I recall a passage of a judgment of the Supreme Court in the Robert Russell extradition case which goes as follows:</P>
    <P>Decisions as to the method by which the national territory shall be reintegrated are matters for the Government subject to the control of Dáil Éireann. The carrying out of these decisions is exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs or State established by the Constitution.  For a person or a group of persons to take over or to seek to take over the carrying out of a policy of reintegration decided upon by himself or themselves without the authority of those organs of State is to subvert the Constitution and to disrupt the function of Government.</P>
    <P>The Government operate under a parliamentary system of democracy of which we are very proud.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind ourselves of these basic realities in the light of the continuing problem of violence arising from the Northern situation.  It is we the Oireachtas who make our laws and it is we the Government who conduct national policy.</P>
    <P>I know that the efforts of our Government to tackle violence arising from the situation in Northern Ireland and, in co-operation with the British Government, to create conditions &mdash; and this is of central and crucial importance &mdash; which will bring it to an end, have the full support of this House and of the people.  These efforts are now supported by a legally binding international agreement in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in this House on the review of the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 16 November last, the Government made clear their commitment to help bring the appalling violence of the last 20 years to an end.  The Minister for Justice reminded us that security co-operation is about the saving of life and property and the maintenance of peace and order.  He set out the excellent record of the Garda in finding explosives, weapons and ammunition which are a threat to everyone on this island.  In carrying out this intensive successful <Col N="426" /> drive, they pre-empted and prevented further terrorist offences of an even greater magnitude.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told the House on 17 February this year that the resources we as a State have committed, and are committing, to the security area in general are in place because it is our judgment that they are necessary in the interest of all the people who live in this island.  We have put and retain these resources in position, despite their very heavy cost, because we believe that it is right and necessary to do so.  Our commitment in this area is given freely, in the common interest of society, North and South, to ensure that the forces of terrorism &mdash; whether domestic or of international origin &mdash; will not prevail.  The Taoiseach went on to say that he wanted to emphasise our determination and resolve to do everything within our power to defeat the men of violence and to maintain democracy and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>Having made this considerable commitment to combat violence on the ground, as it were, it would be strange if we were not to follow it up with an equal commitment to combat violence through the courts in accordance with the rule of law.  It is in this perspective that our extradition arrangements whether with Britain or other countries must be seen.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from listening to the Taoiseach that extradition has been in existence in its present form since 1965. Indeed it has been part of the legal machinery of this State since independence, and that is as it should be. Extradition is part of the normal machinery of legal co-operation against crime, whether ordinary or terrorist, among democratic states.  I mention ordinary crime because it is sometimes lost sight of in our debates on extradition.  International co-operation is just as much required against crimes such as kidnapping, hijacking and drug smuggling as it is against terrorism.  These are no &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; crimes.  Nor should we lose sight of the requests which our authorities make of other countries for the return of offenders who have fled our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Where it is right and proper, therefore, <Col N="427" /> a person who is accused of a serious offence should be made amenable to the judicial process.  The combined effect of the Attorney General's function under the Act we are considering today, and the function of the courts in determining whether a person should be deprived of his liberty, achieves a balance between the rights of the individual and the exigencies of the State which deserves support.</P>
    <P>I have said that we should complement the substantial effort we are making in the field of security co-operation with effective action in the courts against those accused of serious offences.  Extradition is one route which can be followed.  There is also the alternative of the procedure under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, and reciprocal British legislation under which the courts in either part of Ireland have jurisdiction to try persons for certain serious offences committed in the other part.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today detailed the record of this extra-territorial legislation which is worth repeating.  Only one case has failed under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act in our jurisdiction, resulting in the acquittal of three persons.  Thirteen persons in all have been tried and ten have been convicted in respect of charges which included murder, firearms and explosives offences.  Nine out of ten persons tried in Northern Ireland under the parallel legislation have also been convicted.</P>
    <P>Both Governments agree that there is scope for operation of the extra-territorial procedure and that the use of it should be considered in appropriate cases.  The two Attorneys General have been having discussions with a view to its practical application in such cases. Deputies will be aware that, very recently, a new prosecution was brought in this State under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, extradition has long existed as a mechanism for ensuring that the fugitive offender does not escape justice simply by fleeing from the jurisdiction in which he is alleged to have <Col N="428" /> committed an offence.  It is right and proper that extradition should continue and that it should be subject to reasonable and prudent safeguards including those provided for in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, ask the House to support the motion before it that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 should continue in operation.  The safeguards written into it will be a very prudent, legal mechanism for the protection of the individual faced with charges and the person will know that such charges must be scrutinised by the law officer of our State, the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party have already put on record outside the House last weekend that we intended to support the Government motion making permanent the safeguards to the 1965 and 1987 Extradition Acts.  We did so for a number of reasons.  We felt it was essential to give a clear signal to the public that there could be no ambivalence or second guessing in relation to the question of extradition, the need for extradition and, obviously, the need for safeguards in relation to how it operates.</P>
      <P>For whatever reason, there seems to be a fairly widespread belief outside the House that what we are discussing here today is whether we will have extradition at all.  Of course that is totally false but it is believed because there are quite a lot of people outside this House who, for their own reasons, distort the reality of what we are debating here.  Indeed, they distort many other things as well.  Nevertheless, it is important to make a clear statement and to put a stop to the bandwagon that was beginning to roll in relation to a particular case and the question of extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party position on extradition has been quite consistent during the debates on the two Extradition Acts to have gone through the Dáil in the past two years.  We have always argued that a State seeking the extradition of a person from this country should be required to establish in an Irish court a <i>prima facie</i> case against the person sought.  When the <Col N="429" /> Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act was going through the Dáil in December 1986 we tabled an amendment that extradition should be on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> case, but this was voted down by Fine Gael and Labour with the assistance of the casting vote of the then Ceann Comhairle. In December last we tabled a similar amendment to the 1987 Extradition Act, but this was blocked by Fianna Fáil. The whole sorry chapter of misfortunes and misunderstandings which have bedevilled extradition since then could have been avoided if those who now support the <i>prima facie</i> requirement had voted accordingly in 1986, and this House given the courts the responsibility for making a decision on extradition requests on the basis of a <i>prima facie</i> case against the person sought.</P>
    <P>We do not believe that the Attorney General is the ideal person to consider extradition requests.  I am not referring to the Attorney General in person but to his Office.  The Office of the Attorney General is a political appointment.  It would be clearly extremely difficult for the public whether it be Irish or British public, to believe that he could disregard the political implications of a decision to extradite.  By giving the courts the responsibility for making decisions on extradition requests, it would be the clearest possible statement that this country will treat extradition as a matter of law and not of political expediency.  The role of the Legislature should be to set out the broad legal framework within which extradition can take place and then leave the detailed operation of it to the judicial process.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has quite rightly criticised the manner in which individual extradition requests have been politicised by the British Prime Minister, and we in The Workers' Party have made this criticism also but the Taoiseach should realise that the most effective way in which to depoliticise extradition would be to transfer the functions now performed by the Attorney General to the courts.  By making it primarily a judicial function, the Dáil would be ensuring that <Col N="430" /> extradition was not abused for political purposes by either the British or Irish Governments.</P>
    <P>Our preference is still for a <i>prima facie</i> requirement, but we must accept that given the present attitude of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael this is not likely to be agreed to in the immediate future.  In this situation we are prepared to vote for the motion to renew the Act.  We do so because if the motion was not passed, it would mean that there would be no safeguards at all, and there is always the danger that in that situation the Fianna Fáil Government, under pressure from its ultra-Nationalist wing, would refuse to operate extradition at all.</P>
    <P>We had considered attempting to amend the Government motion to provide for a <i>prima facie</i> case but had been advised that it would not be in order.  We would have supported the Labour Party amendment had it been allowed, although, as framed we consider it an awkward way of approaching the problem. I make the point once again that the current problem would have been avoided had the Labour Party voted for a <i>prima facie</i> case in December 1986.  I point out also that we had a Private Members' Bill on this issue on the Order Paper for more than 12 months but have never been given time to have it discussed. I hope that those who have come round to supporting the <i>prima facie</i> position will now agree to time being allocated to discusss it at an appropriate time.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat unfortunate that this debate is taking place against the background of the emotional hype surrounding the Patrick Ryan extradition request.  National policy on extradition has to be decided on the basis of logic and reason and not on emotion.  If we are to see the defeat of terrorism in Britain and Ireland it is essential that there be an effective system of extradition which protects the rights of the innocent, while ensuring that those who have a case to answer are brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>The decision on the Patrick Ryan case must be made on the basis of our law, as decided by this House, and all other <Col N="431" /> considerations must be put aside.  In particular, there must be no surrender to the sort of blackmail contained in the reported threat from Mr. Ryan that he will go on hunger strike to the death rather than face extradition to Britain.  If he goes ahead with this threat he will be exercising his right to choose whether to live or die.  As elected representatives, it is up to us to remind people that the victims of the Provisional IRA in Northern Ireland and Britain are given no such choice.</P>
    <P>In expressing concern about the rights of persons whose extradition is sought from this country, we must not lose sight of the equally fundamental need to protect people from the Provos and the UVF who decide themselves on life and death for others; whose decisions are always made in secret; who act as judge, jury and executioner; whose verdict is always &ldquo;guilty&rdquo;, a verdict from which there is no appeal; and whose sentence is always to kill or maim their victims.  The Provos take no prisoners.  When you become a target for the Provisionals you will die or you will be maimed for life.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party share the widespread anger provoked in this country by the offensive comments of the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, arising from the Ryan extradition request.  It seems Mrs. Thatcher has little knowledge or indeed little interest in the attitude or feelings of Irish people.  Does she not appreciate the damage her provocative and unacceptable comments last week did in this country?  Does she not realise that the defeat of terrorism and the achievement of peace in Northern Ireland requires the co-operation and support of the people in both parts of Ireland, as well as those in Britain?  There must be people in the British Cabinet who understand the situation but is there nobody who can take her aside and tell her very firmly that her table-thumping, hectoring interventions into the affairs of this country are music to the ears of Gerry Adams and his followers, and that they totally undermine the position of those <Col N="432" /> in Ireland who are seeking effective, democratic ways of combating terrorism.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister now have a responsibility to try to cool the situation.  Their primary objective must be to secure peace in Northern Ireland and not simply to fuel the attitudes of their more extreme backbenchers, in the way in which we saw during the past week.  Early last week the headlines said `Thatcher slams Haughey' and the Tory backwoodsmen cheered. At the weekend the papers were saying `Haughey snubs Thatcher', and the Fianna Fáil backwoodsmen cheered.  In the meantime, the people of Northern Ireland continue to die at the hands of the paramilitaries.</P>
    <P>I share also the very deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which sections of the British media cover the background to extradition requests for Irish people, and particularly the way in which they attempt to convict such people in advance of any judicial hearing. I must emphasise here that I am talking about sections of the British media.  It has been put across in Ireland that because <i>The Sun</i> or other such rag carries a racist headline, all of the British people either read <i>The Sun</i> or believe implicitly in what it states or indeed that everybody in Britain supports Margaret Thatcher, which of course is not true.  We should retain a sense of balance in relation to the commonsense of the British people in regard to what Mrs. Thatcher or indeed the tabloid press in Britain may say.</P>
    <P>Indeed the almost racist way in which sections of the British media cover Irish affairs is a matter of great concern and should be raised by the Taoiseach with the British Government.  Article 2 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement provides that in certain cases the Irish Government can raise matters involving co-operative action in both parts of Ireland and possibly also in Britain.  The Irish Government should raise, through the Intergovernmental Conference, the matter of British media coverage of Irish affairs which is offensive to the vast majority of Irish people.  It should also be a matter of great shame to the National <Col N="433" /> Union of Journalists, who represent journalists in both Britain and Ireland, that so many of its members participate in this racist coverage which is clearly in breach of their own code of ethics.</P>
    <P>I believe the majority of people in Britain and Ireland recognise that extradition is a weapon that should be available to society in the battle against terrorism.  I am confident that the majority of people on both islands want a system of extradition which protects the innocent, while ensuring that those who have a case to answer are brought before the courts.  We must not allow legitimate concern about the rights of individuals whose extradition is sought to be used as a smokescreen by those who really believe that nobody should be extradited to Britain or Northern Ireland, irrespective of the crimes in which they may have participated, simply because they claim some historical mandate.</P>
    <P>I and The Workers' Party believe that we must bury once and for all the ambivalence within our society which tears us apart when we are faced by appeals to nationalism by those who carry out criminal acts like the massacre in Enniskillen or the slaughter of an unfortunate young 13-year old and her grandfather just a few days ago.  That is the reason we are supporting the motion put before the House today by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I find it odd that the Fine Gael Party have put down this amendment.  There is a need for this House to demonstrate clearly that there is no ambivalence in regard to the issues of extradition and/or terrorism.  I know that the Fine Gael Party do not have that ambivalence.  But there are signals going out to the effect that, in some way, this debate is about whether we should have extradition; whether the law, as it stands, protects or does not protect the innocent in relation to extradition.  I believe the Fine Gael amendment is sending the wrong signal to people who will use it for their purposes in order to indicate that there is division in this House in relation to the major issue of justice and peace in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity of contributing to this <Col N="435" /> debate.  I smiled while listening to some of the remarks made by Deputy Peter Barry in the course of the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record my congratulations to the Taoiseach on the way he handled the very difficult position that has obtained over the past two weeks caused by the very intemperate remarks on the part of the British Prime Minister and a number of her senior backbenchers who should have known better than make the remarks they did.  It would appear that, over the past week-end, the British Prime Minister mellowed to a certain extent, probably on the advice of some of the diplomats within her organisation.  She endeavoured to dictate to us on more than one occasion to introduce laws she regarded as fit.  As previous speakers have said, we are an independent, sovereign State and have an obligation to introduce whatever laws we see fit; we will not be dictated to by anybody.</P>
      <P>I was astounded by the public reaction engendered by those intemperate remarks, on the part of people who would not have any involvement in politics at all, who were aghast at them and the way in which they were made.  I agree with Deputy Blaney that the vast majority of Members of this House and of the people agree with the stance taken by the Taoiseach in regard to the Rhodes Summit and in the days immediately beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted also that the remarks made in the British Parliament politicised an extradition procedure which should not be politicised.  Indeed one British commentator referred to it as a partly <Col N="436" /> political procedure.  It may well be in Britain or in Belgium but, as far as I am concerned, it is not so here because section 7 (4) of the Extradition (Amendment) Act prohibits any communication with the Attorney General that might influence his decision in regard to any given case.  Therefore, I do not agree at all that extradition procedure could be deemed to be partly political; it is an entirely judicial process.</P>

      <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement was mentioned here earlier.  There is no doubt that the Anglo-Irish process has been damaged by the offensive remarks made.  It is unfortunate that those people in Britain chose to make the remarks they did given that there are procedures whereby such matters can be raised.</P>
      <P>I make no bones about the fact that I am a constitutional Republican.  I believe there will never be peace on this island until there is a united Ireland.  Equally I firmly believe that the only way in which that goal can be achieved is through peaceful means and that we, Republicans, have a duty not alone to the people in the 26 Counties but also to those in the Six Counties.  If that means we must introduce laws we might not introduce if peace prevailed on this island, then that is the reality; sometimes in such circumstances we may have to take decisions we might not take in more normal times.  Equally on account of that fact we may have to introduce legislation from time to time which might be deemed to be suppressive in normal times. Because times are not normal we are faced with the prospect of extradition. The position that obtained up to 1965 was that our Government were faced with the most simple form of extradition between this country, the North and England, a system of rendition under which an RUC Commissioner or a Commissioner in the police force in England would produce a warrant, the back of which would merely be signed by the Commissioner in the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> We were signatories to the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  Like every other State in Europe we had international obligations and decided to be signatories to that convention.  I might add that Britain were not signatories at that time and still have not ratified that convention.  Therefore, it ill behoves them to criticise us on our extradition procedures.  That Convention on Extradition had the effect of abolishing a <i>prima facie</i> requirement in extradition procedures. In 1957 there did not obtain the same problem on this island as obtains today or indeed has done over the past 20 years or so.  As a result of our being signatories to the European Convention on Extradition of 1957 we introduced and passed the Extradition Act, 1965.  Deputy Blaney will correct me if I am wrong but I think he was a member of the Government that introduced the 1965 Act.  Since then we have extradited somewhere in the region of 900 people to the Six Counties, most in respect of what might be termed to be non-political offences. There was contained in the provisions of the 1965 Extradition Act the political offence defence, the time-honoured defence which had originated from English common law.</P>
    <P>While in 1977 the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism was signed by a number of European countries we decided to ratify that convention in 1987 only.  People contend that that Convention did away with the political offence defence.  It did not; it restricted it to a number of offences, such as hijacking, hostage-taking, offences which I contend could never be regarded as political.  Had we not ratified the safeguarding legislation we would be reverting to a position in which there would be merely a backing of warrants or rendition. That would be very bad because there is the genuinely held fear in the Republic that people who are extradited to go before courts in Britain do not get a fair trial.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government introduced the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, <Col N="438" /> 1987, thereby ratifying the relevant Convention. Indeed they postponed the implementation of its provisions for a year.  Some people may contend that that postponement was a political ploy, they knowing full well that a Fianna Fáil Government would be in power by the time its provisions would fall to be implemented.  The excuse was given at that time that it was to enable reforms to take place in the Six Counties.  We all agree that those reforms did not take place over that period.  Unfortunately this Government were faced with the passing into law of the 1987 Act implementing the Convention on Terrorism which related merely to the backing of warrants.  No one in this House would agree with that.  We may disagree as to the type of safeguards we need but we are all agreed that there should be safeguards.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court had a very big hand in the whittling down of the political offence defence and they drew a distinction between genuine political activity and the barbarous acts committed on these two islands.  They took up the running in regard to terrorism and decided that they would whittle away the political offence defence.  Some people are saying that we should abolish the Amendment Act.  If we abolish the Amendment Act we are back to rendition. If we abolish both the Amendment Act and the original Act of 1987 we are back to the 1965 Act in conjuction with the Supreme Court decisions which do away with the political offence defence.  If we abolish all of the Extradition Acts including the 1965 Act, it would be still possible to extradite people under international law.  What we are doing is putting in safeguards.</P>
    <P>Some people have referred to the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  In view of the difficulty that has arisen over the last number of weeks and which will arise in future every time an extradition case comes up, we should make more use of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act.  When this was first mooted in 1973-74 a commission was set up to investigate extradition and extra-territorial legislation. <Col N="439" /> The commission comprised parties from the Republic and from Great Britain. The people from Great Britain favoured the amendment of extradition legislation and we found that there would be a constitutional problem under Article 29 of the Constitution in relation to the political offence.  The Supreme Court whittled away that defence so that in recent times the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act is a much better resort, as far as I am concerned, that extradition.  I fully appreciate that we have a system of extradition that we have to work as best we can.  The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act has been used successfully on quite a number of occasions as the Taoiseach and other Deputies have stated.  Unfortunately there is a reluctance particularly on the part of the RUC to use the procedure under that Act.  They are reluctant to come to the South to prosecute although any time they have come down the result has been excellent in that people who have been brought before the courts have been convicted.</P>
    <P>A lot of emotive talk has gone on in relation to a fair trial.  I was horrified not only by the comments of Mrs. Thatcher but by those of Ken Maginnis recently in a programme on RTE television.  Irish people have a genuine fear which is not helped by the statements made by Mrs. Thatcher, Ken Maginnis and others. There is no doubt that the picture they paint is very alarming for anyone who might be taken across the water or up to the Six Counties.  It may happen that when someone goes before a court in England he will get what is called a fair trial.  There may be no problem with the court case but there is a genuine fear and a genuine problem with the media hype that is built up around these cases.  It must affect jurors involved in those cases. When jurors read statements like &ldquo;Devil with the Dog Collar&rdquo; and see all the hype on the television regarding the security surrounding these trials there is no doubt that jurors are affected.  That is where the genuine fear of people in the Republic is well founded.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Just one other remark which is that there seems to be a constant intertwining between political and judicial decisions in Britain.  Take for instance the case in which Private Thain was released after a very short time. Other people charged with similar offences are languishing in jails.  In relation to the Stalker/Sampson affair political decisions were made in Britain not to prosecute.  This is where people have a genuine fear about the intertwining of political and judicial decisions in England.</P>

      <P>When the Tánaiste was speaking earlier in this debate he accused Fine Gael of being ambivalent.  I will come back to that, but first I would like a subsequent Government speaker to clarify if what the Tánaiste appeared to me to say is correct.  The Tánaiste appeared to me to say that the Fine Gael interpretation of our motion is incorrect. The Chair has ruled that it is in order and so we have put it down.  The Tánaiste appeared then to say that the right to debate all of this was when we came to the review under the 1986/1987 Amendment Act early in the New Year.  Does the Tánaiste mean by that that we will have the opportunity to debate the Bill and amendments to the Bill early in the New Year or will we have just a debate and a report submitted under section 44 of the Amendment Act by the Attorney General? If the Tánaiste means the latter then his interpretation of the Fine Gael position would equally apply to that report and would not allow this House to enter a time limit into how long the 1987 Act and the Attorney General's involvement in the process of extradition should last.  But if the Tánaiste means the former then we are talking about something totally different.  If the Tánaiste means that we are going to debate the whole Bill and redebate the amendment Act of 1987 and amendments to it that is quite different from saying that we were just going to debate the report.  The Tánaiste then <Col N="441" /> gave the impression that a timescale for the Attorney General's involvement in the Act could be redebated at that time. I would like the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs or some other speaker on the Government side to clarify that position.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste also accused Fine Gael of being ambivalent.  Without being pompous, I can say that there is no party in this House other than ours more entitled to say that they are absolutely unambiguous and unambivalent about terrorism.  We have been engaged in the fight against terrorism, in all its forms, for the past seven years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern referred to remarks I made on BBC television over the week-end. It is true I was critical of what happened in the British House of Commons, but I backed this Government.  I am not one of those who attacks the Irish Government outside this country.  I leave that to the Leader and Deputy Leader of Deputy Ahern's party.  They are the only two politicians I know who did not back the Government of the day who deliberately went out of their way to attack the Government outside this jurisdiction. When this House had passed the Anglo-Irish Agreement Deputy Haughey and Deputy Lenihan went to America and tried to persuade the American Administration and the Friends of Ireland not to give us any support, and if possible to damage the agreement.  They were the only Members of this House I have known to do that.  When I speak outside this country I will continue to back the Government of the day and the legislation passed by this House.  The Deputy need not worry about me in that regard, but I would advise him to have some words with members of his own party about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress and improvement in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland was, and remains, one of the primary concerns of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  The determination of our Government to pursue genuine progress in this regard cannot be considered in isolation from the renewal of the Extradition Act.  On the occasion of the signing <Col N="442" /> of the Anglo-Irish Agreement at Hillsborough three years ago Deputy Garret FitzGerald, then Taoiseach, indicated the Government's intention to accede to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  The impetus for this undertaking was a commitment entered into by the Irish and British Government to work together to achieve early progress in relation to certain matters of mutual concern in Northern Ireland, that was, bringing about peace and stability, increasing confidence in the administration of justice and improving the relationship between the two communities, particularly the Nationalist community and the security forces there.</P>
    <P>It was against that background that we agreed to sign the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and introduced the Extradition Act, 1986, the Extradition Act, 1987 and the amendment to that Act which was debated here, and got the support of Fine Gael on the undertaking that we would have an opportunity to look at it 12 months later to see how it was working and, if necessary, to continue the process.  It is because we are not satisfied that we have the material to assess if it has been working over the past 12 months that we have put down our amendment to this motion. As Deputy O'Malley said, there has been only one case completed under that Act, and since that person volunteered to go back the Act was hardly necessary.  The other case, that relating to Father Ryan, is going through at the moment.</P>
    <P>To my mind this House has nothing to debate, even though the Taoiseach said, and the Tánaiste repeated it, that we are assessing the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, that has operated over the past 12 months.  We cannot do that because there has not been any case heard under it.  We feel another year or two is necessary before we can properly assess whether these safeguards are working or if they were necessary in the first place.  As I said, that is why our amendment is before the House.</P>
    <P>Almost everybody who spoke here <Col N="443" /> today said it was regrettable that the British Prime Minister's recent remarks displayed not just a lack of sensitivity but clearly signalled her lack of understanding of the problems faced by any Irish Government working extradition arrangement with the United Kingdom. The terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the sprit in which it was negotiated and the political will which produced the Agreement, all signified a shared understanding of the problems facing both our countries in the fight against terrorism, but the events of the past week seem to indicate that this shared understanding and common objective has been set aside.</P>
    <P>If the British Prime Minister was concerned about Anglo-Irish relations, it was a pity she did not use the machinery of the Conference to bring them to the attention of the Taoiseach, or through her Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to the attention of the Tánaiste, who is the joint chairman of the Conference, or use the Secretariat in Belfast. Instead, she used the floor of the House of Commons.  The British gutter press, the tabloids, took up the baying and, with the Prime Minister, proceeded to act as judge and jury in this very sensitive case which should be decided under the process of our law and not through any hysteria worked up by the British media and contributed to by a number of British backbenchers who are unthinking and certainly uneducated in Irish law.</P>
    <P>The Agreement provides the mechanism where the Irish and British Governments communicate in a constructive and effective manner.  It is a matter of great regret that the British chose to ignore that machinery on this occasion &mdash; and &ldquo;regret&rdquo; is far too weak a word to use in that regard.  The emotive statements of the past week would have been more properly expressed in the confines of the joint Conference, through the Secretariat in Belfast or through the British Ambassador in Dublin.  By making the House of Commons and the newspapers a battleground, the British <Col N="444" /> Prime Minister has done a great disservice to the people of both islands.</P>
    <P>Damage may not have been done to the politicians involved.  We are pragmatic. We have to get over these things. We are used to disagreeing with our counterparts in other countries or across the floor of the House, but we still have to work together.  The same applies to the people who work the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  After the Prime Minister's remarks in the House of Commons I imagine the Secretariat in Belfast had to sit down and solve other problems, had to put aside what had been enunciated by the British Prime Minister in London and start working together in a constructive manner.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of damage has been done, as was shown by the level of public opinion on both sides of the Irish Sea &mdash; and that is demonstrated by what is happening outside this House today &mdash; and by the headlines of some of the cheaper British papers.  Deputy De Rossa made a good point when he said not all the press in Britain or all the British people are anti-Irish.  We should always try to maintain a balance and remember that.  There were a number of leading articles in the papers yesterday and today which had a much more constructive attitude towards this country.</P>
    <P>No politician or official can operate in a vacuum.  We all depend on public opinion, and public opinion on both sides of the Irish Sea can be affected by the attitudes adopted by the leaders in the other country.  Therefore, British public opinion can seem intolerant of things Irish if the British leaders adopt an anti-Irish attitude.  Likewise, we should be very careful not to join the anti-British, or Brit-bashing lobby which is frequently a substitute for some form of Anglo-Irish politics here.  We should avoid that.  It is not just the damage done to politicians or officials.  We have to get over these things.</P>
    <P>I understand that a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference scheduled for tomorrow has now been postponed, but I think the meeting could have gone ahead. <Col N="445" /> After the initial chilliness, the two chairmen would have settled down to do the necessary constructive business that needs to be done by the Anglo-Irish Conference and which has been so neglected by this Government during the past two years.</P>

      <P>The British Prime Minister's remarks have damaged people's perceptions in both jurisdictions about the machinery of Government.  I think it is unfortunate that the debate on the renewal of this legislation takes place against this background.  The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, enabled Ireland to ratify the European Convention on the suppression of Terrorism. That Convention provides the basis for a common approach between member states of the Council of Europe to the question of what constitutes a political offence for the purpose of extradition and mutual assistance.  The offences in question include hijacking of aircraft, kidnappings, taking hostages and offences involving the use of bombs, or automatic firearms, if that use endangers persons.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with concern the report entitled &ldquo;The Development of community and Social Services in Tallaght&rdquo;, published by the Tallaght Welfare Society in May 1988 and circulated to each party in the Dáil.  Dáil Éireann notes also that if all existing development plans are completed, Tallaght will soon have a population roughly the same as that of Cork City; and that the headlong, unplanned growth of the greater Dublin South West area has taken place without the provision of the basic amenities &mdash; or even social services &mdash; taken for granted in established urban areas of a similar size.  Having regard to the particular needs of Tallaght, and bearing in mind that the problems of Tallaght represent a microcosm of disadvantage throughout the country, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish a special programme to address and resolve these problems.  In particular, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;establish a single authority, to include representation by the people of Tallaght, to oversee and control the continued development of the area, with the ultimate aim of establishing a seperate local authority for Tallaght;</P>
      <P>&mdash;designate Tallaght as a high-priority area for industrial investment purposes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;give absolute priority to the completion of the Hospital in Tallaght and the development of other necessary health facilities, including services for the elderly and physically handicapped;</P>
      <P>&mdash;proceed with the building of the Regional Technical College in Tallaght;</P>
      <P>&mdash;examine ways and means of building, as soon as practicable, a rapid rail link from Tallaght to the city centre;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" />&mdash;allocate the necessary resources for the establishment of essential social and recreational projects; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;ensure that adequate family support and community development services are available in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion before the House this evening people may wonder why we, the Labour Party, are using our Private Members' time to move a specific motion directed at a particular area.  I think the reasons speak for themselves.  There are many areas throughout the country to which we could direct our attention, but I believe, as the motion states, that Tallaght is a microcosm of the problems facing new urban developments in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recent reports, particularly the report commissioned by the Combat Poverty Agency from the ESRI, have highlighted the enormous scale of poverty in our society.  This debate is timely and is particularly welcome tonight because it allows us to focus on one huge element of that problem.  Although the motion before the House deals specifically with the problems of poverty and underdevelopment as they manifest themselves in Tallaght, I believe it will become clear to the Members of this House that there are many lessons to be learned from the experience in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>In my remarks, I intend to confine myself to some of the more general aspects of the problem.  Other Labour Party speakers will deal with aspects of the problem that are more specific to Tallaght and to Dublin south west.  I certainly will be making the case that Tallaght is a problem area but it is a problem that we, the legislators, the planners and indeed governments have created down through the years.  The people of Tallaght have not created the problem and do not have to accept responsibility for it.</P>
    <P>The population of Tallaght is now the third largest in one centre in the country after the city of Dublin and of Cork. There are many people there working on a daily basis at the unenviable task of building a community in Tallaght.  It is <Col N="448" /> now well recognised that they are beset with problems but also that they are equipped with determination and spirit to overcome them.  It is in recognition of that determination and that spirit that we have the opportunity here tonight of bringing their difficulties and plight before this House.  They not only deserve to have their difficulties debated in this House, and indeed considered, but to have a response from the Government.  I would like to think that by 8.30 p.m. tomorrow evening when it comes to voting on this motion the people of Tallaght who are trying despite enormous odds to improve their position, to bring about a community spirit and to work towards building support and structures within their community will not only have the understanding and ear of Members of this House but will have universal support from all the parties in this House who will be prepared to provide solutions and some hope for the people of Tallaght in facing up to and overcoming their problems.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it may well be that there are Members of the House who wonder if there are not other areas equally deserving of the House's attention. Indeed, I think it would be reasonable to say there are other areas in the country equally deserving because as we all now know &mdash; if we did not know before the recent ESRI report &mdash; the absolute level of poverty and disadvantage that has risen over the past two years.  There are other areas where we could focus our attention, but I believe that Tallaght is deserving of special mention.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is that Tallaght has been allowed to develop in a very unstructured, unco-ordinated and unplanned manner.  For many years past, Governments have been aware of the difficulties facing the community in Tallaght.  The housebuilding programme continued without an adequate infrastructure.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; has been misused in recent years without getting down to spelling out what it means.  If we were looking for an area which showed <Col N="449" /> the greatest inadequacies in infrastructure, we could perhaps pick on Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is perhaps disadvantaged by reason of its proximity to the city of Dublin.  There seems to be an impression abroad that because of its proximity to Dublin, Tallaght has access to the infrastructure and facilities of the city and, therefore, does not need these in its own right.  Unfortunately, the totally opposite is the case.  Because of its proximity to Dublin, Tallaght has not been allowed to develop, as it now has to develop, as a town, as a community and perhaps as a city in its own right.</P>
    <P>The absolute level of poverty and disadvantage has risen over the past two years and much of it has been caused by the confidence trick perpetated by the Government and often encapsulated in the headline used by Government Ministers on a day-to-day basis, that confidence is returning to the economy.  That headline always catches my eye because, just as we can focus on any other area in relation to this debate, I say I represent one of the most economically depressed regions in the country.  From local experience and local knowledge I would question the use of that expression that confidence is returning to the economy, and I have difficulty in understanding the basis on which this declaration is made. Looking around in the city of Dublin at present we see shops boarded up, houses becoming derelict and parks overgrown and deserted.  I know from personal experience and from correspondence I have received that thousands of families in the city of Dublin and the country are living on the poverty line, and this has been confirmed in recent weeks consequent on surveys that have been done. Thousands of families have lost one or more of their young people on the emigration trail.  These features added together do not give me to understand that confidence is returning to the economy, that confidence is out there waiting for investment.  Certainly I do not see it as confidence and I cannot agree with the statements by Government Ministers made on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> Perhaps I am looking in the wrong places and perhaps my experience is not consistent with this headline.  Perhaps I am reading the wrong newspapers.  Some of the other newspaper headlines might create a very different impression, that all is well.  Some of the headlines like &ldquo;Cement-Roadstone Raises Pre-Tax Profits to £45 million&rdquo;,&ldquo;Hibernian Shows 41.5 per cent Increase in 1986 Profits&rdquo;, &ldquo;Jacobs Increase Pre-Tax Profits and Dividends&rdquo; and perhaps headlines relating to the profitability of the banking sector could lead one to conclude that all is well, all is rosy in the garden.  Yes, profits seem to be rolling into these sectors or, to be more precise, they are rolling out of these sectors.  I believe the money is going out of Ireland and into more profitable investments abroad.</P>
    <P>When will the benefits of these headlines filter down to the people we here in this House represent?  When is the growth in profits going to be reflected in job creation?  When is all this wealth going to benefit those dependent on social welfare? The truth is that left to themselves the politicians in this House who are now total prisoners of the right will see to it that none of the filtering down ever happens.  The figures shows wealth in certain areas and increasing poverty in others.  They show that, although there is a great boom in exports, the numbers on the unemployment lists begin to grow.  In short, the figures show an increasingly divided society.  The Labour Party have tried to bring this point home again and again.  Every day we highlight the cuts that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats are collaborating in, but each time there are strong attempts to paint out the real picture, to emphasise the confidence instead of the pain, the profits instead of the cutbacks.  That is why I say &ldquo;confidence trick&rdquo; is a more appropriate expression than &ldquo;confidence&rdquo;. We are being allowed to see only the rosy side of the picture.  The division, the alienation and despair throughout the country are being hidden from us or there is an attempt to hide them.</P>
    <P>Much of the inspiration for this motion <Col N="451" /> came from the Tallaght Welfare Society who have drawn up a comprehensive blueprint for the development of support facilities and basic social and infrastructural needs for their area.  They together with Tallaght Community Council, Tallaght working co-operatives and others have already demonstrated in detail a comprehensive understanding of the needs of their area.  They have shown a commitment to the concept of a balanced and integrated approach to development involving voluntary and community interests together with the statutory agencies and the private sector. They have shown a capacity to lead and manage which ought to be built on.</P>
    <P>The first and best way to build on that commitment is to adopt the first specific item in the proposals before this House. We have proposed the creation of a single authority to oversee the development of Tallaght.  We believe they should be a democratically elected authority with a status at least equal to that of a county council to challenge the ideas and commitment of the people of Tallaght into the resolution of their own problems.  The first steps in that direction were taken by the last Government in their proposals for local government reform and they should be developed now in the interests of the people of that area.</P>
    <P>We have heard on numerous occasions that a major review of local government is on the way.  If that is true the Minister for the Environment should take this opportunity to establish a local authority for Tallaght and the surrounding area. Many towns with smaller populations than Tallaght have local authority status. The granting of such a status to Tallaght would enable the people who live there to make a major contribution to the future development of their own lives.  Increasingly local authorities are coming to be seen as the best focus for development activity and there is little doubt that at some stage in the future their role could undergo a radical change in this direction. This means it is possible to foresee when local authorities will be charged with industrial and tourist development <Col N="452" /> responsibilities among others.  The increasing trend towards decentralisation will probably mean that local authorities, perhaps for the first time, will come into their own as the bodies who will really translate the energies and determination of local people into action for their own communities.  For such an approach to work it would mean, of course, the new local authorities would have to have more power and more resources than they have at present, but if this sort of development comes to pass it would be a tragedy if a major centre of population like Tallaght were to lose out.  There will never be enough resources for development, particularly as long as right wing policies predominate.  In those circumstances those with most control of their own destinies can contribute most to development.</P>
    <P>No area has a greater claim to decentralised power than the area of Tallaght. It has suffered too long from centralised planning, or rather from the <i>ad hoc</i> development which passes for planning. It is time the people of Tallaght and people in other parts of the country who suffer the same kind of disadvantage were brought in from the cold and given a real opportunity to have a say in the development of their own future.</P>

      <P>I can think of no better way to begin my contribution to this debate than to quote the preface of the report of the Tallaght Welfare Society, The Development of Community and Soial Services in Tallaght, which provided a good deal of the motivation for this motion before the Dáil tonight.  The preface says:</P>
      <P>To the majority of Dubliners, Tallaght always signified the beginning of a day out in the Dublin mountains.  It was like basecamp &mdash; the village... and the beautiful scenery, with the Dublin mountains in the background, combined to make it a location of envy.</P>
      <P>In 1966&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="453" /> ... plans were unveiled for future development.  These plans promised, in the long term, a town described then as &ldquo;The Garden City of Europe&rdquo;.  Ten years ago, signs were erected on the approaches from the Greenhills and Templeogue roads with the words &ldquo;Welcome to Tallaght New Town&rdquo;. Today, nearly twenty-five years on, the only qualification Tallaght has to being a town is its population of 70,000.  Planning lost its way in Tallaght a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Very few of the promises were fulfilled, and we now have a situation that is crying out for massive investment, services and facilities.  Voluntary organisations have paved the way and made brave efforts to fill the vacuum, but this has not been matched by the State.  Delays in the construction of the town centre and the regional college have justified opinions that Tallaght is not getting a fair deal.  The only show piece in the town centre to show our visitors is the Garda station...</P>
    <P>The story of Tallaght is one of neglect.  Despite representations throughout the years nothing has changed.  The nature and structure of development create built-in limitations to personal and family fulfilment.</P>
    <P>The 1986 census shows that it is possible to say that the population of the town of Tallaght at the time of that census was 73,783 people.  That represented an increase in the population of 30 per cent in five years which makes Tallaght, in addition to being the third largest population centre in Ireland, also the fastest growing population centre in the country.</P>
    <P>Members of the House might like to consider how the people of Limerick would react if they were told in the morning that all of their hospitals were being closed, that the railway station was being shut down and that the NIHE and other third level institutions were being removed.  I do not think it takes too much imagination to describe the outcry that would result.  Yet in a town larger than <Col N="454" /> Limerick none of these facilities is available and, despite promises, none of them is likely to be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with some of the issues that arise in relation to Tallaght in the order in which they are specified in the motion before us.  Deputy Spring has already spoken about the need to establish a single united authority to include representation by the people of Tallaght and to oversee and control the continued development of the area with the ultimate aim of establishing a separate local authority for Tallaght.  There is an unanswerable case for that.  To take the Limerick analogy I would ask Deputies to consider the reaction if the people of Limerick were to be told that in future all local services and all industrial development and planning would be handled from Cork and that they would not be entitled to a voice in the determination of their own future.</P>
    <P>There are even more pressing arguments than that.  Tallaght has become a marginalised part of our community. That has not happened because of weakness or laziness or stupidity on the part of the people of Tallaght.  It has happened because the establishment has decided that Tallaght can safely be ignored.  As a consequence promises made to Tallaght and its people have systematically been broken.  The illusion has been created that Tallaght is getting its fair share of scarce resources and the people of Tallaght have no structure available to them that would enable them to highlight how great an illusion this is and how great the needs of that community are.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest need in Tallaght is jobs.  It already has, in some areas, one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and that rate is growing.  Even those that are at work, in the vast majority of cases, have to travel out of Tallaght to their work.  The IDA owns large tracts of land in Tallaght which they have owned for years, intended for the development of industries that would provide the employment so badly needed; but no steps have been taken by the IDA to develop those lands for the purpose for which they were acquired.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Youth unemployment is a particularly serious problem and is leading to serious disenchantment among large sections of the youth population because no employment is provided for them and there is no indication that employment will be provided for them.  When local people try to provide local enterprise, as did the Kiltilawn local enterprise project, and tried to remedy that off its own bat by organising an excellent scheme, and sought very small contributions from this Government to get that employment project under way, they were turned aside and sidetracked by the Government. There has been little or no emphasis in the past on attracting jobs into Tallaght and that has to change.  Tallaght must be designated as a high priority area for industrial investment and it must attract the same scale of incentive as other designated regions.</P>
    <P>The absence of a hospital to serve a community of almost 75,000 people is a continuing scandal.  It is abundantly clear from the Public Capital Programme published recently that very little progress will be made towards the completion of the hospital this year.  I find it inexplicable that this Government and particularly how the Minister for Health can defend this position. We have all heard recently how the Minister for Health was able to sanction a loan from a foreign bank for a hospital in his own constituency.  How can he ignore the overwhelming case in Tallaght?</P>
    <P>One person in every three of the population in Tallaght is under the age of nine. Half of them are under the age of 19, and only 13 per cent of the population of Tallaght is over the age of 40.  Most families coming to live in Tallaght are setting up home in an unfamiliar location.  Most of them have come to Tallaght because that is where the houses are rather than because of family ties, proximity to work or availability of services.  For this reason the initial experience of setting up home in Tallaght can be difficult.  Local resources and amenities are extremely limited.  While there are schools and some local shops, good shopping is scarce and <Col N="456" /> few if any of the housing estates have a library, coffee shop, restaurant or other facilities; and the absence of these facilities add to the stress, particularly for younger mothers.  Outlets which many people take for granted are often out of the question and this gives rise to a potentially serious situation.  Tallaght has more than its share of health problems, of stress within families and of family breakdown as the consequence of social problems like this.  A great deal of work is being done by voluntary organisations to deal with this problem, but resources are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I want to pay a particular tribute to those many organisations in Tallaght and the people who work in them to provide a service for the people of Tallaght. Deputy Spring has already mentioned the Tallaght welfare society.  There are many residents associations and tenants associations; there are organisations who organise the youth; there is the Tallaght choral society, the many senior citizens clubs, drama groups, art groups, groups organising outdoor activities such as orienteering, boxing clubs and so on. Every field of activity is catered for and the people of Tallaght themselves make a magnificant contribution to the area; but the development of family back-up services is urgently needed.  We are asking that the Eastern health Board develop a more adequate social work service, that additional day care facilities for children in the newer estates be established, that grant schemes be expanded to make proper resources available for the development of community pre-schools and local activities for children in young families, that Tallaght be established as a separate health area with its own administrative headquarters and that adequate funds be given to the Eastern Health Board to develop further its community care programme in Tallaght. I want to hear a response from the Minister and other Ministers concerned on these issues.</P>
    <P>To date what has the record been?  Far from providing these additional grants, existing grants through Dublin County Council which had already been <Col N="457" /> approved have been reneged on.  Many sporting organisations, residents and tenants associations and others who had had grants actually approved for them had to have these grants indefinitely deferred because of the cutbacks imposed on the county council by this Government.</P>
    <P>A regional technical college has long been promised.  The breaking of that promise is one of the most dishonourable acts of this Government.  The community in Tallaght is absolutely determined that it will have its own third level institution and it is essential to the future development of Tallaght in community terms and in economic terms that that regional technical college be provided.  A regional technical college would attract expertise to Tallaght from all around the country. It would contribute to the economic development in the area because it has been the experience all over the country that investment is attracted to areas where training and education is available locally.  Land has been reserved for the regional technical college; the plans are there.  There is no area of the country where it would be more logical to provide that base, and it is the one single thing that would bring a tremendous boost and enable a third level education to be given to the people of Tallaght.  I am asking here in the House tonight that the Minister representing the Government should look again at the decision to sidetrack the regional technical college for Tallaght and to ensure that that matter is given top priority because the boost that that one issue alone could provide for the area would be absolutely enormous.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need as well for improved education facilities at first and second level in Tallaght.  This is another area where this Government have made and broken promises, particularly in relation to the post-primary school for Jobstown and the post-primary school for Kingswood-Kilnamanagh.  These are areas where sites have been acquired, where schools were always intended to be built and the sites now lie idle with grass growing on them.  Some local representatives have taken pride in informing the residents of these areas that they <Col N="458" /> have succeeded in getting the grass cut on the sites where those schools are so badly needed and that were promised to the people of Jobstown and Kingwood-Kilnamanagh. Kingwood-Kinamanagh must be one of the most densely populated areas in the country and is bound on all sides by major dual carriageways. It was always intended to provide a school in that area and I should like to appeal to the Minister for Education to look again at the need for a post-primary school there and in Jobstown also.</P>
    <P>One of the major needs of the Tallaght area is for cheaper, safer and more reliable access to the city centre.  Clearly, the ideal solution would be an extension of the DART system to Tallaght.  Such an extension can be justified on economic and social grounds but I understand that the Government have decided that in any integrated plan for the Dublin area, an extension of the DART line will not be entertained.  If that is true, it amounts to a scandalous decision.  I hope the Government representative who contributes to the debate will give us an assurance that an extension of the DART system to Tallaght has not been ruled out.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the proposal for a town centre for Tallaght is making headway. However, I hope it will amount to a full town centre and not a grandiose shopping centre.  A town centre is meant to be more than that.  We require not just shops but facilities such as a library, a leisure and recreation centre and local authority offices.  It is important that local authority offices are located in such a centre so that people can have access to the various Departments of Government. The Government should give serious thought to the provisions of funds for the erection of such a centre.  It is important that such a centre be a vibrant place in the daytime and at night.  The people of Tallaght do not want to see the centre confined to shops that will be closed at night, as though it was a grandiose Dunne's Stores shopping complex.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Time is a scarce commodity so far as the Labour Party are <Col N="459" /> concerned but they considered it important that the needs of Tallaght be highlighted in the House.  The motion was not introduced with the intention of political party bashing on the issue.  The people of Tallaght do not want their problems made into a political football.  Our intention in moving the motion was to make progress on the issues I have highlighted. We will co-operate with the Government, and other parties, to ensure that moneys are voted by the House to improve Tallaght.  At budget time and when the House debates Estimates I do not want to hear the representatives of any party saying that while they support the need for a hospital, a regional technical college or schools in the Tallaght area, they are not prepared to vote against any cuts in expenditure.  Those representatives must insist on money being earmarked in the budget to ensure that the facilities needed by the people of Tallaght are provided.  There should not be any easy talk from Members to the effect that they support certain projects for Tallaght.  They should announce what they intend doing at budget time or when an Estimate does not provide for a regional technical college, post-primary schools or a hospital.  That is the acid test and Members contributing to this debate should address that issue.</P>
    <P>Too often we have had Members announcing support for projects at public meetings in the area and issuing documents to the effect that they support other projects.  However, those Members, particularly those who belong to Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, have voted with the Government in favour of cutbacks in Health, Education and Social Welfare.  Those policies have denied the people of Tallaght a livelihood and the facilities that are needed if they and their children are to have any hope for the future.</P>
    <P>The people of Tallaght are entitled to the same treatment that others receive. They have suffered establishment neglect for too long.  It is time that the House as a unit recognised that, combined to support the people of Tallaght and give <Col N="460" /> them the same basic facilities that have been provided in other areas.  I hope that will be done.  It is essential that a local authority for the area be established. Funds from the national lottery have been dispensed hand over fist to many sporting organisations but I should like to know why some of those resources are not diverted to job creation projects in Tallaght.  I do not think the Government can do anything more prudent than provide employment for the young people. The Garda have complained that some young people in Tallaght do not co-operate with them on occasions but is it any wonder that that occurs when those young people are denied employment or the prospect of it in the foreseeable future?  That is what is turning the youth off and it is remarkable that it has not done so to a greater extent.  The people of Tallaght are doing everything they can from their meagre resources to create employment.  The Tallaght Welfare Society produced an outstanding booklet analysing prospects for the district and other organisations are trying to create employment in the area but the response from the Government has not been good. I hope the debate highlights the need for a change in direction so far as Tallaght is concerned.  The Government should be considering providing jobs for the young and not so young.</P>
    <P>We cannot rely on private enterprise to provide employment in Tallaght. The IDA have been sitting on land in the area for years.  I would be pleased if private enterprise established factories in the area but that has not happened.  There must be active intervention by the Government and semi-State agencies to ensure that employment is provided.  I accept that there are industrial estates in Tallaght but factories have not been built on them.  Many warehouses have been built there to store goods that have been manufactured abroad for distribution throughout the country.  Approximately six people are employed in those large factory-type buildings and that does not meet the needs of the people of Tallaght. We need labour intensive industries <Col N="461" /> established there, if not by private enterprise then by the Government or Government-sponsored agencies.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion will have the support of all parties in the House and that it will lead to a rethink by this Government on these important and serious issues for the people of Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to initiate the Government's response to this motion. This Government are endeavouring to provide the much needed facilities in Tallaght by taking comprehensive action in relation to many of the problems facing the community now living there.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to congratulate Tallaght Welfare Society for producing their excellent report entitled &ldquo;The Development of Community and Social Services in Tallaght.&rdquo;  The report is an extremely comprehensive document dealing with housing, family support services, community organisations and families, social welfare and health services and services for the elderly and physically handicapped. I am certain that the report will be of immense benefit in the future development of policy in these areas, and others, in Tallaght.</P>
      <P>One of the most interesting aspects of the report is that it highlights the extensive community development activity that has evolved over the last number of years in Tallaght.  In addition to the large umbrella organisations such as the Community Council, the Youth Federation and the Arts Council I understand that there are 125 local organisations covering such activities as sports, music, arts and youth clubs.  While there are a number of problems facing Tallaght today it is evident from the degree of community involvement that the people of the area are determined that these problems are resolved and are prepared to invest significant effort of their own to this end. This is to be highly commended and must be supported by all relevant State agencies in so far as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As noted in the report this extensive community activity is a clear indication of the positive concern many people in <Col N="462" /> Tallaght have for the development of the neighbourhood and their town.  This very constructive attitude is reflected in the concluding comments of the report which highlights the many positive aspects of Tallaght and I would like to emphasise that there are many such positive aspects. These include the good quality housing, the regional parks, the community centres, the high quality of professional social service care and particularly the role of the community sector.  A Cheann Comhairle, I would like to share some of my time with Deputy Flood.</P>

      <P>I must emphasise that the development of Tallaght has not been ignored or forgotten even though it is possible to point to some failings and work still in hands.  I would like to emphasise that the planners of Tallaght got many aspects right &mdash; the Tallaght Welfare Society acknowledge this in many parts of their report.  To quote from the report: &ldquo;there is a plentiful supply of good housing plus a basic infrastructural network of roads, schools and open spaces...the situation has improved in recent years &mdash; with Dublin County Council actively providing a range of community and environmental facilities, the Health Board transferring extra staff into the area, the IDA developing an Enterprise Centre, and Dublin Bus setting up its local bus service&rdquo;.  The report welcomes the recognition in the 1988 budget, through the extension of the urban incentives scheme to the town centre site, for the need for investment and growth in a range of industrial, commercial and social activities.  The report recognises, &ldquo;that part of the planning idea was the creation of independent communities of 5,000 people or so and to some extent this has worked&rdquo;.  It also recognises that, &ldquo;by and large the actual quality of housing in Tallaght is good. The local authorities, as we have noted already, have invested heavily in good quality construction and their tenants speak well of the houses allocated to <Col N="463" /> them&rdquo;; &ldquo;that a large number of green spaces have been provided in Tallaght along with some excellent park facilities&rdquo;. The report also acknowledges the importance of, and the extent of, the significant investment in community facilities by Dublin County Council.  The report also has other positive praise for other work by the State agencies. However, by cataloguing the acknowledged successes in Tallaght I would not like to give the Deputies the impression that the Government intend to rest on their laurels as regards Tallaght or that the Government are satisfied with the rate of progress.  Quite frankly I am very disappointed at the failure up to now of the commercial sector to provide a town centre for this huge development centre. We are tackling the problems on many fronts and I would like to inform you of progress to date and future plans.  I will deal first with the town centre.</P>
      <P>Tallaght is an area which has experienced intensive development and rapid population growth in a short time span. It is now a major centre of population in its own right.  Tallaght has many assets; it has excellent schools, open spaces and parks, a beautiful hinterland and it has a thriving community life.</P>
      <P>This Government have been concerned, however, that the provision of the necessary commercial facilities to service and support the population of the area has not kept pace with the scale of residential and community development. The absence of a suitable retail town centre to service the area and to serve as a focal point for other types of commercial, recreational and other development is an obvious lack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have been planning the provision of town centre facilities in Tallaght for many years.  Recognising the need to accelerate this project, the Government announced in the 1988 budget than an area in and around the site of the proposed Tallaght Town Centre would be designated for incentives under the urban renewal scheme.  The purpose of extending the incentives to Tallaght <Col N="464" /> was to expedite the arrangements for the proposed town centre which has been delayed for far too long.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation had been involved in protracted negotiations with the proposed developer of the town centre for a number of years.  An agreement was reached between the Corporation and the developer two months ago.  I would like to think that the budget announcement about Tallaght had the required effect in bringing these negotiations to an early conclusion.  For my part I was not prepared to make the necessary order designating the town centre site until such time as Dublin Corporation had a legally enforceable agreement to ensure its development.  Once the terms of the agreement were finalised, I made an order on 14 November, designating an area of some 120 acres in Tallaght under the urban renewal scheme.  The tax and rates reliefs available under the scheme are valuable incentives and will, I hope, ensure rapid and worthwhile developments.</P>
    <P>The incentives will be available in respect of qualifying expenditure on the designated area until the end of May 1991.  The limited time available &mdash; just two and a half years &mdash; will ensure that, in order to qualify for the incentives, the development we all want to see must come to fruition at a very early date.</P>
    <P>Some preliminary works have already been carried out on the site of the proposed town centre.  I understand that the developer has completed negotiations with the main tenders for this project and will be in a position in the next two weeks to sign the main contract for commencement of work on site immediately after Christmas and that the project will then be scheduled for opening in September 1990.</P>
    <P>Th town centre, which will be called &ldquo;The Square&rdquo;, will provide some 500,000 square feet of retail and leisure development at a cost of over £40 million.  The facilities will include prestige food and fashion shops, offices and a multi-cinema complex seating 3,000 people.  There will be parking accommodation for over 2,000 cars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> The area designated in Tallaght for urban renewal also includes extensive lands surrounding the town centre site, an area north of the Blessington Road and part of the existing Tallaght village. Designation of the village area will facilitate a co-ordinated and integrated development, dovetailing the old and new and will ensure that the existing village can be upgraded hand in hand with the major new development.</P>
    <P>This report provides some valuable comments on the housing and planning process and I believe highlights the need for a considered and integrated approach to housing and planning.</P>
    <P>The report rightly acknowledges the high standard of local authority housing provided in the Tallaght area.  The houses provided by the housing authorities in Tallaght are basically good houses and I am glad to record that with the exception of the Avonbeg flats complex, remedial works are generally not needed.  It must also be appreciated that the large scale development of local authority housing and the preponderance of family type accommodation provided in Tallaght and, indeed, other Dublin suburbs in the seventies and early eighties was in response to the needs arising from rapidly increasing population in the Dublin area. As the report points out, recent years have seen the emergence of additional categories of housing needs such as single people, single parent families and the homeless.  These categories together with the elderly now outstrip traditional family type housing needs on local authority waiting lists.  Since the seventies local authorities, including those in Dublin, have provided over 10 per cent of new housing by way of purpose built elderly persons' dwellings.  The Housing Act, 1988, revises and updates the statutory basis for local authority housing and the new procedures being put in place under the Act place greater emphasis on meeting these special needs in much the same way as the needs of the elderly have already received special recognition.  This new emphasis will result in a wider range of responses being used by housing authorities to meet housing needs than simply <Col N="466" /> the provision of new accommodation on green field sites.</P>
    <P>The new tenant purchase scheme which I introduced this year will mean that tenants generally will be able to buy their homes at half the market value.  This scheme will bring home ownership within the reach of many more tenants than was previously the case and should help bring stability to those estates which have suffered an unduly high turnover of population. Earlier this year my grave concern at the problem of vacant houses in Tallaght was conveyed to Dublin Corporation. I am now informed by the Corporation that some 60 vandalised houses have been or are being refurbished. The corporation have also been asked to make every effort in conjunction with the county council to ensure that adequate arrangements are put in place to deal with this problem and to prevent its recurrence.</P>
    <P>The idea of a single development body for areas such as Tallaght has a certain simple logic to it, but on close examination it is very problematic.  Tallaght is an integral part of the overall Dublin area and has important linkages with the metropolitan area as a whole.  The area cannot be developed or administered in a vacuum and in isolation from the rest of Dublin.  Any decisions taken in relation to the infrastructure of other parts of the city and county will have a significant impact on Tallaght and <i>vice versa</i>.  We should strive, therefore, to ensure that the area as a whole will be developed in a planned and co-ordinated way.  I believe that to establish a new authority at this point would not facilitate such a planned and co-ordinated approach for the future.  Tallaght is not a compact area under single ownership such as the Custom House Docks area. These factors mean that simple administrative solutions are unlikely to respond adequately to the complexity of Tallaght's problems.</P>
    <P>The broader question of changes in the local government system in County Dublin taking account of the special needs of the Dublin region as a whole, including Tallaght, is a matter which falls <Col N="467" /> to be considered in the context of a comprehensive programme for the overall reform of local government which will include local authority structures, functions, powers, finance and legislative reform.  Since becoming Minister I have been carrying out an intensive review of the system and work on the re-organisation programme is now well advanced.  I will be announcing details of this programme as soon as possible.  The question of the appropriate local government system for the Dublin area is one of the matters which will be dealt with in this context.</P>
    <P>The development plan is the planning authority's statement of its objectives for the development and improvement of its area.  The plan generally includes objectives for land use zoning, the development and renewal of obsolete areas, the preservation and improvement of amenities, road improvement, water supply, etc.  Each planning authority are responsible for the implementation of their development plan and do this through their own development work and through the exercise of development control.</P>
    <P>The local development plans may be reviewed from time to time as necessity arises but must in any event be reviewed every five years.  County councils must prepare a separate plan for what are known as the &ldquo;scheduled towns&rdquo; listed in the 1963 Act.  Tallaght is such a scheduled town.</P>
    <P>Tallaght is specifically dealt with in detail in the 1983 Dublin County Development Plan.  Dublin County Council have had a policy to make land available for development in Tallaght in an orderly fashion and this policy will continue until Tallaght is fully developed. Tallaght has and continues to be promoted as a centre for industrial growth in the Dublin sub-region.</P>
    <P>The completion of the review of the Dublin County Development Plan is due next year and work is proceeding apace on the preparation of a draft plan.  The county council have recently published a working paper on the western towns around Dublin, including Tallaght.  This <Col N="468" /> is a valuable source on the present position in these towns and it is indicative of the problems being addressed in the review process.  When the new plan is placed on public display it will, of course, be open to the people of Tallaght to play their part in planning the future development of their town by making objections or representations on the contents of the plan.  All objections and representations made to the draft plan must be taken into account by the county council before the plan is finally adopted.  This process is an invaluable opportunity for the people of Tallaght to influence future policy on the development of their area and ultimately to channel resources into the areas of development which they themselves would favour over the next five to seven years.</P>
    <P>A matter which is of immediate concern to us is the reform of the Structural Funds which is primarily designed to promote the development and structural adjustment, both economic and social, of the regions whose development is lagging behind.  A crucial element of this proposal is the commitment by the EC that aid from the Structural Funds for the least developed regions, including Ireland, would be doubled by 1992 and that the rates of contribution from the funds would be increased to a maximum of 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Before the new arrangements come into effect it is necessary for new implementing and co-ordinating regulations to be made.  Drafts of these regulations, which have been prepared by the EC Commission, are the subject at European level, of detailed negotiations which are now nearing completion.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Dublin area, which is of particular relevance to today's motion, the Government decided in October 1987 that Dublin, which includes the Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire areas, was to be the first of seven regions for which an operational programme is to be prepared.  A consortium of Davy Kelleher McCarthy, Reid McHugh and Partners and Stokes Kennedy Crowley was appointed as consultants to carry out a study which will <Col N="469" /> lay the basis for the operational programme for the capital.  The study aims to identify the obstacles to the economic growth of the Dublin region, to identify its economic strengths and potential and to devise a strategy aimed at meeting the region's needs.  Work on the study is proceeding and I wish to assure you all that the needs of Tallaght are being taken into account in the context of the study now in progress.  The Government are well aware of the extent of the economic and social problems which face the people of that community and the development requirements of the area in general.  It is envisaged that the operational programme for Dublin will help to focus on the various needs of areas such at Tallaght, will identify priorities and outline a development strategy aimed at meeting these needs and improving the quality of life for the communities involved.  I would like to take this opportunity to assure the House that when details of the Dublin programme are being finalised and come before Government the particular needs of Tallaght will not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>The amenity grants scheme has been debated at length in the House and Deputies opposite were at pains to point out the alleged inadequacy of the allocation system.  That is now water under the bridge to a large extent but, as I said at the time, the amount available this year for amenity grants was so small compared with demand, many combinations of projects could have been chosen by different people.  One aspect of the allocations made by me which I considered important was the necessity to give each local authority area an equitable share of available funds on the basis of comparative need and I am glad to say that in the case of the Dublin area Tallaght did very well as far as allocations were concerned in that it received a total of £163,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Check it now.  This amount was more than the allocations made to <Col N="470" /> each of 21 counties and county boroughs. Examples of the types of projects, ten in all, which are being assisted this year are Greenhills Community Centre which is receiving a grant of £15,000, Tallaght United Football Club which has been allocated £25,000, Jobstown Community Centre which gets a grant of £30,000 and a playground in west Tallaght which has been allocated £25,000.</P>
      <P>To implement the full plans for the extension of the DART system, including a link between the city and Tallaght, would cost in the order of £500 million. The possibility of such a development had been under consideration for a number of years and the absence of action was no doubt influenced by the likely costs involved.  Rather than allow uncertainty to continue, the Government decided last year that proposals for the extension of DART should not be proceeded with because of the considerable costs of any such extension and the state of the public finances.  The Government were, nonetheless, not unmindful of the transport needs of the developing western city suburbs and at the time of the DART announcement, my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, requested the chairman of CIE to prepare public transport investment plans for the Dublin area based on bus only options or diesel rail on existing lines. This was a practical approach to the transport issues.  Tallaght comes under the heading of the bus options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE have submitted a report to the Minister for Tourism and Transport in response to his request and the proposals in that report are being examined in his Department.  I understand that, outside the framework of that report and with a view to improving the standard of service at peak times, Bus Átha Cliath recently introduced five additional buses on the 50A, 50C and 77 routes.  In addition, that company plan to introduce an additional minibus to provide a better service on the existing local-link services in the area and also to provide local-link services on a further route before Christmas.  The report to the Minister envisages a new service linking Tallaght with Dundrum <Col N="471" /> and Dún Laoghaire together with a broadening of peripheral services generally. These developments domonstrate that the Tallaght public transport interests are not being ignored.</P>
    <P>The new hospital at Tallaght will be one of the major general hospitals for the Dublin area and will, together with Naas Hospital, serve the population of south-west County Dublin, the western portion of County Wicklow and the southern portion of County Kildare.  The services currently provided by the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's hospitals will form the nucleus of the new hospital in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght Hospital Board were appointed in 1981 to plan, build, equip and commission the new hospital.  The board completed the planning brief for the hospital in 1984 and approval was given to the board to proceed with the development on a phased basis.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made since then on the planning of the hospital. I am aware of the comments on the length of time it is taking to plan the hospital.  I can understand people's impatience in wanting to see the hospital in operation as quickly as possible.  However, it should be remembered that unlike many other building projects, a hospital is a highly complex fusion of specialised departments which individually require skills and time to properly plan so as to ensure, that when built, they operate effectively.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to the Tallaght Hospital project and approval has recently issued to the board to proceed to Stage 4 of the planning process. It is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintained construction work will commence in mid-1990.</P>
    <P>The development of Tallaght and the south west area did not take place in an unplanned way and the area is not without basic amenities.  In addition to the modern housing schemes built by the Dublin local authorities, lands were reserved for churches and schools, primary and post primary, and local shops. These amenities have been provided in every district in Tallaght.  Lands reserved <Col N="472" /> for industrial development were made available to individual firms and to the IDA at Whitestown.  There are also other industrial estates on the Belgard Road and in other districts.  Extensive landscaping and recreational facilities are a feature of the area.  Killinarden Park, the most recent formal park, was developed at a cost of £500,000 approximately.  The roads infrastructure in Tallaght is at an advanced stage and at present provides ready access to all areas.  Work will start shortly on the Tallaght Town Centre site while Dublin Corporation have recently invited tenders for a three acre site at the junction of the Tallaght by-pass and Belgard Road for the construction of an hotel.  This, of course, will provide many service jobs and is the type of response needed in that area.  As I have just indicated, the Tallaght Hospital project just across the road from the town centre site is at an advanced planning stage and the development should start by mid-1990.  I am sure my recent designation for special tax incentives of some 120 acres in Tallaght will bring additional much-needed facilities and development.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention to oppose the motion since we are all, I hope, of one mind on the necessity of providing much-needed development and facilities in Tallaght.  For our part as Government we will continue, within the available resources, to do all we can to provide all the necessary development, facilities and amenities.  Our ultimate aim is to make Tallaght a better place for the community.</P>

      <P>When the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, came to Tallaght to launch a report by the Tallaght Welfare Society published in May 1988 and entitled <i>Development of Community and Social Services in Tallaght</i> I felt that here at last was a report which not only identified the problems of <Col N="473" /> Tallaght but, more importantly, pointed out how these problems even at this late stage could be tackled and perhaps overcome. I wish especially to pay tribute to Mr. Aidan Thomas, Chairman of the Tallaght Welfare Society, and his colleague, Mr. Brian Kenny, Director, who were largely responsible for drawing up the report in conjunction with their staff and the supporters of the society.  If there is any one who genuinely wishes to try to understand Tallaght and the nature of its problems then that person would be well advised to carfully consult the report drawn up by the Tallaght Welfare Society.</P>
      <P>The 1986 census results show that Tallaght has a population of 74,000 people, with almost 38,000 of those people under the age of 20 years.  I could go on to spell out a whole range of statistics covering the population structure of Tallaght but time does not permit me to do so. However, a crucial point I want to make is that in 1955 the population of Tallaght was just under 400 and in 30 years that population of 400 has grown to 74,000. The real tragedy is that the provision of essential infrastructure has not kept pace with the extraordinary growth I have referred to.  People came to live in Tallaght with great expectations of the new town but 30 years later many of their hopes and aspirations for the new town remain unfulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe Tallaght has been used over the years to resolve difficulties for other areas.  Low-cost housing has been provided in huge housing estates by the private sector.  These developers have repeatedly failed to complete their developments properly and unfortunately many of them have gone out of business overnight leaving major problems behind for the residents of the new estates.  Local authorities have solved their housing waiting lists by buying up huge tracts of lands and building housing estates in the Tallaght area which remain as yet vastly underprovided for in terms of community facilities.  I must stress here in particular that Dublin Corporation, as a housing developer in the Tallaght area, created major problems in Tallaght by <Col N="474" /> their repeated failure to properly complete and manage their developments in the area.  I believe Dublin Corporation's inner city housing problem was solved at the expense of Tallaght and apart from building houses their commitment to Tallaght has been extremely weak and should be corrected forthwith.</P>
    <P>Tallaght needs a new local government structure and there needs to be an improvement in the present situation whereby it participates in a council of some 78 members and a district council of some 26 members.  These two councils are unworkable so far as Tallaght is concerned and I am glad that the Minister has under review the organisation of local authorities for the greater Dublin area.  I hope that arising out of his consideration of this aspect of local government Tallaght will be regarded as an area capable of meeting and dealing with its own problems and needs.</P>
    <P>The recent designation of a large portion of Tallaght by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, under the urban renewal scheme should provide a major boost for the area and give a major boost to the provision of the new town centre for Tallaght as well as revitalising the old village itself.  Tallaght desperately needs a new hospital which I understand is at a very advanced stage of planning. The continued commitment of the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, to the Tallaght Hospital and his commitment to its opening in 1992-93 is extremely welcome as it will have an enormous impact on the whole area.  The provision of a regional college in the Tallaght area is very badly needed and, again, I ask the Minister for Education to look at this project despite the present difficult national financial situation.  Many young people in Tallaght would benefit by the provision of this college and its courses could be structured to meet the needs of the young people and local industry.</P>
    <P>Public transport to and from Tallaght is very unreliable and continues to be a very difficult issue.  I am absolutely convinced that a rail link to Tallaght would dramatically improve the infrastructure of the area and would be the making of <Col N="475" /> Tallaght.  The lands to lay the rail link from the Clondalkin line have been reserved free of development by the local authority.  This facility would greatly enhance Tallaght, allow its people far greater mobility and take away much of the sheer drudgery associated with travelling to and from Tallaght on the existing public transport system which needs dramatic improvement.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without yet again mentioning the provision of second level school facilities in the Jobstown and Kilnamanagh-Kingswood areas.  A school has been established in Jobstown and it needs a suitable building within the parish of Jobstown.  Its particular needs are evident to all who are familiar with the area and the enormous social problems in the area would be alleviated to a great extent if a suitable building was provided.  Not only would it cater for the needs of Jobstown community college, which as I have said, has been established but it could also be used for adult education and other activities which arise from time to time in the locality.  The Kilnamanagh-Kingswood area is experiencing major problems because of the lack of a second level school to serve the area.  Soon up to 1,000 young people from these two parishes will have to travel on public transport to attend second level schools elsewhere. This is not very satisfactory from the point of view of the two communities.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in Tallaght in recent years in relation to road development and infrastructural developments in terms of community facilities but a great deal still remains to be done.  Tallaght a new town with a population of 74,000 people is entitled to a greater portion of this nation's resources.  For too long this area has lagged behind in a commitment from successive Government's to develop the infrastructure which the people in the area rightly expected and are entitled to.  Some progress has been made in stablising the community.  The tenant purchase scheme introduced by the Minister will go a long way towards <Col N="476" /> redressing the absolutely catastrophic situation which arose as a result of the old £5,000 grant scheme which drew out community leaders from local authority areas which needed that kind of leadership and pushed them into private housing estates. Those same people are now having difficulties in meeting their loan repayments but their only sin was their desire to own their own home.  If a suitable tenant purchase scheme had been in place at that time I believe that the difficulties relating to the development of local authority estates which we have seen in the past need not necessarily have arisen.  I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the tenant purchase scheme which is proving extremely successful.  However, there are other issues in the Tallaght area which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to security, I am very pleased the Minister for Justice recently found time to visit Tallaght to discuss with the local superintendent and the Garda the difficulties which are arising in the area and in particular some recently highlighted incidents.  I am pleased also that the Minister for Justice has appointed an additional Garda superintendent to the Tallaght area, together with a number of additional gardaí.  This is what the local community have been calling for and I welcome progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on his commitment to provide a new purpose-built social welfare head office in the Tallaght area.  This I believe the people of Tallaght are entitled to and I appreciate the Minister's decision to bring forward that project and to provide it as part of the Tallaght town centre infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>Tallaght has problems.  It is at a crossroads. It is up to this Government, of whom I am a supporter, to bring forward all possible projects so that the town of Tallaght can rightly take its place within the economy.  Jobs must be provided for its people, as well as the infrastructure to which they are entitled.  Facilities for second and third level education are extremely important.  I am sorry I do not have enough time to go into a whole <Col N="477" /> range of issues affecting Tallaght, including those where progress has been made and others where progress needs to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, a new Tallaght strategy.  We could do with one every year and if people had the sense to follow our strategy we would not have the problems we are discussing.  I should like to commend the Labour Party on bringing forward this motion.  I commend them particularly because in doing so they are supporting in very large measure policy proposals made by Fine Gael which were widely circulated in the Tallaght area some time ago.  I have a copy of them here and I intend to refer to them later in my remarks.  I have no doubt that Deputy Taylor is very familiar with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These proposals were developed after a series of consultations with the Tallaght Welfare Society, the Tallaght Community Council and a number of other groups in Tallaght.  Together with a number of my colleagues in this House, in the Seanad, in Dublin County Council and in my own party organisation in Tallaght, I have had extensive discussions, which are continuing, about the future development of Tallaght and a range of issues which are raised in this motion, including the provision of amenities of all kinds, and, above all, the expansion of employment in Tallaght.  I am glad to see that we have the support of the Labour Party for many of the policy approaches we have set out.  So far I count two parties in this House who are now showing a real commitment to imaginative thinking in relation to the development of Tallaght. I intend to continue that commitment on behalf of my party.  I had the pleasure of reiterating that commitment to the people of Tallaght just over three weeks <Col N="478" /> ago when I had the honour of presenting the Tallaght People of the Year Awards on behalf of the Tallaght Community Council.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Labour Party's support in this, all the more in that sections of the motion before us use almost exactly the same words as in my party's policy document. I can give no better illustration than to quote from that document as follows:</P>
    <P>If all existing development plans are completed, the Tallaght area will soon have a population roughly the same as that of Cork City.</P>
    <P>Our policy document continues:</P>
    <P>The headlong, unplanned growth of the greater Dublin South West area has taken place without the provision of the basic amenities &mdash; or even essential services &mdash; taken for granted in established urban areas of a similar size.</P>
    <P>Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I am very flattered to find exactly those words in the motion before us.</P>
    <P>We went on to say a good deal more. We pointed out, for example, that one in ten of all the unemployed people in this country live in south-west Dublin.  A huge youth population is emerging in that area. There is little or no provision for their medium or long term future in terms of educational facilities and employment.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that in 1985 when Deputy Taylor's colleague, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, was Minister for the Environment, we began to put in place radical changes in local government, designed to give more local control and encourage local initiative and participation at county council level.  Those reforms have been put on hold by this Government and I should like to see them reactivated and brought to fruition.  It is very clear that in areas of rapid expansion and very large population such as Tallaght and Blanchardstown there is a need for a new approach to local government structures which will bring together not just the work of local government as we know it but agencies like the IDA, FÁS and other <Col N="479" /> State and semi-State agencies.  They must focus their efforts on a co-ordinated programme of development in such areas.  I should like to see us regarding Tallaght as a forerunner for a new formula of local government initiative which would give people in Tallaght and in similar areas the kind of local government service and support they need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned a very striking comparison.  If there were any other town in the country of the size of Tallaght which did not have a local authority we would all be complaining about it and the whole population of the area would feel they had been badly done by.  There is clearly a case for the new approach to structures of local government to co-ordinate and to channel all the activities of local government and the State for the benefit of that community.</P>
    <P>We believe that in order to assist the growth of strong communities and viable centres of economic activity we should build on the initiatives already proposed by the Tallaght COMTEC and the Tallaght integrated area programme.  We need to consider how local groups, community associations and the development and service agencies to which I have referred, the IDA and FÁS, can be brought together in new structures to meet the needs of areas of that kind.</P>
    <P>In regard to transport needs, we have proposed a series of steps which are required immediately, as well as a series of longer-term steps which need to be taken.  We have proposed, for example, a permanent busway from Tallaght to the city centre and a review of the times of current services.  Some progress has been made in the past few months by way of additions and extensions to existing services, but it is very clear that the transport links between Tallaght and not just the centre of Dublin but places like Crumlin hospital are grossly deficient when compared with the needs of the people.  We have proposed the reactivation of a commuter rail link from Clondalkin to Connolly Station, with a feeder bus system in Clondalkin and a bus link to Tallaght.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> In our proposals for making Dublin again a living city, we pointed out that in the current financial environment it is extremely unlikely that the State, on its own, could develop a rapid rail transport service between Heuston Station and Tallaght and Clondalkin.  We therefore proposed that a committee of this House should examine how such a rapid rail system might be introduced by a combination of the public sector and the private sector or &mdash; if that is the only way to do it &mdash; by granting an exclusive licence to a private sector operator.  That is very far from saying that there is an immediate and unambiguous case and availability of funds for the provision of a service of that kind.  I have no doubt that we are far from having examined in full detail all the options open to us in that connection.</P>
    <P>There is no third level educational institution in south-west and west Dublin between the Liffey and the Dublin mountains for a population larger than that of Cork.  Of the outstanding regional colleges and projects which were planned but have not yet been carried out, the most urgent is the proposal for a regional college in Tallaght.  That must get priority.  I intend in a moment to come to the question of resources on which Deputy Taylor touched somewhat provocatively.</P>
    <P>In the area of housing provision, we pointed out that a large proportion of public housing in the area consists of Dublin Corporation houses in a county council area which causes very difficult problems for the tenants of Dublin Corporation who live in the Tallaght area. We proposed that those estates be transferred to Dublin County Council with suitable arrangements for the transfer of tenantship and funding.  Pending the transfer, we are pressing for corporation offices in Tallaght to serve corporation tenants.  We have pursued that matter in Dublin County Council and in Dublin City Council.</P>

      <P>I encourage Deputy Walsh to get his colleagues in Dublin City Council to support a perfectly sensible move both from the point of view of the tenants, Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council.</P>
      <P>We proposed that national lottery funds should be made available for a major multi-sports centre in the south-west Dublin area.  We could go on at length about the facilities that need to be provided there.  If all the requirements were put together and a proper application made to the national lottery there would be very little difficulty in the face of the obvious needs of the area in getting those who decide the allocation of national lottery funds to agree that such a series of projects should come very high on the priority list for the allocation of funds.  I will give every possible assistance to Deputy Walsh, Deputy Flood and other Members in bringing that matter to the attention of whoever makes the decisions.  I will gladly co-operate with other Members in the House to get that done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>So far.  I will not be tempted to say any more but I am sure the Deputy got my message.  It is not enough to say that the construction of Tallaght Hospital is being proceeded with with all possible haste because we all know that is not true.  We know that on two occasions, in 1987 and 1988, the allocations for Tallaght Hospital and the priority to be accorded to it were pushed <Col N="482" /> down the list.  That is not a very wise course of action and it will not serve the interest of the people of the area or of the catchment area to be served by the hospital.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Taylor pointed out, bringing all those things about requires resources to be made available. However, Deputy Taylor put this in somewhat the wrong context in talking about decisions made here on the Estimates every year because that is not the proper context.  The proper context is the simple question of where, in the order of priority, the needs of the Tallaght area come.  Where in the order of priority, do the needs of other similar areas in Dublin come?  Representing myself and, representing in my more corporate self 41 constituencies, I must point out that the needs of that area have not been high enough on the priority list.  Decisions in relation to resources for the kind of development we want to see there will be a very important part of the decisions made on the use of extra funds coming from the European Community in the context of assistance for integrated development programmes, in particular for integrated programmes for the development of the Dublin region.  To do that properly, we need planning structures capable of taking into account the needs of an area like Tallaght and capable of giving priority to the needs of the different parts of the area served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have that structure now. We have a system under which decisions in relation to the Dublin region affecting Tallaght and Blanchardstown and each of the other six planning regions will, effectively, be made by the Department of Finance and the European Commission. There is a token involvement of local authority managers but no Member of this House can say that he or she has met a local authority manager who is involved in it or who thinks that he or she has any role to play.  We have consultative structures that are nothing more than a sham.  They give the appearance of consultation but that is an argument for another day.  The point I want to make is <Col N="483" /> that whether we are talking about Tallaght or any other region, there is no effective way in which the needs, requirements and the priority that should be attached to the development of those areas can properly be put into the mix that will produce integrated development programmes for those regions.</P>
    <P>I commend the Labour Party support for our action in this area and I invite the other parties in the House to enthusiastically support the action taken, not alone in supporting the motion before the House&mdash;because that is only the beginning&mdash;but in supporting the action in Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council and in the preparation of integrated programmes that will turn our proposals into real jobs and real welfare for the people of Tallaght.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to participate in this debate.  Like other Members who spoke, I should like to pay tribute to the Tallaght Welfare society for the very comprehensive report and analysis they undertook which show what has been achieved in Tallaght and which very clearly set out the problems and difficulties experienced in that area.</P>
      <P>In a debate such as this it is correct also to pay tribute to the many other voluntary bodies doing excellent work in Tallaght, such as St. Vincent de Paul and Dr. Barnardos, many of whom are filling gaps that the State has not been willing to fill in and servicing need in the area which would go unserviced without their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1972 the County Dublin development plan envisaged that Tallaght would become a major and essentially self-sufficient urban centre with a full range of industrial, commercial and social facilities. Only 8,000 people lived in Tallaght in 1971 but by 1986 the population had risen to 73,000.  It is now in the region of 75,000 to 76,000.  There has been an increase of over 800 per cent in the population of Tallaght in 15 years.  This is a population growth without parallel in any other part of the country and indeed without parallel in most of the member states <Col N="484" /> of the EC.  Despite the vast growth, in particular of housing, Tallaght still has no town centre or cinema and has only one library as well as a mobile library service.  There is only one decent health centre and there is a totally inadequate transport system.  There is no local hospital and there are major problems of unemployment.</P>
    <P>As the report of the Tallaght Welfare Society highlighted, in certain parts of Tallaght unemployment has reached over 40 per cent and in other parts social welfare dependency levels are over 60 per cent.  I have no doubt that part of the reason for the problems regarding Tallaght has been the lack of one overview by way of the provision of a comprehensive plan and the putting in place of one authority to co-ordinate the provision of services in the Tallaght area.  It is long since past time for major local government reform.  Tallaght is currently served by Dublin County Council of which there are 78 members, a council that has more members than the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I think we are all aware that the Anglo-Irish Agreement has provided the means to focus the political will of both Governments towards the task of defeating terrorism and, therefore, towards a stable and a just society for both communities in Northern Ireland.  I have been calling on both Governments, since the beginning of this year and indeed for 12 months previously, to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement to the full. They must regain the momentum and the dynamism of the first 18 months of this Agreement.  It is time that the Irish Government started to plan ahead and to follow long-term strategies.</P>
      <P>In the light of the present difficulties it is right and proper that we in this country demand a more open and constructive approach from the British Government. The aim of the Extradition Act is to defeat terrorism, national or international. It is a measure of the effectiveness of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that all parties have come together to defeat a common enemy, the men of violence and terrorism, but more than this is required.  What is required now is a signal from both Governments that they have a clear vision of confirmed commitment to peace and stability in Ireland.</P>
      <P>When I spoke earlier tonight I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to clarify what the Minister has said earlier in his speech about the ability of this House to review the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, in the New Year.  That has not been done yet as far as I am aware.  I hope the Minister for Justice who will be speaking later tonight will clarify what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said earlier, that we will have the opportunity to amend the Extradition (Amendment) Act early next year as well as to review, as is laid down in that Act, the report of the Attorney General on the workings of the agreement for the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>If there were normal relations between this country and Great Britain perhaps we would not be here discussing the extradition issue but, unfortunately, that position does not prevail. There is grave concern throughout the country in relation to the extradition arrangements currently being reviewed. I want to put on the record my observations and views on why there are so many problems in relation to this issue and in particular on the strained relationship between our two countries.  Extradition strikes against the whole historic aspirations and concept of Ireland as a Thirty-two County entity, part of whose national territory is still under occupation by a foreign power.  Ireland's right to sovereignty, independence and unity is inalienable and indefatigable.  Partition was imposed on Ireland against the wishes of an overwhelming majority of the people of Ireland and the imposition of partition has led to a permanent problem concerning the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>The Most Reverend Dr. John Austin Baker, Anglican Bishop of Salisbury, a leading Anglican the ologian who was also Chaplin to the British House of Commons at the time of the 1981 hunger strike, said of Britain that her injustice created the situation and by constantly repeating that they would maintain it as long as a majority in the Six Counties wish they actively inhibit Protestant and Catholic from working out a new future together.  This is the root of the violence and the reason the protestors think of themselves as political offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many major constitutional documents <Col N="488" /> of this State repudiate all British claims over any part of the national territory. Neither Britain nor a small minority selected by Britain has any right to partition this ancient island of Ireland.  It is worth quoting from some of these documents, leaving aside the Easter 1916 Proclamation and the 1919 Declaration of Independence which were adopted before Partition and which obviously assert our national unity.  We can still look at the 1937 Constitution adopted by the people of this State and the unanimous declaration of Dáil Éireann on 10 May 1949.  Article 2 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states that the national territory consists of the whole territory of this island and the territorial seas.  Article 3 speaks of the reintegration of our national territory and the right of the Parliament and Government established by the Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory.</P>
    <P>The 1949 declaration adopted unanimously under the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, and the then leader of the Opposition, Eamon de Valera, solemnly reasserts the indefatigable right of the Irish nation to the unity and integrity of the national territory.  It reaffirms the sovereign right of the people of Ireland to choose their own form of Government and, through their democratic institutions, to decide all questions of national policy, free from outside interference, repudiating the claim of the British Parliament to enact legislation affecting Ireland's territorial integrity and violation of those rights and pledging the determination of the Irish people to continue the struggle of the unjust and unnatural partition of a country until it is brought to a successful conclusion.  It records the indignant protest against the introduction in the British Parliament of legislation purporting to endorse and continue the existing Partition of Ireland and calls on the British Government and people to end the present occupation of our six north-eastern counties and thereby enable the unity of Ireland to be restored and the age long difference between the two nations to be brought to an end.  That declaration was sent to the <Col N="489" /> Governments and Parliaments of all countries with which Ireland had diplomatic relations.  It is the only unanimous declaration of the Dáil on the Partition issue.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt from all of those earlier statements and the litany of oppression endured by the Northern Nationalist community since Partition that the conflict in the North is political. As Congressman, Joe Kennedy, stated after his recent visit, he was in no doubt that the people resorted to violence because of the attitude of the British and their rule in the North.  Given that there is a political conflict at the root of violence in the North, that Britain's presence is at the root of that conflict, bearing in mind the violation of the feelings of the majority of Irish people and also of most British people, and the violation of the major constitutional documents of this State, it would be very difficult for any Irish Government to extradite people to the Six Counties or to Britain without ensuring beyond all reasonable doubt that any warrant received from the Six Counties or Britain conformed to the provisions of the Extradition Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>In prevailing circumstances it is very difficult to allow people to be extradited to Britain since they still occupy part of our national territory.  In those circumstances I have a difficulty, in that, to my mind, extraditing people to the North or Britain recognises the right of the British to be in Ireland and to impose their will and laws on our country, flouting our aspirations and the constitutional position of this State.</P>
    <P>It has now come to the point at which people who oppose the British presence in our country are branded as common criminals.  I have no apologies to offer to anybody for my views in relation to the occupation of this country or with regard to extraditing people for offences of which they may be guilty to the Six Counties or to Great Britain.  Having said that I want to place on record that, while I may accept that many of them are misled, that many may be of the firm conviction that they are engaged in a process of freeing this country of an oppressor, as a <Col N="490" /> constitutional politician &mdash; who believes that the law of this land must be upheld &mdash;I believe that people who perpetrate such atrocities must also face the consequences of the laws of the country in which they may have committed them. In view of the present attitude of the British Government to this country, which they do not recognise to be a sovereign independent nation, then we have an obligation to ensure that there are safeguards in our extradition laws so that any person sought in another jurisdiction is protected to the full before being sent out of the country and has a proper case to answer.  That is the position as I see it and I am firmly convinced that many people in the country are of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil acted correctly in having introduced the safeguards in the Extradition Act, 1987.  Indeed, were it not for those safeguards people could have been handed across virtually on demand.  The record of my party has never been in doubt with regard to dealing with subversives or people who have offended against the State.  They dealt with the problems that obtained in the thirties, forties and fifties.  I have no doubt that any Fianna Fáil Government in office would be prepared to do whatever was found to be necessary.  Indeed, the present Government are doing so in supporting the safeguards enshrined in the Extradition Act of 1987.</P>

      <P>As I had begun to say, there is not a great deal I want to add to what my colleagues Deputies S. Barrett and Peter Barry have already said.  But it should be pointed out in this House that it would be utterly absurd to pretend or to find ourselves in a position in which the only options facing this House would be to drop the 1987 safeguards or continue their operation indefinitely.</P>
      <P>This is a sovereign Legislature and must be free to make its own decisions. If the Dáil agrees with my proposal that we put a term to the operation of these safeguards, pending a further review, that most certainly would not be going outside the original intentions of the 1987 Act.</P>
      <P>We should also reflect on where the roots of today's debate lie.  They go back quite a long while but one of the strongest reasons for today's debate are to be found in a debate in this House in November and December 1986 in relation to the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Bill, 1986, subsequently enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part of the reason for the difficulties about this issue today is to be found in the utterly disgraceful performance of the Fianna Fáil Party in the course of that debate.  In the course of that debate &mdash; and the Official Report clearly shows it &mdash; speaker after speaker in the Fianna <Col N="492" /> Fáil Party, most notable among them at the time being Deputy Dr. Woods, the present Minister for Social Welfare attempted to obscure the whole issue. The whole tenor of Fianna Fáil's contribution to that debate was designed to create the pretence that that Bill invented extradition or the handing over of requested persons from this country to the United Kingdom or to any jurisdiction within it.  Of course that was not the case.  I begin to believe we are making some progress when I read and remember what the Taoiseach said here today.  I will quote two passages from his speech:</P>
    <P>Today's motion proposes to renew the safeguards contained in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  That is its only purpose and that will be its single effect.  If the motion were not adopted, this would not mean that our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North would be suspended. Those arrangements would remain because the Extradition Act, 1965 and the Extradition (European Convention of the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 would still be part of our law.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say later:</P>
    <P>We are not concerned today, either, with a general review of the operation of the extradition arrangements we have with Britain and the North.  Issues affecting the operation of those arrangements as a whole will be a matter for another day when we come to debate the report which the Government is required under section 6 of the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 to make to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the operation of Part III of the 1965 Act.  That review of the operation of Part III in its entirety is a quite separate matter from the renewal of the 1987 Amendment Act which is what today's motion is about.</P>
    <P>I had the experience earlier this evening of looking at an RTE television news programme just after 6 o'clock and one of the items carried on that was a series of interviews conducted with various Members of this House on the plinth <Col N="493" /> outside.  One of those Deputies was Deputy Davern who has been a contributor on and off to the debate about extradition.  The Deputy was at some pains to explain that the debate in this House today is about the safeguards and only about these particular safeguards. The Deputy went on to say &mdash; and I felt almost like applauding him &mdash; that we must have extradition and that extradition must be part of the legal system in any civilised state.  The reason I felt like applauding that statement from Deputy Davern is that it is a new approach from Fianna Fáil Deputies to be quite so unambiguous about extradition, about the safeguards in the Act and about what this debate is all about this evening.  I welcome it and I am glad to see it.  I am happy that the Members of Fianna Fáil in this House tonight are finally going to end the ambiguity and the pretence they have spent the best part of two years cultivating, and perhaps even longer than that, because there is no doubt about the fact that by their approach to this whole issue and particularly since the end of 1986 they have sown the whirlwind and they are reaping it now.  Earlier on this evening Deputy Spring illustrated just what a whirlwind it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring discussed the situation that faces the Attorney General at present and he said that if the Attorney General decides to give a direction that the warrant that is in place in a case at present before him should be executed he could be unleashing a hurricane of political activity and protest that could do terrible damage to this country at least in the short term and that if he decides not to give a direction he could be ensuring that the possibility of securing progress towards peace and reconciliation on this island is set back for years.  There is not a lot of exaggeration in what Deputy Spring said and the reason why the situation is as he has described is because there has been so much ambivalence and ambiguity on the part of Fianna Fáil deputies for so long on this issue of extradition.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many Members of Fianna Fáil at meetings over the past few <Col N="494" /> weeks, not to speak of the last few years, have taken the trouble to point out that we have had a backing of warrants procedure between this country and the UK since 1922 and not just since 1965?  How many Deputies in Fianna Fáil have gone to the trouble to point that out?  How many of them have gone to the trouble of pointing out that successive Fianna Fáil Governments over the past 66 years have stuck to these arrangements and have implemented them even at times when it has been politically hard for them to do so.  They stuck to those arrangements because it was the right thing to do and because there is an interest in this country and in our neighbouring country in keeping down violence, in combating the people who would seek to impose their will on others by violence.  Let us be clear about it: it was a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice who codified the whole system in 1965 and who gave us among other things Part III of the 1965 Extradition Act.</P>
    <P>This debate has been very important because at the end of it when this House makes its decision tonight I fully expect that the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party will march through the lobby and say with their feet, which is the way it counts in this House, that they accept, agree with and support the necessity for arrangements under which we will hand over persons who are to be charged in another jurisdiction, because we believe that is a right and proper part of the legal system that we should have in any civilised country.</P>
    <P>During the course of the past few weeks there has been what I could only call a movement of rediscovery in which the Taoiseach has shared and in which Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Minister for Justice have shared.  They have rediscovered the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976 and time after time during that period it has been trotted out as the solution to our problem.  The Taoiseach mentioned it today in his speech where he dealt with it in some detail.  He pointed out that the record of prosecutions under the 1976 Act in cases <Col N="495" /> relating to extra territorial jurisdictions was impressive and he gave the statistics. The Taoiseach concluded.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that greater use should be made of that legislation in future and that by invoking its provisions in appropriate cases it will be possible to find an appropriate way of tackling the common problem of the fugitive offender.</P>
    <P>I agree that where it is appropriate we should use the Act but I would strongly advise the Ministers, Deputies and others in the Fianna Fáil Party when they invoke that Act to make sure before doing so that they read it.  I will read the Long Title of that Act.  It is called</P>
    <P>An Act to extend the criminal law of the State to certain acts done in Northern Ireland, to provide for the admission of evidence obtained by the examination of witnesses in Northern Ireland at trials for offences in respect of those acts, to enable evidence to be obtained by the examination of witnesses in the State for trials in Northern Ireland for corresponding offences under the law of Northern Ireland in respect of acts done in the State, to reform the criminal law in other respects and to provide for related matters.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of that Act should be a required part of the impedimenta of every Member of the Fianna Fáil Party and of many other people who go around this country talking about extradition, because the context of that is very clear.</P>
    <P>Earlier on the Taoiseach suggested that we should be circumspect with reference to a particular case.  I do not intend to inflame anything by what I might say about a particular case but that Long Title, if properly read, would prevent many people around this country from making asses of themselves and from pretending that the law provides for something for which it does not provide.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill at this time last year and during the course of <Col N="496" /> today we pointed out that we have reservations about these particular safeguards and about the role allocated to our Attorney General in the Act that is now before us.  We have pointed out that we do not have enough experience of the operation of these safeguards to be confident that they are what we need.  We pointed out, and I pointed out about two years ago, that apart from anything else that was going on, the then Government of which I was Minister for Justice, had taken up the question of safeguards and proper procedures with the United Kingdom authorities and had come to a number of conclusions with them.  The Government chose to go further in the way that is contained in the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>I am far from being convinced that the precise method chosen was the correct one and I do not think this House has before it enough information about the operation of those safeguards to be able to say with any confidence that the indefinite continuation of these safeguards is the right course of action for us to take.  I do not believe that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed Deputy Dukes suddenly discovered that Fianna Fáil members had standards, but if he mixed a little more he might find that other members also had standards. Fianna Fáil have always adopted strong resolutions, particularly in the thirties and forties when conditions were even more severe.  The record will show they did what had to be done during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate deals with public concern about extradition.  I do not believe that concern is any greater this year than it was last year.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Dukes try to stir the pot a little. He did not include safeguards in the legislation when he was a Minister of the Government which introduced this legislation in 1986.  The Fianna Fáil Government reacted to that legislation by bringing in amending legislation which included these safeguards because if the public are not happy that there are safeguards in this legislation, there is the <Col N="497" /> possibility that they will be liable to fall prey to the propaganda of others.  There is a very thin line between the emotionalism of some people and joining an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the safeguards in this Act are being renewed.  This is a credit not just to the present Attorney General but to past Attorneys General, including Deputy Kelly.  Our Attorneys General have always been men of high standing.</P>
    <P>We are happy that the Attorney General will be the proper person to adjudicate on applications under the 1987 Act.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the lack of sensitivity displayed by a Prime Minister of another country last week.  I was delighted at the restraint exercised by the Taoiseach and the Government compared with the indignation and insensitive statements of that Prime Minister.  I applaud the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice for their lead.  They have given a great sense of dignity to the country and to the House.  They have set the pattern for others to follow.  They set the guidelines for the law abiding citizens of this country who were incensed at that attack not only on our Government but on the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>What worries me slightly is that although there is extradition to Northern Ireland, there is still no progress on the Diplock court system, the replacement of a jury by one judge who has to decide the issue, and now he has the added problem of the right to silence which makes his work much more difficult.  I urge the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to keep pressing for a change in the Diplock court system and the re-introduction of a three-judge system.  In this way, we can be assured that that safeguard is not only included in the 1987 Act but that it is there in the North where there will be a fair judgement, one which can be seen to be fair by all.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the controversy which has been very cleverly used by members of the Provisional IRA to stir the emotions and to get people involved in their activities.  Today, the Taoiseach urged that more use would be made of <Col N="498" /> the Criminal Jurisdiction Act.  I hope that will be considered particularly in the present circumstances and acted upon by the British.  The recent extradition case involves three countries and is extremely sensitive.  There is a serious lack of confidence in the British judicial system, not merely in the application of justice but also in the imposition of penalties.  That is the perception of the Irish people and as long as it exists, we will have extreme difficulty in persuading our people to accept certain facts.</P>
    <P>No Government have ever doubted that there is and always will be a need for extradition.  There have been over 800 extraditions from the Republic and 1,000 from the other side.  This proves that this practice has been in operation for a number of years, but it also shows that we must have this type of agreement for criminal as well as subversive activities. If the people of Northern Ireland are to be considered, the British must co-operate in the area of the Diplock courts bearing in mind the sensitivity of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I hope this motion will get unanimous support tonight.  While there is a number of amendments down, I do not believe the Fine Gael amendment is very strong nor that they feel very strongly about it.  It is a reflection on the long line of honourable and decent law officers who acted as agents for all Governments over many years.  I hope future Governments when appointing law officers will ensure that these very high standards are maintained. We have had a very high standard among our law officers since 1922 and will continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite welcome to answer for yourself.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be said at the outset, and reiterated time and again, that this debate is not about whether we should have extradition on the Statute Book, but that to a certain extent it is <Col N="500" /> about whether we should have safeguards and what safeguards we should have for individuals whose extradition is sought from this country.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that extradition procedures as between the United Kingdom and Ireland operate under a less onerous and cumbersome mechanism than operates between Ireland and many other countries.  There is a history of almost automatic backing of warrants between the two countries, without the necessity to enter into a treaty or convention. To that end it must be pointed out in this House and beyond, that there is a privileged relationship between the United Kingdom and this country with regard to extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the 1965 Extradition Act deals particularly with the situation between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Under that Act, extradition between Ireland and other countries had to be agreed at a later date by convention or treaty.  Ireland undertook to ratify the European Convention on Terrorism on signing the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in order to fulfil that commitment it was necessary to amend our legislation so as to rule out a defence against extradition on the ground of the offence being political or committed in connection with a political offence.  That, in effect, is what the 1987 Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act implemented.  However, this Act was not to come into operation until 1 December 1987.  During that period after which the Convention legislation was passed and in the latter part of the year, Fianna Fáil backbench opinion was fanned into believing that vast numbers of our citizens were going to be at risk following on the ratification of the European Convention on Terrorism and that there was a possibility that they would not allow the Convention to be implemented. The Government then found, due to a number of horrific incidents of a terrorist nature occurring around that time that they were forced to ratify the Convention, but felt the necessity to put some kind of political gloss on their about turn <Col N="501" /> and so we had the Extradition (Amendment) Act passed last December.</P>
    <P>Following that legislation, the Attorney General, a political appointee, is an integral part of the procedures, having been given the responsibility of certifying that there is a clear indication to prosecute and that this intention is founded in the existence of sufficient evidence. In that connection, I would like to point out that Deputy Ahern earlier in this debate tried in some roundabout way to differentiate between the Attorney General acting in his capacity as legal adviser to the Government and the Attorney General acting under the provisions of this Act.  There is no difference. It is the same person, he holds the same office.  You cannot say he is acting in a semi- or quasi-judicial capacity with regard to this Act and at the same time say that he is not acting as a judge.  It was the Progressive Democrats' opinion at the time of the passing of that Act, and it remains so, that this new function of the Attorney General is a quasi-judicial function at the very least and is, therefore, constitutionally suspect.</P>
    <P>The other direct result of the involvement of the Attorney General in the extradition process is that that process itself becomes politicised.  As I have said the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and reports directly to the Taoiseach.  He is a political appointee who loses office with the Government.  The close relationship between the Government and the Attorney General, taken together with his responsibility for consenting to the endorsement of extradition warrants, especially where many of those warrants concern people wanted for quasi-political offences, sets a very dangerous trend. At the very least, the Attorney General leaves himself open to allegations of political pressure, despite the provisions within that Act.  No matter what way he makes his decision, those allegations can be made.</P>
    <P>There is the added aspect that the opinion the Attorney General forms, on which basis the consent to extradite is either given or withheld, is formed <Col N="502" /> behind closed doors, with no reasons given and, therefore, no way of countering the information he has considered. That is a remarkably difficult part of the amendment Act to stomach.  If we are talking about safeguards, they should be out in the public eye.  We should know whose extradition is being looked for, we should know whether it has been granted and we should also know on what grounds the decision was taken.  It is the very antithesis of a real democracy which incorporates a proper judicial system to find that decisions are taken in that Star-Chamber like manner, behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>This is one of the major reasons the whole extradition process between Britain and Ireland has become politicised and the reaction, therefore, to a perceived failure on the Irish Administration's part to extradite is seen as being politically motivated in Britain. This Parliament was treated to a bally-ragging by the British Prime Minister last week on an individual extradition case in a way that indicated a real lack of appreciation of legal provisions in this country.  It was either that or a deliberate intervention which in itself jeopardises the extradition process in this and other cases.</P>
    <P>Overnight many people in Ireland reacted against the tone and content of Mrs. Thatcher's remarks and those of her Government.  Opinion is now polarised to such an extent that the whole process of extradition between the two countries is at risk.  This is one of the consequences of introducing a political element into the decision-making process on this side of the Irish Sea, that is, the role of the Attorney General in vetting extradition applications.  Real work will have to be done immediately and continue over the next number of months on rebuilding relationships within the Anglo-Irish conference and particularly at head of Government level so as to further an appreciation of the political realities and difficulties facing both Governments.  It is simply not good enough to allow a useful tool, that is extradition, in the fight against terrorism to become sidelined <Col N="503" /> through the politicisation of its mechanisms.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to another provision which relates to combating terrorism and to which the Taoiseach referred in his address to the House earlier in this debate, that is, the use of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1976. It is worthy of note that in the debate on that Bill, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey in Opposition, failed to endorse the objectives of that Bill.  He also cast some doubt on whether it could be operated and said that if it were enacted it would provoke violence and disorder among the public.  When he was in Government in 1982 and the Act was on the Statute Book and available for use, he refused to operate it.  According to a report in a book called <i>The Boss</i>, which has not been denied by the Taoiseach himself or by anybody else, he called a meeting of Ministers, ambassadors and departmental secretaries before whom a member of the Garda Síochána laid a scenario, the same scenario, I might add, as the Taoiseach Deputy Haughey had laid before the Dáil when he spoke on the Bill, and that was that there would be public disorder and violence if the Act was used.  After that the Act was not used.  We must be in some real doubt as to whether this Government are committed to using that Act.  There is a place for using that Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but not in substitution for extradition, I tell Deputy Cowen.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that one of the three major safeguards the Taoiseach referred to in this legislation which was passed a year ago was that the rule of specialty was to be extended to extradition as between Ireland and Britain.  Up to that point it had simply been available to those who were being extradited to other countries. The Minister for Justice was by that legislation enabled to bring in an order which prevents those who are being extradited from being tried for any <Col N="504" /> offences other than the ones in the charge.  The Minister has had one year in which to bring in that order and I for one do not accept the excuse given that administratively there have been problems or negotiations were ongoing with the British.  It is not good enough in this day and age when there is real doubt about the ability of an Irish person to obtain justice in some British courts, to allow a year to go by and one of the major safeguards in this Act not to be implemented.  I call on the Minister for Justice to get going and bring in this rule of specialty.  Why should it apply to those extradited to other countries and not apply as between Britain and Ireland?</P>
      <P>Finally I would like to draw the attention of the House to some claims by Deputies in the Government party that it is not possible to involve a real judicial process, as opposed to a quasi one which the Attorney General holds, in the examination of evidence relating to Irish nationals who are sought for extradition to Britain.  An argument is being put forward that the European Convention on Extradition precludes this country from involving any type of <i>prima facie</i> evidence or case under the terms of that Convention.  That is simply not so.  I have been advised by a number of people that what happened at the time of our ratifying that Convention was that we put down a marker about whom we were defining as our nationals, and they were to be citizens of Ireland.  Having done that we are enabled to introduce evidentiary rules in relation to the extradition of our own nationals.  We are certainly precluded from introducing different rules in relation to non-nationals, but in relation to our nationals we may allow a judicial process to take place which requires certain evidentiary rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see why, on the advice of, I presume, the Department of Foreign Affairs, this Government have not investigated this possibility in a greater way. The Progressive Democrats amendment which we placed to this motion today and which was disallowed was looking for the services of a High Court Judge to be substituted for those of the Attorney <Col N="505" /> General, in other words to put it on a proper judicial basis.  We regard the situation as being open to that under the Convention on Extradition.  We see no reason why such substitution cannot be done.  I ask the Minister for Justice in his review of the whole extradition process, which I know is to take place early in the New Year, to have regard to that and to the real politicising of the extradition process when the Attorney General is being used, and to the fact that the whole process is therefore put further at risk the more it is politicised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach tonight said acceptance and support are essential to the operation of extradition.  I put it to him, lest he does not know through the members of his party and otherwise, that he has neither the acceptance nor the support of the majority of the Irish people for extradition to Britain and the Six Counties at present, and the sooner he wakes up to this the more likely he and his Government are to begin to act as representatives of the people rather than as lackeys of the British occupation of this country.  I have listened attentively to what has been said here tonight and if it was not so serious it would really be farcical.  We see all sorts of rabbits being pulled out of a hat and so many red herrings being pulled across that our quota on the Celtic Sea would be filled as far as the EC would be concerned, and what is it all about?  Each and every speaker trying to be better than the one who went before as to how and why we should have extradition.</P>

    <P>I differentiate entirely and completely between extradition to any other civilised country in the world and extradition to Britain and the Six Counties, and I draw a line at that.  To those who trot out the 1965 and 1920 Acts or procedures since then, let me say that we all must have been educated very clearly on the sort of system we would export those we extradite today to by sending them to Britain. Have we forgotten the Birmingham Six for whom we have our people going round the world trying to influence people of other States to try and get their <Col N="506" /> freedom because the belief is that they are innocent?  Have we forgotten the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven and more recently the Winchester Three?  We have the incredible situation of those who are peddling that view on the one hand supporting extradition to the very system that has brought about what they worldwide are decrying as lack of justice for Irish people or people charged with offences relating in any degree to the freeing of part of this country.  It is farcical and would be funny if it were not so serious.</P>
    <P>To Fine Gael one might accord the doubtful compliment that they have been consistent since they took the name &ldquo;Fine Gael&rdquo; and before that right down to their foundation.  At least that can be said of them, which is much more than can be said of the present Government.  This is the Government whose party opposed tooth and nail the Anglo-Irish Agreement under which we were obliged to sign the European Convention for the Suppression of Terrorism directly from which came the Extradition Act which Fine Gael and their supporters in the Coalition in those days in 1986 put through this House on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle, much against the opposition of Fianna Fáil and a few others, but carried it was by the merest thread of the Ceann Comhairle's casting vote to bring it about.  It had none of these trappings we are talking about tonight, that is the alleged safeguards.  I say &ldquo;alleged safeguards&rdquo; now; they were alleged safeguards when those of us who thought so opposed them this time last year.  They are really a charade, nothing more, nothing less.  The Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice come in to talk, tongue in cheek, about a review after 12 months.  Review of what?  Review the safeguards that never were, that have not yet been shown up to be what they are, a fake.  They have not been tried.  At least Fine Gael's amendment is consistent in seeking to let us do it for another year and have another review and in the meantime we may have evidence to show whether the safeguards are safeguards or, what many of us think, <Col N="507" /> merely window dressing in order to get the party to come in and do with their feet what they do not really think in their minds,</P>
    <P>The sad part about this is that there really is nothing to debate, as nothing has happened in the 12 months since the passing of the Extradition Act.  All we are allowed to talk about here tonight are the safeguards, but there have been no cases that they apply to.  We are hearing the same refrain, that in the interests of the suppression of terrorism we have to have extradition to Great Britain who occupies our Six Counties and whose long litany of offences against human rights and civil rights are well documented in the European courts, in the Council of Europe.  We cannot but be aware of the Stalker-Sampson debacle and the case of Private Thain, one of the very few peacekeeping security force members ever tried, who was sentenced to life for murder and did two years and is now back in his unit; in fact we find that he was never off the role of that unit and I would go so far as to say that he was paid as a private while he did the two years on foot of his murder conviction.  That is very different to the 25 years for the Winchester Three, to the 14 or so years that the Birmingham Six have done &mdash; and the world believes them innocent.</P>

      <P>I am on fairly good ground in any event.  The Members of this House should stop crying about the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four and the Winchester Three while they are, at the same time, prepared by their votes in the lobbies here to commit Irish citizens to the tender mercies of the mob of Gough Barracks and Castlereagh torture centres. Surely it is ludicrous that they should do so.  Yet, they are putting a face on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> Let us take the point where the Attorney General enters into this matter, or is supposed to enter into it &mdash; he did not get the opportunity until a few days ago.  Where a warrant is received in respect of a person who has already been convicted of the offence in question he does not come within the scope of the new procedure.  A lad from my home town, Jim Clarke by name, was with several others committed to Long Kesh on the evidence of a supergrass.  Jim Clarke, with a few others, escaped, but a number were still held.  The supergrass was so discredited that eventually his mates were allowed out because they were wrongly convicted.  Even in the North it was agreed that they were wrongly convicted.  What is happening here now? Clarke is before our courts, on appeal at the moment, because of the conviction that was quashed in respect of his friends who were released from Long Kesh and in addition to that there is the charge on the warrant that he had escaped from the Maze.  Could one get anything more crazy than that?  This man is now being sought on the original charge, and because he had escaped from the custody he should never have been in.  Another lad from the same town, McIntyre by name, got away on a motor bike and he was wise to have got away because he would be dealt with in the same way as we propose to deal with other people who are innocent.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the Attorney General's function.  Anybody, even those without legal training whatsoever, would agree that the function that is now assigned to the Attorney General &mdash; that he has to be satisfied or of the opinion that a prosecution will take place based on the charges and that he must be further satisfied that there is sufficient evidence &mdash; is a judicial function.  Maybe in the law books it is not described as a judicial function, but is there anything more serious than a case where some person is charged by the authorities in the Six Counties and the Attorney General looks at the warrant and requires more evidence and eventually enough is trumped up to get the Attorney General of the opinion that that person must be sent <Col N="509" /> back for trial?  Surely that is a most serious decision.  It has to do with the freedom of an individual, the freedom of a citizen of this State, and we are prepared &mdash; and I do not think we are entitled to under our Constitution &mdash; to leave it to a non-judicial person or persons to make that decision.  That is wrong. This could and should be tried in a manner that would see it proven one way or the other.</P>
    <P>We say that the 1965 Act was always there.  What we do not recall and what we like to avoid is that in 1965 a political offence was a good defence and that continued not until it was whittled away, as Deputy Ahern said, but until it was totally upended in one fell swoop very late one night by three members of the Supreme Court in order to get McGlinchey across the Border so that Garret would have made his sacrifice to Mrs. Thatcher before he visited her the following week.  That is what happened to the political defence, and not because the Supreme Court defined what a political offence was.  They defined all the things that were not a political offence but nobody, the Supreme Court included, has attempted to define what is and was accepted over the years to be a political offence which was regarded as a good defence.  Anybody who talks about the 1965 Act today should talk about the Supreme Court decision delivered in the small hours of the morning or the late hours of the night, on the eve of St. Patrick's Day or on St. Patrick's Day. That is the sort of thing we are dealing with here.</P>
    <P>There has been talk here about emotional hype and people getting on the bandwagon.  I think it was my friend, Deputy De Rossa, talking here in front of me tonight.  He should know.  He was on the bandwagon long enough himself and so were his cohorts sitting here as well.  They should not forget that and they should not be throwing these snide remarks at other people and describing them as having been hyped and having got on the bandwagon at this particular time.</P>

I may be wrong, and if I am I apologise.  There was not a word about Britain being an institutional judge, jury and executioner on the Rock of Gibraltar.  We forget these things.  We forget McAnespie being shot going to a football match in his own village. We forget the fact that we had an inquiry from down here and a big hullabaloo about it and, likewise, an inquiry in the North which finally decided that it was a ricochet bullet that never should have hit the road to hit the man and that obviously came from the man above.  The fact is it came from a British rifle, fired by a British soldier in a British pillbox on the checkpoint at Aughnacloy, which never should have been fired.  Yet there was no prosecution, and none in relation to the executions in South Armagh, according to the Stalker-Sampson report.</P>
      <P>It is a farce in the extreme to be trying to pretend in Parliament that this is a debate.  There is no time for any debate; it is not sought to expose any of those things and it is much more comfortable to talk glibly about the suppression of terrorism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, the purpose of the motion before this House tonight is to <Col N="511" /> continue in operation the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  Section 7 (4) of that Act provides that the Act itself shall expire on the day that is 12 months after the date of its passing unless a resolution is passed by each House of the Oireachtas before that day declaring that it should continue in operation.  Hence the motion here tonight, with a similar motion in the other House tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I want to deal first with the amendment put down in the name of Deputy Seán Barrett.  The gist of that amendment is that the motion adopted here today should provide for the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 being subject to a further renewal in 12 months time.  That is simply not possible under the terms of section 7 (4) of the Act itself.  The only kind of resolution which that provision allows for is a resolution declaring that the Act should continue in operation after 14 December next.  A resolution which would seek to make the continued operation of the Act after 14 December subject to a further resolution a year from now would be <i>ultra vires</i>, section 7 (4). One cannot amend an Act of the Oireachtas by way of a motion.</P>
      <P>If a resolution were adopted here today which was <i>ultra vires</i> section 7 (4) and void, the effect would be that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 would lapse.  This would mean that the safeguards contained in that Act would cease to apply.  However, any Act can, of course, be amended or repealed by further legislation if the need arises and there is a continuing review mechanism built into this Act in section 6.  The Taoiseach in his opening statement has already referred to that mechanism and to the assurance he gave the Dáil of his intention to set the new arrangements aside if they were not adhered to or to bring forward revised proposals if the arrangements were not working satisfactorily and persons whose extradition was fully justified could evade the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, after more experience of the working of the arrangements provided for in the 1987 Act, it becomes clear that they are not working satisfactorily, either to <Col N="512" /> safeguard the rights of persons wanted for extradition or to ensure that there are not unjustifiable obstacles in the way of extradition, then remedial action will be taken by way of amending legislation. The Government will have to report annually to the Oireachtas under section 6 on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the 1965 Act as a whole. This will mean that our entire extradition arrangements with the North and Britain, including the procedures provided for in the 1987 Act, will be subject to regular monitoring by the Government and full account will be taken of ongoing experience of how these arrangements operate. Any views which the British Government may put to us about the operation of the arrangements will also be considered as part of that review process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett suggested that if the courts were to find that his amendment had caused the legislation to lapse, that could be dealt with by way of a short amending Bill which could be processed quickly but the damage that would be caused to the whole extradition process in the interim would be severe.  The passage of a motion containing this amendment would almost certainly give rise to a challenge to our whole extradition arrangements with the North and Britain and extradition would become paralysed until such a challenge was eventually determined by the Supreme Court.  That is a risk which is simply not worth taking, especially in the light of the review mechanism in section 6 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry inquired as to whether it will be possible to have amendments to the legislation made when the House will receive the first of the annual reports from the Government on the operation of Part III in the New Year.  It is intended that all relevant aspects of our extradition arrangements with Britain and the North will be the subject of that report. However, that is not to say that amendments to the law will necessarily be introduced by the Government at that stage. It is clearly not possible to prejudge at this stage whether such amendments will be required.  It will, of course, be open to Deputy Barry to introduce any legislative <Col N="513" /> proposals he might have in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I now turn to the Father Ryan case but only because it was mentioned by many who contributed to the debate.  I do not want to say too much about it, not only because, in my view, too much has already been said and written about it and not just in this House, but also because the matter is before the Attorney General at present and he has the statutory duty to consider the application under the terms of the 1987 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of that Act &mdash; section 4 &mdash; prohibits communications with the Attorney General and certain other persons for the purpose of influencing the making of a decision under the Act.  That particular provision underlines the legal aspects of the Attorney General's task under the Act.  The decision be must take is of course a legal, or if you like, a quasi-judicial one, and political matters do not enter into the decision at all.  It would be as well if this particular aspect of the matter were to be brought <Col N="514" /> home to some of those who commented on the matter last week.  The decision of the Attorney General will be based on the legal aspects of the case and no amount of political pressure, no matter who exerts it, or where it comes from, will have any bearing on his decision. That is the long and short of the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that the procedures under the 1987 Act may put an unjustified obstacle in the way of extradition in certain cases.  What is being postulated is that some persons who are wanted for charges elsewhere may be found, or may arrive, unexpectedly in the State and that it might not be possible to obtain a provisional warrant until the Attorney General had considered the appropriate information and formed the opinion he is required to form under the Act.  By that time the wanted person might well have evaded justice.</P>
      <P>This suggestion is, of course, based on the fact that a provisional warrant was not obtained in the Fr. Ryan case, though I hasten to add that no speaker has suggested that such a course should have been adopted in that case.  I have to be circumspect in what I say in response to this point both because it impinges on that individual case and because on the more general level it relates to matters that are within the province of the Attorney General's function under the 1987 Act.  However, I can say that it would be unwise to draw any conclusions from the Fr. Ryan case about what might or might not happen in other cases in the matter of provisional warrants.  That case had unique features which militated against the use of the provisional arrest procedure.  An extradition application on the same charges had just been refused by the Belgian Government.  There were indications that the grounds for that refusal included findings that the charges were too vague and did not meet relevant legal requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was not, therefore, a simple one which the Attorney General could <Col N="515" /> have examined in all its aspects and come to a decision upon within the period for which a person sought could have been held on foot of the provisional warrant procedure.  During the period since Fr. Ryan's arrest in Belgium on 30 June last the British authorities made no preparations on a contingency basis for making an extradition request to this country, despite the notoriously high failure rate of extradition applications in all countries and their recent experience of failures in suspected terrorist cases in France and in the United States.  In those two cases the same possibility of the person coming to Ireland had arisen and the experience which the British authorities had had of making preparations on a contingency basis in those cases should have made apparent the need for making such preparations in this case and for making them in adequate time.</P>
    <P>There is also the technical point that the provisional warrant procedure applies only when the Garda do not have the original arrest warrant in their possession and when there is reason to believe that the person sought may be found in the State.  In this case the original warrants were expected to arrive in this jurisdiction at or about the same time as the person sought arrived here, as it transpired, they arrived a few hours afterwards because the flight bringing them was delayed.  In the circumstances, therefore, it would not have been appropriate to invoke the provisional warrant procedure in that case.  Those circumstances were, however, quite exceptional.  There would be no justification for assuming that similar considerations would apply in other cases where the question of a provisional arrest might arise.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested during this debate that the length of time for which a person may be held on foot of a provisional warrant might be extended from three days to some longer period.  That is a matter which falls outside the scope of the motion before the House today and is appropriate for consideration in the context of reviewing the operation of Part III of the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> I wish to say a few words about the amendment to today's motion which was put down by the Leader of the Labour Party and ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  I appreciate that this suggestion was motivated by a concern for the protection of the rights of persons whose extradition is sought and by an awareness of the need to have sufficient and effective safeguards.  However, the Government could not have accepted the amendment, partly because it is simply unnecessary and partly because it seeks to pre-empt the kind of action that might be taken in the future if it transpired that the rights of the persons wanted for extradition were not being adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Underlying the amendment which it was sought to introduce was an implication that the safeguards provided by the different Extradition Acts are inadequate. More specifically there was the implication that, in place of the requirement for the Attorney General to be satisfied that there is a clear intention to prosecute founded on sufficient evidence, provision should be made for a <i>prima facie</i> case to be proved in our courts.</P>
    <P>To debate that suggestion again is in a sense to rehearse the arguments of a year ago.  The Government decided in the context of the then Extradition (Amendment) Bill that such a course would not be the right one following a careful examination of all the issues involved.  To have followed that course would have created obstacles which would represent an undue restriction on legitimate extradition requests.  That still remains our view.  The difficulties which would arise in relation to the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case in the District Court by foreign prosecution authorities outweigh any advantages that approach might have. Such a requirement would inevitably result in an increase in the delay and complication associated with extradition requests.  Prosecuting authorities in a foreign jurisdiction would experience considerable difficulty in preparing a book of evidence that would comply with our court rules and procedures in the time <Col N="517" /> span that would be available in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, provides an alternative safeguard which meets the very same public concerns which prompt those who suggest a <i>prima facie</i> case requirement but which meets those concerns without the associted problems that the latter requirement would have.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act provides a safeguard which is workable and which has proved to be workable.</P>
      <P>The new procedure involving the Attorney General which the 1987 Act provides requires, first, that he must be satisfied that there is a clear intention to prosecute the person sought and, second, that the intention is founded on the existence of a sufficiency of evidence.  More generally, Deputies should not ignore the other safeguards which the various Extradition Acts provide.  There is the provision relating to lapse of time and other exceptional circumstances also provided for in the 1987 Amendment Act.</P>
      <P>Other safeguards include the requirement for the offence for which the person is sought to correspond to an offence under the law of this State which is an indictable offence.  There is also, of course, the possibility of extradition being refused where there are substantial reasons for believing that the person sought will be prosecuted or detained for an offence other than that for which he is sought and which would not have been extraditable because of its political character or where there is reason to believe that the person is being sought for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or where his position would be prejudiced for any of these reasons.  Taken together, these represent a comprehensive code of safeguards under which the Government is satisfied that the rights of the person whose extradition might be sought are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about the making of an <Col N="518" /> order under section 3 of the 1987 Amendment Act applying the rule of specialty to Part III of the 1965 Act.  The position in that regard, as the Taoiseach has already indicated, is that I have yet to make an order under section 3.  Such an order will require a corresponding amendment to the British backing of warrants legislation because the rule of specialty of its nature can operate only if such provision is made in the law of the requesting country.  Discussions to this end are continuing at official level between the two sides.  The fact that the provisions of the 1987 Act will no longer be subject to renewal after today's motion is passed will, of course, have a bearing on the question of the introduction of reciprocal provisions on the British side.</P>
    <P>The fact that an order has not yet been made has not, however, given rise to any problem in practice.  The administrative arrangements which were referred to in the Taoiseach's opening statement ensure that additional charges of a political nature will not be brought after extradition and that the specialty principle is observed.  Those arrangements remain in place and I can assure the House that they are being adhered to in practice.</P>
    <P>In addition there is of course the added safeguard contained in section 50 (2) (b) of the 1965 Act.  Under that provision a person facing extradition to Britain or the North may apply to the High Court to have an order for his return set aside on the ground that there are substantial reasons for believing that he will be prosecuted or detained for a political offence.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by a number of Deputies about the need to be satisfied that persons extradited from the State would receive a fair trial.  In the more specific context of recent events and in the light of past experience, the concern that was being expressed was that the position of such persons would be affected by highly prejudicial stories in newspapers &mdash; what is commonly referred to as trial by media &mdash; and comment in other fora.  It goes without saying that it is a matter of considerable concern to us that an extradited person should get <Col N="519" /> a fair trial in the receiving state.  With regard to the way in which the British press and other media choose to cover extradition applications, I would simply say that those who make and print such comment should know that it does nothing for Britain's reputation for justice and is inimical to the extradition process.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the possible effect of prejudice, I have already mentioned that the Extradition Act, 1965, as amended by the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, provides that extradition shall not be granted for an offence if there are substantial grounds for believing that a person's position would be prejudiced on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion. The courts, therefore, have jurisdiction to refuse extradition in any case where they are satisfied that a person's position would be prejudiced on any of these grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley's speech ranged over a wide area.  In fact, he proposed major changes in the extradition area &mdash; not to mention a substitute procedure in place of extradition.  With the greatest respect to the Deputy, these matters were not for debate here at all today.  These are matters to be raised when the Government reports to the House on the operation of Part III of the 1965 Act early in the New Year.  Today's debate is concerned only with whether the safeguards introduced in the 1987 Act should stay or should lapse.  We can return to the wider issues raised by Deputy O'Malley when the Government's annual report on the operation of the extradition arrangements with Britain and the North, provided for in section 6 of the Act, is presented early next year.</P>
    <P>There were those in the debate who favoured a more extended use of the option of extra-territorial prosecutions under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  The Government favours this approach.  As the Taoiseach indicated, the record in cases where prosecutions have been taken under the Act is quite <Col N="520" /> impressive.  We are committed to exploring with the British Government the means by which greater recourse can be had to the 1976 Act and the parallel British legislation.  Such a course indicates no weakening in our commitment to the extradition process.  Rather it reflects a recognition by both Governments that extradition will not always be the optimum means for dealing with the problem of fugitive offenders and that the process of extradition does not necessarily represent the quickest or surest means of achieving justice in a particular case.</P>
    <P>There will be cases in which an extra-territorial prosecution will be the appropriate response.  The Government are firmly of the view that a greater use of the Act in a wider range of cases is both possible and desirable.  The Government also believe that such a course would have the effect of creating an improved atmosphere for co-operation with our immediate neighbours.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would be less than forthcoming if I were to leave anybody under the impression that extra-territorial prosecutions might in some way replace extradition altogether.  It has to be acknowledged that in certain types of cases trial in a jurisdiction other than the one in which the offence was committed will present practical difficulties.  Beyond that it is also necessary to recognise the limits of what may be achieved under the 1976 Act.  That Act makes it a criminal offence under our law for a person to commit in the North certain scheduled offences which, if committed within the State, would constitute an offence here. Those offences include murder, manslaughter, arson, kidnapping, firearms and explosives offences.  The Act also makes certain explosives offences committed anywhere outside the State by an Irish citizen offences under Irish law.  The choice between the extradition and an extra-territorial prosecution option will be determined in part, therefore, by whether a prosecution is possible here at all by virtue of the Act.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 adds significant <Col N="521" /> new safeguards to those which already exist under previous legislation.  It is important that those new safeguards are preserved.  That is the purpose of <Col N="522" /> tonight's motion and I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to cover the cost of the Government's information and awareness campaign for the completion of the European Single Market which was launched by the Taoiseach on 4 July.</P>
      <P>The entry into force of the Single European Act in 1987 has been the signal for a new surge of activity within the European Community.  After a long period of economic stagnation and internal debate and disagreement about the future development of key Community policies, the member states have decided on a broad set of objectives of which the completion of the internal market and economic and social cohesion are probably the most important.</P>
      <P>This House has already had an opportunity to consider the implications for the Community of the creation of a Single European Market when the published Cecchini report was debated.  It was generally accepted that the lifting of the numerous barriers to the free movement of goods, services and capital and, of course, people would offer many advantages to this country, particularly to industry and commerce provided adequate steps were taken to prepare all those whose economic activity would be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress towards the achievement of a single market is now irreversible.  This was agreed by the Heads of State and <Col N="528" /> Government at the European Council in Hanover earlier this year and more recently in Rhodes.  By the end of the year, the European Commission confidently expects to have tabled over 90 per cent of its legislative programme. Improvements in the decision-making machinery within the Council of Ministers have made an enormous impact in the rate at which agreement on many aspects of the internal market programme have been reached.  The European Council has now called for this rate of progress to be maintained and where possible accelerated.</P>
    <P>The creation of a Single European Market is clearly of enormous historic importance for the European Community but has equally important economic and social implications for the people of Europe.  That is why the deadline of 1992 has caught the imagination of the citizens of Europe and made an indelible impression on their minds.</P>
    <P>When the Government launched their information and awareness campaign at the beginning of July, they did so under the slogan &ldquo;EUROPEN &mdash; Think Ahead, Act Now&rdquo;.  In that slogan, we have attempted to convey the idea of a Europe which is open to the freer movement of trade on which we in this country are dependent as well as to people who wish to move freely throughout the Community whether for business, education, employment or recreation.  We have also tried to give a sense of urgency.  We are, in effect, saying that while 1992 may seem some way off, it is in fact just around the corner in terms of strategic planning and preparation which individuals and firms may be about to undertake.  If we are to benefit from the estimated economic advantages which a unified market will hold, we must begin to make the necessary preparations now.</P>
    <P>In designing the first phase of this campaign, we have tried to do four things: (i) to create awareness about the Single European Market in broad terms; (ii) to provide relevant information on the principal areas where change can be expected; (iii) to highlight the opportunities and the challenges which, with <Col N="529" /> proper preparation, can be seized from the internal market and (iv) to urge individuals and firms to take all appropriate steps to brief themselves and prepare for the single market.  We also recognised the need for a truly national campaign. The Taoiseach spelled this out clearly at the national launch on 4 July when he said that what was required in tackling the challenge of the internal market was the national unity and sense of common purpose that we have in launching and implementing the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Those of you who were in the National Concert Hall on that date will recall that the bodies who are partners with the Government in that programme were represented on the platform with the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I should like to pay tribute to the invaluable role which all the organisations who are partners with the Government in that programme are playing in the EUROPEN campaign.  Their support and co-operation, together with their own energetic programme of activities, has greatly contributed to the success and effectiveness of the campaign as a whole.</P>
    <P>The economic argument for a Single European Market is by now broadly accepted.  The question which is now being asked is not whether it will happen but how can I get ready for it and how exactly will it affect my business and my future?  The Government cannot, and indeed should not, attempt to dictate to each firm or organisation what the correct strategy for any individual group should be.  It is, however, the Government's role to ensure that the conditions on which we participate in the creation of the single market and the benefits which we can expect from it are, given our status as a peripheral, economically underdeveloped part of the Community, both fair and generous.  That is why we attach such importance to the parallel implementation of a meaningful policy for the regional and social development of this country as set out in the Single European Act which specifically calls for the reinforcement of the economic and <Col N="530" /> social cohesion of the European Community. The recent satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations on the reform of the Structural Funds are a vindication of the Government's determination to see reflected in the legislative detail the broad political commitment made by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels in February.</P>
    <P>It was to ensure proper co-ordination of important negotiations such as those to which I have just referred that the Government established a Committee of Ministers and Secretaries which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  This committee, which meets weekly, will also co-ordinate the steps that are needed to adjust to specific features of the internal market programme.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the EUROPEN campaign has been the targeted provision of information and the promotion of specific preparatory action on a sector-by-sector basis through conferences, seminars and group meetings as well as through direct advice and guidance.  In addition, the Government commissioned a major advertising and public relations campaign which is being co-ordinated by the EUROPEN Bureau headed by a full time director attached to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The seminars dealt with the implications of the specific directives most closely affecting the different sectors but also provided guidance on the changes affecting all sectors across the board on how to adapt in the different functions of business such as production, finance, marketing and so on.</P>
    <P>Following the initial launch which focused primarily on raising awareness of the Single Market Programme through television, radio, press and poster advertising, the campaign has moved into higher gear with the series of sectoral conferences to which I have referred.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce, accompanied by representatives of the semi-State agencies most involved in the single market, hosted a nationwide series of seminars at which an estimated 3,500 members of the business community participated.  Other Ministers also held or participated in conferences and <Col N="531" /> many were organised by the national representative bodies which joined the Government in sponsoring the campaign. Such has been the proliferation of conferences since the beginning of September that we estimate that there will have been at least one conference a day on some or other aspect of the Single European Market.</P>
    <P>The Government have also published a set of 14 information leaflets covering key areas of the Single Market Programme and an extensive advertising campaign inviting members of the public to obtain copies will continue until Christmas.  These fact sheets are designed to be updated to take account of developments in the Community and they will be a permanent feature of the campaign.  In addition, over 8,000 copies of a booklet issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce entitled &ldquo;The Opportunity and Challenge for Business&rdquo; were distributed.</P>
    <P>We were also conscious of the interest being taken by young people in the completion of the internal market so we were happy to co-operate with Allied Irish Banks in preparing a special 1992 supplement in the November edition of &ldquo;Young Citizen&rdquo;.  This has been widely distributed in schools and colleges across the country.</P>
    <P>The EUROPEN Bureau are also making a financial contribution towards the cost of a video on the Single European Market which is being made by a production team from the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.  The office of the European Commission in Dublin has generously agreed to contribute 5,000 ECU to the production costs and has paid for the RTE team to travel to Brussels.  The film will last about 35 minutes and is scheduled for broadcast on 13 December.  It is our intention, with the co-operation of RTE, that an edited version of this video will be marketed widely.  We will encourage companies, organisations and schools as well as individuals to obtain a copy.</P>
    <P>The Government drew on the professional services of a private organisation, AIR Call Teledata Services Ltd. <Col N="532" /> to handle the taking and logging of requests for the information leaflets, for their despatch and for generating a data base system for use by the EUROPEN Bureau.  The advertising and public relations firms were retained by the Government following the submission of competitive tenders and their fees together with other external payments will be met in accordance with the Government's contracting procedures.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the momentum of the campaign has been successfully maintained.  A solid basis of information on what is involved has been relayed through conferences, seminars and information leaflets to a wide crosssection of the population, especially the business community.  There has also been extensive well informed coverage in the media of the issues which the Single European Market must address.</P>
    <P>The EUROPEN Bureau, in consultation with the private sector and public sector, which have come together in a co-ordination committee on the campaign, are preparing a detailed action programme for 1989.  Feedback from the campaign is already showing a growing demand for more detailed information on the implications for specific sectors of economic activity.  The campaign will respond to this demand in the most effective and co-ordinated way possible.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of the need to have a detailed and sophisticated survey of Irish industry and business to gauge the effectiveness of the campaign in raising consciousness and encouraging serious preparation.  I have no doubt that information from such a survey would be of great assistance in planning certain aspects of the next phase of the campaign.</P>
    <P>A year ago or even six months ago, it would have been hard to imagine that the &ldquo;spirit of 1992&rdquo; would have caught the interest and attention of the public and the business community as much as it has done.  There is now a widespread acceptance of the need to prepare for 1992 and the Government are determined to ensure that together with the sectoral bodies, the social partners and <Col N="533" /> other representative organisations, this country will be among the best prepared of any in the Community to take full advantage of the opportunities which will undoubtedly present themselves as the single market becomes a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister of State for her long and detailed speech in the 15 minutes available to her.  Fine Gael accept the Estimate and will not make it an issue for a vote.  The amount involved is rather small and we accept the fact that the money has been spent in pursuit of legitimate aims.</P>
      <P>The sum of £300,000 has been spent on a marketing campaign.  It was a reasonably effective marketing campaign in so far as it helped to create added awareness about the Single European Market in broad terms fulfilling the first objective of the Minister's list of objectives in his speech.  However, the nature of marketing campaigns, whether they are an attempt to sell soap powder, microwave ovens or the latest trouser press, is to depict one's product as faultless and flawless, better than any other product around and something which you absolutely must have.  In terms of the campaign, I congratulate the marketing company for fulfilling those objectives very well indeed but the Government have not fulfilled the role they should fulfil in this case.  The marketing of 1992 has been overdone.  One side of the argument has been presented but the very real difficulties which will face us in 1992 have been almost ignored.  Certainly an awareness has been created but I doubt if all the relevant information on the principal areas where change can be expected has been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of this campaign Ministers <Col N="534" /> wander the country.  The present Minister for Finance, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, made a series of statements.  I got a copy of his script on one occasion in which the benefits of 1992 were marketed very well indeed but the difficulties were scarcely referred to. While it might be the role of a marketing company to show how attractive 1992 will be, it is not the role of Government to give a one-sided presentation of what is happening.  This is where I would fault the Government's campaign to date and they should adjust it very quickly.</P>
    <P>Opportunities and challenges have been highlighted but difficulties have not been highlighted.  While individuals and firms have been urged to take appropriate steps to brief themselves and prepare for the single market the Government have not done the same thing.  They have dismally failed to fulfil their role in leading with the changes which are necessary for 1992.  I do not think the Government should see themselves simply as Ireland's midwife delivering us into an internal market in 1992.  There are things which they must do and there are real issues which must be faced.  Otherwise we will miss the second opportunity which Europe is providing us with, having half missed the first one in the years following 1 January 1973.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael put forward the following priorities.  Probably the most important objective is that we cut the cost of access for people, goods and services to and from Ireland in 1992.  If we do not do this we will not survive.  At present, as a peripheral country, we suffer the most serious of disadvantages.  There are too many air companies in Europe and too many people employed in these companies. The cost of travel to passengers is too high and economic growth and development in the peripheral areas is being penalised by this.  You can survive high cost transport, whether by air, sea or internally, if you are in the centre but when you are on the periphery you are in trouble if the transport costs are extravagant and they are very extravagant in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out in our policy <Col N="535" /> document for 1992 that air services in Europe are 60 per cent more costly than in America, that aircraft maintenance costs in Europe are 119 per cent higher than in the US, that airline administration costs are 365 per cent higher and that ground and passenger services costs are 315 per cent higher.  It is about time the Government, at their meetings and seminars around the country, began to point out these figures to the businessmen who will be availing of access transport in the export led drive the Government are expecting from them.  We must make reduced airline and communications costs a number one priority if we are to survive.  Peripheral areas can do very well and industry can be located in those areas if people can move freely towards, communicate cheaply with, the centre.</P>
    <P>Again, in the area of communications costs we are way out of line.  It was pointed out in <i>The Sunday Times</i> during the summer that the price per phone connection in Europe is between £120 sterling and £265 sterling as against only £53 sterling in the United States.  Within Europe Ireland's general charges are exceptionally high.  Telephone charges here are 60 per cent above the European average.  Inexpensive telecommunications services allow business to stay in the outlying regions whereas expensive services force it to congregate in the large centres.  Ireland, led by whatever Government are in power, should again be in the lead, pressing for the implementation of a deregulated telephone system and for a structure of charges that benefits peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>Not all parts of the Community will develop together after 1992.  The cleverest of marketing agents, fulfilling the mandate given to them by the Government, presenting 1992 as such a desirable objective, will not contribute anything to the economic development of Ireland unless the real issues are faced.  The same case I have made applies to the difficulties with which sea travel will present us. Once the channel tunnel is built we will be the only North Atlantic offshore island, certainly the only island nation, in the <Col N="536" /> Community.  When we match that with the concept of &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; delivery, which is now cutting business costs dramatically and which is so crucial to reducing the overall costs of business by cutting down warehousing space and time, we will have extreme difficulties if our access costs by sea remain at their present level.</P>
    <P>We also have infrastructural problems. There is a combination of an inefficient road network, high excise duties on articulated trucks and on carbon oil and hydrocarbon fuels.  It costs 40 per cent more here to transport a metric tonne than it does in the United Kingdom. Under the heading of transport costs alone, whether internal or access costs, our economy will take a frightful beating after 1992 in that area.  It is a fallacy to go around the country presenting one side of the argument to the Irish people without looking at all sides of it.</P>
    <P>I am restrained by the time available to me from going into the area of competition which is also a priority area.  As a peripheral nation it is only in competition that we can survive.  I could say a lot about the teaching of languages such as German, Spanish and Italian in our schools and about how funds are going to be spent but I have not the time.  One area which I have time to refer to, an area which has been neglected, is the whole area of tax harmonisation.  I read Deputy Reynolds' speech in Limerick and he never mentioned that matter. That is one issue that affects the Irish people.  If we are to highlight the opportunities and the challenges of 1992 we should talk about tax harmonisation.  It is being stated in this House and this city at present that there will be a loss to the Exchequer of £480 million.  I do not know on what premise that figure is based.</P>
    <P>What is the Government's position. Are they going to comply with the proposal of the Commission to harmonise VAT?  If we put VAT on zero rated items such as food, children's clothes and shoes, oral medicines, animal feedingstuffs and books, are we going to move in at the top of the recommended band or at the bottom?  The House probably knows that two tax bands have been <Col N="537" /> recommended.  We are told that socially sensitive items can be taxed at between 4 and 9 per cent and that there can be a standard rate of between 13 and 20 per cent.  In order to remain under the standard rate it seems we will have to put 8 or 9 per cent on the socially sensitive items.  Will we put 4 per cent on those items and suffer the loss or will we look for compensation from Europe, just as we did when we entered the EMS, until the buoyancy of revenue comes through from greater activity in the economy.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Are we going to harmonise excise duty?  Are we prepared for the political decision which will reduce the price of cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol and increase the price of food?  Only today a survey conducted in the United Kingdom was brought to my attention suggesting that the increase in living costs of the bottom 10 per cent of people on the lowest incomes there will be 15.5 per cent after 1992 on the basis of present recommendations of the Commission, whereas the increase in the cost of living for their top 10 per cent of income earners will be 5 per cent.  Are we to have a Europe which divides us even more?  Will the marketing agency and the Minister of State's colleague in Cabinet not point out some of these issues as they move around the country?  Why has nobody talked about the necessity to harmonise deposit interest retention tax?  If we are to have free movement of capital within Europe will not that automatically go to the area of least taxation?  Will the deposit interest retention tax be removed with a loss of £250 million to the Irish Exchequer?  Will we have harmonisation of unit trusts within insurance companies?  How will the Custom House Docks site and the Financial Services Centre survive at 10 per cent while Luxembourg is zero-rated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> These are the issues which should be addressed.  While I welcome the increase in awareness caused by the expenditure of these £300,000 by the good work of a marketing agency following their brief, it is deplorable that the Government are not leading from the front, saying: look, there are really very difficult issues here which must be faced.  Exhorting this nation to pull together, as is suggested in the Minister's script and the Taoiseach leading us to happier fields is not dealing with the issue as it should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Before calling on Deputy Kennedy, in view of the limitations on time, I will direct the attention of speakers to the fact that this Estimate, as it appears to me, refers to the inevitability, indeed the relative imminence of 1992, its significance and the Government's programme in educating people in that regard.  I urge speakers not to stray too far away from those issues in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall stray no further than did Deputy Noonan.  We are supporting this Supplementary Estimate for the expenditure of £300,000 to fund the EUROPEN campaign to prepare for the Single European Market in 1992. However, we are doing so with considerable reluctance.  We do not agree in principle with the idea of retrospectively sanctioning moneys in Supplementary Estimates when these moneys have already been spent by the Dáil.  The most noteworthy aspect of this Estimate is that it proves beyond all doubt that the Government had made no plans whatsoever for an information campaign on the single market in last year's budget and organised the EUROPEN campaign only following on intensive pressure on the part of my party and other Opposition parties from mid-year onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the passage of the referendum on the Single European Act last year we pressed the Government on every possible occasion to begin a public awareness campaign on the huge implications <Col N="539" /> of 1992.  Nonetheless, the EUROPEN campaign &mdash; since it was begun on 4 July last &mdash; has increased the level of public awareness about our new status in Europe from 1992.  In this respect it is disappointing that the Government decided to provide only a similar sum of £300,000 to follow up that campaign for a full year next year.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence to date that the Government, or the Committee of Ministers and Departmental Secretaries, established under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach, have adopted a clear strategic approach to upholding Ireland's interests in relation to European developments regarding the single market.  On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that we are going about the European process in a non-planned way.</P>
    <P>The complex nature of full EC integration in 1992 merits more than a sporadic debate in this House late at night. With the exception of references in the course of Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs we have had only one single debate in this Parliament on the implications of 1992.  That was on the occasion when we debated the Cecchini report before the summer recess, a debate that had been requested by the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The general lack of debate in this country on the implications of 1992 sector-by-sector brings home the point once again that we need a properly structured foreign affairs committee in this House.  I want to avail of this opportunity to repeat my request to the Taoiseach and the Government to consider the establishment of such a committee, a proposal supported by Opposition parties of all hues in this House.  The establishment of such a committee is necessary on a formal footing rather than on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis because there is need to address long-term structural considerations of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>My great fear about the Government's EUROPEN effort is that a mere publicity campaign is no substitute for a properly planned process to prepare this country <Col N="540" /> for 1992.  I still hold that that is not happening. There have been a number of <i>ad hoc</i> announcements on the part of Ministers &mdash; indeed changes in the status of Ministers themselves &mdash; without any real thrust on the part of the Government to our policy for 1992.  It was interesting even earlier today to hear the Taoiseach respond to Deputy Ruairí Quinn by asking Deputies to address questions to the Minister for Finance rather than the new Minister for Structural Funds on the whole important Structural Funds question. One might well ask: what then was the point of changing the portfolio of the Minister for Finance, taking Structural Funds out of their rightful place in that Department a couple of weeks ago?</P>

      <P>Rather than concentrating on the publicity aspects of EUROPEN &mdash; which I concede has opened up an initial awareness of the single market here &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State, when replying, would answer a number of specific questions about the Government's intentions for 1992.  I pose these questions in the context that 1992 is a mere three budgets away for planning purposes.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in this House, the Progressive Democrats are wholeheartedly in favour of the completion of the internal market in 1992. We do not want any exemptions or derogations. We take that view because we believe it to be fundamentally in the interests of this country, our economy, industry, our long term employment prospects that we adhere fully to the 1992 deadline.</P>
      <P>Since the EC Single Market Programme which is well under way involves more than 350 proposals, the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly in the interests of this country, I am asking the Minister of State this evening to avail of this opportunity to spell out Government policy in a few areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioner-elect and outgoing Minister for Finance, Deputy Ray Mac-Sharry, gave the go-ahead in principle &mdash;<Col N="541" /> as I understand it &mdash; for the full harmonisation of Irish VAT rates under the 1992 proposals at the Crete Council of Minister's meeting in September last. That was a welcome development.  I am asking the Minister of State to outline when replying what plans, if any, the Government have to proceed with this proposal.  Will it be done, as would appear to be the obvious way, over the next three budgets?</P>
    <P>My party have taken the view, from the beginning of the Single European Market campaign, that 1992 provides the ideal externally-imposed opportunity and deadline to introduce the long overdue reform of our tax system.  In order to conform to this principle we published our five-year tax plan last week to bring the rates of personal taxation down to 25 per cent and 40 per cent respectively.  We set out these proposals in a planned way in our document.  We believe that the Government should do likewise, taking into account the implications of full harmonisation of VAT and indirect taxes in three years' time.</P>
    <P>I should like a response from the Minister of State on this issue since we acknowledge that so great is Government dependency on indirect taxation &mdash; estimated variously as being in the region of between £460 million and £650 million &mdash; that Revenue objection to full harmonisation of VAT by 1992 is a serious one.  For example, when replying could the Minister of State report on progress to date among countries of the EC in gaining full acceptance of this deadline on VAT?</P>
    <P>We are also seriously concerned about the way the Government are going about organising a national development plan for the vastly increased Structural Funds that will become available to this country from 1992 onwards.  The Taoiseach refused in the course of Question Time in the House today to agree that the draft development plans, now completed, could be debated before being sent to Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas in which we have heard little from the <Col N="542" /> Government during the six months operation of the EUROPEN campaign.  For example, what changes in education curricula are planned in the Department of Education, in particular what proposals have been adopted to teach more foreign languages to our young people?  What moves have been taken here to meet the requirement that restrictive public procurement practices operated by member states will be phased out by 1992?</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate Deputy Ray MacSharry on his recent nomination as our next European Commissioner. Although I strongly believe that the interests of this country would have been better served by leaving Commissioner Peter Sutherland in Europe and Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance, I wish our new Commissioner well and I hope he will receive a permanent portfolio in the night of the long knives which we will be sitting down to in exactly a month's time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kennedy made a delightfully wide contribution referring to Europe, but I must advise Deputy Quinn that he should not follow her invitation to refer to how he was treated regarding Structural Funds or anything of that nature, or encourage the Minister of State when replying to be out of order in referring to matters not provided for in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is exclusively about voting taxpayers' money for an information campaign which the Labour Party support.  The Labour Party would like to congratulate those responsible for the EUROPEN campaign.  The first objective set by that campaign was to make people aware of 1992 and that objective has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I do not have a comprehensive report on all the awareness seminars that have been going on around the country, from what I have been able to divine from various people I have <Col N="543" /> little or no argument with the Government after less than six months of this campaign.  Most of the business community are aware that 1992 is an issue that will affect them in the commercially competitive trading sense.  The Labour Party support this campaign and I am not being argumentative when I say that we would like to see twice the amount of money being spent.</P>
    <P>1992 involves more than the completion of the internal market.  It involves recognising that the completion of the market creates winners and losers and that the Structural Funds have been established to compensate the losers.</P>
    <P>During Question Time today I expressed the opinion that I am not convinced that taxpayers' money is being used in the information programme to inform workers and other people who might be directly or indirectly affected of the consequences of the completion of the internal market in the long run, and of what action they can take in relation to securing their jobs.  Because of the time constraints involved in this debate I would refer the Minister to my more extensive contribution on the Cecchini report on 19 May and specifically to our historic experience of the CIO reports where industry after industry and sector after sector were identified by the Lemass committee as being in trouble unless they adapted.  The owners of industry decided not to adapt.  They took their money and went into retirement and the workers walked the streets.  We should not repeat that and we can avoid it.  Since the net question tonight is to vote moneys for an information campaign there is a requirement for balance across the community and for the sort of social dialogue to which this Government are committed. Equal attention should be given to employers' problems in facing the completion of the internal market and to the implications for workers particularly those in middle management who are perhaps in the worst place of all, and they are not being involved in this process. How can they ensure that they have access to information and can exercise <Col N="544" /> the right to participation in the social dialogue to which the Single European Act refers?</P>
    <P>The year 1992 does not relate exclusively to the internal market although the internal market is the dominant issue. There are other factors relating to structural funds.  Although this suggestion is probably outside the context of this precise debate I will refer to it.  We have already put down a motion on the Order Paper that the joint Oireachtas committee should be renamed the 1992 committee. I have already put down questions to every Government Department and to the Taoiseach on this issue of 1992 but I have got very unsatisfactory replies.  The Minister knows what I am referring to so I will not bore the House with it.  The Government and the officials can do better than that and the Government have enough political courage and enough political support to do better than they have done.  There is no big contest on this side of the House on this issue. We are behind the Minister in trying to get the best for this nation so I would appeal to him not to hide behind the cautious conservative Civil Service recommendation that he tell us nothing so that it cannot come back against him. I am asking the Minister to trust us and to share the information.  None of the replies I received either on 8 November or today reflects that sense of courage but I believe the Government are bigger and better than that.  I will keep on asking the questions and if I cannot get the replies in a nice way I will get them in another way.</P>
    <P>My last point is that we should have an hour each week in this House to talk about 1992 and its implications.  We should take from 3.45 p.m. until 5 o'clock every Thursday to talk about 1992.  The arrangements would be a matter for the Whips.  If we are serious about 1992 and this information campaign indicates that we are being serious with taxpayers' money, we should be serious in this House and practice what we preach.  I am offering that as a suggestion which the Minister may wish to consider or to which she might wish to respond.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on these four points <Col N="545" />&mdash; the awareness campaign has been a success; the internal market implications have penetrated to the business side; I do not believe that the social participation among those who will be affected has been compensated in terms of taxpayers' money; and the Structural Fund has been limited.  My final two suggestions are that we rename the committee and give it a sense of focus and extra resources and maybe give the Oireachtas, in full plenary session, a full hour or a fixed time once a week in the foreseeable future to focus on the variety of issues involved, because this is an enormous agenda and I do not envy the Minister her responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank my three colleagues who contributed to the debate.  I am very much aware of their commitment to this area, to the furtherance of our membership of the European Community and their total support for the completion of the single market.  There are a number of points to which I would like to respond, and perhaps I could deal first with the points raised by Deputy Quinn as he is still in the House.</P>
      <P>I thank him for the compliments he paid myself and the staff who are working on the 1992 awareness campaign.  He is right when he says that the first priority of the campaign has been achieved, in that awareness has been created among the business community.  There is a much higher level of awareness now at the end of the six months campaign than even those of us who were most optimistic at the beginning felt could be achieved within the six months period.  Of course, I would agree with Deputy Quinn that 1992 is about far more than just the completion of the internal market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I have spoken publicly I have stressed that if we are to be properly prepared for 1992, if companies and business premises are to be properly prepared, then workers and employees at every level in the company must be kept fully informed of what is happening in the negotiations within a company or between companies.  Deputy Quinn is <Col N="546" /> correct when he talks about the warnings that were issued prior to our accession to the European Community in 1973.  We all remember that at that time the clothing and footwear industries were identified by Government and Opposition as the two industries which were the most sensitive and would face the greatest difficulties and a great deal of attention would have to be given to them.  Despite all the warnings, advice and support given by every State agency at the time, most of those businesses did not take the preparatory steps necessary.</P>
    <P>That is why during this campaign we have all worked extremely hard, in all the seminars and conferences and when making guidance available, to impress again and again on the people and representative bodies involved that it is most important that the necessary steps are taken.  That cannot be stressed loudly or often enough during the campaign.  Of course, there is a need for balance and we have to give equal attention and focus to both sides of the argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn made two suggestions. First, he said that the Oireachtas committee should be renamed the &ldquo;1992 Committee&rdquo;.  In my speech to that committee recently I said I was prepared to go a considerable distance towards meeting certain difficulties the committee have at present.  The Deputy can be assured that I have already raised those issues with the powers that be and the chairperson and vice-chairperson will be meeting with the Minister for Finance shortly to discuss that issue, and I hope we can resolve it to the satisfaction of the committee.  His second suggestion was that there be a fixed hour each week to debate 1992. That is in line with the suggestion made by Deputy Kennedy that we should have more opportunities to discuss European business and European affairs generally. That is something we would all welcome.</P>
    <P>The Government Whip suggested to the other Whips that there might be some system of debating reports on a regular basis &mdash; I made that suggestion to the Oireachtas committee.  That is a positive suggestion which I believe should be and will be followed up.  As the Minister of <Col N="547" /> State with responsibility for co-ordinating European affairs, I would have no hesitation in having more frequent debates on the whole area of European affairs. All I can say is that I will take this up with our Whip and with the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>I could not accept Deputy Noonan's view that only one side of 1992 is being portrayed.  All Ministers, Ministers of State and Government spokesmen have been at pains to point out at each seminar, meeting and conference around the country over the past six months that there are two sides, that there are challenges and opportunities but that there will be difficulties as well.  We have been stressing that unless adequate preparations are made, companies and businesses do not have a hope of competing not just at home where there will be increased competition from abroad, but in the vast 320 million market in Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said the Government had dismally failed in leading the campaign and he spoke about areas he felt the Government had not addressed.  He spoke about fiscal harmonisation, and because of the time constraints perhaps I might deal with that first.  As Members of the House are aware, in the area of fiscal harmonisation the Commission produced its proposals some time ago.  Those proposals have been discussed at a number of Finance Ministers' meetings. It was decided that the commissioner with responsibility in this area, Commissioner Cockfield, would hold bilateral meetings with the various Finance Ministers from the different member states so that they could outline to him the specific difficulties various countries have &mdash; and those difficulties have been outlined this evening by the three Deputies who have contributed and there is no need for me to go into them again.</P>
    <P>Those bilateral meetings have only concluded in the last couple of weeks and it is for the Commission to bring forward amended proposals by the end of this month.  Those amended proposals will be discussed by the Council of Ministers once again and it is only then that we <Col N="548" /> can take a position in relation to the amendments and how we feel they affect us.  The Minister for Finance has indicated at each session of the Finance Ministers' meetings &mdash; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the General Affairs Council of Ministers' meetings that we support in principle the  of a single market, that tax  harmonised, that VAT rates  taxes should be harmonised, but he has pointed out as well that nothing should happen to divert this country and this Government from the type of stringent economic policies we are pursuing to try to get the economy back on a proper footing.  The Commission has been one of the leaders in explaining and offering guidance and advice to countries such as ours and nothing should happen now which would upset the balance if we are to do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan spoke about the fact that we are on the periphery of Europe. This is one issue which the Committee of Ministers and Secretaries have been addressing over the last number of months.  Deputy Noonan is right when he says that when the Channel tunnel is built Ireland will be the only country without a direct land link with the Community. The Committee of Ministers and Secretaries have been looking at this area extensively over the last number of weeks and the way the structural funds will be spent over the next five years will be crucial to ensuring that our competitiveness will be foremost in the minds of this Government so that we should not be at a disadvantage because we are on the periphery of Europe.  At the same time, we have been at pains to point out to the Commission and our partner countries that Article 130 V is extremely important to this country in terms of cohesion.  We cannot have the internal market proceeding and indirect taxes, etc., being harmonised while the poorer regions get poorer and everything is centralised. That is a central issue which each of our representatives at the meetings of the Council of Ministers has been at pains to point out, and they will continue to <Col N="549" /> debate it vigorously within the Community.</P>
    <P>With regard to a point made by Deputies Kennedy and Noonan on the proficiency of Irish people in general and young people in particular in European languages, I would only refer them to the information leaflet No. 1 on the Single European Market entitled <i>&ldquo;The Basic Facts.&rdquo;</i>  On page 3 of that leaflet, there is a comprehensive statement, if I may say so, on the steps being taken by the Minister and the Department of Education with regard to European languages.  I would refer Deputy Noonan also to a speech I delivered in University College, Galway last night and which covered many of the aspects he was worried about.  In our information leaflets and in speeches made by Ministers, we have given a balanced view and have referred at all times to the potential difficulties or challenges that will have to be faced as well as the opportunities given to us by 1992.</P>
    <P>We have only started the work of preparing for 1992.  Our whole thrust up to now has been the creation of awareness, making people aware that 1992 is just around the corner and that we must prepare for it now.  As I have said, the campaign has moved into a much higher gear in recent weeks in that we are now targeting the information sector by sector. Of course, based on the evaluation that is now taking place we will be in a position, together with the private and public sector, to move towards the planned campaign which we will put into effect at the beginning of 1989 and thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I am aware of the pressure that you are under from many Members wishing to raise matters in this way.  I am grateful, too, to the <Col N="550" /> Minister of State, Deputy Denis Gallagher, for attending at 11.30 p.m. to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>The closure of the Babygro plant in Belmullet, County Mayo, is a matter of serious concern and must be given absolute priority by the Government agencies. Geographically, the Erris region is as big as County Louth.  It is difficult to service this vast area with industry, whether indigenous or industry introduced to the area by Government agencies.  Erris is covered by both the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta, as part of it is a Gaeltacht area and comes under the Gaeltacht Authority as does this plant and Belmullet town.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter in this political forum not alone because of the representations made to me by a great number of people and my concern for them as a public representative but also to help both the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, in putting the other points of view and to assist them in their dealings with the various Government agencies.  I would like to quote from an editorial in the <i>Western People</i> on October 12 entitled, &ldquo;Bleeding Erris&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is an intolerable loss to a region which has suffered irreparable damage over the years because little has been done to create industry to keep people at home.</P>
      <P>Now whole families are emigrating, closing up their homes as their predecessors did in another era.  Football teams are being decimated, villages denuded, the region robbed of its youth and its vitality.</P>
      <P>Bishop Thomas Finnegan, in his diocesan homily in Knock last week, pointed out that the equivalent of two large parishes have emigrated in recent times from the Killala Diocese: it is a horrifying statistic but one all too readily recognised by the people of Erris whose lot it appears, is the emigration trail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this most recent closure, and against a background of deprivation over the decades, we call on the <Col N="551" /> Government to put all its resources behind the acquisition of alternative industry.  It should recognise the agony of Erris, the haemorrhaging of its very heart, and declare it as an area of the highest priority for the provision of jobs on a scale commensurate with the problem.</P>
    <P>If it doesn't then, as local politicians have warned, it will become an area only for the very young and the old, and eventually only for the old.  The proud people of Erris deserve a fate better than that.  All voices, therefore, must be united in the call for immediate action.</P>
    <P>In an objective sense, that article sets out the picture as we find it today in the Barony of Erris.  I know the Minister of State here tonight understands deeply the consequences of such emigration, coming from the Achill area, which also has been ravaged by emigration over the years. The consequences are enormous for the people of the region.</P>
    <P>The workers at the Babygro plant at present are on a short term extended contract.  This area has had very little investment in industrial development since 1982 either under the previous Government or the present Government. The Babygro plant is not a new industry but resulted from a move from the Children's World factory seven miles from Belmullet to a new and better plant.  The factory was opened in July 1987 by the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, amid great jubilation and hope for the future.  I ask the Minister of State in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach what future the plant has and what is the position in regard to acquiring an alternative industry.</P>
    <P>It might be proper to say that the State agency, Údarás na Gaeltachta, dealing with this particular case had a list of intolerable demands made on them by the Scottish company who bought over the Babygro plant.  Indeed, the list of conditions is such that it could not be met by any State agency and this has placed great pressure on the authority to acquire an <Col N="552" /> alternative industry for the area.  Would the Minister of State be able to say what has happened with regard to the assistance being given to Údarás na Gaeltachta to acquire an alternative industry for the Babygro plant?  If an alternative is secured, will finance be available by way of Údarás grants to set it up and run it? The Minister of State is quite well aware that if and when this contract ends, up to 120 skilled textile workers will be without employment.  Many of these people returned from England and abroad in the seventies.  They acquired local authority loans and set up their homes and are now in the process of rearing their families at home.  It is intolerable that an area like this should be further crushed beneath the weight of unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>I ask specifically that the Minister of State direct that Údarás na Gaeltachta would set up a specific task force which would recognise the absolute priority of the provision of industrial employment in Erris and that would also secure an alternative industry in this case.  I think that consideration could be given to the provision of a separate budget in this area.  It appears to me that the extent of the growth in fish farming over the past number of years is eating away a substantial amount of money from the Údarás na Gaeltachta budget.  While fish farming is a source of economic activity, we must not lose sight of industrial expansion. I would like the Minister to outline the authority Údarás na Gaeltachta have to deliver at this time.  I understand that after a meeting in October some controversy arose from a letter sent to the Údarás and that up to 30 projects with possible potential for over 300 jobs have not been sanctioned either because gurus in the Department of Finance have issued instructions that no further finance be made available to Údarás na Gaeltachta or because other resources in other ways are not being made available to them. This is intolerable and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Calls have been made at public meetings that the Taoiseach should intervene. Intervention by Deputy Haughey as <Col N="553" /> Taoiseach will not in itself solve the problem but it would be appropriate that he lend his not inconsiderable weight in the matter and express his concern to Údarás na Gaeltachta and give them other resources to go about meeting the requirements of the people dealing with this, bodies who have expressed an interest in acquisition of the plant in order that the matter be sorted out.  This area is not serviced properly by Údarás officials. Only one official of Údarás na Gaeltachta services there once a fortnight or thereabouts, and that is not keeping with such an area that is made up of Gaeltacht areas, as it were.  We do not give a proportionate level of grant assistance in terms of resources to the people of the area.  Something should be done in this regard as well.  If a new project has to be put in &mdash; and this is what has to be done &mdash; will the finance be made available by the Údarás to set it up and run it?</P>
    <P>Let me say that both the Minister of State here tonight and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, have expressed their personal interest in this matter.  Nobody wants to see anybody losing a job particularly in an area like this, but people in the area are beginning to wonder where is the commitment of the Government to saving the jobs and delivering the alternatives which must be delivered as this is the last remaining plant giving any significant employment in the area.  We have two Government Ministers, one at the Cabinet table, one in the Department of the Gaeltacht and I will offer them every assistance I can as a public representative.  I am sure nobody wants to see a small workforce, many of them with young families, having to go into this Christmas with prospects of unemployment staring them in the face in 1989, and I urge the Minister of State to use his authority, together with that of the Taoiseach, and allow Údarás na Gaeltachta and their officials to use every possible resource, not alone in declaring the area to be a priority for employment but in considering those who have expressed an interest in acquiring this plant.  As the Bishop has said, we do not want this area, as big as County Louth, <Col N="554" /> to become a home only for geriatrics, a place robbed of heart, vitality and soul. All the public representatives, regardless of which side of the House they are on, shares that concern.  I urge the Minister of State in his capacity as representative of the Taoiseach to see to it that authority and resources are given to Údarás na Gaeltachta to deliver on this matter.</P>

      <P>Níl aon chall a dhul isteach i stair an chomhlachta seo.  Nuair a tháinig siad go Béal an Mhuirthead bhí siad in ard a réime agus shíl gach duine ag an am go raibh obair mhór déanta agus an comhlacht seo a fháil don áit seo.  Thug an tÚdarás agus Roinn na Gaeltachta gach cúnamh dóibh nuair a tháinig siad isteach go Béal an Mhuirthead, agus ceadaíodh na deontais seo a leanas dóibh: deontas caipitil £222,000, deontas oil-iúna £305,000: sin £527,000 ar fad.  Bhí £341,535 den airgead sin íoctha nuair a d'fhág an comhlacht.  Chaill siad £1.75 milliún sa leathbhliain dar chríoch 1 Bealtaine 1988.</P>
      <P>Ansin cheannaigh comhlacht eile, comhlacht R.H. Lowe, a bhí lonnaithe in Cheshire i Sasana, scaireanna iomlána Babygro.  Nuair a tháinig an comhlacht sin i gcumhacht rinne said athstruchtúrú ar an ngnó a bhí acu agus shocraigh siad cuid de na monarchana a dhúnadh, agus bhí Béal an Mhuirthead ar cheann de na monarchana a bhí i gceist.  Rinne an tÚdarás a ndícheall thar ceann na n-oibrithe an mhonarcha a choinneáil ar siúl. Ach, mar atá ráite ag an Teachta Kenny, ní thiocfadh leo a ghlacadh leis na coinníollacha a bhí á leagan síos ag an gcomhlacht seo maidir le deontais agus mar sin a bhí ag teastáil uathu ón Udarás le leanúint ar aghaidh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhuail an lucht oibre le R.H. Lowe i mBéal an Mhuirthead agus i bBaile Átha Cliath, agus pléadh an scéal, ach sháraigh orthu teacht ar aon réiteach.  Bhí sé soiléir nach raibh fonn ar bith ar R.H. Lowe fanacht i mBéal an Mhuirthead.  Tá díomá orainn uilig go bhfuil an scéal mar atá sé, ach tá gach dícheall á dhéanamh ag an Údarás le postanna a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir do mhuintir <Col N="555" /> Bhéal an Mhuirthead.  Tá an Taoiseach é féin ag cabhrú sa chás seo, agus Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Chomh maith leis sin, iarradh ar an IDA teacht isteach agus cuidiú chomh maith le tionscal a lonnú i mBéal an Mhuirthead.  Tá foireann bhreise tofa ag an Údarás atá ag plé go dícheallach leis an gceist seo, agus tig linn a rá ag an bpointe seo go bhfuil fiosruithe faighte ó chúpla comhlacht.  Ach níl aon chinneadh deimhnithe déanta go fóill maidir le ceann ar bith acu a roghnú.</P>
    <P>Tá cuid mhaith ráite ag an Teachta Kenny faoin gceantar seo, agus aontaím leis go bhfuil ceist na himirce go dona san áit agus go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go gcuirfí postanna ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir.  Ach má amharcann sé air agus má tá sé dáiríre faoin iarracht atá déanta ag an Rialtas seo go dtí seo, chuir said £2 mhilliún ar fáil le tionscal a lonnú i gceantar atá thart ar dheich míle ó Bhéal an Mhuirthead, agus nuair a chuireann tú san áireamh an méid a cuireadh ar fáil do Babygro sílim go dtig linn a rá, san achar gearr atá caite ag an Rialtas seo, go bhfuil iarracht mhaith déanta acu le teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir Iorrais, rud nár tharla sa tréimhse roimhe sin.  Níor tharla tada, níor cuireadh infheistíocht ar bith isteach sa cheantar seo sna ceithre bliana a raibh an Rialtas eile i gcumhacht.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Tá deacrachtaí i gcónaí comhlachtaí a tharraingt go dtí áiteacha cosúil le Béal an Mhuirthead agus Iarthar Mhaigh Eo, mar go bhfuilimid píosa maith ó chathair agus ó áiteacha eile.  Dá bhrí sin, ní bhíonn fonn ar lucht tionscail a theacht chomh fada sin ó bhaile.  Ach san am céanna, tá ár ndícheall á dhéanamh againn agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta, foireann oibre an-mhaith ansin, foireann a bhfuil díograis iontu, foireann a dteastaíonn uathu fanacht ansin sa bhaile agus oibriú sa bhaile.  Táimid ag déanamh gach iarracht tacú leo ó thaobh an Údaráis agus ó thaobh airgid.  Má thagann an tionsclaí ceart isteach san áit ní bheidh siad fágtha gan tionscal de bharr airgid. Beidh an t-airgead curtha ar fáil ón Údarás, má thagann tionsclaí ceart.  Tá sé sin cruthaithe cheana.  Tharla sé leis an gcomhlacht eile a raibh muid ag caint fúthu.  Fuair siad £2,500,000; rinneadh iarracht faoi leith, agus más rud é go dtagann comhlacht eile atá sásta lonnú i mBéal an Mhuirthead tabharfaimid an chabhair sin dóibh.  Tig leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte go bhfuil gach dícheall á dhéanamh na postanna breise a chur ar fáil chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office as Minister for Health, I have made it clear to the health boards in discussions with them, this Government's policy in regard to the protection of key community care services. I have asked the health boards to ensure that resources be made available to further the enhancement of critical primary care services as key elements in preventive health policy.  This policy was reflected, for example, in the 1988 expenditure figures on the health protection programme which showed an estimated increase from £19.7 million to £20.0 million and at a time when the general hospital programme was showing a decrease.</P>
      <P>My decision to establish the health promotion unit in my Department in January of this year also helps to ensure that greater resources are applied to preventive health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment on 1 January <Col N="244" /> 1988 the health promotion unit has undertaken the following major projects.</P>
    <P>Anti-Smoking</P>
    <P>The unit participated in the national smokeout campaign and is at present developing a new anti-smoking campaign for 1989.</P>
    <P>AIDS Awareness</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit has a continuing poster and media campaign against AIDS which is aimed at the high risk groups.  For World AIDS Day on 1 December 1988, the unit intensified this activity and also made available through pharmacists, an information booklet on AIDS.</P>
    <P>Healthy Lifestyles</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit is at present working with the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation in the development of materials and a programme for promoting healthy lifestyles. This programme will address issues such as diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol.</P>
    <P>Drugs and Alcohol</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Drug Questions&mdash;Local Answers&rdquo;, a community based approach to combating drug and alcohol abuse was launched in May.  Nine training courses for convenors of this programme have already been carried out with at least one in each health board area.  One hundred and fifty convenors have been trained to date.  A further course for the Eastern Health Board area will take place in January 1989.</P>
    <P>CLEANWATCH</P>
    <P>The unit, in association with the public health division of the Department, the Environment Health Officers' Association and the food trade launched a major food hygiene campaign, titled &ldquo;CLEANWATCH&rdquo; in May, 1988.  This campaign is of continuing relevance as a support to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Immunisation</P>
    <P>Measles, Mumps and Rubella.</P>
    <P>In October 1988 the health promotion unit in association with the public health division launched a measles, mumps and rubella immunisation programme.  This initiative was taken against a background <Col N="245" /> of continuing high incidence of the three diseases in question and in the light of the success of similar immunisation programmes in other countries.  The campaign which is aimed at children between 15 months and five years has the objective of achieving a 90 per cent uptake in the period October to March 1990.</P>
    <P>Europe Against Cancer Year, 1989</P>
    <P>I have established a national co-ordinating group to plan and oversee activities for 1989 which will highlight the cancer problem in Ireland.  The group includes representatives of the health promotion unit of my Department, the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, GP groups, An Bord Altranais and the Departments of Education and Labour.  The group is preparing a programme of activities to focus public attention on cancer during 1989. This programme will include elements dealing with each of the ten points in the European Cancer Code.  Activities under this programme will include a new anti-smoking public education campaign, conferences on various cancer related topics, a school programme and a mobile cancer education unit, among others.  The full details of the programme will be announced publicly in January.</P>
    <P>Public Information Services</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit provides a public information service on various health topics, campaigns etc., by providing printed materials on health matters to health workers, schools and the general public.</P>
    <P>Voluntary Organisations</P>
    <P>The unit has provided financial and other assistance to a wide range of voluntary organisations throughout the year to assist these bodies to produce health information materials and organise health related seminars.</P>
    <P>Advisory Council on Health Promotion</P>
    <P>In addition to the health promotion unit, I also established in January 1988 the advisory council on health promotion, whose remit is to make recommendations to me for changes in public <Col N="246" /> policy which will impact on the health of the community.</P>
    <P>The council has examined, in particular, the areas of nutrition, alcohol, tobacco and accidents and has made a number of recommendations to me related to these areas.  In particular, the council recommended the development of a national policy on alcohol which would take into account the full range of health, social and economic questions involved.  I have now received the agreement of the Government to have such a policy drafted under the auspices of the advisory council on health promotion.</P>
    <P>Chair of Health promotion, University College Galway</P>
    <P>I recently announced sponsorship of a Chair of Health Promotion at UCG.  This is a major new development, involving significant investment over the next seven years and reflects my commitment to the development of health promotion as a cornerstone of future health policy.</P>

      <P>It is important that accurate demographic and medical information is available in relation to all perinatal deaths whether these deaths occur prior to or shortly after delivery.  In that context, the perinatal reporting system was established by my Department with the dual purpose of registering all live births and notifying and providing statistical information on all perinatal deaths.  The recommendations of the World Health Organisation (1975) were followed in setting up the notification system.  I am satisfied that the current system is achieving effective coverage in relation to stillbirths, but in the light of the Deputy's question I will communicate with the Central Statistics Office about the matter.</P>

      <P>I have received a very considerable number of requests for assistance from the national lottery proceeds available to my Department.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it has been possible to accede to only a relatively small <Col N="251" /> number of these requests because of the limited funds available.  This year's health allocation of national lottery proceeds has now been distributed or committed in full and consequently I am not in a position to reconsider my decision regarding funding for the Irish Association for Victim Support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>A strict system of control over the use of food additives (including colours) exists in this country.  Regulations control particular classes of additives, list the substances which are permitted and, where appropriate, specify the conditions under which they may be used and maximum levels of use.  These regulations are enforced through weekly food sampling programmes involving the environmental health offices and the public analysts' laboratories of the health boards.  Additives are included in &ldquo;permitted lists&rdquo; only if there is satisfaction as to their safety in use and that there is a technological need for them.  Safety is the paramount consideration and positive evidence of this, including the results of specified toxicological tests, is required.  I am advised on these matters by a committee of independent experts, the Food Advisory Committee.  In addition, additives are also evaluated by international expert bodies such as the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food <Col N="252" /> and the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, as well as by the national authorities of many other countries.  Information about the safety of additives is exchanged internationally, either on a bilateral basis or through international fora such as the EC, the Codex Alimentarius of FAO and WHO and through the council of Europe.  The use of permitted additives is kept under continuous review, particularly in the light of any new evidence relating to safety and if any was shown to cause widespread problems appropriate action would be taken.</P>
      <P>There are EC directives controlling the use of emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickening and gelling agents, preservatives, colouring agents, antioxidants, erucic acid and vinyl chloride.  These directives have all been implemented in Ireland by means of regulation under the Health Acts, 1947-70 and the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>At present the two colours referred to by the Deputy, red 2G and brilliant blue FCF, have been approved for use in food under the EC colours directive.  These two colours are at present in Annex II of the directive which lists the colours which member states may permit in national rules.  A current proposal being discussed at EC level provides for these colours to be moved into Annex I which have community authorisation.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently examining as a matter of urgency the question of incinerating hospital waste in such a manner as to minimise air pollution.  This examination involves complex technical considerations including an evaluation of a number of options for the disposal of this waste.

      <P>I do not propose to make AIDS a notifiable disease.  Since 1984, my Department have been operating a special monitoring system under which AIDS cases are reported to the Department on a confidential and voluntary basis.  The criteria used for defining and for the diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of cases of AIDS are based on the most up-to-date guidelines issued by the Centre for Communicable Diseases Control, Atlanta and approved by the WHO.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the operation of this scheme on a voluntary basis and I would be concerned that a change to a statutory scheme could give rise to fears, albeit unfounded, in relation to confidentiality and result in a reduction in the numbers coming forward for HIV testing and treatment of the disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The closure of beds in the hospital mentioned by the Deputy is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The measures taken by the board for the month of December relate to elective surgical beds.  This is not so unusual when it is considered that the number of people who elect to enter hospital in the run up to Christmas falls significantly.  The board have merely taken advantage of this situation to live within their allocation.  This action has been taken following agreement with the appropriate personnel in the hospitals concerned.</P>
      <P>I would point out that it is not my policy to encourage boards to seek reductions in staff wages in order to alleviate pressure on their finances and I am informed that no consideration was given either by the North Eastern Health Board itself or its management to the proposal mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am assured that all emergency medical and surgical services will be provided in the North Eastern Health Board over the period in question.</P>

      <P>I am aware that delays have arisen in the provision of orthopaedic treatment for spina bifida children in the Southern Health Board.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that there has been any widespread recourse to expensive prescription only products solely as a result of the delisting of OTC items.</P>
      <P>The items which are excluded from the GMS scheme are quite inexpensive to purchase.  As the term &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; implies, these products are available for retail purchase without any need for a doctor's prescription.  Many of these products are sold in a variety of retail outlets, including pharmacies, supermarkets, etc.</P>
      <P>Very significant savings have accrued to the Exchequer in each year since these products were delisted.</P>
      <P>In the context of new arrangements for the provision of medical services in the GMS, I understand that the working group, established by the IMO and by the Department to prepare a national drugs formulary, may propose the restoration of a specific limited number of OTC items to the GMS list.  I will give due consideration to any such proposals which may be made, as part of an agreed mechanism to secure more cost-effective prescribing in the GMS.</P>

    <P>The specific details of the arrangements entered into with the various banking groups, after competitive tendering, in relation to the funding of these equipment packages, were approved by the Department of Finance.  None of these packages involved foreign borrowing.  As the Deputy will appreciate it would not be appropriate to publicise specific details of the arrangements entered into with the banking groups, but in all cases repayments are spread over five years and fall to be met from the Revenue allocations of the respective bodies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of adults awaiting dental treatment in each health board area; the number of children awaiting dental treatment in each health board area; and the length of time they are awaiting same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will circulate in the Official Report a table which sets out the material he has requested.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that waiting lists are not kept for children in many health boards as the services are based on rotational visits to the schools.</P>
      <P>Following is the table:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Waiting lists for Dental Services</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  <i>Eastern Health Board</i></P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board keeps two waiting lists for adults.  At present there are 762 persons on the priority list and the board is currently treating persons who made application in February 1988. The priority category comprises persons aged over 60, the handicapped and pregnant and nursing mothers.  Persons who do not fall into these groups are placed on the general waiting list.  At present there are 9,663 persons on the general waiting list and treatment is currently being provided for those whose names were put on the list in October 1986.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board does not have statistics on the numbers of children awaiting dental treatment.  The average time a child has to wait to get treatment following application is three months.</P>
      <P>2.  <i>Midland Health Board</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Midland Health Board suspended <Col N="269" /> the provision of routine dental treatment for eligible adults in 1987 and does not keep a waiting list.  The board organises its services for children on the basis of school inspections and as a result waiting lists do not arise.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Mid-Western Health Board</i></P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board ceased to add names to its list of adults awaiting routine dental treatment some time after it suspended routine treatment for adults.  With regard to services for children, these are organised on a school inspection system in Tipperary North Riding and waiting lists do not arise.  In Limerick about 2,500 children are awaiting treatment and the waiting time varies from three to 12 months.  In Clare, about 1,500 are awaiting treatment for between six and 12 months.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>North-Eastern Health Board</i></P>
    <P>Only Meath Community Care area keeps waiting lists at present.  There are 3,580 adults and 3,200 children on the lists and the average waiting time is 3-5 years.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>North-Western Health Board</i></P>
    <P>In 1987 the North-Western Health Board decided to focus its resources on dental services for children.  No waiting lists are kept for adults while 5,437 children are on the waiting lists.  The waiting time varies from area to area and the maximum waiting time is two years.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>South-Western Health Board</i></P>
    <P>As the South-Eastern Health Board only provides emergency services for adults it does not have waiting lists.  Two community care areas, Carlow-Kilkenny and Tipperary South Riding use school inspection systems and priority is granted to children in sixth standard in Carlow-Kilkenny. In Waterford, 2,500 children are on the list.  The average waiting time is 6-12 months, similar to Wexford where, 1,804 children are awaiting treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> 7.  <i>Southern Health Board</i></P>
    <P>There are about 9,000 adults on the waiting list for dental treatment in the Southern Health Board.  In the city centre community care areas, a priority system works and people in the priority groups can expect to wait six months while others have to wait up to four years.  In west Cork the waiting time is six to 12 months while the waiting time for adults in the other two areas is two to three years.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has recently reorganised its services for children to a school based system so waiting lists do not arise.</P>
    <P>8.  <i>Western Health Board</i></P>
    <P>There are 10,768 adults awaiting dental treatment in the Western Health Board which suspended the provision of routine dental treatment for adults in July 1984 and only provided emergency dental treatment for adults.</P>
    <P>The children's service is based on school visitation and so waiting lists do not arise.</P>

However, the North Eastern Health Board is finalising arrangements with Dublin Dental Hospital whereby the health board will fund a post of Registrar in Orthodontics at the Dental Hospital.

      <P>I am not aware of any new initiative on the part of the European Community concerning aid to Kampuchea. The Community provides humanitarian assistance and food aid to Kampuchea and Kampuchean refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> The assistance provided by the Community is channelled through nongovernmental organisations (NGOs).  So far in 1988, 2.1 million ECUs (over £1.6 million) has been provided by the Community for a number of humanitarian projects organised by NGOs in Kampuchea (including Trócaire).  Food aid in the form of dried vegetables and fish worth 2.7 million ECUs (over £2 million) has also been provided to the UN organisation (UNBRO) for Kampuchean refugees in camps in Thailand.  In 1987 total Community assistance to Kampuchea and its refugees was 5,097 million ECUs (£3.95 million).  Kampuchea is eligible to receive emergency assistance from the Community, and benefited from this in earlier years.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the humanitarian assistance being extended by the Community is what is appropriate in present circumstances.  I do not think that specific action by Ireland is necessary at present.</P>

      <P>My Department have sought to respond promptly to disasters as they arise on the basis of need and to the extent which our circumstances permit. Our response has involved the provision of grants in support of the relief activities of Irish and international relief agencies rather than direct participation in relief activities on our part.  For this reason, the need for contingency planning does not arise.</P>

      <P>The reply to the Deputy's question is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> (1)  With the exception of the Dublin area, each working group has held two meetings since establishment in addition to the inaugural meetings addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn.  In the case of Dublin, only one meeting has been held but a steering committee which supervised the earlier stages of the operation met on a number of occasions prior to this.</P>
    <P>(2)  The terms of reference provided for the working groups were as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  To identify and analyse the economic and social problems, potentials and prospects of the area;</P>
    <P>(b)  To identify a medium to long term overall strategy for the development of the area;</P>
    <P>(c)  To a prepare, within such an overall strategy, a five year programme which will be concerned with (i) the social and economic development of the entire area; (ii) establishing the priorities to be given to particular developments and the links and interdependence between them in the context of the overall strategy for the area.</P>
    <P>(d)  To examine the ways in which financial interventions are needed and can be made available from (i) Central Government funding sources, having particular regard to the existing and foreseeable future constraints on Ireland's public finances, or other domestic public and private agencies; (ii) the various EC funding sources.</P>
    <P>(e)  To propose arrangements for the implementation of the programme and projects therein, so as to ensure maximum co-ordination of inputs by all agencies involved.</P>
    <P>(3)  Consultants were engaged by my Department to assist with the preparation of a programme for Dublin city and county.  Consultants have also been engaged by some local authorities on their own account to advise on the preparation of programmes.  I have no responsibility in relation to the appointment of the latter consultants.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is not the normal practice to give <Col N="284" /> the cost of a competitive tender received. Under Government contract procedures, all information in regard to tenders should be treated as strictly confidential between the tendering firm and the contracting authority.</P>
    <P>(5)  Competitive tenders were sought for the Dublin consultancy.</P>

      <P>As regards future loan guarantees, it is Government policy to progressively reduce, to the lowest possible level, the issue of guarantees by the Minister for Finance to commercial State bodies.  This policy is being implemented on a phased basis and it is the aim that most commercial State bodies will in time raise their funds without a ministerial guarantee. It is recognised that in the short term certain State bodies would have difficulty in meeting all their borrowing requirements without such a guarantee.</P>

    <P>Although some of the projects which benefited from the 1987 allocations e.g. the Arts Council and Youth and Sports organisations, also received State support via Departmental Votes, it is not possible to say how much, if any, public money would have been applied for those purposes had lottery funding not been available. At a time when all public spending has been under intense scrutiny and even the most desirable programmes have had to be cut back, the availability of lottery funds enabled certain programmes to be continued and-or maintained at a level which might not otherwise have been possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will take steps to ensure that Allied Irish Banks plc and the bank of Ireland reduce the rate of interest charged by them on the credit cards issued by them, which at the moment at 24.6 per cent, is excessively high; and if he will take steps to break up the cartel which exists between the credit card issuing subsidiaries of these two banks which is detrimental to the public interest and to the welfare of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The supervision of interest rates is primarily a matter for the Central Bank. While the bank has agreed arrangements with the associated banks relating to ordinary deposit and lending rates, these arrangements do not extend to credit card interest rates.  The rates of interest on credit cards are set by the credit card issuers by reference to the prevailing consumer lending rates of interest and take account of additional cost factors such as the interest-free credit period on repayments, bad debt experience, operating costs etc.</P>
      <P>I believe the best method of ensuring the welfare of the consumer is to encourage competition in the provision of these services.  The Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade has been empowered by the Restrictive Practices Act, 1987 to investigate any alleged restrictions on competition.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that one bank has recently lowered the rate of interest charged on the credit card issued by it. No doubt the other issuers of cards will have to take account of this in deciding their interest rate stance.</P>

      <P>The goat herds in the Burren areas are a combination of feral herds and semidomesticated herds which are privately owned.  Goats in this country are agricultural animals as opposed to truly wild and therefore they are not of primary importance in themselves from the viewpoint of species conservation.</P>
      <P>I am naturally concerned with the control and management of Burren vegetation and grazing by many animals, especially goats, is an important factor in this context.  However the control of exploitation of goats in this region is extremely difficult as feral and privately owned herds can intermingle and it is impossible to distinguish between the so-called wild and domesticated stock. Accordingly, I am not in a position to make a preservation order for wild goats in the area in question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to EC budgetary difficulties, <Col N="301" /> this year's allocation to Ireland under the Community's &ldquo;Free Food&rdquo; Scheme was less than half of the amount which was granted for 1987.  This includes an extra 1.338 million ecu (over £1.0 million) which I have recently succeeded in obtaining for the scheme.</P>
    <P>By contrast, therefore, with the scheme which operated in 1987 it has been necessary to restrict eligibility for the current year's scheme to certain clearly defined categories of welfare recipients which were selected in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare.  This was the only way in which it could be ensured that eligible beneficiaries would obtain a meaningful allocation from the limited quantity available.</P>
    <P>The present scheme, as approved by the EC Commission, is restricted to:</P>
    <P>(1)  homeless persons accommodated in hostels and shelters run by voluntary organisations</P>
    <P>(2)  certain social welfare recipients i.e.:</P>
    <P>&mdash; recipients of long term unemployment assistance who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>&mdash; recipients of long term supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>&mdash; FÁS trainees who qualify for the fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>For the reasons set out above, it would not be feasible to extend the existing coverage this year.</P>
    <P>Coverage for 1989 will be reviewed when the allocation to Ireland for next year is known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disease bacillary haemoglobinuria, or BHU as it is commonly called, is not a new phenomenon. It is a bacterial disease caused by the same family of organisms as blackleg, pulpy kidney, braxy and tetanus.  The organisms are found in the soil and can remain there without causing disease.</P>
      <P>BHU, in this country, was first diagnosed in North Cork in 1985.  It was subsequently diagnosed in the South Limerick region and, more recently, has been identified in the Killarney, Castle-island, Milltown and Rathmore areas of Kerry.  The disease has a rapid course, the affected animal dying within 24 hours of the first signs becoming apparent.  The affected animal stops eating, as no bowel movements and shows red discolouration of the urine; it is reluctant to move and becomes recumbent prior to death.  The main organ affected is the liver.</P>
      <P>The carcases of such animals should be disposed of by burial in quicklime.</P>
      <P>Since the disease was first diagnosed, my Department's veterinary officers have consulted with, and advised, veterinary practitioners and farmers in the affected areas on preventive measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BHU can be prevented by vaccination and I would advise farmers to consult with their veterinary surgeons with <Col N="303" /> regard to the possible need for this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cereal production is governed <Col N="306" /> by the EC Common Agricultural Policy and I shall continue to do my utmost to ensure that the interests of Irish cereal producers and the economy generally are recognised when decisions on the cereal sector are taken at Community level.  Small cereal producers can, of course, get a refund of co-responsibility levy paid under a scheme operated by my Department.  The proposed extension of the producer group regulation to Ireland will also provide further opportunities to our cereal producers.</P>
      <P>I believe that the best course for Irish cereal producers to follow is to concentrate on the most efficient production of quality cereals for use in the milling and malting industries, both on home and export markets.  The emphasis should be on a more market-orientated operation, thus reducing dependence on intervention. Attention must also be paid to input costs to achieve adequate profit margins.</P>
      <P>Some underlying economic factors are now much more favourable than they were in the early part of this decade.  In particular, our inflation and interest rates are at very low levels and, because of the success of Government policy, are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future.</P>

He applied for permission to sign retrospectively as unemployed from December 1987 to 22 October 1988, but permission was not granted as he had not shown good cause for his failure to prove unemployment.</P>

      <P>She has stated that she was employed from 1953 to 1970 but has not been able to quote a social insurance number.  So far, the Department have also been unable to trace a social insurance number and record in respect of her for that period.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance are entitled to a weekly fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme provided that they (a)  live entirely alone or (b) reside only with a qualified adult dependant and/or child dependants.  A qualified dependant for this purpose is a person in respect of whom an adult or child dependant allowance is payable.  No fuel allowance payable where any person other than the qualified dependants are residing with the claimant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment assistance at the <Col N="313" /> long term rate is payable in respect of any day of proved unemployment that forms part of a continuous period of unemployment during which the applicant has received payment for at least 390 days.  For unemployment assistance purposes, a continuous period of unemployment is any two periods of unemployment not separated by more than 20 weeks.  The legislation provides that any period up to one year in duration in which a person participates in a course run or approved by An FÁS shall be disregarded in determining there has been a break of claim.  However, periods spent on employment courses or training schemes run by An FÁS do not reckon towards the accumulation of the 390 day period.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme is that the person must be in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate until August 1986 when he ceased to sign the unemployed register. He renewed his claim to unemployment assistance on May 1987 and, as there had been a break of claim of more than 20 weeks the claim was authorised at the short term rate with effect from that date. He subsequently participated in a course run by An FÁS for 12 months from 21 September 1987.  He made a repeat claim for unemployment assistance on 19 September 1988.  While the period spent with An FÁS did not constitute a break in his claim it does not reckon towards the accumulation of the 390 day period. Consequently, the person concerned became entitled to unemployment assistance at the short term rate and accordingly is not eligible for a fuel allowance under the National Fuel Scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child benefit is payable up to 18 years of age where the qualified child is in full-time education or is handicapped. Increases in social welfare payments for child dependants are payable in all cases to age 18 except in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoner's wives and unmarried mothers where payment continues to age 21 as long as the child is in full-time education.</P>
      <P>The provision of payments to other social welfare recipients in respect of children over 18 in full-time education would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">

      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance at the long term rate is payable in respect of any day of proved unemployment which forms part of a continuous period of unemployment during which the applicant has received payment for at least 390 days.  For the purpose of unemployment assistance, a continuous period of unemployment is any two periods of unemployment not separated by more than 20 weeks.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions of the national fuel scheme is that to qualify for a fuel allowance a person must be in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Only those unemployment assistance applicants who were in receipt of the longterm rate of payment during the week ending on Tuesday 29 November 1988 qualified for the Christmas bonus.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for free food under the European Community Free Food Scheme, which is administered by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, is confined to persons in receipt of the long term rate of unemployment assistance and to those on supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was in receipt <Col N="316" /> of the long term rate of unemployment assistance until he signed off the live register on 12 November 1987.  He renewed his claim to unemployment assistance on 20 September 1988 and, because he had broken his claim by more than 20 weeks, he became entitled only to the short term rate of unemployment assistance at £108.10 a week.  He is still in receipt of the short term rate and accordingly is not eligible for receipt of the fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme, Christmas bonus, or free beef. However, as he had previously been receiving a fuel allowance under the urban fuel scheme, his entitlement to an allowance under the national fuel scheme is preserved by the &ldquo;saver clause&rdquo; which applies in such cases.  Arrangements are now being made for payment of the fuel allowance at £5 a week, including all arrears since the commencement of the fuel season, to be made to him.</P>
    <P>Between November 1987 and June 1988, the person concerned was in prison and his wife was in receipt of prisoner's wife's allowance in respect of herself and her 5 children.  This allowance, which then stood at some £110.90 a week, was terminated on 15 September 1988 when it became known that her husband had been released from prison on a temporary basis.  Under the terms of the scheme prisoner's wife's allowance is payable only where the husband is in custody and a person on temporary release may not be regarded as being in custody for the purposes of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was disallowed to the person concerned from 18 August 1988 following examination by a medical referee who expresed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed the disallowance and arrangements were made to have her examined by a different medical referee on 3 November 1988.  However, she failed to attend this examination and arrangements have now been made to have her examined on 8 December.  The <Col N="318" /> claim will then be reviewed in the light of the result of this examination.</P>
      <P>The person concerned also claimed disablement benefit on 14 September 1987 in respect of an occupational accident on 2 April 1984.  Regulations provide that the earliest date from which disablement benefit may be paid in the case of a late claim is three months prior to the date on which the claim is made unless good cause is shown for the delay in making the claim.  In such circumstances payment of benefit may be allowed in respect of an earlier period not exceeding six months prior to the date the claim was made. Following investigation the claim was allowed and disablement pension was awarded at the rate appropriate to an assessment of 30 per cent from 19 June 1987.  All arrears of disablement benefit were issued on 30 August 1988.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been invited to explain the reason for the delay in making the claim to disablement benefit. The question of backdating her claim a further three months will then be reviewed.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned applied for invalidity pension in July 1987.  This application was refused as the person concerned was deemed not to be permanently incapable of work.  He was notified of this decision and of his right to appeal.  As no appeal was received in the Department, it was considered that the person concerned did not wish to pursue his claim to invalidity pension and no further action was taken on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> The person concerned, on 28 November 1988, again contacted the Department with a view to claiming invalidity pension.  He had been examined in connection with his claim to dissability benefit on 17 November 1988 by a medical referee who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work and asked to have him referred for a further examination in four months.  A deciding officer decided that the person concerned was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension. He has been notified of this decision and of his right to appeal.</P>

The person concerned appealed against the assessment and an appeals officer reduced the assessment to £32.40 per week with effect from 25 July 1988.  This entitled him to a weekly payment of £5.40 being the maximum rate appropriate to his case &mdash; £37.80 &mdash; less the value of his means. Payment at the increased rate, including arrears was made on 29 November 1988. Further weekly payments of £5.40 will continue as they become due.</P>

      <P>The Eighth Council Directive requires member states to regulate the educational standards and independence of those carrying out statutory audits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, Article 2.1 of the Directive gives member states the discretion to approve natural or legal persons or other types of company, firm or partnership as auditors.  Under existing Irish legislation, section 162 (5) (e) of the <Col N="323" /> Companies Act, 1963, prohibits companies from carrying out audits.</P>
    <P>The licensing of creditors referred to in the second part of the Deputy's question, does not arise in the directive; it is assumed, therefore, that the query refers to the licensing of auditors.  In this regard, Article 28 of the Directive requires member states to ensure that the names and addresses of approved auditors and firms of auditors are made available to the public.  This in turn raises the question of introducing some sort of registration/licensing system for auditors.</P>
    <P>In general, Ireland supported the adoption of this directive.  Member states are requirted to bring its provisions into force not later than 1 January 1990.  In a number of areas, discretion is given to member states as to the manner in which the provisions will be implemented.  My Department are currently examining these options as well as considering the legislative steps necessary to implement the Directive in this country.  In the circumstances, it would be premature for me to comment in more details on the Directive.</P>

The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1988, which comes into effect on 31 December, 1988 will also apply to the operators of these systems.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently examining applications for licences to operate Multi-point Microwave Distribution Systems (MMDS) which will provide multi-channel services to areas of the country not served by cable systems.  I hope to begin to issue licences in the immediate future which will enable the installation of such systems to commence during 1989.

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to allegations published by Greenpeace and CORE in May 1988.  Copies of the allegations were provided to my Department by Greenpeace, with a copy of a commentary by Mr. John Large, an independent consultant in the UK.  These documents were examined in my Department. The allegations related largely to incidents within Sellafield, worker contamination etc., which did not have environmental implications for Ireland. The history of high levels of radioactive discharges and the number of incidents of one kind or another which take place at Sellafield suggest that the plant is not well managed and therefore the risk of a serious accident is higher than is necessary. It is for these reasons that the Government want the plant to be closed.</P>

      <P>On 24 June 1988, dead mullet were sighted by Navy personnel in an area between Cobh and Haulbowline in Cork harbour. Subsequently samples of the fish were collected by county council pollution officers lower down the harbour.</P>
      <P>These samples were examined by the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board and all were found to be net marked to some extent with no other physical abnormalities apparent.</P>
      <P>Based on the information available i.e. that only mullet were affected, that the dead fish were originally observed concentrated in a small area, and that net marks were found on the fish, I have been informed that the fish most probably died as a result of netting and were dumped in the lower harbour area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the increasing number of accidents at the railway bridge, Coote Street, Portlaoise, County Laois over which 27 trains travel daily between Dublin, Cork and Limerick and under which heavy articulated traffic with high loads on the regional route N80 is unable to pass by virtue of the bridge height; and if, in view of the fact that Laois County Council do not have sufficient funds to address the problem, he will grant-aid the project, having regard to the very serious consequences in the event of a derailment.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation at Coote Street railway bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authority has already achieved an increase in available clearance under the bridge from 12' 11&rdquo; to 13' 6&rdquo;. The local authority, in consultation with my Department's engineering advisers, considered a number of options for further increasing the clearance height.  I understand that the authority has concluded that the cost of such improvements on the existing alignment would be prohibitive.  However, an alternative crossing of the railway line at Portlaoise is available via Ridge Road and Green Mill Road, which provide a link between the N7 and N80.  I understand that the <Col N="340" /> clearance under the railway bridge on this route is 14' 4&rdquo;, compared with 13' 6&rdquo; in the case of the Coote Street bridge. Any arrangements for the diversion of high road traffic on to this alternative route are matters, in the first instance, for the local authority in consultation with the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <P>The principal changes in the reformed European Social Fund which will affect its administration by my Department are, (1)  the concentration of the new fund on the priority objectives set out in the Delors Plan, (2) closer co-ordination with the operation of the other Community <Col N="344" /> Structural Funds, and (3) the move towards the application of fund assistance for programmes as opposed to individual projects.</P>
      <P>Concentration on the priority objectives agreed for the Structural Funds will, in the case of the ESF, necessitate the preparation of separate plans for combating long term unemployment and the integration of young people into employment, as well as the training and related components of the overall plan for regional development.  Consultations have taken place with the Irish organisations which are traditional beneficiaries of the ESF on the implications of pending changes in the operation of the fund and in connection with drawing up of the relevant plans.

      <P>In 1988 a revised school medical examination system is being implemented in the Southern Health Board area.  Under the revised scheme it is intended that every school will be visited but that examinations will be confined to particular classes as follows:</P>

      <P>The situation on the ground is that the majority of patients are, in fact, referred by their general practitioners in the first instance to the consultants at the local general hospital.  My Department's policy is to develop an integrated network of services, including the general hospital service, on a catchment area basis and <Col N="349" /> this will facilitate the provision of a comprehensive health care service to all patients within the area.  However, I believe that patients themselves and their general practitioners should be allowed a reasonable degree of flexibility and choice and I am not convinced that any problems created by the existing arrangements are so great as to warrant the effective removal of this level of patient and doctor freedom.  If a hospital provides a level of activity which adequately meets the requirements of its catchment area it will attract the patients within the catchment area and the family doctors will be happy to refer their patients to them.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's question refers to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre. I do not have overall responsibility for women's affairs, nor do my Department have specific allocation for women's affairs.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Rape Crisis Centre received combined funding from the Eastern Health Board and the national lottery fund amounting to £40,500 for 1988.</P>
      <P>The current financial difficulties of the centre were caused by their entering into commitments, particularly the recruitment of extra staff, without agreement with the Eastern Health Board.  The greater part of the centre's activities is with alleged child abuse, only a small proportion of which are current cases. The Eastern Health Board already have an effective and coherent multi-disciplinary service for child abuse based at Temple Street and Crumlin Childrens' Hospitals.</P>
      <P>However, without prejudice to my view as to the manner in which the centre's difficulties have arisen, I have decided in view of the urgency of their financial position to issue to them now a further £20,000 from lottery funds.  This additional sum is their 1989 allocation from the lottery.  This payment is conditional upon their coming to agreement with the health board on the co-ordination of their services with the statutory services.  I have been in contact with the Eastern Health Board who will advise the centre about the organisation of its financial affairs.</P>

      <P>Student nurses in their first year of training in addition to the payment of £58 per week are provided with free accommodation. In their second year of training they are paid £100 per week plus additional payments in respect of week-end and night duty.  The rate of £100 per week has been structured to compensate students in their second year of training for the cost of outside accommodation. Third year students are paid £146 per week are also in receipt of additional payments in respect of weekend and night duty.</P>
      <P>All students have access to subsidised meals in their hospitals.  At the end of the three year training period, the student nurses on successfully sitting their final exminations qualify as state registered nurses &mdash; a qualification which has a high international marketable value.  It should be noted that members of other disciplines, for example medical and paramedical personnel, have to fund their own way through third level institutions before qualification.</P>
      <P>The reality of the present situation is that the available resources at my disposal for training purposes can either be allocated to the training of a select few or, alternatively, these limited resources can be spread over a greater number of students thereby giving more of our young people access to nurse training and an opportunity to achieve a skill which is in high demand.  I decided to take the latter course.  This has enabled me to make training available to as many young people as possible and as a result 400 more students for general nurse training will be recruited in 1988 over and above the 1987 intake of 720 students.  I am satisfied that this was the correct decision to make.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to he anomalous situation which exists whereby recipients of EC health eligibility cards are liable for health contributions, youth employment and income levies despite the fact that their incomes may be within the income guidelines for an Irish medical card; and the action he proposes to take to eliminate this anomaly.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued on a means test basis under section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, to persons who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants. Such persons are exempt from payment of health contributions.</P>
      <P>Persons resident in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another member state of the EC and are not also in receipt of pension from the Department of Social Welfare in Ireland or are not employed or self-employed in Ireland, are entitled to the full range of health services free of charge under EC Regulations irrespective of means.  These people are given medical cards as proof of their entitlement to health services but they are not automatically exempt from payment of health contributions.</P>
      <P>However, if their income is under the guidelines for the issue of medical cards under section 45 of the Health Act, 1970, they are of course eligible for medical cards which would exempt them from these charges.</P>

This school's application for an allocation from the capital to be made available in 1989 to my Department for its national school building programme is under consideration in conjunction with applications from other schools in a similar position.  The school authorities will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

Under these arrangements one teaching post in the school in question became surplus to requirements and the teacher concerned was facilitated through the operation of the panel scheme in obtaining an alternative post in another school.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to my Department's technological and commerce certificate examinations. These examinations are part of the technical schools' scheme of examinations and are intended primarily for evening students.  There is no provision for waiving entry fees in the case of these examinations solely.  Where, however, a student is entered for the leaving certificate or day vocational (group) certificate examinations, in addition to the technical schools examinations, there is provision for a reduction in the combined fee payable.  I might add that the entry fee in respect of the advanced level of the technical schools examinations, £30 per subject, has not been increased since 1983.</P>
