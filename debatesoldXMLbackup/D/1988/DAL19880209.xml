      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>den Taoiseach an dtuigeann sé go bhfuil fíorchontúirt ann nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge dhá húsáid mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha pobail i bhfad eile agus an bhfuil aon ghníomhaíocht speisialta beartaithe aige maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge i measc aos óg na Gaeltachta a neartú.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Gaeltachta (Mr. D. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cé gur maith liom go mbainfí i bhfad níos mó úsáide as an nGaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra sa Ghaeltacht, ní aontaím go bhfuil an scéal chomh dona agus a deireann an Teachta.</P>
      <P>Tá caomhnú na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra mar bhun-aidhm ag na scéimeanna éagsúla atá á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse, agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus tá mé sásta tríd is tríd go bhfuil ag éirí leo san aidhm sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, tá soláthar speisialta £500,000 curtha ar fáil ón gcrannchur náisiúnta le haghaidh scéim phíolóta do theilifís Ghaeilge agus tá an cheist á meas faoi láthair, i gcomhairle le <Col N="1370" /> saineolaithe éagsúla, d'fhonn teacht ar an mbealach is éifeachtaí chun an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh.  Is cinnte go dtabharfar aird ar leith do riachtanais an óige ó thaobh cláracha teilifíse i nGaeilge de in aon socruithe a dhéanfar agus, tríd is tríd, ní foláir nó gurbh fhearrde go mór í an Ghaeilge a leithéid de sheirbhís a bheith á soláthar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá scéimeanna ar leith ar siúl ag Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá siad ag tabhairt cabhrach do chlubanna, thart ar chúig cinn ar fhichead, agus ag tabhairt deontaisí dóibh.  Agus tá siad ag plé le cúrsaí sóisialta atá ag cabhrú leis an Ghaeilge.  Ach braitheann sé ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí iad féin iarratais a chur isteach leis an chabhair sin a fháil.  Go minic ní bhíonn iarratais dá leithéid á gcur isteach chuig an Udarás.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar chúrsaí san Údarás ó thaobh cheist na Gaeilge, mar an chuid is mó de na daoine atá ag obair anois sna monarchana is de bhunadh na Gaeltachta iad agus níl siad ag brath ar strainséirí níos mó le bheith ina mbainisteoirí agus le bheith i bhfeighil cúrsaí sna monarchana.  Agus sílim gur féidir a rá go bhfuil dul chun cinn an-mhór déanta ag an Údarás ó thaobh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>

Agus freisin, an féidir leis a insint dom cathain a bheas an Dara <Col N="1371" /> Plean de Bhord na Gaeilge ag teacht amach, ó thaobh oideachas trí Ghaeilge agus forbairt labhairt na Gaeilge de?</P>

B'fhéidir go bhfuil laghdú ar an daonra chomh maith, agus má thógtar é i gcomhthéacs an laghdaithe sin b'fhéidir nach bhfuil a oiread sin de laghdú tagtha ar uimhir na bpáistí atá ag fáil an deich bpunt.</P>

      <P>Tuigim ó Údarás na Gaeltachta go bhfuil an chuideachta i gceist bunaithe.  Is comhfhiontar é Telegael Teo. idir Údarás na Gaeltachta (75 faoin gcéad) agus RTE (25 faoin gcéad) a chuirfidh áiseanna táirgíochta agus eagarthóireachta clár teilifíse ar fáil do leiritheoirí neamhspleácha agus do RTÉ féin.  Beidh na háiseanna ar fáil ar théarmaí tráchtála agus cuirfear béim ar leith ar chláir theilifíse trí ghaeilge a tháirgeadh. Fáiltím roimh an tionscnamh suntasach seo agus bheinn dóchasach go dtiocfaidh méadú maith ar líon na gclár teilifíse trí Ghaeilge dá bharr.</P>

Tá siad ag tabhairt tacaíocht airgid agus beidh siad ag tabhairt cúnaimh chomh maith ó thaobh foirne, i gcomhar leis an Údarás, leis na cláracha seo a réiteach agus a chur ar fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the additional financial resources, if any, which have been made available to the health boards to enable them to provide adequate community care services in such areas as psychiatric services, facilities for the disabled, health promotion and district health nursing; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In determining their overall budgetary strategy for 1988, health boards were asked to make adequate resources available to ensure the protection of key community services such as services for the old and housebound, services for the handicapped and child care services.  I am satisfied that the overall level of funding available in 1988 is sufficient to enable them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to health promotion, the Deputy will be aware that I recently established a health promotion unit within my Department.  I have asked the boards to make special provision in 1988 <Col N="1375" /> for the development of specific projects in the area of health education and to liaise closely with the health promotion unit in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister respond to the specific question whether he had made additional financial resources available for community care? I am sure the Minister is aware that the overall allocation has been reduced. Does he intend to make or has he made additional resources available because it is clear from the Eastern Health Board&mdash; and perhaps others &mdash; that community care services are on the point of breakdown as a result of lack of resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the letter of allocation which accompanied the moneys made available to health boards, I stated very clearly that the thrust of current health policy should shift emphasis to the promotion of health and primary care. In this regard, I asked health boards to ensure that adequate resources would be allocated from within their budget to further these objectives.  I particularly considered that resources should be specifically allocated to health education projects.  Details of such projects should be identified to the promotion unit of the Department of Health in determining their overall budgetary strategy for 1988 and health boards should ensure that key services for the old and housebound are protected.  These services include community nurses, home help and meals on wheels, services for the handicapped, child care, particularly day care and preschool services for deprived and disadvantaged communities and aftercare services for children leaving long term residential care, to make sure that these are maintained at 1986 approved levels in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may appear correct to the Minister that he asked the health boards to maintain certain services, surely he must realise that he has an obligation and responsibility in this matter?  In the Southern Health Board <Col N="1376" /> area, with which I am familiar, is the Minister not aware that restrictions in capital allocations are now so severe that psychiatric nurses on the public health side are curtailing their activities in terms of visits to homes?  Any statement the Minister makes in relation to ensuring there is adequate community care in relation to the psychiatric services is quite unacceptable as the health boards, because of the rigorous financial curtailment, are not in a position to allow the work to be done on a community care basis.  Will the Minister accept that there is a necessity for further cash allocations, to the Southern Health Board in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to nurses curtailing their travelling, I must also point out that in the letter of allocation I said that to assist in the maintenance of services, health boards should ensure that the travelling expenses of care staff in the community, i.e. public health nurses, etc., should be restored to the 1986 levels.  We want to ensure that there will be no shortfall in the level of activity among the staff working in the community. The psychiatric services are going through a period of change in which there is development in the community sector and many health boards have made arrangements to develop sectors for the delivery of psychiatric services in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister must agree that the terms of that circular are really only pious platitudes?  The community care services are on the point of collapse.  The Minister referred to home help but is he aware that in the Southern Health Board area home helps, who are supposed to be one of the keystones of the community care programme, are paid 75p per hour and have been paid that amount for the last five years?  The Minister must accept that this area is neglected by the health boards and that he has no real control over how they spend their moneys which are going on acute services rather than on community care.  Surely the Minister must make additional <Col N="1377" /> moneys available for the development of the community care programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the home help service is provided and has always been provided more as good neighbourliness than as a service which is rewarded with remuneration comparable to other services.  As the Deputy rightly points out, the situation has been the same for five years.  There has been no reduction in the level of funding.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's response, I would like to put to him that a prominent public health nurse operating in the south-east region indicated this week that with the mileage cut and the increase in area, and more especially with the threatened closure of the district hospitals, it was no longer possible to maintain a viable public health nurse system.  What steps has the Minister in mind to provide an adequate public health nurse system in the south-east region and, indeed, throughout the country?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply where he indicated that he requested that the childcare services should, by and large, be maintained at least at the 1986 level, is he not aware that in the Eastern Health Board area, for example, the school medical examinations have had to be done away with? This is a very shortsighted step in view of the fact that they were able to identify early, illnesses which might lead to greater disablement among children and also more costly medical expenditure furthere down the line.  Is the Minister happy with this situation, and does he take any <Col N="1378" /> responsibility for it?  Has he any proposals in relation to this and the other areas which so many of the Deputies have been able to point out which indicate that community care is not being protected or maintained at the standard at which it was?</P>

Virtually all the community services, ranging from the district health nurses, the psycho-geriatric services, the home-help care services &mdash; all of these services &mdash; are at crisis point because of lack of resources and lack of staff.

      <P>During 1986 and 1987 a major capital scheme amounting to £0.5 million was undertaken at St. John's.  As separate capital funds were provided by the Department for this scheme it was reasonable for the Department to assume that the hospital would not need to be funded to the usual extent for its normal maintenance requirements which came from its revenue budget.  This did not apply to Barrington's which had to fund its routine maintenance requirements from its revenue budget for these years. Also, Barrington's Hospital operates a 24-hours, seven day a week casualty unit whereas St. John's operates a nine to five, seven day casualty service.  The major commitment of Barrington's to casualty demands that its funding should be protected to the maximum extent possible pending the implementation of any decision on an alternative location for the service.  In this context the cuts to St. John's allocation would have a less serious impact on services.</P>

      <P>With regard to the elderly, I expect to have a report soon from the Working Party on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly and I will then examine their recommendations on these services.  As regards the mentally ill, the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> recommended the development of a psychiatric service based primarily in the community.  This requires the provision of a wide range of facilities, outside the psychiatric hospitals, which will be much more accessible to those needing help. Progress is being made in developing these services which will be of benefit to patients and their families.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware, however, that there is a wide range of support schemes already in existence to help families care for relatives in need of care.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept <Col N="1386" /> that it would be much more satisfactory from the individual patient's point of view, while also being a lot less costly, if the Minister had a policy to provide some financial incentives to enable people to be cared for at home, in their own environment or in their own areas?  There is great confusion as to what exactly Government policy is in this area or indeed what has been Government policy in, not so much this Minister's term of office, but in previous years also.  Some nursing homes are registered to receive subvention from the health boards while others are not.  It is difficult to establish exactly what official policy is in this area. Would the Minister agree in principle with the proposal contained in the question?</P>

      <P>Health boards and voluntary organisations provide various welfare services for the elderly, the chronic sick, the disabled and for families in distress such as social work support services, day care services, home helps, home nursing, meals on wheels and fuel vouchers. The health boards in collaboration with the National Rehabilitation Board also provide vocational assessment, guidance, training in community workshops and placement for physically and mentally handicapped persons.  The health boards also administer a number of income maintenance schemes including in particular the disabled person's maintenance allowance which is available to mentally ill persons in the community who meet the conditions of eligibility. Elderly and mentally ill persons may also be entitled to free or partially free health services depending on which category of eligibility they are in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>A number of general principles govern the manner in which people have access to hospital services.  A universal principal is that access to the services is determined by the needs of the patient.  In the Irish hospital system there is a long-standing tradition of incorporating the public and private practices of hospital consultants within the public hospital system.  I believe that this tradition has served the people of this country well in making the services of the most eminent and highly-skilled medical personnel available to all categories of patient.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the common contract consultants have the right to private practice within and without the hospital in which they are employed.  However, in public hospitals the common contract stipulates that medical need should be the overall criterion for access to hospital and that admissions should be arranged accordingly.  Admission policies and practices in private hospitals are a matter for those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I cannot accept that public patients who are in urgent need of treatment do not have access to hospital facilities. In the circumstances it is unavoidable that patients will exercise their right to seek treatment on a private basis.  This can help relieve pressure on public facilities and facilitate speedier. <Col N="1389" /> access by those who are unable to avail of private facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the gap between public and private medicine is widening and, as implied in the question, that consultants are not generally available to public patients but are instantly available to private patients?  Will the Minister agree that there has been evidence of this for some time, particularly with regard to hip and heart operations and a number of other procedures?  Does the Minister accept that that trend exists?  What steps does he propose to take to deal with it or is he satisfied to allow this trend continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the gap is widening or that the position is any different from what it was when I took office.  I take the Deputy's point about long waiting lists for non-urgent procedures, particularly for such procedures as hip replacements.  The Deputy will be aware that there are two waiting lists for public patients for hip replacements, a priority waiting list and an ordinary waiting list.  Those in severe pain have priority and I am concerned at the length of time people have to wait for such operations. I am addressing that matter to see if it will be possible to improve the position. The problem is not new.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

Will the Minister agree that the community look to him, the person in control of public policy, to redress the ever widening gap which is causing such distress to the people who have to wait so long for operations?  The delay is not confined to hip operations.  When would a heart operation be considered urgent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the closure of 2,500 medical and surgical public beds in 1987 and to the end of 1988 will inevitably mean the development of more and more private <Col N="1391" /> work?  Will the Minister agree that the addition of 600 new private beds will mean that elective medical and surgical work will go to the private sector and that consultants, who are paid £36,000 per year for 34 hours public work, are no longer doing that?  Will the Minister agree that many of those consultants are spending half their time on private patients with the result that orthopaedic, ear, nose and throat and basic cardiac work for public patients, is being totally neglected?  Is the Minister aware that that is happening? Will he accept that it is his responsibility to change the system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's allegations.  In fact in some hospitals where beds were closed as a temporary measure last year the throughput of patients was greater than it had been the previous year.  I should like to add that with the advent of five-day surgery and day surgery a lot of the procedures now carried out do not demand a long stay in hospital.</P>

Such patients have to wait a longer time for such procedures.  Will the Minister accept that for an elderly person that delay can be critical and will mean a deterioration in the quality of their life?  It may mean that those people will be housebound for a number of years and that they may not benefit to any great extent from the operation.</P>

Worldwide there are waiting lists for hip replacements and countries who have tried to eliminate such waiting lists were unable to do so.  It is one of the areas I am concerned about.</P>

      <P>The hospital referred to requested funding from the Department to install the patient administration computer system approved for the health services generally.  A sum of £75,550 approximately was accordingly paid for ancillary computer services in connection with the installation of the system.  The hospital subsequently informed the Department that they were contracting for an alternative computer system.  The hospital was informed that, as they were acting contrary to Department policy, no financial assistance would be made available for the project, and arrangements were made for the sum already paid to be deducted from a subsequent capital grant instalment payable to the hospital.</P>

      <P>While this does not arise out of the specific question, I am aware that the Department decided during the period 1980-82 that the maximum use should be made of standardised computer systems in hospitals.  A detailed evaluation and assessment of requirements and of available computer systems was carried out.  A computer system supplied by McDonnell Douglas was approved as the standard computer system for patient administration. Extensive high level external computer consultancy assistance was employed in the analysis and evaluation leading to this decision.  Since the decision to standardise the McDonnell Douglas system was taken in 1982-83, there have been significant developments both in computer technology itself and in hospital information systems requirements. Accordingly, it was decided in 1987 that a new competitive tendering process should be carried out to select patient administrative systems for the future, particularly for Beaumount Hospital.</P>

To this, however, must be added a return on investments of £8.211 million which produced an overall surplus on the year's activity of £2.861 million.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister agrees that the main reason why this year every subscriber, including myself, has to pay an increased VHI subscription of between 8.5 per cent to 9.2 per cent, or an increase three times the rate of inflation, is precisely because of the enormous heightening of activity in these two hospitals?  Claims arising in respect of plans B and C require major output of money into those hospitals from the VHI, quite apart from what people pay in under plans D and E.  Would the Minister agree that at the rate we are going the VHI subscription rates will have to go up by another 8 per cent or 9 per cent in 1989, to cover the huge demand by virtue of the introduction and approval by the Minister of a two-tier system of health care in this country?  The tax relief will not be worth a curse at the rate the subscriptions to VHI are increasing in the current subscription year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 67 and Question No. 31 together.</P>
      <P>It is my objective to maintain and, if possible, expand the laundry and sterile services currently provided by the Hospital Joint Services Board (HJSB) in order to realise its full potential and put the operations of the board on a firm financial footing.</P>
      <P>Considerable efforts have been made over the year to put the operations of the board on a financially viable basis, but despite these efforts the board continued to have financial problems and the majority of hospitals remain dissatisfied with its service.  In the light of the HJSB's financial difficulties and the dissatisfaction of many hospitals it is my view that the board should consider examining the possibility of attracting genuine interested parties in order to maintain and develop the activities of the board as a going concern.  The board have been informed to this effect.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that this or any other proposal affecting the future of the HJSB will include as major considerations the present level of staff and services of the board.  Officers from my Department have recently met with representatives of the Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) to clarify and discuss the implications of this proposal for their members.  I understand that it has been agreed that a further meeting will take place to discuss the ICTU's proposals regarding the future of the Hospital Joint Services Board before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I wish to state that it is my <Col N="1399" /> intention to explore the possibility of attracting badly needed investment from genuine interested parties, under the most favourable terms, to maintain and develop the operations of the board as a going concern.</P>

      <P>I do not foresee any further closures of hospitals in 1988 beyond those already announced.  As is already well known, the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in Cork will close in the middle of the year with the transfer of the ophthalmology service to Cork Regional Hospital.  It is also intended, if possible, to transfer the services now provided at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital to other general hospitals in Dublin and to the Midland Health Board area.  Discussions are ongoing about the transfer of geriatric services from St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital, Drogheda to Drogheda Cottage Hospital.</P>
      <P>Apart from these I do not intend to take any other initiatives during 1988 involving closures.  Any proposals that health boards may make to me about hospital closures will be considered if they arise.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that there is no risk to the lives of patients undergoing operations in such hospitals associated with normal anaesthetic practice.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

The faculty itself has claimed on a number of occasions that they know of some &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo; anaesthetists working in hospitals whom they have described as dangerous and a risk to patients.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 193, 197 and 200 together.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently, the Government have decided to transfer responsibility for developing and co-ordinating community social services from the National Social Service Board to my Department.  This decision will be given effect to by regulations made under sections 4 and 6 of the National Social Services Board Act, 1984, which will remove from the purview of the National Social Service Board the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of subsection (1) of section 4 of the Act.  The Government's concern is to considerably enhance, develop and to give new emphasis to voluntary community services.  The National Social Service Board had, in fact, been involved in such work in less than half of the counties of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A newly constituted National Social Service Board will continue to support the services at present provided to community information centres.  The centres provide the public with information in relation to the whole area of community welfare and I propose to considerably enhance this activity in consultation with the Minister for Social Welfare.  I have, in fact, added to the functions of the board two additional functions: first, to report to me every six months on aspects of accessibility co-ordination or awareness of health services which can be improved to facilitate the promotion of health or the encouragement of individual responsibility for personal health; and, secondly, to promote and develop <Col N="1405" /> voluntary community information giving activities.</P>
    <P>I will be appointing the members of the board in the immediate future.  The membership will reflect the Government's concern that the board should be representative and competent to fulfil its role.  The first task of the new board will be to produce a programme of work and activity related to the development of information services for the remainder of 1988.  I will then allocate resources from the national lottery funds to meet the costs of that programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me at the outset welcome the Minister's conversion on this issue.  I am glad that occasionally this Administration can reverse a nonsensical decision.  May I ask the Minister, arising out of his reply, firstly, whether his plans in this regard require amending legislation; secondly, whether the £1 million allocated or announced previously will be available to the new board; thirdly, the specific functions the new board will have and, fourthly, the numbers that will be on the new board as constituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation will not be necessary for the changes in the National Social Service Board.  The funding from the national lottery will be decided on a proportional basis.  The functions of the National Social Service Board in relation to community information centres will be funded with a portion of the £1 million and the remainder will be used by my Department to fund community-based activities in line with what the £1 million was allocated to do.</P>

      <P>It is really in order to try to have the procedures regulated in the best possible way.  If an Inter-governmental Conference were to be held tomorrow it would have been followed by a statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. King, in the House of Commons and then I would almost certainly have had a meeting with the British Prime Minister on the same day or the following day.  It is in order to try to have our discussions as fruitful as possible that, at our suggestion, the Inter-governmental Conference meeting &mdash; which, by the way, was never fixed for tomorrow but was proposed for tomorrow &mdash; has been postponed.  It will be replaced by a ministerial meeting between the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Energy and for Communications and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The statement by the Secretary of State in the British House of Commons will not take place on Thursday.  It is very likely that I will have a meeting with the British Prime Minister in Brussels and at that stage I think the scene for a further Inter-governmental Conference meeting would be set much more effectively.</P>

      <P>In resuming on this debate I should like to refer to the response to the budget from the Combat Poverty Agency which issued a budget analysis on the implications for poverty on 29 January 1988.  In the introductory section to their document, they point out quite clearly that the agency consider that the overall policy framework of the budget will not significantly change the existing scale of poverty and that there are a number of reasons for this.  They state:</P>
      <P>First, the budget will not bring about any major redistribution of income and resources between different groupings of the population; at best, it will effect small shifts here and there in the economy. Secondly, the budget will not significantly reduce poverty because it does not provide a comprehensive programme of reform of the taxation and social welfare systems.  Thirdly, the budget will not reduce the continuing high levels of unemployment even if the job targets in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> are achieved.  A job &mdash; the main outlet from poverty apart from emigration &mdash; will still remain beyond the reach of many of those who are currently poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That analysis of the budget is significant because it has been done, not by an interest group, not by the Labour Party, or the Workers' Party, or any other party, but by a statutory agency established by this House to advise the Government in various ways in relation to the elimination of poverty.  In the preface to their document the Combat Poverty Agency point out that they have a statutory obligation to advise the Government on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty and to promote greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent <Col N="1539" /> of poverty and the measures necessary to overcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant because of the source of the analysis.  It is an agency established by this House and the Government in relation to poverty. In the view of the agency, the current budget which we are debating will not significantly improve the position of those caught in the poverty trap.  That analysis is significant in view of the apparent welcome that the budget has received from the majority of the public polled recently in that regard.</P>
      <P>The point that I made last week at the commencement of my contribution was that the budget was only the gloss on what the Government had already done in relation to the Estimates.  Unless you take the effect of the cuts in the Estimates and a whole range of social services into account, obviously the goodies which were distributed on budget day will give the impression that something good and useful has been done.  I do not propose to go over the points I made last week in relation to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been at least one other development since I spoke last week which should be referred to and that is the announcement of the unemployment figures last weekend which showed a furthere increase of something like 2,000 on the register.  Unfortunately these State figures do not reflect the real situation in relation to unemployment.  They do not take into account the numbers that are continuing to emigrate, the numbers that have been taken off the register because of the Jobsearch programme or the large numbers of people who are no longer signing on because they are no longer entitled to unemployment assistance without means testing.  Clearly a major unemployment problem is facing the country and the general opinion of those who are praising this budget is that this <Col N="1540" /> budget will not tackle unemployment in the current year and that it will not reflate the economy to any extent and in fact they are of the opinion that it will deflate it even further.  There is an unreal sense in Fianna Fáil in relation to the opinion polls.  Fianna Fáil would be naïve to believe that they have massive support because of the budget.  I am sure Fianna Fáil are realistic enough to recognise that, if not immediately, then certainly in the course of the next few weeks.  As people realise the effects of this budget combined with the effects of the Estimates that were introduced late last year their view of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael who are maintaining them in power will rapidly change.  There is a fundamental difference in my view of the budget and that of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats who are involved in this consensus of tackling our problems by viewing the national debt as the most important problem. They believe that until the national debt is tackled nothing else can be done. Those of us on the left and I presume at this stage we must include the Labour Party, would argue the reverse.</P>

Fianna Fáil should recall that by and large their support is support which the Fine Gael Party do not normally draw and that the road which they have taken in recent times, while it may gain the applause and support of the media and economists in the media, will not at the end of the day gain the support of the ordinary people who will be voting in the general election, whether sooner or later.  If Fianna Fáil maintain their present course they will have no <Col N="1541" /> future other than as Opposition.  There is need for them to reappraise what they are doing and where they are going.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The year 1987 will be looked back upon as a watershed; the year in which the Government took firm control of the economy and began to turn it around after a long period of mismanagement. We are now well into the task of overcoming the serious economic difficulties which were steadily destroying all our hopes and prospects as a nation.  The first crucial steps necessary for national recovery have been successfully implemented.  They are part of a clear overall strategy set out in our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  That programme is designed to secure a return to economic growth and increased employment in the 1990s.  This budget is a further step along the planned road to recovery.</P>
      <P>In 1988 we have to follow through and maintain the process of restoring order to the national finances and reducing the relative size of the national debt, as an essential prelude to future growth.  The most difficult stage of all is now immediately ahead of us.  What we have started must be seen through to a successful conclusion so that the sacrifices being made will bring the reward of permanent and lasting improvement in the welfare of our people.  The complete success we have achieved in managing the public finances in 1987 has, however, brought its own danger because of some feeling among the public that the worst is over and that we can now relax and slip back into the old ways of indifferent management and lack of direction and control.  It would be tragic if we were to give in to that kind of weakness now having come this far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the moment the overriding priority must be to stabilise the relationship between the national debt and GNP because this is the only basis on which we can secure all the other improvements we desire.  We can of course, and we will, within the strict expenditure constraints adopted, pursue active development policies, seek to improve tax equity, maintain the basis standards of our social welfare <Col N="1542" /> system and the other public services. However, it is dangerously premature at this stage to be calling for a new agenda or for reflation as if our financial problems were already solved.  No one should underestimate the difficult path that still lies ahead, because the only thing that we can say with certainty at this stage is that we have made a good start and have clearly demonstrated that recovery is possible.</P>
    <P>Last year we took three major first steps.  In the March budget we made a decisive reduction in the level of spending and borrowing.  Then immediately after the budget we started a detailed, thorough and comprehensive examination of all aspects of Government expenditure culminating in the publication of the 1988 Book of Estimates which significantly reduced expenditure right across the board.  Later on in the year we formulated an agreement with the social partners on a broad and balanced strategy of economic recovery covering employment, the public finances, taxation and social equity which was endorsed by them.</P>
    <P>In 1987 for only the second time in ten years the budget strategy was adhered to and the targets met.  A large reduction in Government borrowing was achieved, indeed with a significant margin to spare. As a result confidence returned.  The Minister for Finance has outlined to the House in detail what was achieved in relation to the public finances in 1987.  A few key figures illustrate the dramatic improvement that has been achieved.</P>
    <P>This State had been borrowing about £2 billion every year in recent years. Every year since 1984 we have been sending out of the country between £700-£800 million in interest payments on the foreign debt, while the cost of servicing the national debt as a whole has been over £2 billion.  The weight of this borrowing was crushing the life out of the economy.  Total Exchequer borrowing was reduced to £1,786 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>In 1988 we will be making substantial progress in reducing the level of borrowing still further.  Exchequer borrowing will be £1,457 million that is £340 million below the 1987 level and £688 <Col N="1543" /> million below the level in 1986.  In fact, Exchequer borrowing has now been reduced by one-third in just two years. Taking 1987 and 1988 together the two-stage reduction in expenditure has been evenly distributed between the current and the capital side.  There will be a further significant reduction in the current budget deficit this year and in due course reduced interest payments resulting from a reduction in the real level of the national debt should allow for sustained reductions in the current budget deficit in future years.  Definite and encouraging progress has been made in achieving the objectives we first set out in the financial framework section of our election programme.</P>
    <P>Deputies and others may complain about the deflationary and social effects of bringing the debt problem under control but these must be contrasted with what would have happened had we allowed the national debt to keep on growing and growing to the point where it could no longer be sustained.  Some people have recently been speaking as if controlling the rise in the national debt was an option, something that might take second place to some other priority.  That is just nonsense.  There is no option.  It is an inescapable, even if unpalatable, truth that we could not go on as we were.  It was not a question of choice.  The stark reality was that we were approaching the point where the public finances would no longer be able to cope with even the existing social and welfare services we have.</P>
    <P>It is a delusion to think that it only needs a political decision to eliminate poverty in Ireland.  If it were so, would not every party in the Dáil jump at doing so?  In better times when the resources were available Fianna Fáil Governments led the way in building up and developing all our welfare services and we will always point with pride to what was achieved in those days, particularly in giving a new dignity and status to the old and the disadvantaged. I can give a solemn assurance that we will return to that great humanitarian task as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> When we came into office last March, the national debt at £25 billion had grown from 133 per cent of GNP to 151.5 per cent between 1985 and 1986.  The action we have taken together with healthy economic growth in 1987 meant that the debt-GNP ratio increased by less than 1 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>The absolute size of the foreign debt, with the help of favourable exchange rate movements, actually declined slightly to under £9.7 billion.  It looks as if the foreign debt may already have stabilised at or below the 1986 level of 60 per cent of GNP, and we are on target to stabilise the overall national debt-GNP ratio by 1990.</P>
    <P>For some time before the general election I had been arguing that more active management of the national debt was possible and that this could achieve significant savings in the cost of servicing it. During the past year measures to improve the management of the debt have been actively pursued by the Department of Finance.  The resulting savings are reflected in the 1988 provision for Central Fund services, which shows one of the lowest increases for many years.  Interest on the debt will increase by only £40 million, compared with a £150 million increase last year.</P>
    <P>Among the measures taken have been:</P>
    <P>the issues of new borrowing instruments in both foreign and domestic markets, including the ECU bond issue, and the introduction of the scheme of tax-exempt bonds for multinational companies &mdash; resulting in some of the cheapest dollar funding that the Exchequer has ever received;</P>
    <P>an increase in the volume of Exchequer bills, which are providing funds for the Exchequer at about 1½ per cent below the cost of gilts;</P>
    <P>renewed promotion of the small savings schemes so as to obtain more stable funding for the Exchequer;</P>
    <P>continuation of the programme for prepaying foreign loans and refinancing them at lower costs.  The savings from this programme now <Col N="1545" /> amount to about £100 million over the life of the prepaid loans;</P>
    <P>the undertaking of a major programme of interest rate swaps, which is giving considerable savings;</P>
    <P>regular discussions with domestic and international finance houses on new instruments of debt management.</P>
    <P>The cost of servicing the national debt takes such a large proportion of our budgetary resources that we must constantly seek savings in this area and increase the sophistication and efficiency of our management techniques.</P>
    <P>One important outcome of controlling the national debt is to give the Government scope for reductions in the burden of income tax especially on the PAYE sector and to introduce measures to reform the system and improve tax equity.  Between 1982 and 1986 the main burden of the effort to achieve a better financial balance was borne by the taxpayer, and taxes increased in real terms by 5 per cent of GNP over that period. That approach contributed substantially to negative growth and rising unemployment and this lesson should be remembered by those who are now advocating further increases in taxation for whatever purpose.  Last year was the first time for a number of years that tax did not increase as a percentage of GNP.  It will not increase in 1988 either.  This is a radical change from previous years when the principal instrument of fiscal correction was increased taxation.  Today the strategy of our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> places a joint emphasis on expenditure reductions and economic development, as indeed we proposed previously in <i>The Way Forward.</i></P>
    <P>We can recall the histrionics of January 1983 when Deputy Alan Dukes, as Minister for Finance, sought the adoption in 1983 of a current budget deficit target of £750 million which had been set by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government but was overruled.  For the rest of the lifetime of that Government the public finances got further and further out of balance <Col N="1546" /> because of that initial refusal to agree to the proposal of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In the past year it has been demonstrated that if they have the political will to do so a united Government can impose the necessary disciplines on Government spending.  Government expenditure has been reduced by almost 5 per cent of GNP from 55 per cent in 1986 to 50.3 per cent in 1988, when allowance is made in previous years' figures for the impact of the technical change in the local loans fund arrangements introduced this year.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has wrestled with the task of reducing Government expenditure or who has even studied it carefully knows that the key factor is public service numbers and pay.  One half of Government spending goes on pay.  In his budget speech, last year, the Minister for Finance outlined the stringent measures which the Government had decided to take to reduce significantly public service numbers.  To enable this to be achieved in a fair and just manner we introduced a programme of voluntary redundancy. This programme has been successful in reducing numbers in the public service last year by 7,000.  We will press ahead with this programme of reducing the size and the cost of the public service.  This year we expect numbers to fall by a further 9,000.  The decrease from nearly 189,000 to just over 172,000 represents an 8.5 per cent reduction in numbers over two years.  Outside the Civil Service, which constitutes about one-sixth of total numbers, this structural reduction in the country's administrative overheads is a necessary, radical measure which had never before been seriously attempted. What we must do is ensure that substainable jobs can be generated through the right conditions in the private sector to make up for the reduction of the public service to a level we can afford.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-seventies, we have been borrowing heavily to continuously improve out health, educational and social welfare systems, so that we now have a highly developed level of public services in relation to national income. We have sought social services on a par <Col N="1547" /> with those in much wealthier countries. What the Government are striving for is to make all public services more economic and efficient and by prudent management of resources to maintain the real value of welfare services for those who need them.  Everyone concerned should co-operate with us in this sensible objective instead of continuing to demand the supply of services at a level and scope we cannot sustain in present circumstances. To maintain an acceptable level of social welfare payments we must exert control and cut down on abuse.  Over £20 million has been saved in 1987 in this way and this went a long way toward helping to provide the modest improvements in this budget.</P>
    <P>In the health area the major hospital modernisation programme begun ten years ago has been nearly completed. Since 1978 £500 million has been invested in new, modern, well-equipped hospitals. These new hospitals are to replace old unsuitable ones.  What is now demanded is that, having spent vast amounts of taxpayers' funds providing first-class new hospitals, we keep the old ones as well, very often for sentimental reasons only. The numbers employed in the health services grew enormously over the last ten years and the reduction in numbers at present being sought is very modest by comparison.</P>
    <P>In education, too, there is a need for realism and commonsense.  Education is the second largest estimate.  Current expenditure is £1,269 million or over 7 per cent of GNP.  There are one million pupils, and 50,000 teachers and other staff.  The education of our children is a top priority and we will make every effort to make sure that it is of the best quality we can afford.  We are determined in particular to maintain the quality of the education our children receive at primary level.  The high standards and achievements of our educational system are recognised at home and abroad.  The provision of such an extensive range of educational services from the age of four to third level is no mean achievement in a country of limited resources.  In view of <Col N="1548" /> important demographic trends for the pupil population at primary level over the next four years, the Government are undertaking a fundamental review of the provision of primary education and the primary curriculum and I welcome the participation of the teachers' union and of the National Parents' Council in that review.  Even in the extremely difficult capital budgetary situation the Minister has provided an extra £6.5 million to extend, improve or replace certain primary and secondary schools which are in an unsatisfactory or dilapidated condition, mainly in rural areas.  We have always, and will continue, to aim to have an educational system of which we can be proud but our economic circumstances now demand that everybody involved combines to make it cost-effective.</P>
    <P>Two major benefits that have flowed from the implementation of our financial policies and action in the 1987 budget have been a substantial reduction in interest rates and a corresponding reduction in the rate of inflation.  Interest rates have fallen by about 5 per cent since March, 1987 and this had a very useful effect in counteracting the deflationary effect of budget stringency.  Home owners with mortgages have benefited with a saving of around £55 a month. While real interest rates remain high, we are hopeful that reduced Government borrowing will bring home further reduction in the course of 1988.</P>
    <P>Our rate of inflation is now down to the level of the sixties.  In mid-November the quarterly rise in the consumer price index was a mere 0.1 per cent and, for the year as a whole, inflation was only marginally in excess of 3 per cent.  We are now a low inflation country, even in relation to many of our EC partners.  In particular our inflation is nearly 1 per cent below the British rate.  We hope to reduce it further in 1988 to around 2.5 per cent.  The moderate wage increases agreed in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for the next three years should enable us to keep inflation down to these levels and, furthermore, to improve our competitiveness, with obvious benefits in employment and growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> During the general election campaign I indicated that we would be aiming over the medium term for an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent.  To achieve this level of growth, and, more important, to sustain it, requires that the public finances be put on a sound basis.  Corrective fiscal action, of course, has its downside in its deflationary impact.  This can, however, be offset and mitigated by lower interest rates, rising exports and increasing our share of the home market.  In fact the growth rate achieved in 1987 having regard to the nature of that year's budget was quite remarkable.  Furthermore, the recent ESRI review shows that, provided current financial policies are carried through to a successful conclusion, there should be a return to sustained growth, on the scale of last year's outturn, in the nineties.</P>
    <P>The past year, in terms of growth, turned out substantially better than anticipated, considerably exceeding the prudent projections we made at the time of the budget.  The latest estimates put our growth rate in 1987 at round 3.5 per cent.  This was, in fact, the highest growth rate in the EC, apart from Spain and Portugal.  There were, of course, elements of rebound in last year's performance &mdash; notably as regards agricultural incomes and tourism earnings &mdash; and it owned a lot to the exceptional buoyancy of industrial exports.  For this reason, and given the less favourable external economic prospect and necessary reductions in public expenditure, the rate predicted for economic growth in 1988 is at present minimal.  However, economic forecasting is not an exact science and no one can categorically state that even in the coming year a modest growth rate may not be possible. Whether that is the case, it has no bearing on the correctness of the strategy we are now following.</P>
    <P>There were some distinctly positive features in the economic outturn in 1987. Industrial production revived strongly, increasing by 10 per cent compared with less than 3 per cent in 1985 and in 1986. This was the biggest increase in the EC. The performance of the more traditional <Col N="1550" /> labour intensive sectors improved but is still unsatisfactory.  The volume of industrial exports increased by about 18 per cent in volume.  Total exports well exceeded £10 billion, bringing the trade surplus on an adjusted basis to around £1.25 billion.  As a result we achieved a small balance of payments surplus in 1987.  This was the first surplus since 1967 and compared with a deficit of over £500 million or 3 per cent of GNP in 1986. There is every indication at the moment that the balance of payments are moving into structural surplus and that this will continue to grow in 1988.  The country's foreign reserves increased markedly following the budget and now stand at a record level of £2.8 billion providing about three and a half months import cover.  In contrast to an almost total lack of growth in recent years, industrial investment also revived by 5 per cent in 1987.  It was also a year of strong recovery in agriculture, with a reversal of the decline in farm incomes in 1985 and 1986, and in tourism which had a record year.</P>
    <P>The level of unemployment remained unsatisfactorily high.  Nevertheless for the first time in eight years there was no rise in unemployment between January 1987 and January 1988.  The objective must be that when our financial problems are brought under control and various development measures take effect to steadily reduce the level of unemployment. As the latest EC Annual Report on Ireland states: &ldquo;The present re-establishment of a favourable environment for growth through further budgetary adjustment is thus an essential precondition for progress in reducing unemployment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of budgetary strategy this year was to continue to improve the overall state of the public finances and rightly so.  But while achieving this objective the Government have prudently and with considerable skill made maximum use of their limited scope for manoeuvre to effect a number of significant improvements in both the level and structure of taxation and in social welfare.  The introduction of self-assessment, the reform of the structure of <Col N="1551" /> corporation tax, the extension of PRSI to farmers and the self-employed and the reductions in personal taxation are a clear indication of our intention to improve the entire tax system.  The structural reforms contained in this budget go far beyond anything attempted since the introduction of PAYE.  A worthy effort has been made to help those at the lowest end of the social scale through the social welfare code and otherwise.</P>
    <P>It was alleged by the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance that while the 1987 Budget led to a reduction in interest rates there had been no stimulus to investment. That is not correct.  For the first time in many years there was strong growth in investment in plant and equipment in 1987 and the signs are that this will continue in 1988; this will lead to new employment in industry.</P>
    <P>The budget has also been criticised for failing to provide an economic stimulus. This ignores the simple fact that the improved confidence which has been strengthened by it is in itself a stimulus. The traditional type of stimulus, that which was provided by increased overall Government expenditure and borrowing, is in the main ruled out in present circumstances. But in addition to the real stimulus provided by evidence of sound financial management the budget contains a considerable number of elements that will be conductive to growth, development and employment.  These are, further reductions in interest rates resulting from the reduced pressure from Government borrowing on the liquidity of the money markets; the reform of corporation tax, which will shift investment in 1988 from fixed assets to employment; an extra £4 million for tourism; the restoration of the young farmers' installation aid; the two phases of decentralisation of the Civil Service; the tax exemption scheme for profits repatriated to Ireland for investment; the reintroduction of section 23, and the extension of the urban renewal scheme and tax relief on the use of cars for business purposes.  This is a considerably larger, more substantial and <Col N="1552" /> more potential list of employment measures than were contained in any other recent budget.</P>
    <P>The main function of the budget is to set the fiscal and financial framework for the economy.  Within the budgetary framework specific measures to promote growth and development should be pursued throughout the year.  There are also many activities of Government, either in the form of administrative action or legislation which can have a positive impact on growth and development.</P>
    <P>The improvement of competitiveness by reducing costs has been given a high priority by the Government, and acted upon.  There is no need for a new agenda because this has been on the Governments agenda since last summer.</P>
    <P>Our very low inflation rate which was not significantly affected by budget measures will increase our export competitiveness, as has the reduction in our very high interest rates.</P>
    <P>Price controls on petroleum products were abolished by the previous Government, and had to be reimposed in July to ensure that price reductions were fully passed on to the consumers.  The price of premium grade petrol dropped 23p between July and budget day.  Electricity prices will be reduced for commercial firms who will be able to reclaim VAT and secure a 5 per cent reduction in their energy costs.</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance for businesses is a major problem.  The Courts Bill, which provides for the abolition of juries in personal injuries cases, the drafting of legislation to give effect to the main recommendations of the Barrington Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work and the promotion of safety audit arrangements by insurance companies are all measures which taken together, should lead to a reduction in the insurance costs at present borne by businesses.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation of air transport with consequent cheaper fares for business travellers will also have a beneficial effect.  Reductions in international charges for telecommunications, which will help improve competitiveness, will be <Col N="1553" /> announced by Telecom Éireann.  In the budget we have raised the capital allowances and running expenses by 50 per cent on the use of motor cars for business purposes.  All in all considerable progress has been made in the last 12 months in reducing interest, energy and transport costs, but there is a great deal more that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The concept of a consensus on economic and social policy emerged out of the NESC report of November 1986.  To set it out in express terms in the form of a written programme, as we have done, represented a major advance in the management of the Irish economy.  For the first time ever a comprehensive three year agreement, designed to regenerate the economy and improve social equity was drawn up and agreed by the trade unions, the employers, the farmers and the Government.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been widely welcomed.  Furthermore the validity of the Government's policy approach has been confirmed by the Economic and Social Research Institute, which shows that current policies should lead within a couple of years to a return to a path of steady growth.</P>
    <P>This approach of seeking dialogue and consensus has the complete support of the European Commission.  The Commission states in its Annual Report:</P>
    <P>Strengthening social dialogue at national and Community levels remains decisive for widening the consensus on the changes of attitude and the economic policy measures necessary for the success of the Community strategy ...  However, the will to cooperate shown by the social partners at Community level should also be better utilised at national level.</P>
    <P>The current negotiations in the Community on the Delors plan and the outcome of the Brussels summit this week could have an important influence on our efforts to achieve our objectives in a number of sectors of the programme.  The increase in the resources, and the changes in the mechanisms of the structural funds, for instance, could be very helpful and it <Col N="1554" /> will be essential that we keep the objectives of the programme in mind throughout these forthcoming discussions.</P>
    <P>The budgetary measures announced by the Minister for Finance, together with the 1988 Estimates and Public Capital Programme, are designed to meet the Government's commitments in the programme on macroeconomic policies, tax reform, social equity and for development and employment.</P>
    <P>I cannot possibly accept Opposition criticisms to the effect that the Government have missed an opportunity this year in the area of tax reform.  In fact the Minister for Finance has rightly claimed that this year represents the greatest advance in tax reform since the introduction of PAYE.</P>
    <P>One of the specific commitments made by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was to introduce income tax reductions to the cumulative value over the next three years of £225 million including increases in the PAYE allowance of £70 million.  That entire undertaking has been met in this budget as the total cumulative value of the changes outlined last week were £91 million this year, £152 million in a full year and around £400 million over the three year period of the programme.</P>
    <P>The PAYE allowance, which was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government in the 1980 budget, has been improved with the objective of moderating the disproportionate amount of the burden of taxation now borne by the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Another income tax objective, set out in the programme, is to achieve a situation where two-thirds of taxpayers will pay only the standard rate of income tax. This aim was included in our general election manifesto.  The tax changes in this budget will bring us close to achieving that aim, by broadening the bands and reducing from 48 per cent to 37 per cent the percentage of taxpayers paying at the higher rates.  The 35 per cent income tax band has been widened by £1,000 in the case of a single person and £2,000 for a married couple, the first major widening of bands since the early eighties.  The budget changes will end the unacceptable <Col N="1555" /> situation whereby a single person earning less than £10,000 a year can be subjected to a marginal tax rate of 58 per cent.  A married couple, with one spouse working, on PAYE with full mortgage relief, will in future have to earn nearly £26,000 a year before reaching the highest tax band.  By international standards, our tax rates were particularly penal for the middle income group and for the single person.  It is only equitable that they will benefit relatively better from the reliefs being given.  While this is a significant improvement in the existing situation, it cannot be regarded as anything more than a first step in the right direction.  The very limited resources available ruled out the possibility of any substantial relief for income taxpayers this year, but this must be our continuing objective.</P>
    <P>The income tax concessions are still more than three times what could be required for personal and PAYE allowances and the bands to keep pace with the expected rise in the consumer price index.  For the first time anyone can remember, income tax is not planned to rise at all compared with the previous year.  The anticipated yield for all forms of taxation will be up by only 2.2 per cent, slightly less than the expected rate of inflation.  As a result of the substantial increase in tax relief in the budget, any PAYE worker getting the pay increase provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will at all income levels see his or her take-home pay rising ahead of the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>The tax concessions in the budget, together with the moderate pay rises in the programme, reduced interest and mortgage rates and the social welfare increases of £45 million should lead to some modest increase in disposable income.  This is important because it can give some lift to personal consumption in real terms this year.  The listlessness of consumer spending is a major inhibiting factor in raising the level of domestic economic activity and providing more employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>This year two fundamental reforms are being undertaken in the tax system &mdash; the <Col N="1556" /> introduction of self assessment for the self-employed and major changes in corporation tax.  Both will move us towards the objective of a more efficient and equitable tax system.</P>
    <P>I made a commitment to the introduction of a system of self-assessment back in January, 1986, very soon after the publication of the Fifth Report of the Commission on Taxation.  The issue was taken up later that year by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, who organised some preliminary studies on the subject with the help of the IMF.  We repeated our commitment as the second main aim of our taxation policy in our election programme.</P>
    <P>Self-assessment requires radical changes in procedures both for the taxpayers concerned and for the Revenue authorities. It must be phased in over a period, but the initial key steps are being put into effect this year.  These will apply to income tax for the self-employed and to corporation tax.  As part of these arrangements for a phased move towards self-assessment, self-employed and corporate taxpayers will have the option of a fuller, voluntary form of self-assessment this year.</P>
    <P>These changes in assessment procedures will make a major contribution to improving their efficiency and effectiveness, by eliminating lengthy negotiations with the tax authorities following the initial estimate which may be inflated, and by reducing the huge backlog in the tax system.  The new system will work better for the self-employed and farmers, in that it will avoid the confusion which arises when amounts are demanded that are not actually due.  It will greatly reduce scope for delays and evasion, and speed up the flow of revenue to the benefit of the country at large.  It will create greater equity as between the self-employed and the PAYE sector by the more prompt collection of tax.  An inefficient tax system is a definite handicap for the commercial sector and a source of frustration generally.  Therefore, this change is in itself an important contribution to improving the climate for business.  It has <Col N="1557" /> been efficient and successful, for example, in the United States.</P>
    <P>The basis on which farmers will pay tax was decided once and for all last year. This must be accepted as final.  The other sections of the national community who are paying very high rates of tax cannot be expected to tolerate any further chopping and changing or any further postponement. The only fair and acceptable system of farm tax is taxation on actual income, the same as for every other sector of the community.  The income tax system is fair and acceptable not only between different sectors of the community but between different categories of farmers.  It is the only system that can take account of good years and bad, of family circumstances, and of whether for instance a farmer has a milk quota.  The income tax system for farmers is an integral part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and will be adhered to.  Sensible arrangements for the administration of the system have been devised, which will be further improved by the reform of the taxation system for the self-employed announced this year.  I would ask everyone to accept that this issue has been finally settled.</P>
    <P>The withholding tax on professional fees which was introduced with effect from June last yielded £20 million in 1987. The tax is an important innovation in the tax system and it has operated satisfactorily to date.  It was another measure designed to improve equity in the tax system as between professional self-employed people and the PAYE sector. It will be further extended this year to payments made by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in respect of fees of medical personnel.  The prediction that the tax would cause widespread disruption has proved to be unfounded.  In 1988 the Exchequer will continue to benefit from the cash flow from the tax even though most taxpayers will be able to offset tax withheld against their normal tax liability in 1988.  It should be clearly understood that the tax withheld is tax which in almost all cases is due to be paid ultimately.  There is no valid justification for opposing this method of collecting tax <Col N="1558" /> which is payable, especially as it is a very mild version of the much greater deductions made from the vast majority of taxpayers, namely the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the tax collection system became impaired over recent years by the steady addition of an increasing load of functions.  A number of administrative and legal steps were taken to improve the situation in regard to arrears and as announced in last year's budget a special task force formed from officers in the former Department of the Public Service was established specifically to tackle the problem.  It has had considerable success.  By the end of 1987 over £14 million in arrears had been collected compared with the target we set of £10 million.  The position is, however, still far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Accordingly two further steps are being taken: a new power of attachment and the incentive of a once-off offer to waive interest and penalties where taxpayers bring their payments up-to-date. The incentive to bring tax payments up-to-date gives every trader, company and self-employed person a final opportunity to put their tax affairs in order before all the new procedures for collection and enforcement become fully operative.  It should be availed of now.</P>
    <P>It is idle to talk of tax reform as long as the system of collection is defective. All the changes and innovations that have been announced, therefore, have the aim of ensuring that we have a system of collection that works efficiently and fairly.  Anything else is blatantly unjust and causes widespread resentment.</P>
    <P>The extension of social insurance to the self-employed is one of the most significant developments in relation to social welfare which has taken place in recent years.  Up to one quarter of a million self-employed persons will be brought into the social insurance system for the first time.  They will now in return for the payment and contributions acquire cover for a pension in old age and, in the event of their death, their wives and children will also qualify as of right.  This is a major change for the better in the whole area of social protection and brings <Col N="1559" /> Ireland in this regard into line with virtually every other European country.</P>
    <P>The self-employed have hitherto had to rely on social assistance pensions financed fully by the Exchequer at a cost of over £300 million to the taxpayer.  The self-employed will now for the first time be making a direct contribution to the financing of their own social welfare pensions and over time this will reduce significantly the net cost of these pensions to the Exchequer and, ease the burden on the general taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In setting the level of contribution for the self-employed the Government had to have regard to the fact that not all self-employed are in the high income category and to bring in straightaway a high level of contribution would have caused hardship for many.  There is also the consideration that it will take some time to get this major change operating effectively and comprehensively.  The arguments therefore for phasing it in over a number of years are compelling.  For the 1988-89 tax year the rate will be 3 per cent subject to a minimum contribution of £4 per week.  Those on low incomes who are not regularly assessed for income tax will be subject to a flat-rate contribution of £2 per week.  Smallholders on unemployment assistance will not be required to pay a contribution towards the scheme.  The contribution rates for future years will be laid down in this year's Social Welfare Bill, so there will be no doubt about the three years phasing in up to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>This is another commitment by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which is being honoured and I am fully satisfied that we are doing it in a way that is fair and equitable to both the self-employed and taxpayers in general.  It does not make sense for any party to say they will vote against it because it is being phased in.  The political reality is that this long delayed reform is at last being implemented and it is less than honest not to recognise what a major step this Government are now taking which so many of their predecessors <Col N="1560" /> failed to take.  It should be welcomed as something that is long overdue.</P>
    <P>This Government can legitimately claim that in the two budgets they have introduced they have now done a great deal to spread more fairly and evenly the burden of tax between the PAYE sector and other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax changes which were announced by the Minister for Finance also constitute the first major reform of the corporation tax code for many years.  This reform will have important economic and fiscal effects.  It is now accepted in several OECD countries that corporation tax rates should be reduced and capital allowances cut back so as to improve economic efficiency and bring about greater equity in the treatment of different firms and industries.  Our standard rate of corporation tax at 50 per cent is too high by comparison with many EC countries and its reduction to 43 per cent will be of significant benefit to service companies including construction firms which tend to be labour-intensive.  There has been increasing recognition recently that our tax system unduly favours capital expenditure at the expense of employment, and the parallel reduction in the first year of 100 per cent capital allowances to 50 per cent will help to restore the balance.  Other changes are designed to increase Exchequer revenue and simplify the corporation tax system and other aspects.</P>
    <P>A new provision is being introduced to encourage Irish companies to repatriate dividents from their foreign subsidiaries subject to certain conditions.  These moneys will be relieved from Irish tax if they are used here for specified investment purposes.  The Government expect that this measure will ensure that progressive Irish companies with international associates which are in a position to do so will repatriate as much of their foreign earnings as possible for new investment and the creation of employment here.</P>
    <P>For the second year running the Government have imposed no excise duty increases on beer, wine and spirits which should be of assistance to this <Col N="1561" /> important industry and also be of some help to the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the 48-hour restriction on cross-Border shopping in this Government's first budget on 31 March 1987 has been highly successful.  A grave distortion of trade has been corrected and business restored to its natural centres.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Commission of the European Communities should take the view that this measure is in breach of our obligations under the EC Treaty, and that they intend to test the matter in the European Court.  The situation that had developed was intolerable from the point of view of the Irish Government with the so-called travellers' allowance being the subject of wholesale abuse resulting in an unacceptable loss to the Irish Exchequer and to business in this part of the country. Whatever the purpose of these travellers' allowances they clearly were never intended to support organised shopping expenditions and the distortion of trade. I believe the Commission should think again about this issue.</P>
    <P>To achieve the fiscal and social purposes of the budget it was necessary to raise some new revenue.  The 8p increase in excise duty on petrol in fact, only offset a single price fall earlier in the month and should be viewed in the context of a fall in the price by 21p since last July.  The improved capital allowances for motor cars for business purposes which I have mentioned are something that the motor industry have sought for some time past, and the measure should be of assistance to that trade.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments have always been deeply committed to social progress and to the improvement of the situation of the disadvantaged within our society. We have never accepted that social welfare is a legitimate target for reductions in expenditure.  It is our firm conviction and indeed an essential part of our political philosophy as a party that the poor, the disadvantaged and the old have a special claim on the resources of the community and must always be protected from the impact of economic forces to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> We have honoured our commitment under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to maintain the overall value of social welfare payments.  We have also had regard to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The overall increase of 3 per cent should maintain the general standard of living of social welfare recipients having regard to the projected rate of inflation.  The improvement in the situation of the long-term unemployed, the extension to them of the free fuel service and the extension of treatment to the spouses of insured workers are all in line with the trend of the recommendations of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Two special measures in the budget give a clear indication of our decision to respond sympathetically to special needs. One is the provision of £3 million over three years for voluntary organisations providing accommodation for the homeless and the other is our decision to retain in full the drug refund and long term illness scheme, because we recognise the hardship that would otherwise be caused. I think there has been a general acceptance that even in the very constrained budgetary circumstances of today the Government have given evidence of their commitment to the welfare of the least well off in our society.</P>
    <P>I have often expressed, both in public and in private, my admiration for the quality of our Irish public service.  I am very conscious of the debt we ove them for their competence, loyalty and integrity. I understand and appreciate the depth of disappointment among many of those in the higher echelons when it was decided that the special pay award based on sound and objective criteria should once again be deferred.  It is important that public administration should be able to attract and retain its share of the best talents that are available by rates of remuneration and conditions that are reasonably competitive having regard to the differences between the public and private sectors.  The difficult situation, the need for public acceptance of severe reductions in Government expenditure that have been necessary this year but <Col N="1563" /> which inevitably impose hardship have meant that we have had to postpone a little longer the restoration of a reasonable level of reward for the splendid and dedicated service given in these areas of responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is an essential part of our economic and fiscal policy that corrective action on the public finances must be parallelled by sectoral development policies.  This basic principle has been implemented actively and comprehensively since we came into office.  In every sector the Government have been vigorously promoting, stimulating and co-ordinating development. The whole structure of the administration has been reorganised in order to enable development policies to be more effectively implemented.  New policies with new mechanisms to implement them are in place over a wide area of the economy.  Opportunities for investment and employment are being pursued actively.</P>
    <P>The promotion of an international financial services centre at the Custom House Quay is an example of our approach.  Progress with this important major project has been swift and satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The contract for the development of the Customer House Docks site was formally signed on 25 January 1988, with work commencing immediately.  The first offices in the financial centre are expected to be available for occupation by mid-1989. Interest in the centre has been remarkable.  Already, 11 companies have received approval in principle from the Minister for Finance for proposals for financial services activities in the centre. The proposals already approved carry an employment content of some 500 jobs. In addition, there are some 50 more companies in serious discussion with the marketing team on potential projects.  It is expected that when the development is complete there will be about 7,500 jobs in the centre.</P>
    <P>The interest has come from local Irish companies, including our two major <Col N="1564" /> banking groups and from leading international companies and financial institutions in the UK, continental Europe, the Far East and the United States.  Foreign enterprises with already established links with Ireland are also showing keen interest in the centre.</P>
    <P>Approximately 400,000 square feet of office space has already been provisionally booked by companies intending to set up operations in the centre. This accounts for the whole of the first phase of the financial services centre and amounts to approximately half the total office space being provided on the site.</P>
    <P>The recent weakness in the stock markets has not had any noticeable effect on the level of interest being expressed by financial institutions in the centre.  In fact, this development could well help the centre in that many firms are increasingly conscious of the need for economies in their operations and will look at the economic advantages and low costs that Dublin can now offer, as well as our favourable time zone position; the high quality of the communications services and the skilled highly trained personnel which will be available at the centre.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and eighty seven was an important year for Irish industry. It saw a return of business confidence and significant increases in industrial growth, output and exports, Industrial policy has been reorientated to achieve a more targeted and cost effective approach to industrial development.  Significant new measures were introduced to improve the cost environment for industry.</P>
    <P>Real economic growth depends on confidence, a competitive environment and a willingness to invest and undertake new ventures.  From this point of view, 1987 was in many respects a year of departure for Irish industry, a year when industry saw clearly that there was a Government willing and able to tackle our economic problems.  Lower interest rates, low inflation, wage moderation and satisfactory growth were all benefits to industry from the new approach.</P>
    <P>Despite a very slow start to the year, the number of new projects negotiated by the industrial development agencies <Col N="1565" /> improved significantly during the course of the year: 11,000 new jobs on the ground were created in 1987 with assistance from the IDA.  In addition, 180 overseas investment projects with a job potential of 12,500 were negotiated by the IDA, while Shannon Development approved 20 projects for the Shannon free zone with a job potential of over 800.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that the IDA have started 1988 with a very strong project pipeline and I am confident that the manufacturing job targets set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be achieved.  A number of large projects are once again being secured for Ireland. Last year we had the Goodman Group investment of £260 million creating 660 permanent jobs in the food processing sector, and this year the approval of the Saehan investment in Sligo, a first from South Korea, which involves 800 jobs at full production, is another milestone. Last Friday in Cork I was in a position to announce the establishment of a major new pharmaceutical facility by Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.</P>
    <P>The Estimates decisions for 1988 already taken encompass a shift in State support from fixed assets to R&amp;D, management development and marketing support.  This is in line with the policy direction set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>Some elements of the re-orientation of industrial policy designed to achieve the increased job targets at a lesser cost to the Exchequer are a greater degree of selectivity in the type of projects assisted and the grant package on offer; the strict implementation of performance conditions relating to grant assistance to jobs actually created; increased emphasis on jobs created rather than jobs approved and greater use of repayment forms of assistance.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis in the strategy for generating new industrial projects from overseas will be to exploit Ireland's competitive advantages so as to maximise investment and job creation opportunities from new clients in sectors of <Col N="1566" /> increasing opportunity, e.g. financial services, and in markets of strategic importance, e.g. the Far East.  A related goal will be the attraction to Ireland of key firms in targeted technology sectors in electronics, pharmaceuticals and engineering, including new areas such as biotechnology and micro-electronics.  At home the development agencies will work closely with the existing base of over 900 overseas companies, encouraging developments which expand operations to include R&amp;D, purchasing and market responsibilites.</P>
    <P>Priority is also being given to the indigenous manufacturing sector which will be actively strengthened through the operation of the company development programme and by ensuring that State support is allocated to meet the specific weaknesses of indigenous industry in areas of management development, marketing and product development.  To offset increasing competition worldwide for new investment, a more selective approach is being taken to promoting overseas investment by concentrating on projects and sectors where we can exploit our particular advantages.</P>
    <P>Sectoral strategies have been prepared on a number of areas to meet the target of 20,000 extra manufacturing jobs to be created over the next ten years.  Fianna Fáil have given greatly increased priority to science and technology, by appointing a Minister with responsibility for science, by creating a new science agency, EOLAS, amalgamating the functions of the NBST and IIRS, and by the establishment of a specific science budget.</P>
    <P>There is a comprehensive re-equipment programme under way in EOLAS test laboratories.  A biotechnology programme has been established; an advanced manufacturing programme to help industry adapt to the rapid advances in manufacturing technology has been set up and already 21 graduates are being employed in industry funded projects. There is also a teaching companies programme designed to overcome the severe shortage of technically qualified personnel in indigenous industry.  The 1987 <Col N="1567" /> programme has helped to place 30 high calibre science and engineering graduates in Irish companies, so that they can implement and profit from technologies which would otherwise be beyond their reach.  The Government are actively considering how R&amp;D assistance to industry should be allocated so that national priorities in the field of science and technology are fully reflected in State support for industry.</P>
    <P>The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> places considerable emphasis on the key importance of Ireland's export performance as a means of generating economic growth and job creation.  The appointment of a Minister with specific responsibility for Trade and Marketing is clear evidence of the high priority that the Government accords to this important area.</P>
    <P>A central feature of any export drive must be the adoption of a market led approach by our firms.  In the past we have tended to concentrate on developing our productive capacity without always having due regard to changes in demand in the market place.  This lack of a full marketing awareness has been a particular handicap to our native Irish firms which have the potential for substantial development if they are willing to address their marketing deficiencies.</P>
    <P>When we look more closely at our achievements on the export front we cannot but be concerned at the fact that only 20 per cent of our exports are produced by indigenous manufacturing firms.  The remainder is due in large measure to the performance of multi-national companies based here.  It is also of concern to note that 60 per cent of Irish firms do not engage in any export activity at all.</P>
    <P>Our performance on the home market also leaves a lot to be desired when one considers that in 1986 the value of our total imports of goods and services was equivalent to 53 per cent of our GNP compared with an EC average figure of 29 per cent.  We must turn this situation around and I am convinced that Irish companies have the capacity to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> A National Marketing Group to provide the best practical advice to the Government has recently been put to work.  We have now received EC approval for the Export Trading Houses announced in last year's budget, and we have been developing Irish centres in major cities abroad, which are intended to concentrate in one place all the services of State agencies and promotional bodies.</P>
    <P>Legislation has been brought forward to enable semi-State bodies to develop and diversify.  A Bill is before the House to provide for a limited extension of the ACC's lending power to the non-agricultural sector.  Also before the House is the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1987, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, enable the ESB to form subsidiary companies, thereby allowing that company to exploit to the full its potential to develop overseas services, to diversify at home and to make full use of the Moneypoint terminal for wholesale coal imports.  Other State agencies with the potential to develop overseas services and to diversify their activities are at present exploring how best to achieve this either individually or collectively.  For example, the IDA, SFADCo, CTT and ICC are in the process of developing a subsidiary company through which they will undertake joint consultancies overseas.  An Overseas Services Committee has been established under the chairmanship of the Minister of State for Trade and Marketing with a view to identifying the scope for the development of consultancy services overseas.  Aer Rianta has recently been successful in its bid to provide the Soviet airport authorities with management consultancy services for duty-free facilities at Moscow airport.</P>
    <P>Since 1981 the construction industry has been going through a protracted period of great difficulty.  It has proved impossible to sustain the industry over recent years by major public spending programmes.  With the exception of the road network the heavy infrastructural demands of the seventies have been satisfied to a considerable extent.  A pick-up in the construction industry will depend <Col N="1569" /> on a pick-up in the economy as a whole and a growth in private sector demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fundamental change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised in the industry that the success of current macroeconomic policies particularly in the fall they have brought about in interest and mortgage rates will have a favourable impact on construction activity in due course.</P>
      <P>The two phases of the Civil Service decentralisation programme, the Financial Services Centre, the extensions to the urban renewal incentives, the extension of the natural gas pipeline to Dundalk, and the undertaking of the Western Ring Road by the private sector are examples of decisions taken last year, which should have a beneficial impact. Many of these types of initiatives can be carried a stage further within the consultative framework of the Construction Industry Board.  In the context of the budget we have restored one of the most successful incentives of modern times, the section 23-type incentive originally included in the 1981 Finance Act.  This should give some stimulus to the construction industry, as will the reduction in stamp duty from 4 per cent to 3 per cent on houses in the £50,000-£60,000 price range.  The lower rate of corporation tax will also be of special benefit to construction companies.</P>
      <P>A key priority included in the programme is the maximum development of our natural resources based on a sound approach which will concentrate on an efficient, economic supply of raw material and securing the maximum return through added value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished to hear a suggestion from the Opposition benches that there was no progress in the food industry sector.  The exact opposite is the case.  In fact there has been tremendous progress since the strategic importance of the food industry was recognised by the establishment of the new Office for the industry and the adoption of an integrated <Col N="1570" /> approach to the whole agri-food processing sector.</P>
    <P>In 1987 there has been an unprecedented number of substantial investment proposals for the food sector; like the investment by Goodman International of £260 million.  A large scale rationalisation and modernisation programme for the pigmeat sector was announced in July and involves an investment of £140 million over five years and a significant investment in cheese production, sheepmeat and poultry processing and in the potato and vegetable processing sectors.</P>
    <P>A new National Food Centre which will integrate the former R &amp; D food programmes of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and An Foras Talúntais will be fully operational within a few months.</P>
    <P>Under the 1987 Finance Act food processing companies can now avail of capital allowances for machinery and plant without regard to any grants received.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive development plan for the food and drink industry entitled <i>A Future in Food 1988-92</i> was published by the IDA in close consultation with the Office of the Minister for Food, on 7 December last.  The strategy sets out detailed objectives and targets for the food industry to be achieved over a five-year period resulting in an increase in exports by over £350 million and nearly 5,000 new jobs in processing by 1992 in line with the objectives set out by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  Central to the strategy is the need to change the industry's emphasis from a mainly agricultural processing industry supplying commodity products to one which is a modern competitive food industry supplying quality foods for the European market.  The strategy also includes selectivity with future State investment being reserved for specific development strategies by companies which are market led and which have the required management skills and marketing expertise.</P>
    <P>A major reorganisation and expansion of the horticultural industry is under way. A five year development plan for the <Col N="1571" /> industry, on a product by product basis is being prepared by An Bord Glas with the aim of regaining markets from imports and increasing exports and, in the process, laying the basis for the creation of 1,500-2,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>The same approach is being actively pursued in forestry which has been specifically targeted for restructuring and development.  Down in the forest something is definitely stirring.</P>
    <P>The Government, in deciding on a vigorous expansion of the forestry sector, were influenced by the existence of a large land bank of submarginal agricultural land in excess of 1 million hectares eminently suited to forestry; the commitment by the European Economic Community to actively encourage the diversion of land from the production of agricultural goods which are in oversupply; the fact that in Ireland many species of trees can grow up twice as fast as in other EC countries; apart from the domestic construction market, in which Irish timber has over the past decade gained a strong market share, there is an assured export market for processed Irish timber in the United Kingdom and in the EC as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government increased State planting last year by 1,000 hectares to 8,000 hectares which, together with private sector planting of 3,000 hectares gave a record national planting level of 11,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>An even more ambitious programme has been set for 1988 which will increase State planting to 10,000 hectares.  This considerable expansion, which will reverse the declining levels of State planting up to 1987, is being significantly aided by the Government's decision to devote areas of Bord na Móna's cutaway bog to forestry.  Of the 10,000 hectares being planted this year, 1,000 hectares is comprised of cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>While the Government are pressing ahead with the expansion of State forestry, we are also taking positive steps to secure a sizeable expansion of the private forestry sector.  We have increased the domestic grant for conifer planting to <Col N="1572" /> £500 per hectare and that for broadleaves to £800 per hectare.  In addition, proposals which are now with the European Commission are expected to provide greatly increased incentives for private timber growing.</P>
    <P>1987 saw a considerable increase in the volume and value of timber produced from State forests, reflecting the rapid maturing of the State forest estate.  Revenue from timber sales rose by £3 million to almost £20 million last year.  A further increase is being programmed for 1988.</P>
    <P>The process of establishing a semi-State company to manage our State woodlands on a fully commercial basis is well in hand and the preparation of the necessary legislation to give effect to this is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>The achievements of the Forest Service since March last &mdash; record planting levels, increased timber production and market penetration &mdash; show that this service, given a commercial thrust, will readily adapt to the challenges of the future and justify the Government's faith in their ability to further develop this great national resource.</P>
    <P>Over recent years Ireland's oil and gas licensing terms had become less and less competitive.  In response to the cutbacks in oil exploration budgets resulting from the dramatic and sustained fall in the price of oil in 1986 and 1987 the Government announced new oil and gas licensing terms in September 1987 with the objective of maintaining and expanding exploration in the Irish offshore by making the Irish terms once again among the most competitive in Europe.  Already the response of the oil and gas exploration industry has been very positive and a number of new drilling commitments have been entered into for 1988 as a direct result of the new terms.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in hard minerals exploration activity.  It is expected that there could be a threefold increase in the number of new licences issued this year as compared to each of 1986 and 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> As part of the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, the natural gas grid is being extended northwards from Dublin taking in the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk.  Spurlines are planned to population centres and the horticultural industry of north County Dublin.  EC Regional Fund assistance of £12 million has been sanctioned towards the estimated £30 million cost of the project. Work on the project will go ahead this year and during the construction phase some 200 jobs will be created.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy and Communications is actively seeking to reestablish operations at the Whiddy Oil Terminal at Bantry, County Cork.  Currently, a number of inquiries embracing both Whitegate and Whiddy have been received.  One of these involving the Nigerian authorities is currently the subject of intensive negotiations.</P>
    <P>We are seeking 5,500 new jobs in the marine sector through the development of sea and inland fisheries and aquaculture. Bord Iascaigh Mhara has prepared a Five Year Plan designed to meet the targets set out in our programme. The Marine Research Institute will be established in 1988.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, the Government have identified tourism as an industry capable of making a major contribution to economic growth.  It is also an industry that can be a major earner of foreign revenue and a source of new jobs. Because tourism is basically a transport industry and the key to its success is good cheap access transport, I brought tourism and transport together under one Department when setting up this Government. This has given an entirely new thrust to the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>An emergency package of measures in 1987 which included a range of cheaper air and sea fares, new services, the introduction of a petrol voucher scheme for UK motoring tourists and increased marketing resources brought dramatic results.  1987 turned out to be a record year with overseas visitor numbers exceeding two million and foreign tourism earnings topping £500 million for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> We are now concentrating on 1988. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> calls for an additional £500 million annually in foreign tourist revenue, through a doubling of visitor numbers, and the creation of 25,000 new jobs in tourism over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Already a number of initiatives have been taken; a relaxation of charter rules, a special fares initiative whereby Australian visitors to the UK can travel on to Dublin at no extra cost; aggressive marketing and promoting by Bord Fáilte of special interest package holidays; more reduced access fares and the extension of the business expansion scheme to tourism activities, all these will enhance our 1988 tourist prospects.  A tourism forum was held recently at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, in which a wide representation from the tourism industry participated. Recently a small specialised task force has been established of top people in the industry to assess the various proposals that were put forward at the forum and to suggest to Government how the extra funds provided in the budget can be used to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>I think I have, in this outline of economic policy and follow-up action, given clear evidence that the developmental side is being pursued positively and comprehensively.</P>
    <P>This budget is an important part of the implementation of our <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  It contains four principal features: first, it is another major step towards stability in the national finances; second, it provides both tax relief and major tax reforms, with no real increase in the tax burden; third, it demonstrates real commitment to improving the position of the least well-off in our society, particularly the long term unemployed and the homeless; and fourth, it underpins the development and employment strategy of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> agreed between the Government, employers, trade unions and farmers.</P>
    <P>The budget has received a wide level of acceptance among the public.  I believe the people have a good perception of <Col N="1575" /> what must be done and what the Government are doing to meet the critical situation in which we find ourselves.  A large majority of our people understand what is needed to be done so that the present difficult period can be put behind us. They will support us in our efforts, whatever the difficulties may be, as long as they are satisfied that the Government have a clear view of what they are about and will not be deflected from their course by pressure from any quarter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been nearly 15 years in this House and during budget debates, debates on White Papers and debates on economic strategies and philosophies which fly through the air in graphically designed covers every few months I have often found myself speaking after Deputy Haughey.  This is the first time I find myself not having the heart to dine out on what he has said and that is for two reasons.  First, if I were to descend from another planet with only paper information about the state of the economy and suffering from total amnesia of the half generation which had led up to that condition I could not fault anything which I have heard in the speech delivered over the last hour and a bit.  The same goes for the Budget Statement delivered ten days ago by the Minister for Finance.  I would not wish the Government party to be under the impression that it is from the lack of any material ammunition that anyone on this side forebears from dining out and dining out richly on the sight of a party which now preaches discipline with which I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot disagree with a single word the Taoiseach has said on this issue.  They now preach discipline having not only preached but insinuated, whispered, whinged and whined indiscipline over the last 15 years, since they left office in 1973. Indiscipline was their message.  &ldquo;Cause trouble for the Government and you will get your way&rdquo; is the message to some extent they are now having to pay the price of themselves because &mdash; and I do not take any joy in this &mdash; I observed them running for their lives pursued by <Col N="1576" /> pressure groups and doing U-turns.  They have taught the people to behave like that.  I do not recall Mr. de Valera being downfaced by deputations or by parades out in Kildare Street.  I do not remember Sean Lemass being downfaced by them. I need not tell the House that Willie Cosgrave was never downfaced and I do not remember John Costello being down faced.</P>
    <P>That is the harvest which the party opposite sowed relentlessly and diligently for 15 years and which they are now reaping themselves.  It is because they have come to a recognition of what the State is up against, because they are trying to clean themselves off, that I am willing to make the act of faith that it is so with sincerity.  I am not going to try to make things difficult for them and I have not got it in my heart to remind the Taoiseach, and his party, that it was the same Deputy, and his friends, who shouted Thatcherism, monetarism and bookkeeping at Garret FitzGerald's Government when they sat over there. They went around the country telling people that there had to be a better way knowing that every hobbledehoy in the country would understand that as meaning that there has to be an easier way, there has to be a way that I can push my daily responsibilities off on to my neighbour, or if my neighbour will not carry them, on to my children and their children.  The insinuation behind the expression, there is a better way, is that there has to be an easier way.</P>
    <P>It is not from me that that message was ever preached in the country and it was not from most of the people in this party but from the other side of the House.  I could spend the entire of my speech, and several other speeches, reading from the record of how the people were persuaded that it was nothing except the university remoteness of Dr. FitzGerald.  It was because of the economists, backed up by the malice of the business class who were supposed to be so solidly behind us although to a man they voted against us in 1977 because of the poor little wealth tax, that a mood built up which became almost ungovernable and, perhaps, is <Col N="1577" /> ungovernable.  Perhaps the proof of that pudding has yet to be seen.  I take no pleasure in the fact that when it is I will not be sitting on a Government bench but I will get the results of it just the same, and my family will, like the families throughout the country.  Although I may keep a quiet tone in the rest of what I have to say I do not want the party opposite to run away with the idea that anybody here is under any illusion about what brought us to where we are.  I have no illusions; I have explained in the last few minutes that the diligent corruption, the diligent day in and day out corruption of the public sense of responsibility indulged in by the party opposite was a major factor in it.</P>
    <P>Another factor in it &mdash; I cannot contradict what Deputy Haughey said in this regard &mdash; was the shackling of this party to the Labour Party in the crucial years 1982 to 1987.  It galls me not to be able to contradict what the Leader of Fianna Fáil has said since I have spent 20 years in politics trying to do them down but I have to agree with the Leader of that party that what he has said is correct. Once 1983 came and went we were goosed as a Government which could hope to revive the economy and to inject some sense into the public finances.  I have to bear the chagrin of that personally, and I mean personally, because I pay a certain price for sitting on the back benches.  I went to the back benches because I could see that coming.  I have to bear the chagrin of that and had to wait to see in power a Government who did their best to destroy the economy of the country with the mood they built up among the people.  I had to wait to see them take the first apparently solid step towards regaining the position which they for reasons of political partisanship and greed threw away.</P>
    <P>It may be said that they are penitents, they are political Magdalens.  A Renaissance painter would depict them with their long hair down over a bare shoulder, politically speaking.  I am willing to accept that their penitence is genuine and I am going to take it at its face value but I have not forgotten the old days.  I have <Col N="1578" /> not forgotten the rhetoric which was launched at the unfortunate Dr. FitzGerald shackled to a party he never ought to have touched with a barge pole politically, nice though they are as individuals. It is easy to have a pint with them but politically they are poison in the eighties.  It was pathetic to see him having to deal with colleagues like that and being confronted on the far side of the House not by sympathy, not by solidarity, not by support and not by a party that might have had the generosity to say, &ldquo;let us close down the Civil War; come over here and work with us or let us cross the floor and work with you and not mind those fellows whole ideology comes from 2,000 miles to the East&rdquo;.  I do mean the Parliamentary Labour Party when I say that.</P>
    <P>Instead of the solidarity that we might have expected from one section of the old national movement, what we got was rhetoric about bookkeeping.  We were told that we were only a crowd of bookkeepers, that there was a better way, an easier way.  We were told that we could feed the debt, hang it around somebody else's shoulders and leave it for our children and grandchildren.  That continued until 1986, and beyond, when Fianna Fáil industriously supported the teachers' claim for pay retrospection.  The Government I supported then said that they could not afford that claim and that they stood on an arbitration agreement which allowed the other party not to pay an increase it could not afford.  Nobody wanted to know about that clause.  The teachers did not want to know about it. If their leaders had not intended that clause to be taken seriously they should not have signed that agreement and they should have been told that by an Opposition which should have had too much pride to get behind them merely because they are a powerful political voice.  No, they were not told that; they were flattered and supported in their claim.  That unfortunate wretched, shackled, hamstrung and faltering Government had to give in to them.  Now we are discovering what it is like when a Government are not able to afford something.  Nobody is going to begrudge the crowds on the <Col N="1579" /> doorsteps of the Fianna Fáil Deputies, deplorable though I think it is that a Government should be run by pressure groups and parades.  Certainly, I do not feel sorry for them because they made that trouble for themselves.</P>
    <P>There are a few dangerous ideas which have to be resisted although, in a general sense, I do not fault the Taoiseach's speech this evening.  I have declared a sort of amnesia in regard to the years and years of destructive energy which the Taoiseach, and his friends, put into trying their damndest to keep this economy down as long as they could be in the job themselves.  There scarcely is a word in the Taoiseach's speech that I could quarrel with or would wish to.  Some of that speech I would applaud, such as his reference to the Government's attempts to fight off the European Commission's attack on the 48-hour limitation on the duty-free expeditions.  The same applies to the budget.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to emphasise that if the Government mean discipline they have got to mean it and enforce it in a way that will stick.  They must enforce, in particular, intellectual discipline among their own supporters, among Cairde Fáil, Taca, or whatever other organisations they may have in the background whose names everybody is afraid to utter.  I am not insinuating that there are such organisations, there may be for all I know but I am not aware of them. All I am saying is that wherever the Fianna Fáil Party have any kind of intellectual influence it should be deployed, now that they have apparently converted, in support of the discipline they have proclaimed in the budget.  We are willing to give them a kind of amnesia and an amnesty in the general political/legal sense.  They appear to be reformed desperadoes, or partially reformed, but I do not want them to forget that the amnesty which the Irish people have granted them &mdash; I hope that is so and I do not regret the fact that there is a consensus of a kind behind the Government but it is a provisional one &mdash; means that they have lifted the conviction of political sabotage <Col N="1580" /> from them.  They have only suspended it; they are a Government of ticket-of-leave men and that ticket-of-leave Government will have to show and prove themselves day in and day out.  If they stumble they will not get cheap jeering from this side of the kind that we had to endure; not from me certainly.  They will have to prove that the message of discipline is one which they genuinely believe and they will have to keep teaching the people and telling them that there is no easy way out, that there may be a better way but it is not an easier way.</P>
    <P>The first illusion that a Government is under an obligation to repress intellectually &mdash; there will be people, of whom Deputy Higgins is a mild and gentle enough representative, who might be anxious to see a sign of the jackboot in the use of the word &ldquo;repress&rdquo;&mdash; is the idea that we can take a shortcut out of our difficulties by what is called rescheduling our debts, by doing what I believe I heard a junior Fianna Fáil Minister recommend not long before Christmas, that is telling the international bankers to go and take a running jump at themselves.  That kind of talk is baby talk.  If this country enjoys the topmost grade of international credit rating, it is precisely because no Government here of any colour has ever done that.  If a Government here were to say that we are terribly sorry, that we cannot afford the instalment due on 10 March nor the one due on 1 June and that we are unilaterally demanding a rescheduling of our debt portfolio, under threat of non payment, this country would be dragged overnight from its topmost position in the credit rating down near the bottom.</P>
    <P>I seem to remember some junior Minister saying that some countries are supposed to have tried that and got away with it, but their experience shows no such thing.  I will read from a recent bulletin, issued from a temple of capitalism, which Deputy Higgins would not touch with a tongs.  It is the bulletin of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York and deals with the subject of world financial markets.</P>

      <P>The issue of July 1987, dealing with Peru, states as follows:</P>
      <P>One approach to limiting financial transfers is seen in Peru's unilaterally decreed limit on debt-service payments, in effect since 1985.  Emphatically, this is not the right approach. Peru's debt-service limit has ensured practically no new money inflows from banks.  It is virtually cut off from credit.</P>
      <P>I do not know why anyone imagines this country's fate would be any different if we were suddenly to say we could not pay the interest or were unwilling to do so and that if our creditors wished to get any money at all they would have to accept lesser instalments and take them later.  It passes my comprehension that anyone could imagine that an international bank would be any more understanding about that position than a private bank manager.  Let us suppose that any of us carrying a loan or mortgage were to go and say, &ldquo;Look here, I have decided I am not going to pay the March instalment of your interest and you need not bother putting it on my bank statement because I will not pay it.  I cannot afford to pay it and I consider that you are making a lot of money for your shareholders. I do not see why I should make them rich and you will have to wait a great deal longer for your money&rdquo;.  What would be the reception any of us would get in our local banks if we were to display that kind of lunacy to the man whom we had politely asked for a loan some time previously?  What would his reaction be if we came in again to ask for an extension of credit or a new loan to underwrite a new enterprise?  As they used to do in the 19th century, I should apologise to the House for arguing a point so absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope nobody on the other side of the House will allow any of his branches, cumainn or comhairlí ceanntair or anywhere within the large organisation which Fianna Fáil control, that kind of talk to be heard without contradiction.  It is true that nothing which the Government, through the Minister for Finance, have said tends in any way in that direction <Col N="1582" /> and I do not want to be taken as implying otherwise.  However, I have heard that kind of talk from the Fianna Fáil benches and outside the House.  It is important that it is not left to the Opposition to do the dirty work of rebutting the childlish delusions which underlie it.</P>
    <P>One of my own children, when very small, used to say when I said I could not afford something, &ldquo;but, Daddy, you could write a cheque&rdquo;.  He saw me writing cheques and assumed that was the perfectly acceptable substitute for banknotes, that one had no relationship with the other and that it was as easy to pay for something by writing on a scrap of paper as by producing bank notes from one's pocket.  When he became a very little older, still very far from the use of what we would call reason, he saw the point.  That point still seems to be far too adult for a lot of the people I hear, many of them senile babies over there on the left who think we can take ourselves out of our swamp of debt by telling the international bankers to get lost.  The Government have not been guilty of that and I must make it perfectly clear that I am not imputing any such thought to the wiser heads among them.</P>
    <P>I want to say, however, that anything in the nature of short-term improvements in the revenue or fiscal situation are almost equally suspect.  I am not saying I disapprove of them but I certainly disapprove of a budget or financial strategy being built around them.  I mean by that things like the short-term and necessarily once-off pre-emption of future revenue. I understand that the redundancies in the public service, of which the Minister for Finance is trying to get a large number, not a moment too soon, are to be financed by taking in now the supposed future profits of the Central Bank.  That is a misconceived policy.  If we were to have a totally unprecendented natural or economic disaster which no one could possibly have foreseen and which in the nature of things could not possibly occur again, there might be a reason for a step like that.  I do not think that merely because the Government have decided to cut down the numbers in the public service <Col N="1583" /> there is justification for a step of this kind.  If that is sound financial strategy, how is it that Seán McEntee, Seán Lemas, Paddy McGilligan, Gerard Sweetman, George Colley, Jack Lynch or even Deputy Haughey as Minister for Finance did not go for this option?  If it is so easy to lay one's hands on a stray £18 million or £25 million by calling in future profits of one of the State's creatures or organs, how is it that none of these people thought it could be done?</P>
    <P>The same goes for writing into the budget the anticipated yield of an accelerated collection of outstanding income tax.  Every pound collected by means of crash income tax collection this year will mean a pound less next year.  I must not be understood as being against the idea of the prompt and punctual collection of income tax or against the idea of trying to get down the arrears, but that a quick raid on the arrears in order to get over a problem of this year's budget is financially sound or a good move in budgetary terms I do not believe.</P>
    <P>The worst financial device of the whole lot, something which my own party introduced, is the national lottery.  Deputy Haughey, who likes to be associated with success or what he perceives as success, is up front, not quite on the Champs Elysées but at some more humble address in order to announce the first annual results of the national lottery.  The national lottery had exceeded expectations. That is the Government's position on it.  I have to say in justice to Deputy Haughey that had there been a Fine Gael Minister there I do not expect he would have acted any differently.  I consider it a gross shame that a national lottery exceeds expectations.  While I did not care for the way he used to hold the pistol to the heads of the last Government and would say that he would not vote for them any longer unless he got a scheme costing God knows how many millions which would have torn the heart out of the city of Dublin, I have to agree fully with what the former Deputy Liam Skelly said about the national lottery.  I must not be taken as adopting this insulting phrase, <Col N="1584" /> nor can I even vouch for its authenticity. He quoted the great President of France, Georges Clemenceau, as saying that a lottery was a tax on imbeciles.  I do not know whether Clemenceau said that and I would not wish to use language like that in any case about people who play a lottery.  I think that language is far too insulting and gross to use about what may be only a small flutter.  Nevertheless, I think for a Republic to stoop to a method like this for raising revenue is contemptible and shameful.  I am glad to see Deputy Higgins nodding his head.  I am amazed.  I am beginning to wonder whether I should have studied my brief a bit better before leaving myself open to the charge that he has agreed totally with me about something.  I do regard it as shameful if only because it psychologically perpetuates among ordinary people the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow mentality.</P>
    <P>Even though Deputy Higgins is looking at what he may think is a smooth rock face of unchallengable material with which he completely agrees in hearing me say these words, I hope he will not find that I am giving him a toe hold when I admit, to what may be a middle class admission that is, that with one exception, I personally have not bought a lottery ticket.  I did once buy one in Italy because the old man selling them appeared to be so miserable and it seemed to cheer him up so much when I bought a couple of tickets from him.  I have never bought a lottery ticket with the intention or hope or prospect of winning something.  I know no one in my family has and I know, but I had better not be too positive, that none of my friends or relations have bought tickets.  Going into the post offices in the city, as I have to to buy stamps and so forth, I do notice people buying lottery tickets and while they span a fair spectrum of the population and they are not all the same type of people.  My impression, and I hope I am not offending anybody in saying so, I would not be doing my job here if I did not give my impressions whether they were right or wrong, is that the lottery tends to be patronised by people who <Col N="1585" /> have the least to spare.  I have not checked this and perhaps I should have done so before coming in here to speak about it but I suspect that the big end of the lottery business is done on the days when social welfare payments are made. I think it is a scandal that this State should think of financing necessary services, because that is what it is doing, through this source.  By the end of 1988 the State will have paid out £44 million in lottery prize money, but it will have taken in almost £72 million in profits, that is the estimate.  This consists of £35 million last year and a projected figure of £36 million for this year.  To remove money like that from the pockets largely of the less provident section of the community is a scandal. It is degrading and I do not care and I do not give a damn what other civilised republics may do it.  There may be historical local reasons for it.  I think lotteries have a very ancient history and publicly organised lotteries go back certainly to the 17th century and perhaps beyond that.  It may be that there are historical reasons for it but I think it is a scandal that in the late 20th century we in this Irish Republic should choose to pick this means of raising revenue from the poorest, not only from them but certainly preponderantly from the less provident sections of the community in order to provide services which we should have been providing out of ordinary revenue.</P>
    <P>I have here a statement which I think came from the Minister for Finance, in which he gave out the figure I have mentioned of almost £72 million.  The statement carries no date but it is from earlier this year, certainly before the Budget Statement.  It tells us that the money will be allocated as follows: £26.3 million on sport, youth and recreation; £8 million on arts and culture; £4 million on the Irish language and £6 million on health. Health is going to fall on the lottery, not entirely of course but £6 million worth of health will be financed from the lottery and £700,000 will be used to finance &mdash; guess what &mdash; The Dublin Millennium.</P>

      <P>I do not really trust myself to speak on the Dublin Millennium, so I will pass it over.  I made a promise to the Lord Mayor that I would lay off that subject until 1989 had arrived and I will keep that promise.  I have enough material without mentioning that.  If it is necessary for the State to support sport, youth and recreation, and I recognise the value of these and I certainly recognise the value of youth now that it has departed from me, it should not be done in this way.  I recognise the value of sport and recreation even though there was a time when the State did not feel that it was among the items on which public revenue had to be spent.  Arts and culture, the Irish language and health are matters on which this State since its foundation has spent some money in one shape or form.  Myles na gCopaleen, during the war years, when he heard people complaining about the fact that the State was spending £.5 million a year on the Irish language said that at a time when the major civilised powers of the world were spending tens of millions every day on trying to destroy one another, surely it was one of the few humble little boasts this modest little State could make that we spent £.5 million on a relatively urbane object like trying to revive an ancient language.  How the money is spent, we need not discuss now.  This is not an appropriate debate for discussion of the work of Board na Gaeilge but certainly it has always been something that the State spent money on, right back to the days of the first Government.  That expenditure was financed out of ordinary revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put onto a siding objects such as those that are to be financed from the lottery appears to attribute a second class status &mdash; naturally you might not think so if you are getting the money from it &mdash; a conjectural, only provisional, really there by the skin of its teeth status to these objects of expenditure.  However, that is not the worst aspect of it.  The worst aspect is that it is being financed at the expense of people &mdash; I am, not saying they are on the poverty line &mdash; whom <Col N="1587" /> should be trying to train in habits of providence, whom we should be trying to sustain and help to raise to a level relative to the rest of the population, to those who are better placed.  I have said enough about it but it is an easy way to collect money at the expense of those who should be the objects of the State's special protection and should not be the targets of its plundering fiscal paws.</P>
    <P>The Government's image has been one of firmness.  As I have said it is a great chagrin and sorrow to me that I should have had to wait to see showing that firmness a Government who, in my belief, by their operations on the public mentality as much as by their operations when in Government created most of the problems.  The firmness, that image, that reputation which they are beginning to develop has to be heavily qualified in the light of the financial measures I have mentioned &mdash; the easy options and the kind of talk I have mentioned as for one Government office-holder about the rescheduling of debt.</P>
    <P>It appears even more dubious when you look at it in the light of actual or prospective Government retreats.  I may not have a complete list in my mind but the Government backed down over the school entry age which they wished to raise to a level which would still have been lower than the European average by quite a bit.  They backed down over the abolition of the National Social Service Board.  They have backed down over hospital closures and very probably they will be seen to have backed down over the enlargement of class sizes in the schools. None of these, I want to emphasise, are measures that I specially welcome or would necessarily support.  However, they are instances in which a Government had decided one day were necessary and decided the next were not.</P>
    <P>All I am saying is that they are instances in which a Government decided one day that something was necessary and decided the next day that it was not, not because they genuinely had changed their minds but because they were forced <Col N="1588" /> to change their minds by political pressure. What must qualify this image of fairness?</P>
    <P>I have had people on to me from the teachers organisations, I have had deputations, letters and telephone calls by the bagful and I can tell the Deputies opposite and the House that not by one word have I given them any encouragement in the idea that the Government were in a general sense wrong in trying to economise.  I have not with one word encouraged them in trying to heat up their campaign against the Government. I have, as I believe many Deputies on this side of the House have, taken on to my own shoulders part of the burden which the Government have to carry.  I am willing to do that.  Naturally I would like to have a say in the formulation of the policies which turn out so unpopular, perhaps in being able to deflect them, to recast them or shape them in some different way.  But I am perfectly prepared to do it in a way in which Deputy Lyons's colleagues were not two years ago so that this State should not founder in bankruptcy.  If you require that kind of solidarity from this side of the House then you should stand solid yourselves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do recognise, in spite of perhaps all the disagreeable things I started with, that there is over there somewhere among that ticket-of-leave Government, a will, an embryonic or inchoate will, to try rectitude for a <Col N="1589" /> change.  It is a nice change but it may be too bracing a change for some of the Fianna Fáil constitutions that have been weakened by a lifetime of political debauchery.  Possibly that bracing air of financial rectitude is too much for people who have been sunk in tropical stew of jobbery and of cheap shots &mdash; I do not want to be personal about it so I will not say what came into my mind.  That change may be too much for some of them but I believe there are enough of them there to try to make that change stick.  I urge them not to return to their old triumphalism and not to speak as, for example, Deputy Flynn did last week.  I had it in mind to dine out a bit on what Deputy Flynn said here, and not only did he say it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to get back into this slagging.  I am just as good at it as Deputy Flynn is and I will give as good as I get.  I do not want to be forced into it because I do not have the heart for it.  The conditions in this country are far too serious for it and I urge and beg the party opposite not to drop back into that kind of tone.  If they can maintain the tone which on the whole they have maintained here since they came into office I believe they will get a generous and constructive response from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Before I sit down there is one financial measure I would like to propose &mdash; and I am departing from the earlier rhetoric &mdash; to the Minister for Finance and it relates to the collection of tax.  There has been for many years in the State a system which has been operated by the Central Bank for the issue of tax reserve certificates which is really intended as in aid of the self-employed or people who do not pay tax by PAYE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 20 years ago when I had a bit of money &mdash; and it was a long time ago because I am never out of the red now &mdash; I knew I would be getting a tax bill and because I had heard of this system I thought I might as well give the money to the State and let it be in the pocket and earning interest.  The system of these tax reserve certificates is that if you pay your money to the State in advance of a demand it credits you, tax free, a certain percentage which can then be set off against your liability when it materialises. I remember that I was told that I had to buy these at the Central Bank.  Back in <Col N="1591" /> the middle sixties I had to tromp down to the Central Bank in Dame Street, stand at a counter and explain to an official behind the counter what I wanted. The official had never heard of these certificates. Finally, after much kerfuffling an ancient dog-eared application form for a tax reserve certificate was produced from somewhere.  I filled it in and the official, looking at me as though I had two heads, took it in over the counter with the couple of hundred pounds I had to spare and in due course it was credited to me when finally I had my tax liability established.</P>
    <P>I must say &mdash; and I mean it without sarcasm &mdash; that the Minister's idea of amnesty in order to allow people to make a short end of their conflict with the Revenue Commissioners in regard to personal income tax &mdash; an amnesty that will not be insisted on &mdash; is a good idea.  I do not like a budgetary strategy being built around it or a sudden assault on tax arrears.  That measure is a good idea but an even better idea would be to extend the tax reserve.  It is many years since I had any loose money that I might have put into such a system in order to secure myself against a big tax bill and so I have been out of touch with the tax reserve certificate system.  However, I inquired about the system the other day and the Central Bank not only very courteously told me about it but actually sent me a form.  They accompanied it with the information that the interest which a tax reserve certificate carries is 3 per cent.  It has been 3 per cent ever since the scheme started.  Who in his senses is going to put money into a tax reserve certificate at 3 per cent? Why not close the system down rather than do that?</P>
    <P>The amount of money which the State had taken in in tax reserve certificates in the calender years 1986 and 1987 was published in the 5 January edition of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  In 1986 there were sufficient loonies in the country to voluntarily give to the State money on tax reserve certificates, a total sum of £23,880.  In 1987 the amount taken in was £24,090.  There <Col N="1592" /> have been years when I myself have paid almost as much income tax as that.  What is the sense of this system? The idea is an excellent one and it was fine when there was no inflation and low bank interest rates.  I hope the Minister will take a look at that system and advertise it.  Since it began it has never been advertised. Nobody knows about it.  Even the people in the bank did not know about it in 1965 when I went in with my pathetic £200 and offered to give it to them.  If that system carried a reasonable rate of interest and if that interest was tax free it would bring in a shoal of income tax from self-employed people who now put it on the long finger because they do not see any advantage to themselves in making things easy for the State.</P>
    <P>Another fiscal measure about which I would have liked to have heard the Minister talk, even in an unbuttoned mood &mdash; and perhaps he will mention it in some after-dinner speech sometime &mdash; is the question of the relationship of VAT to personal income tax.  I often inquired from the Minister for Finance &mdash; Deputy Bruton, the last time I inquired &mdash; whether he would calculate what amount of revenue a 5 per cent VAT rate on foodstuffs would produce when discounted from it a compensatory increase in allowances for children allowances and in welfare payments, so as to relieve the less affluent section of our community of the burden of the extra 5 per cent in foodstuffs costs, and to calculate how much of a relief could then be given in the standard rate of income tax.  I got very interesting answers from Deputy Bruton and I would urge the present Minister for Finance to look at them.  I do not want to be taken to be advocating the imposition of VAT on food.  I am advocating that since VAT on food is imposed in most European countries, a very low rate of VAT on food, even when compensated for by correspondingly increased welfare payments for the poorer sections of the community, might make it possible to have very substantial reliefs in personal income tax, thus allowing people to decide for themselves what they will do with their money.  That essentially is the <Col N="1593" /> way in which income tax and disposable personal income should be looked at by the State.</P>
    <P>In a general sense I wish the Government well and urge them not to expect more virtue from the Opposition than they themselves are willing to display.</P>

      <P>Less than a year ago my contribution to the 1987 budget was made in my maiden speech.  At that time Deputy Carey noted that my speech was full of optimism and wished that he could share my optimism.  Opposition speakers decried the budgetary strategy of the Fianna Fáil Administration then only a few days old.  They continued a negative approach which had served the country so poorly during their term of office.  The Opposition castigated Deputy Mac-Sharry's forecasts and projections and spoke of a death wish for the Fianna Fáil Administration of Deputy Haughey.  I have no doubt but that these experienced parliamentarians had a secret pity for what they saw as the innocence and inexperience of the new Deputy who dared to endorse with enthusiasm and open confidence the budgetary policies of a fledgling minority Government that they thought had at best a tenuous life of some months.  Today I can point to the fact that budgetary and fiscal measures put in train by the 1987 budget have brought this country out of the trough of despair in which it had wallowed for the Coalition years to a position where once again people dared to hope and where the economic indicators substantiate that hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the economy grew by 3½ per cent.  There is every reason to hope.  The <Col N="1594" /> growth of 3½ per cent is not the only positive indicator.  We should look at our record trade surplus of £1.5 billion.  These two positive indicators of economic performance are of immense significance. There has also been greatly reduced Exchequer borrowing and the outflow of capital has been halted.  The Government have reduced Exchequer borrowing by £300 million.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced by a significant 2.1 per cent of GNP, from 10.3 per cent of GNP last year to 8.2 per cent of GNP this year.  There are other indicators but these alone, taken against a background of doom and gloom and suicidal deathwish forecasts are sufficient reason for me to feel a glow of self-satisfaction for daring to express optimism and for praising the 1987 budget.</P>
    <P>This budget is a good budget.  That is the opinion of the public at large as reported in yesterday's opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  One could examine the comments of the political and economic correspondents in our national papers. Paul Tansey writing in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 31 January said in his &ldquo;Money Matters&rdquo; column:</P>
    <P>Thus the Government has accomplished a major correction of the public finances for the second year running.</P>
    <P>He went on:</P>
    <P>For 1988, the Government have produced a good budget, warts and all.</P>

      <P>Gulliver in <i>The Sunday Press</i> wrote that Ray MacSharry had introduced an unexpectedly positive and progressive budget.  Chris Glennon, the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday, 29 January cited a statement from Young Fine Gael which welcomed the increased tax free allowances. This came from a source never given to generous acclaim for Fianna Fáil measures and it is a most significant pointer to the excellence of this budget and <Col N="1595" /> its strategies.  In the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Friday, 29 January Brendan Keenan's &ldquo;Business Independent&rdquo; page carried a feature on PAYE entitled &ldquo;How Will Your Fare&rdquo;.  The initial sentence in this feature read:</P>
      <P>The Budget gave unexpectedly generous relief to income tax payers.</P>
      <P>One can take that as a valid, independent objective appraisal of the PAYE concessions in this budget.  Bill Murdock's &ldquo;Business Opinion&rdquo; column said that as the budget has created the right conditions to allow a further drop in interest rates business should in general be pleased.</P>
      <P>I, too, am pleased that so many independent observers and commentators from the world of journalism, industry and commerce expressed positive views and general approval for this budget.  The underlying strategy in this budget is to keep the engine of economic advancement motoring along on the progressive course started in last year's budget.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the importance of this major task was the very bedrock of this programme.  We cannot have national recovery if we luxuriate in a false world of economic pipedreams.  At times one must be cruel to be kind, one must be bold to be brave. We have to put the national interest first and foremost irrespective of short-term consequences, however unpalatable these may be.</P>
      <P>This budget is all about national recovery. It is all about national confidence.  It has been said by an eminent Opposition speaker that this budget ignores the problem of unemployment.  In my view, this budget is all about unemployment, it is all about creating a climate of justifiable confidence in the economy, so that the growth of 1987 may be sustained and strengthened into 1988 and beyond.  It is about consolidating the very significant advances made in the last year when the upward trend in unemployment has at last been arrested.  This is the way that leads to new employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone recognises that high interest <Col N="1596" /> rates are a costly burden for those running a business.  Since last March, interest rates have dropped considerably.  Lower interest rates benefit business people and individual taxpayers alike.  Hundreds of thousands of mortgage holders have benefited from the fall in interest rates over the last year and have had many pounds more per week in their pockets because of lower mortgage repayments. However, the climate for investment is of even great significance.  This substantial fall is set to continue as the budget has created the right conditions to allow a further drop in interest rates.  Investment in plant and machinery is rising and, with the impetus afforded by this budget, will continue to rise.</P>
    <P>The reintroduction of section 23 relief is a further example of a measure that has an inherent capacity to re-energise the construction industry, with increased employment very much in prospect.  If I may make a comment on that, it is my belief that three years may not be enough for that relief to be seen at its best.  People who would now be applying for planning permission for any major site would need two years or a little more from the time that they would plan, get finance and get the construction off the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>Why did the Deputy vote against it when I proposed it in an amendment last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that we shall see the Minister having a look at the situation, to give a little more time for it to be given its full benefit.  We must remember that the rate of inflation is at its lowest level for 20 years and the checks and balances so ingeniously built into this budget will ensure that favourable inflation levels will continue to be a feature of this year and the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A prerequisite of the sort of economic growth that leads to increased employment is that we achieve the dual aim of continued improvement in the public finances with a parallel reduction in our dependence on borrowing.  If this budget strategy could be likened to an arrow, this policy of reducing borrowing would <Col N="1597" /> be at its very tip and increased employment would be its flight feathers, the latter to follow the former as night follows day.</P>
    <P>This confidence in our economy, its performance, its potential for growth and its independence of excessive dependence on external borrowings is not just a matter of national concern and interest. If we wish to attract foreign investment we must create a perceivable climate of economic growth and stability.  We are a small nation but the position we occupy on the world stage is prominent, important and noteworthy.  We would not wish to hide our attractiveness from external attention, neither can we hide our warts. Our economy is not just a national economy, it is part of a world economy.  If we are to attract international investment of the kind which can create new employment, such as the increasingly successful Custom House Docks site, we must have an economy as strong and resilient as any other.  We are noted and commented on in foreign journals and if we wish to ensure the sort of comment that will attract investment, we must gain an economic standing free from the anchors and chains of borrowing and fiscal outflows. We need to continue fearlessly on the path set out on by this and by previous Fianna Fáil administrations.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms built into the strategic framework of this budget will ensure that the significant recovery that characterised industry in 1987 will continue.  It was acknowledged by the Confederation of Irish Industry in their last newsletter of 1987 that progress was made in tackling the very high level of Exchequer borrowing and that this was achieved without a significant negative impact on the economy.  After taking into account interest payments on our foreign debts, national output increased.  In fact, it was the best growth rate for years.  This shows clearly that the Government are managing the economy in a way that is very effective, so much so that there was a growth in volume of manufacturing output of some 10 per cent, which represents the best performance since 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> I present my own optimism unashamedly, an optimism underpinned by a firm determination to resolve our economic difficulties.  This determination has been the hallmark of each and every member of the Fianna Fáil benches over the last year, from the Cabinet Ministers who are bringing forward some of the most radical reforms in the history of the State to the lowliest backbencher who will support what is right for this country.  It is heartening to see this optimism spreading, and spreading it is, as is made clear in the survey of chief executives in the post-budget issue of <i>Business and Finance.</i> Not for many years have the captains of industry had such a positive view.  I realise that certain members of the Opposition and, I suppose, my colleagues in the Progressive Democrats Party, must be alarmed at this survey.  It reveals that their bluff has been pierced.  Their early rhetoric about what must be done has not been matched by any consistency.  Their prohibition on any cuts in Deputy O'Malley's backyard is the clearest evidence of this.  But I digress.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Optimism is spreading. The foundation of our optimism is a solid belief in the Irish people, coupled with a determination that what must be done will be done.  Others may talk about it. There is a feeling now that there is a Government who can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1987 was also a year in which the benefits of increased cost competitiveness were felt.  This Government recognise that the key to job creation for the longer term is competitiveness.  This increased competitiveness is well catered for in the budget.  There are some who would cynically say that competitiveness is but a handy cliché.  Let me disabuse such as might be tempted to be so dismissive. Let me give an example of competitiveness in action.  We need look no further than my own constituency, to Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  Aer Lingus have taken an aggressive stance in countering the low cost carriers with whom they must compete.  They have also decided to meet <Col N="1599" /> head on the loosening up of the new European regulating situation.  I understand that they have applied for a whole series of inter-European routes and are confident that they will meet the challenge of any carrier with whom they may have to compete.  The new routes from Sligo and Galway are only a beginning of what seems to be a bright, confident period of expansion for this semi-State body, by all accounts a highly profitable one, as this year's accounts will bear out.</P>
    <P>I have read with interest of the joint approach between management and unions in Aer Lingus to this competitive challenge.  New salary rates, while lower, have enabled the company to take on marginal extra business that otherwise would not be viable.  The result of this joint approach had been an almost unprecedented series of recent advertisements in the national press for pilots, clerks, hostesses and stewards, operatives and trainee programmers.  I understand that Aer Lingus will be taking on literally hundreds of new staff within the next few months.  Indeed, I have observed young men and women converging on my own town of Malahide recently for interviews in response to the various advertisements I have mentioned.  I believe that the people in Aer Lingus have got together and pointed the way forward for us all. They are creating major employment by contributing enormously to our tourism programme.  Here I must commend them on their recent initiatives on new lower fares for European routes next summer. The tremendous response to their cheaper UK fares initiatives helped to create a record tourism year in 1987 and I know that we are in for a better 1988.  Aer Lingus have thrown down the gauntlet in the aviation field.  Perhaps we should look at other sectors of our economy that are wringing their hands in despair.  They should pick up the gauntlet, meet their problems head on to have a bright and confident future.</P>
    <P>So much for Aer Lingus, but let us not forget Ryanair.  Here is an example of recent Irish enterprise.  They are a company in the same business as Aer Lingus, <Col N="1600" /> competing with Aer Lingus and terrierlike, ready to compete with all comers. This is another example of competitiveness at its best.  You can apply the concept of competitiveness with small firms competing locally to the major companies competing worldwide, from the micro-economy to the macro-economy. The Government must provide the conditions at both micro and macro level. This budget has within it the ingredients to accomplish these ends.  Competitiveness grows out of the confidence. Let me say again that the 1988 budget is all about confidence.  The Government in drawing up this budget were acutely conscious of the need to generate confidence. They are aware of a growing confidence in the nation.  It would be worth mentioning, as the Taoiseach did today the success of Aer Rianta in their bid to provide the Soviet Airport authorities with management consultancy services for the duty-free facilities at Moscow Airport.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that Dublin Airport, two years ago catering for 2.5 million people, now caters for 3.5 million passengers, and it is reckoned that 4 million passengers will come through Dublin Airport in 1988.  In a short space of time the airport has gone from being the size of those at Birmingham and Glasgow to being the size of those at Berlin, Hamburg and Geneva.  It is a tribute to the progressive management there that they have adapted to this new business in a most professional way.</P>
    <P>Once again, it is my view that the Government's budget is successful and this is pointed up clearly in the latest Small Firms Association's survey reported in the current CII newsletter. This report states that 41 per cent of the 127 firms sampled in the poll stated that they were more optimistic for the coming year; that this is an increase of 29 per cent on the last survey which was carried out in February 1987.  At that time only 12 per cent of the respondents expressed themselves as more optimistic about prospects for trade.  In the latest survey 46 per cent of respondents indicated that they are planning to invest more over the <Col N="1601" /> next 12 months in contrast with a figure of 10 per cent of respondents who envisaged reduced levels of investment.</P>
    <P>It is important to note and honestly acknowledge that the decision not to increase PRSI for employers is a positive one reflecting the constructive employment-generating ethos of this budget.  It is generally acknowledged that PRSI can act as a disincentive to employment and the value of holding the line here must surely have a very advantageous spin off on the jobs front.  It has been said that there are major reforms of the taxation code which will gradually have a positive, persuasive effect on the economy.  The increased emphasis on our natural resources and the parallel act of pursuit of development opportunities, for example, in food processing, tourism etc. are beginning to show results.  To all who say that this budget does nothing for unemployment, I would put the positive perspective that the Minister, Deputy MacSharry's budget has introduced and say that this budget is about employment.</P>
    <P>Let me turn for a moment from employment to the specific issue of the self-employed.  The decision to extend PRSI to the self-employed is a most progressive measure.  The self-employed, numbering approximately 230,000, represent about one-fifth of the working population.  It is absolutely correct that all citizens should have access to retirement benefits on an equal basis, and I welcome their inclusion.  The greater the inequalities between groups in our society the greater the possibility of antipathy between them.  We see this at times in the farmer/PAYE area.  Indeed, it is not unknown for certain politicians in less broadly based parties to lament such antipathy for their own ends.  The great majority of farmers and the self employed do not live easily with this.  The honest citizen paying his taxes does not deserve the tax dodger lable so liberally dispensed by those serving other ends. The extention of PRSI, in so far as it removes one major distortion between self employed and the PAYE sector, is to be greatly welcomed.  One more area of social division is going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> The non-contributory pensions bill, £320 million in 1987, is a massive Exchequer burden borne by the taxpaying public.  It is only right that the self-employed should make a significant direct contribution to this.  Some Opposition spokesmen have criticised the initial rate of contributions at 3 per cent. Would they so easily call for 6.6 per cent additional contribution from any other sector?  Any group needs time to adapt to a new levy of this order, and the phasing arrangements outlined by the Minister to be included in the Social Welfare Bill are an imaginative solution to a difficult problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Deputy relied on Paul Tansey in relation to his speech perhaps he would still rely on him in relation to this.  He contradicts the Deputy flatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed this reform will eliminate one major paradox from our society.  The self-employed, the most independent among us in terms of earning a livelihood, are the most dependent on the State in old age.  Many decide not to make any personal provision for retirement because to do so might disqualify them from the non-contributory pension.  Now they can provide in advance from their own resources, confident that the State will provide the basic retirement benefits.  No longer must they sacrifice one for the other.  Another poverty trap will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other possible consequence of this change may need attention in due course. The non-contributory pension has in the past stimulated farm succession.  The farmer handed over to his son and qualified for the pension himself.  There is a danger that, now qualifying as of right, some might delay the handover to the younger generation.  That would be disastrous. If this begins to happen it must be tackled.  Indeed it is more worthy of the attention of the farm leaders than their attack on the recommended level of PRSI contribution as determined by an independent body, the National Pensions <Col N="1603" /> Board, a recommendation based on very sound reasoning.</P>
    <P>The contribution from the self-employed this year will be small at £12 million, but it will grow and its introduction is very important.  Is it not extraordinary that other parties talk of breaking moulds and building on reality and when it comes to the crunch Fianna Fáil are in reality the true mould breakers in Irish society?</P>
    <P>The budgetary provisions in relation to the PAYE sector should have brought a cry of &ldquo;well done&rdquo; from the Opposition benches.  But not so.  Promises of relief for the hard-pressed taxpayer are customarily greeted with some cynicism. This stems from the raw experience of having heard successive Ministers for Finance make such promises only to find that the pay packet is further diminished by the tax take.  However, in this budget reliefs have been worth up to £596. Added to the mortgage savings most families have experienced, this makes for a very healthy situation in family finances. In the day following budget day the reaction to the Minister's proposals on taxation received a favourable press and two headlines in the same page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of that day are indicative of the positive response.  One headline read &ldquo;First steps to Major overhaul of Tax System&rdquo; and the other read &ldquo;Promises to taxpayers to be honoured&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The corporate tax system was set on a path of reform through the decision that will lead to the replacement of the present seven rates of corporation tax with a special rate of 10 per cent and a 43 per cent rate.  This long overdue reform is but one of the budget measures which will help to rationalise the public finances.  It is acknowledged that our tax system is too complex.  It has far too much leeway for the clever tax loophole merchants and the less subtle tax avoiders.  The Commission on Taxation has very useful pointers towards rationalisation and we all agree that this is overdue.  So full marks to the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, and the Government for grasping the nettle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> The Minister has kept faith with the PAYE sector by increasing the PAYE and personal allowances and by widening the tax bands.  This has resulted in 93,000 taxpayers moving out of the 48 per cent rate to the 35 per cent rate.  It also takes 55,000 from the top rate of 58 per cent to safer ground at 48 per cent.  And very significantly it takes 16,000 lower paid workers out of the tax net altogether. The PAYE sector should be greatly encouraged by the Government's undertaking to make significant progress towards having two-thirds of tax payers on the standard rate.  They should see in this budget the evidence of the Government's good faith.  In this regard I do not propose to reiterate the actual figures for the increases afforded in this budget.  I do, however, ask the public at large to compare the treatment they have received at the hands of this Government with their sorry experience of recent Coalition budgets when they were progressively bled white in budget after budget.  Yet, Deputy Noonan had the temerity to say that this was a dull and uninspiring affair.  His sterile political analysis of the budget was unworthy of a person who has accused the Government of being bereft of ideas, even in the face of an avalanche of ideas; one can only conclude that Deputy Noonan is bereft of even a minimal shred of constructive thought.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to PRSI in another context.  I would like on behalf of the vast majority of citizens to compliment the Minister for Social Welfare for the steps he is taking to eliminate abuses of the social welfare system.  We are all victims of the dishonest practices in this area.  Some employers encourage dishonest practices by failure to deduct PRSI and thus facilitate those who would work and sign for welfare benefits at the same time.</P>
    <P>Some other unscrupulous employers collect PRSI and fail to remit it.  This conspiracy of fraud by evasion, collusion and co-operative theft from the public purse is a crime against every man, woman and child in this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="1605" /> Deputy Michael Woods, has set up a new Joint Investigation Unit to crack down on these.  The majority of employers and employees operate legitimately and discharge their obligations honourably.  This House should by acclamation endorse the actions of the Minister, and those who would stand back should forever hold their tongues and be judged at the bar of public opinion.</P>
    <P>The determination of the Minister for Finance to clamp down on tax evasion is another important strand in the campaign to ensure equity right across the total spectrum of public finance in both the giving and the taking.  It is to be welcomed that we are finally coming to grips with these matters.</P>
    <P>The dilemma facing any person charged with ministerial responsibility for social welfare is a very difficult one indeed.  The needs of social welfare recipients have to be balanced against all the over-riding budgetary considerations that are especially acute in an economy where there is a major problem of national indebtedness.  Notwithstanding the immense difficulties and seriously limiting constraints, one has to concede that in this budget the Minister did an excellent job.  The Combat Poverty Agency in their commentary on the budget have noted, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is within the social welfare system that the most socially progressive and welcome changes have been made.</P>
    <P>The CPA go on to mention the 3 per cent cost of living increase with effect from July and note that there are also a number of additional measures that represent significant new departures in policy.  It is important to note that this appraisal comes under the heading &ldquo;Progressive Measures&rdquo;.  The CPA analysis goes on to acknowledge that the single most important of these new policy measures is the extra 8 per cent increase in unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare payments, on top of the 3 per cent indexation addition.  One can readily agree with the CPA observation that breaking with the across-the-board percentage increase system, coupled with <Col N="1606" /> the concept of additional payments for the lowest paid, is a good thing.  The latter is, of course, a strong feature of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The CPA also laud other features for example, (a) simplification of the child dependent allowances; (b) 6 per cent increase for the children of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance recipients; (c) favourable treatment for families with six or more children.  I am well aware, as the Minister is, that there is still a long way to go in reforming social welfare but at last this budget has made a very substantial start to help the least well off in society.</P>
    <P>We have had reams and reams written and said about the homeless.  Here, at last, in this budget we have some positive action instead of the unending verbiage. This Government are serious about the plight of the underprivileged.  The homeless are the lowest rung in the ladder of underprivileged society.  One million pounds per annum for the next three years is a positive contribution to the alleviation of the plight of the homeless. It is heartily to be welcomed.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, will bring forward the legislation on the homeless as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Any tax on pension funds has the potential to be highly emotive and is easily misrepresented.  It is an area in which to tread carefully.  It is not the economic panacea for all our ills that those who shout &ldquo;Pension Funds could pay £300 million&rdquo; claim.  Generally such commentators have little or no understanding of the operation or financing of pension funds and are blinded by big figures.  Taxes of the order suggested, whether on fund values, fund income and contributions, could seriously inhibit the ability of employers to fund adequate pensions for their employees.  They would inevitably lead to higher payroll costs as contributions were forced up, or more seriously and as is more likely, to greatly reduce benefits.  We want to improve rather than disimprove the position and comforts of our elderly.  We want those comforts for ourselves when we are <Col N="1607" /> of an age to need them.  We do not want to widen the gap in terms of pension provision between State and non-State employees &mdash; pensions perhaps being the one area where the State employee has an advantage over his fellow citizens at present.</P>
    <P>We must not undermine the ability of funds to provide adequate benefits.  For that reason the Minister has been most emphatic that his 6 per cent levy, quite a modest tax, will not be repeated.  It is a once-off.  I wholeheartedly welcome this commitment.  As a once-off it is justified by the exceptional investment returns of recent years.  Real rates of return have been, and indeed still are, exceptionally high, well above what actuaries to pension funds could have anticipated.  The funds should be well able to absorb this one-off tax and, on the basis of the Minister's commitment, the trustees, the managers and the actuaries can proceed confident in the knowledge that it will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>However, those same trustees, managers and actuaries have other responsibilities. They should ensure that these excess earnings are not totally applied to reduce funding rates.  Account must be taken of the needs of their retired members, their pensioners, and the moral duty to protect their living standards in so far as their funds allow.  Too many pensions are frozen at the point of retirement and pensioners are condemned to creeping impoverisation.  Of course many of the better funds do index pensions but too many do not.  I call on the trustees of such funds to apply investment profits to this end, to raise pensions in payment where they have not been fully indexed or not indexed at all.  The special tax treatment of pension funds is only justified where they fully discharge their trust.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the setting up of the agency, FÁS, for which the Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, must be congratulated in his first year in Government.  For many years it has been recognised in the House that all the agencies should be one and the <Col N="1608" /> Minister, in his first year, has implemented that.  FÁS is further evidence of the ongoing refinement and rationalisation of State agencies which is a central theme in Government policy. The taxpayer is entitled to services that are excellent in quality and delivery of service but which are also managed and organised to give the best possible return for the expenditure incurred by them.</P>
    <P>FÁS have a very important role to play in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The close co-operation of the Departments of Labour and Education is a most desirable and indeed a very essential prerequisite in getting value for money in the areas of training and education.  The marginal ground between education and training has often in the past been a bone of contention.  The Minister for Education and the Minister for Labour are both very conscious of this and it is likely that the dovetailing of these two Departments in these essential areas where they mesh will be noted for co-operation rather than contention.</P>
    <P>A very recent statement on education and training from the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD has some very pertinent points to make on current trends and needs.  BIAC make the point that the responsibility for the further education and training of the workforce lies primarily with companies. They advocate that it should be left to enterprise to decide the structure and financing of the continuing education of the workforce.  This is a debate that could be taken up in this country and one would hope that FÁS will impartially facilitate this debate.</P>
    <P>BIAC also advocate that higher education should strive to contribute more actively in the area of training so that enterprises will be able to absorb and make use of new developments and new technologies more rapidly.  In the area of training younger persons for the workforce, one would hope that all young workers would be given the advantages of a training contract system so that the status of apprenticeship could be more widely spread.  The links between the workforce, the school leaver and the <Col N="1609" /> school need to be strengthened especially in relation to vocational and educational counselling.  FÁS open up all sorts of exciting possibilities and the return to a fuller employment situation is clearly encompassed in their remit.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Government policy of promoting growth through the utilisation of natural resources.  I would like to deal briefly with tourism, fishing, forestry and food production and processing.  The world markets are waiting for food products that have the green clean label that is so uniquely our heritage and our great national asset.  The advantages inherent in this budget for the business sector offer encouragement to those who would enter this potentially great wealth and employment producing segment of the industry.</P>
    <P>Before I make a few points about forestry, I would like to say that the late Seán MacBride was a man who had a passionate interest in our forests as a national resource that produces wealth, provides magnificient natural panoramic vistas for our citizens and our tourists, a habitat for our wild life, a source of wealth for the agricultural community and those wise enough to invest in the growing and processing of timber.  It has great potential to provide employment. This latter aspect of the forestry business can be and should be exploited to the full through the processing of raw material in the furniture and related industries.  It also has vast potential as an energy source if modern biomass techniques are applied.  To come back to the late Seán MacBride, a man whose passing is greatly lamented, I would like to see on some future suitable occasion that we should name a major forestry development in his honour.</P>
    <P>We have mountains of butter and mountains of beef.  We have wine lakes clogging up the economic viability of the EC.  The wood industry is a noted exception to this over-production fiasco.  In the wood industry within the EC, there is only 50 per cent sufficiency.  As a result of the cutbacks in the agri-sector in the European Community brought about by the aforementioned oversupply in the <Col N="1610" /> food sector there are very real opportunities for forestry as an alternative land use.</P>
    <P>The trials and experiments and the large-scale fieldwork developments of the Forestry and Wildlife Service have been instrumental in identifying those species which grow best and are most suited to the climate and varying soil types in Ireland.  Look at this for a major point of advantage that Ireland enjoys. Our average growth rates are twice the European Community average and four times that of Scandinavia.  Bearing in mind the 50 per cent shortfall, the only conclusion one can logically reach is that we would be remiss, indeed irresponsible as a nation, if we did not capitalise on this ready market in the face of our other natural advantages.  Ireland has the least afforestated land area in Europe, a mere 5 per cent.  We have one million hectares of marginal land suitable for forestry.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that forestry is an industry which could be greatly facilitated and encouraged by appropriate tax incentives and a land leasing scheme that would ensure the release of land for forestry. For example, we should entrust Eolas, with its great reservoir of scientific and technological know-how, with the task of doing a major investigative study on a short-time scale to put forestry and the wood processing industry at the forefront of economic development.  We should not just grow timber.  We should process it and harness its raw material potential to create a great new value-added export trade to timber-starved Europe.  The new semi-State company administering the industry on commercial lines is very desirable and should be implemented with haste.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with a subject very dear to me and my family, that is the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The potential for further development of both the fishing and fish farming sectors of the sea food industry is considerable. This has been fully recognised in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>The establishment of Roinn na Mara, together with the proposed establishment <Col N="1611" /> of the new Marine Research Institute will effect greater cohesion in the implementation of radical, comprehensive and progressive fishery policy and research.</P>
    <P>The huge employment potential of the fishing industry in the catching, processing and aquaculture sectors, and in ancillary industries, can no longer be ignored.  The social and regional development value of the seafood industry, with its impact on the economy of coastal regions, and indeed the national economy, cannot be over emphasised.  The spread of income to less developed regions constitutes a particular value of this industry from a social and economic perspective.</P>
    <P>The performance of fishing and fish farming industries over the next four years will largely determine whether Ireland can secure improved terms when the Common Fisheries Policy is reviewed in 1992.  It is imperative, therefore, that we extract maximum benefit from our fishing and fish farming resources in preparation for that review.  Performance is the best preparation.</P>
    <P>There is a significant upsurge of confidence in the industry.  I find that both at local level and nationally.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have a large number of applications on hand for new vessels which is a further indication of that upsurge in confidence.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the fishing industry is reflected in the improvement in the level of repayments on fishermen's loan accounts financed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The current ratio of repayments to instalments for the year ended 31 December 1987, in respect of operational vessels, stood at approximately 84 per cent.  This compares with a level of approximately 50 per cent in the year ended 31 December 1984.  For larger vessels with loans guaranteed by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, I understand it is as high as 92 per cent.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are to be congratulated on achieving this improved performance in the area of loan repayments within such a difficult and relatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>Allied to all these positive signs is the <Col N="1612" /> new EC structures policy with a budget of £654 million which provides Ireland with a financial opportunity to revitalise our fishing fleet and develop fish farming. Also incorporated in the EC structures policy is financial aid for exploratory fishing, scrapping of old vessels, port development and measures to improve the marketing of surplus and underutilised catches.</P>
    <P>Ireland's seafood products are world famous and have found ready acceptance with discerning seafood consumers in over 30 counties worldwide.  Continuous intensive market promotion drives on global markets have resulted in Irish sea-food exports growing in value from IR£73 million to IR£104 million in the last four years.  Ireland's fish processing and exporting industry, working with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, must continue and expand this important sector.  The industry is also committed to the development of new seafood techniques and processes, developing new products and responding to change in consumer demands and lifestyle. Now, more than ever, innovative processors and exporters are looking to more imaginative and sophisticated profitable added-value products which, more than anything else, will secure the future.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say in his budget statement that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have prepared a draft development strategy, now the subject of consultation.  The objectives of any new plan or strategy must be to realise the growth potential of our seafish industry, both at sea and ashore, to enable it make its full contribution to the economy of coastal regions and the country as a whole.  Incorporated in the strategy must be a commitment to significantly increase annual fish production on present-day value and volume to research, develop and promote an increased market share of Irish sea-food products on national and international markets and further expand the existing employment level from 13,000 jobs.  This development strategy must extract maximum financial benefit from EC structural funds.</P>
    <P>The time is now opportune to build and <Col N="1613" /> reinforce the achievements of previous fisheries development programmes.  Considerable progress has been achieved in stimulating increased fish landings, currently valued at IR£76 million, through the implementation of a comprehensive programme of fleet development and investment in shore processing.  A firm base has also been laid for the further development of fish farming, which has made major strides since the beginning of the eighties and offers a tremendous potential for increased fish production in the future.</P>
    <P>We must maintain this momentum and consolidate and expand the gains we have made to date.</P>
    <P>In any analysis of our economic problems which the Government are undertaking at present, it is clear that, in the short term, tourism represents the best opportunity for achieving growth.</P>
    <P>Since coming to office less than a year ago this Government have given tourism an unprecedented priority.  Progress has already been achieved in relation to access fares and increased competitiveness above what was previously thought possible.  The Government realise that more needs to be done.  Our air fares from continental Europe, and particularly from Germany and France, are excessive, as are fares on cross channel routes where real competition has not yet been introduced and where the same cosy relationship exists between national carriers to the detriment of the consumer.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Tourism and Transport will be following up vigorously the matter of new fares and increased competition.  We sometimes forget that we, the people of Ireland, own the national transport companies which have been paid for and subsidised, where necessary, by the taxpayer.  It is right that they should have commercial freedom. But it is not right that they should follow their interests against the national economic and tourism interests or against the consumer.  Now that we are at last sorting out some of the historic problems which have affected these companies, they have seen the benefits of competition.  I have faith that the professional managements <Col N="1614" /> of these companies can and will respond. I welcome the provision of an additional £4 million for tourism in the budget.  As the Taoiseach has already pointed out, growth has been too sluggish and we have not been maintaining market share in an expanding market.  These £4 million are rightly targeted on short term growth.  I hope that it will be added to by the industry itself by further vigorous and creative campaigns in pursuit of growth.</P>
    <P>This is a special year in Dublin as the city celebrates its millennium, which has helped to focus the attention of the world on Ireland affording superb opportunities for publicity, including Eurovision.  I hope the Minister for Communications will bring home to RTE the national importance for Ireland in the way our country is projected and which has been done so effectively by others.  In many areas the tourism product we sell in Ireland leaves a lot to be desired in terms of standard and terms of development. This budget provides for the continuance of the business expansion scheme introduced last year for the industry.  I would be glad to see more prominence given to the promotion and publicity of this scheme as I have met many people who are unaware of it or its benefits for their enterprises.</P>
    <P>The budget offers much to all sections. I stand over the main theme of what I have been saying this evening &mdash; that it has helped create confidence within all sectors of the community.  Hopefully it will be seen as such by the opinion polls and by the captains of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this debate when it has been well flattened. Most budget debates become very boring within a short period.  This one was worn out even before the Minister for Finance made his Budget Statement.  Having gone through the process of publication of the Estimates in October last, with political parties and various organisations knowing what was in store, the details emerged only on budget day itself.  What has happened since has constituted merely a series of repetitive expressions of views. I am not sure who writes the speeches on <Col N="1615" /> the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  It appears to be a lucky dip, depending on how fast one can read or of how little conviction one has in what one reads. God knows what one might get from the floppy discs emanating from the machines on the far side of the House.</P>
      <P>I want to devote my remarks to three areas and to express a few things that are on my mind relative to the general position obtaining.  I want to refer to my specific area of responsibility, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language.  I also want to refer to the west of Ireland, where I and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, live, and which needs some attention.</P>
      <P>This is a budget of contradictions.  It is a contradiction for the Fianna Fáil Party to have brought it in.  According to a recent poll they have 52 per cent support in terms of what people perceive as the budget being a good thing for the country, and that translates roughly into 44 per cent support for the party.  Between 1982 and 1986 we were lectured daily in this House from the Fianna Fáil benches, which were awash with floods of tears of nationalism and patriotism, in terms of emigrants fleeing from our shores, the soul of Ireland going away and so on. We were lectured in every committee throughout the country and sensitive political issues were raised to bring the Government down at every opportunity. It is a complete contradiction for the Members opposite to speak so vociferously in defence of this budget which was brought in by the Minister for Finance, who is in a straitjacket because of the economic issues which face the country.</P>
      <P>I have spent 12 years in this House and the repetitive performance of the Fianna Fáil Party never ceases to amaze me. When they are in Opposition they do all in their power to tear down the Government and when in Government faced with rough decisions, they hang their heads and hide behind the national flag and the language.  These two topics are always wheeled out when Fianna Fáil think they are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only consistent thread in this <Col N="1616" /> House in the last 12 months was that put forward by the leader of this party, and this was at some political cost.  We have had recriminations from our supporters in terms of our political performance but what we do for the good of the country does not seem to be appreciated by large segments of the community.  They have very short memories.  There was not one occasion between 1982 and 1986 when the Leader of Fianna Fáil told the then Taoiseach he was doing the right thing for Ireland and that his party would back the Coalition Government.  Not once did the then Deputy Haughey stand up and say the Coalition were doing the right thing for Ireland and that Fianna Fáil would back them.  They chose the other road of wrecking the Government at every opportunity.  Now Fianna Fáil have done a turn around in terms of their stated philosophy.  The better-way brigade have arrived and they have to try and appease their supporters.</P>
    <P>Because this party agree with the broad thrust of the economic activities of the Government we are slated by the public, but the wheel will turn.  The leader of my party does not have any personal animosity against the present Taoiseach but such animosity was very obvious when the last Government were in power.  Our leader's vision is of a bigger and broader Ireland with a better standard of living for all &mdash; that is, those who will be left when he gets into office.  As I said, the wheel will turn and when people see the relevance of what the Fine Gael Party proposed when in Opposition they will appreciate that we did not make liars of ourselves because there will be a consistency in our arguments when in Opposition and when in Government.</P>
    <P>One could be forgiven for assuming from the fine media language after the presentation of the budget that the perception abroad is that the national debt has been sorted out, that everything in the garden is rosy, that unemployment will be drastically reduced, and that hundreds of thousands of people are about to be employed.  We used to hear talk of Utopians, but in my view members of this Government are inverted Utopians. <Col N="1617" /> A Utopian cannot produce what he visualises, but an inverted Utopian cannot visualise what he is producing.</P>
    <P>What will happen if the present Government activity continues?  Any good gardener will tell you you can only prune a tree so far.  If the present level of Government activity continues, if the cutbacks continue to be foisted on certain sections of the community, within a very short time we will have a reasonable vision of what will happen in relation to the national debt because we will have neither the initiative nor the engine to provide growth, employment and the standard of living we all consider necessary.</P>
    <P>At present the capital debt is of the order of £28 billion.  If we were to repay that over 50 years without interest it would cost in the region of £500 million per year, but if we were to pay it at an average interest rate of 10 per cent we would have to add £2,800 million to the capital sum, making repayments of £3.3 billion a year.  This shows the problems have not gone away and they must be faced in the years ahead.  The Government do not seem to have put that fact across in such strong language as they used when in Opposition.  Then they vociferously lectured us about monetarism, Thatcherism and all the other things the Government were doing wrong, but not once in those four years did the Taoiseach, then Deputy Haughey, stand up and say that what we were doing was right for the country and that his party backed us.</P>

      <P>The Minister announced he has gone into the business of rescheduling the loans, getting the rates of interest down, cutting public expenditure and the public capital programme, and the result of all that is merely a boost in the unemployment figures and in the number of those on the emigration boat.</P>
      <P>There are various matters in the budget for which the Minister must be given credit.  I accept the decentralisation programme which is first class.  It provides an opportunity for young people working in the public service in our capital city to get back to their home bases and do their job nearer home.  I also agree with the tax amnesty, but a little clarification is required because many of those who might avail of it may not be aware that all the VAT must be up to date by August of this year, otherwise Revenue will be empowered to go back prior to December 1987.  That is broadly acceptable. Revenue might collect more money from that system because the VAT returns would be up to date, whereas in the normal way they might be a year or more behind.</P>
      <P>With regard to the deductions from doctors and consultants, I wonder if this will lead to a doubling of assessed incomes in earlier years.  Once the first claims are in, if a doctor made £25,000 or £50,000 the previous year will Revenue ask what he made in the previous year? Many GPs are hard pressed and they may be afraid that the first level of deductions might lead to a doubling back on the system with further claims from Revenue.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill, 1987: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last week that I welcomed this Bill.  It is an important measure, the culmination of the work of the Law Reform Commission and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I am also glad to note that, as it has been brought forward as a Private Members' Bill, the Government are in agreement, in principle, with its objectives and await Committee Stage to see what improvements can be made as obviously there will be some after the contributions on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There have been some improvements in the procedure by which judicial separations have been handled as, since the Courts Act, 1981, they can now be dealt with by the Circuit Court whereas formerely they were the sole preserve of the High Court.  Unnecessary expense has been avoided by dealing with these matters in the Circuit Court.  However, the real problem with judicial separation up to now has been that the substantive law relating to this matter is the law which was applicable to the ecclesiastical courts prior to their abolition in 1871.  There were only three grounds on which one could seek judicial separation, adultery, cruelty and unnatural practices.  The Oireachtas committee and the Law Reform Commission discussed means by which we could update the substantive law relating to judicial separation and, obviously, increase the grounds on which one could apply to the courts for such judicial separation over and above the three very restrictive criteria laid down in 19th century practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most desirable &mdash; and in the majority of cases it would be true &mdash; that where unhappy differences arise between spouses they are dealt with on a mutually agreeable basis by way of separation agreement or a deed of separation, where <Col N="1620" /> people can resolve their problems and make their own arrangements without the need to apply to the court.  It keeps the adversarial atmosphere out of the process.  Regardless of whether a barrister is wearing a wig, when a spouse has to face into a court and their married life is put under scrutiny with decisions being made by a judge, it is less satisfactory than a person making arrangements through solicitors and coming to a mutually satisfactory arrangement.  Matters dealt with in a court hearing could be dealt with privately and in a manner which keeps the acrimony out of proceedings as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas committee regarded judicial separation as a matter of marital breakdown rather than one of trying to prove matrimonial offences by one party against the other.  Obviously that is a welcome development but it is wrong to suggest that we are totally abolishing the faults principle in dealing with judicial separation in the Bill because three of the grounds in section 2 (1) involves a judge making some decision or finding of fact which will involve a degree of fault by one party or the other, whether it is desertion or adultery.  All the grounds listed in the Bill are not clear to me. Section 2 (1) (a) says it would apply where the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the respondent. That is fair enough as is paragraph (c) which says it would apply where the respondent has deserted the applicant for a continuous period of at least one year immediately preceding the presentation of the application.  Paragraph (d) is also clear but paragraph (f), that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to cohabit with the respondent is not very clear to me and it could have been included in section 2 (1) (a).  The family and marital circumstances referred to in (f) would, presumably, involve the behaviour of the other spouse which is already covered in section 2 (1) (a).</P>
    <P>It is also clear that we must try to <Col N="1621" /> delineate judicial separation procedures here from separation agreements in the sense that one would only apply for a judicial separation where there was no consent on the part of one or the other. I do not see the point in making provision for the application for a judicial separation where both parties agree, which seems to be contemplated in one of the sections.  They could arrange a separation agreement and that would be the end of it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the obligations of a solicitor to advise a person in relation to the counselling or mediation available before proceeding with an application for a judicial separation on behalf of his client.  Part of the procedure would be that the solicitor would certify to the court that he has gone through these preliminary steps before making the application for a judicial separation on behalf of his client.  I would have thought that the steps a solicitor is supposed to take under section 4 are those he would normally take anyway as a matter of ethical behaviour in that when a person approached a solicitor regarding separation proceedings, he would satisfy himself that there was no reasonable possibility of reconciliation or that an attempt had been made by the client to see if reconciliation was possible.  Quite apart from that it seems that the discussions he would have with the client would be all that he would have to do.  It is very much a case of advising a client, giving him a list of names of mediators and counsellors and then go ahead and start the proceedings.</P>
    <P>There should be something in the Bill which, presumably, would form part of the certificate which he would subsequently show to the court when the proceedings had started that the solicitor had attempted to contact the other party and had satisfied himself that no mediation was possible.  As the Bill is outlined at present he can simply have a chat with his client without reference to the other party.  You could have a situation where a client was totally adamant that he would get a judicial separation while the other party might be open to <Col N="1622" /> some means of agreement by which they would separate mutually and by agreement. The solicitor will have to do more than simply discuss it with his client.  In his certificate to the court he would have to show that he had attempted to locate the other person and had put it to him or her &mdash; whichever the case may be &mdash; that the spouse for whom he was acting was contemplating a judicial separation and if he was agreeable to entering into a separation agreement or if it was possible for them to get together to see if any reconciliation was possible.  In that respect the certification procedure as envisaged in section 4 is defective.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to section 5.  There may be exceptional cases where, within a year of the marriage, the conduct of one or other of the spouses was such that an application would have to be made to the court to allow a judicial separation within the one year period.  I have no objection to that.  That is a provision which is necessary in the Bill.  Part II of the Bill deals with ancillary orders which could be made in addition to simply granting the decree of separation.  It is probably the more intricate part or more involved part of the Bill and would require some serious deliberations before coming down with hard and fast rules on it.  I have a few points to make.</P>
    <P>In section 7, the definitions section, I note that &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; do not include the family car and there may be reasons for that.  In the majority of cases the car would probably be the second biggest investment which the family would enter into, apart from the house. That does not seem to be included when one is dividing the various assets of the parties to the marriage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the ancillary orders that could be made by the judge following the granting of a decree of separation. In regard to section 10 (1) (a) it has been mentioned in the previous contributions that there should be a specific provision in the Bill that priority of maintenance payments should be made clear in the Bill over and above any other legal obligations of the person paying the maintenance.  Is there any possibility that <Col N="1623" /> the Bill could also state that the judge would have the power to make an attachment of earnings order in the first instance rather than wait for default by the spouse after the maintenance order has been made?  When you come to that stage of a judicial separation where parties are not agreeing &mdash; and probably there is bad faith against whom the application is being brought &mdash; it would involve the applicant in unnecessary expense if, after making a maintenance order under this section and he subsequently defaults he would then have to come back to the courts and seek an attachment of earnings order.  I do not see why one could not have an attachment of earnings order straight away.  I am not sure if that is legally possible but I will throw it out for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>The other problem relates to section 10 (1) (g) regarding the extinguishing or reducing of the spouse's statutory succession rights.  I would not agree with any change in the present situation where desertion is an absolute bar on a spouse claiming succession rights if the person has been deserted.  For that reason I do not agree with section 30 (c) where, after a transitional period, a person could come back into play again after having deserted a spouse in terms of being able to claim succession rights.</P>
    <P>Marriage is referred to in our Constitution in a way which is of importance to people who are in the marriage state. I do not see how if one party decides to desert &mdash; and leave a wife and children behind &mdash; that when that unfortunate woman, or man if that is the case, dies that he or she can suddenly come back and claim the whole place.  Desertion, as far as I am concerned, means he is out as he has taken a conscious decision to leave.  I do not see any circumstances which would justify him in getting back. I hope that desertion will continue to be an absolute bar in relation to statutory succession rights.</P>
    <P>Where two parties mutually decide to separate, a provision of that agreement is that each party waives their succession rights against the other.  Where two <Col N="1624" /> people come to a mature decision to separate, why should someone who has walked away suddenly have the right at some time in the future to get back into the picture in terms of succession rights? It does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem if no lump sum is payable and if no settlement or property orders are made.  The judge could decide that the person, as envisaged in the Bill, could keep his succession rights.  Therefore, no lump sum payment would be made at the time when the application is being made for a judicial separation.  The husband, or whoever is supposed to be paying the maintenance, could go off and spend his money and assets and when he dies the wife has the worst of both worlds; she neither got a lump sum nor a property transfer order at the time of the separation in order to maintain her succession rights.  When her husband died subsequently he had all the money spent so she ends up with nothing. In other words, when one is trying to cater for the position of varying succession rights at the time of the separation one is depending on the good faith of people and the consistency of circumstances into the future that everything will remain the same if and when one has the right to claim succession rights.</P>
    <P>We need some certainty in this area when we come to judicial separations.  I think we should simply waive the succession rights of each party in the same way as in a separation agreement.  That is the normal practice.  Where one is rescinding one's succession rights at the time of the judicial separation it will provide an impetus for the judge to make sure if he makes the proper ancillary orders in terms of property transfer orders, lump sum payments, adequate maintenance that the person concerned &mdash; who is the application in this case &mdash; can at any time in the future come in and vary the maintenance order.  Her right to seek a variation order on the maintenance cannot be taken from her.</P>
    <P>People who seek a judicial separation, or even a separation agreement, want simply to come to an arrangement where <Col N="1625" /> they can go off and live their separate lives.  We need certainty in relation to succession rights.  We cannot have words like &ldquo;varying&rdquo;, &ldquo;depending&rdquo; and so on. It should be clear and simple.  If the succession rights of each party were precluded, then we would have better arrangements at the time when the separation is being made in terms of lump sum payments, property transfer orders, settlement orders and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 15 raises the point about the power of the court to make retrospective maintenance orders.  Section 8 provides that it would be open to the court to make interim orders to be there for maintenance, custody, access, protection of the family home or the protection of household chattels.  Why should it be necessary to seek a retrospective maintenance order on deciding a judicial separation is applicable in a particular case? From the time an interim order is made there should not be a significant change in circumstances to the time of making the final ancillary order.  I do not know what the idea behind this is.  It should not be necessary to make a retrospective maintenance order at the time of making an ancillary order as is envisaged under section 15.  It may be that this is an extra protection but I do not think it will be widely used if it is inserted.  When one makes an application they may not be granted an interim order and having obtained an ancillary order the respondent may be required to pay from the time the application was made.  That may be the logic behind it.</P>

      <P>I do not see it as being of great importance.  The point has been raised and it is one I am not very clear on at present as to whether one should add additional grounds on which one may obtain a judicial separation or whether one should insert just one ground on which a judicial separation may be obtained, as is envisaged under this Bill, which would be that a marriage has <Col N="1626" /> broken down irretrievably.  At present there are six grounds on which one can prove that a marriage has irretrievably broken down.  As I understand it the Law Reform Commission did not go for the approach adopted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. I have no objections one way or the other but, as I have said, section 2 (1) (f) seems to be too vague.  Under it one could bring in any conceivable set of circumstances.  Section 2 (1) (f) states:</P>
      <P>that the family and marital circumstances are such that it is reasonable for the applicant to wish to live separate and apart from the respondent and to cease to be obliged to co-habit with the respondent.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1) (a) states:</P>
      <P>that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to co-habit with the respondent.</P>
      <P>Presumably what is envisaged under section 2 (1) (f) is going to involve the behaviour of the respondent and seems to be covered by section 2 (1) (a) as it stands at present.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It provides much food for thought.  Unfortunately, some of us have had to hurriedly prepare our contributions but it will be interesting to see what amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage.  It is only on Committee Stage that we will be able to go into the nitty-gritty and get full explanations as to why certain sections are worded in the way they are.  This Bill will grant formal jurisdiction to the court to deal with maintenance, custody and judicial separations in one application and for that reason alone this is a Bill which deserves support.  I commend it in principle to the House and I hope on Committee Stage the various reservations which Members have can be ironed out to everyone's satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief because what is needed at this stage is to signal the position of The Workers' Party in regard to this legislation which is most <Col N="1627" /> welcome.  The ramifications of the Bill were fully explained and outlined both in the explanatory memorandum and in the contribution made by the promoter of the Bill, Deputy Shatter.  As was indicated by the previous speaker, any fine raking over of the provisions of the Bill should await Committee Stage.  The Workers' Party support the Bill and welcome it but do so in a rather grudging and guarded way.  I will explain that a little bit more later in my contribution in the context of the overall position that this Bill must take in the corpus of legislation which deals with family law and, in particular, matrimonial breakdown but at the outset I would like to say that The Workers' Party will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage and will be constructive on Committee Stage in the hope that this Bill having the support of all parties which is now on the record of the House will see its way quickly through both Houses and on to the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me and The Workers' Party not to commend Deputy Shatter for his initiative in bringing forward this legislation.  It is to be doubly commended on the basis that legislation being taken in Private Members' time has achieved all-party support for its principle and the general thrust of its provisions. Being a Private Members' Bill it must, having passed through Second Stage, move on to be dealt with by a special committee.  History has shown that the progress of such special committees has been rather slow but in view of the fact that the thrust and objectives of the Bill have received all-party support it is to be hoped that within a week of the conclusion of the Second Stage debate that the special committee will be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some reservations were expressed in response to the Minister's, Deputy Woods, contribution in which he seemed to indicate that he believed that the next step would be lengthy of necessity, which I frankly do not accept, and would involve much consideration by the Minister's Department and other bodies.  We <Col N="1628" /> have to underline the fact that an all-party committee deliberated for over two years on the very subject matter of the Bill and that they came to the conclusions which form the basis for this legislation. It would be very sad if, following the magnanimous gesture of the Government in accepting and supporting this Bill, it was to be set at nought, retarded or tripped up by parliamentary nit-picking on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope when this special committee is established that The Workers' Party will be afforded an opportunity to participate in its deliberations and to be represented on it.  As a party we have been very active in the debate on proper legislation for marital breakdown and indeed were very active in the referendum dealing with the question of the availability of divorce to Irish people.  We would be sad if, for whatever reason, The Workers' Party were excluded from that committee.</P>
    <P>This is a positive step by the Government in that they are prepared to support legislation introduced by an Opposition party.  That is a welcome departure and I hope that new thinking does not stop there.  The Government should consider taking on board other legislation put forward by Opposition parties.  I am thinking in particular of proposals put forward by The Workers' Party dealing with important areas.  For example, The Workers' Party circulated legislation concerning the drastic position of the office of the Ombudsman.  We want to give legislative authority to the Ombudsman to correct the huge backlog of work that has accumulated in his office by reason of cutbacks.  Our party have also circulated proposals relating to the abolition of ground rents.  Such proposals should be considered by the Government who should not adopt the tired old attitude of consigning proposals from Opposition parties to the shelves without considering their usefulness.</P>
    <P>Another reason for welcoming the Bill is that it emanated from a specialist committee established by both Houses.  There are a number of similar committees engaged in useful deliberations and if their reports are given proper attention <Col N="1629" /> by the Government we will have more constructive legislation for the community. The Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, for example, have been looking at the directive on the whole question of strict liability for producers and distributors.  That directive must be incorporated into our domestic law by July next and the Joint Committee have presented to the Government a useful report on it.  The joint committee want the Government to introduce the appropriate legislation in good time for the House to be able to debate the issue. The Government should ensure that such committees are not ignored in the parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, having presented their report in March 1985, did not take the next step and commission the drafting of legislation based on their findings for presentation to the House in 1985.  Strictly speaking, the terms of reference of such a committee do not allow for this but committees who carry out comprehensive examinations of different topics should seek a redefinition of their terms of reference to allow them to submit draft legislation based on their deliberations.  That did not happen in the case of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and we are indebted to Deputy Shatter for basing this legislation on the report of that committee.  As a result of the joint committee not preparing a Bill based on their report we have had to wait three years for such a proposal to be presented to us for discussion.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to pour cold water on a discussion on this topic I have a sneaking suspicion that many of the contributions are in total disregard of the fact that an all-party committee spent many hours listening to submissions from outside groups and giving careful consideration to their findings.  I am a little suspicious of some of the arguments being put forward in response to the Bill and the points being raised by various quarters in the House on the desirability of accepting the Fine Gael Bill.  Are the <Col N="1630" /> Government losing the sense of magnanimity they displayed in the last term when they announced that they would take this legislation on and see it through all Stages?  The Government should bear in mind that the Bill was not hastily prepared but is based on years of work by all parties.  They should consider that it closely follows the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown published in 1985.  It would be a pity if it was to end up in a committee with members squabbling about its contents.</P>
    <P>At the outset I said that our support was guarded and grudging and I should like to explain that.  It would be wrong to lose sight of the context into which this legislation must be slotted when dealing with family law or the law relating to marital breakdown.  I do not think I could be accused of denigrating the work of the joint committee if I suggested that it was established as a diversion from arguments that were developing and which reached their inevitable conclusion in the divorce referendum of June 1986.  I do not think it would take from the work of that joint committee if I suggested that it was a device created by the Government of the day to seek to be seen to be doing something about the issue of marital breakdown while at the same time not dealing with the whole question of the need for divorce in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point that we are not legislating for divorce.  Support for the legislation must not take away from the demand and need for the Government, and all parties in the House, to look at the prohibition on divorce as contained in our Constitution with a view to doing something positive about it.  Divorce is a civil right and it must be introduced into our corpus of law one way or another without much delay.  I hope that in supporting the legislation we are not putting on the back burner or deferring for longer than necessary, the need for another initiative leading to the introduction of divorce as a civil right. We have to underscore the fact that divorce is ultimately the only effective and humane way to deal with irretrievably broken down marriages.  People in that <Col N="1631" /> situation must be given the opportunity and the right of a second chance at married life.  It would be wrong of us to think that we were dealing with the whole area of irretrievable marriage breakdown through this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution took issue with the term &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown&rdquo; in the context of the first part of the Bill.  I do not support the Minister in that view.  The notion of an irretrievable breakdown is a useful and workable one in the context of this Bill.  We must seek to contract our grounds and to establish one succinct ground for applying to court for a judicial separation.  All such applications are made because parties perceive that their marriage has irretrievably broken down, but through the process provided for so comprehensively in the Bill the parties might well be brought to the stage of realising that their notion of irretrievability is not absolute.  That is a revolutionary departure in this legislation. For the first time we are legislating actively in an attempt through the courts to secure and maintain the institution of marriage.  This does not, of course, address the many thousands of people who have gone far beyond that stage and who have made new arrangements which they cannot consecrate with a civil marriage because of the absence of divorce.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a legislative device to seek to arbitrate fairly between opposing or conflicting interests and rights relating to maintenance, property, custody and succession and all the other issues which caused so much worry to those who opposed the introduction of civil divorce in 1986.  It is a legislative process which will actively work to protect and promote the institution of marriage because so much will have to be done before a court will move to make an order of judicial separation and any ancillary or interim orders which might have to be dealt with. It is a legislative process which will help to protect the rights of children in the context of all those issues.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that one Member of this Dáil was capable of drawing the legislation together, borrowing from a report <Col N="1632" /> which was in existence in 1985, and presenting it to us.  What was wrong in 1986 when Fine Gael and Labour sought to promote a referendum on civil divorce? It failed simply because the proposal was not supported with legislation along the lines of the Bill before us.  There were arguments and worries about property rights, income and maintenance and succession rights.  People who opposed divorce went around the country sowing seeds of doubt among people who were worried about these issues in the context of civil divorce.  All it needed was simple legislation similar to that before us which would have helped people to find an answer to these questions.  If the words &ldquo;civil divorce&rdquo; were substituted for the phrase &ldquo;judicial separation&rdquo; that whole debate would be adequately dealt with. It serves to bring home the point that while the Government of the day sought to hold a referendum in the face of major public demand, they did not have the political courage, with the exception of individual members of both parties, to see the matter through and to couple it with effective legislation of the type we have today.  That would have answered very many of the questions which worried people at that time.</P>
    <P>We have in this legislation a framework that is logical and workable and which will help to advance at least in part the corpus of law available to people troubled in marriage.  It is hoped that once it passes onto the Statute Book it will become another cogent argument for civil divorce. Once this legislation becomes law &mdash; let us hope that is sooner rather than later &mdash; we will have in legislative form the conditions, rights and facilities available for civil divorce, if such existed, except the right to remarry.  All other conditions can be arbitrated upon in the courts.  Only the right to remarry will be omitted.  This omission will be challenged as a sectarian imposition by church interests and will be far more effectively dealt with in debate because people will be aware of the legislation covering their various rights should civil divorce be introduced.  I look forward to that day <Col N="1633" /> and to this legislation assisting that argument when it arises.</P>
    <P>A feature of the legislation is its effort to make the law and the judicial process more accessible to people in conditions of marriage breakdown who need it.  We must look at the whole question of the availability of many, if not all, the remedies in this Bill at District Court level.  I am not taken by the argument that District Court judges are not capable of applying the law with regard to family rights.  At the moment they deal with a huge area of law such as barring, maintenance, access and custody on an interim and emergency basis.  There is no reason why some if not all the remedies suggested in this legislation should not be available in the District Court.  There is always the right of appeal to the Circuit Court for people who feel aggrieved.  The District Courts are the most democratic, readily available and accessible courts. Many people who would not have the property or wealth interests to prod them into going to court would be very easily facilitated by some of the remedies they would be able to avail of without any great difficulty by way of judicial separation in the District Courts.  There is nothing to stop the Government when accepting such a proposal also insisting on education courses for members of the Judiciary at any level.  I believe they are necessary and should be considered by Government.</P>
    <P>The second issue in this general area of accessibility of the law and its remedies to the people is the question of legal aid. I know that as a Private Members Bill it must have this useful device contained within it that the legislation involves no charge on the Exchequer or no staffing problems for the Minister.  That provision of necessity must be there because it is a Private Members' Bill and cannot, I believe, hope to succeed unless that recital is contained with it.  Nonetheless I find it remarkable that we must be considering this type of legislation without having regard to the present existing facilities or lack of them in the civil legal aid offices.  The vast majority of people would avail of these remedies when they <Col N="1634" /> are on the Statute Book but many of them will be unable to afford the process of going, through private solicitors, to the Circuit and High Courts.  The civil legal aid offices are essential for the effective working of this Bill.  For that reason I hope that something radical will be done by Government in trying to relieve the overcrowded lists and inadequate staffing in our law centres.</P>
    <P>The Bill is to be very much welcomed in the proposal it puts forward for the establishment of separate family courts.  I am a bit worried about the Government's response and suggestion that, particularly in rural areas, there are logistical problems. There are not, because the Bill allows for a separate time or place or day. As I interpret the Bill it does not require the appointment of extra judges or the establishment of separate court buildings. It is so carefully and well drafted that its requirements allow for very different conditions, rural or urban.  The important thing is to take the listing and hearing of these cases out of the average run of the mill listing of cases and to put them away into separate chambers or separate times or separate days.  I do not believe that we should pour cold water on the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill seeks to promote the introduction of informality.  Ridding the courts of gowns and wigs is a very welcome development. It is something I sought to do in the corporation, where I tried to get rid of the gowns.  It has always been a curious thing to me that with the revolutionary introduction of this State in 1922 the two areas in which we did not in any way interfere were the courts and the local authorities and they maintained all the trappings of the colonial regime.  It is remarkable that we still rely on them.  I do not know why.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is an understatement to suggest that this is revolutionary legislation in certain regards.  For the first time we are legislating to tell lawyers how to conduct business with clients in their offices and we are legislating to protect and promote the family as an important institution.  We all support this and I believe it is a whole new departure and <Col N="1635" /> should be welcomed.  The committee and the Bill are to be supported for that reason.  It is also in part revolutionary in its attempt to dismantle the formal structures and attitudes of our courts in dealing with family matters.  It is an effort to move towards the introduction of family tribunals, all of which is to be welcomed.  I hope that because we have all-party support that we will have the special committee established without delay.  I hope that we will sit down on an all-party basis to constructively contribute to the amendment of the Bill if it is necessary.  Having read through the Bill carefully and thoroughly I do not see any great need for an amendment to it.  I think it is well drafted.  It will be looked at constructively by The Workers' Party on Committee Stage.  I hope that without any significant delay this legislation will pass onto our Statute Book and that the Government will provide the resources to give it the effective means of implementation for all people and not just those with property and wealth alone.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I am obviously anxious that Deputies on all sides of the House would have an opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  If I may ask for guidance, I think to date there have been only two Fine Gael speakers, myself and Deputy Barnes.  I think Deputy D. Ahearn would be the fifth Fianna Fáil speaker.  Obviously he is welcome but it would seem, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that there is something of an imbalance in that.  It would have been expected that Deputy Flanagan would be called next.  We had two days of debate last week and there was only one Fine Gael speaker on each evening.  The Ceann Comhairle had previously indicated that he would redress the balance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Shatter, I have listened to the point that you have made.  Let me explain that traditionally the debate swings from one side of the House to the other.  Already <Col N="1636" /> the Government side have had five speakers and they will have to follow the Opposition side without breaking up the parties. Fine Gael have had two speakers, the PD Party one, The Labour Party one, and The Workers' Party one.  That is five speakers to five speakers and nothing could be more evenly balanced, in which case I am now calling Deputy Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be too long.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I compliment Deputy Shatter for bringing it forward.  Deputy McCartan said earlier that perhaps people might have regarded it as a quickly rushed through Bill.  I do not accept that and I think Deputy Shatter knew exactly what he was doing when he brought forward this Bill.  We have had various commissions and committees sitting in the area of marital breakdown.  Quite a lot of work has been done in that regard. This Bill is the culmination of a great deal of work that was done particularly by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  We are dealing tonight with a Bill on divorce a <i>mensa et thoro</i>.  In effect to call it divorce in any shape or form is a misnomer because there is not the ability to remarry in this country. Recently we have had a referendum where the people of Ireland had their say and they have said quite convincingly that, for one reason or another they do not want to make provision in the legislation at present for the right to remarry. Accordingly, we have to try to amend the legislation or to go forward from there taking into account that view.  As far as I am concerned this Bill goes quite a long distance to provide everything that should be provided at this stage, given the fact that we cannot include the right to remarry in divorce legislation.  The Law Reform Commission in 1983 and the Oireachtas Joint Committee that I have already mentioned seem to have had different approaches to the problem.  I do not really know why, because the Law Reform Commission was more or less made up of people involved in the area and I think so also was the Oireachtas Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> On the question of judicial separation the Law Reform Commission proposed five different grounds on which judicial separation should be available, whereas the Oireachtas Joint Committee proposed one ground based on six facts which more or less corresponded with the grounds proposed by the Law Reform Commission.  Deputy Shatter's Bill generally proposes to implement the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  There are pros and cons in relation to this.  The concept of irretrievable breakdown, which is really the nub of the Bill, was introduced in England in the Divorce Reform Act, 1969. That was a ground doing away with the element of fault, saying that from here on in you proved the facts.  The court had a duty to inquire into the marriage and the evidence put forward by both spouses.  It was a simple assertion by the court on the evidence as presented to it. Irretrievable breakdown seems to sit easy in the area of divorce, but in regard to judicial separation I see a problem in that &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; infers the non-possibility of a reconciliation at a future time.  The very fact that the legislation provides that the couple at a later stage if they so wish can discharge the order of the court is really saying that the &ldquo;irretrievable&rdquo; that was there previously is no longer there.  Perhaps we should call it something else or build something else into the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill lists a number of grounds or facts upon which the irretrievable breakdown ground is put forward. I note that the previous Government in their statement of intent went along generally with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. The present Government appear to be going along with the same recommendations of the Law Reform Commission rather than those of the Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The problem with the proposed legislation is the sixth of the grounds listed in section 2 (1) (f), and Deputy Cowen referred to this. That provision would cover a multitude and it generally would mean that any <Col N="1638" /> ground that would be put forward by one spouse or another may allow a court at some future date to bring in an order of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to reconciliation and mediation is to be welcomed.  It puts an onus on solicitors and lawyers involved in the process to prove to the court that they have ensured that the people who come into court have gone through proper counselling and mediation procedures. That is probably stating the obvious because in this day and age when couples come into a solicitor's office saying they want a judicial separation they cannot agree; always the tendency is to propose to them that they should either see a counsellor or someone who would act as a mediator in these circumstances and try either to agree to disagree, or to put together some separation agreement that would be all right for both of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has chosen to put the ancillary orders provided for in section 10 along with the judicial separation order and this is welcome.  Anyone involved in the family law area knows of the plethora of applications that have to be made where there is a problem in the marriage, and that is a very expensive and complicated procedure.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to the family home is to be welcomed.  I say as a criticism of the Government and all Governments previously, that we have talked a great deal about putting in order the law in relation to the family home.  We have the Family Home Protection Act, the import of which is to be welcomed, but it has caused many problems for a number of years and has given rise to a number of court actions for family people to decide one way or another in relation to the family home.  The time is ripe for some comprehensive review in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is particularly to be welcomed.  It gives recognition to the spouse, usually the wife, for the work that has been carried out in support of the home.  Up to now it has been left to evidence in court to whatever to be produced by the wife to establish her <Col N="1639" /> right to an interest in the family home. Section 13 gives this statutory grounding. The provision regarding maintenance increases the power in relation to the maintenance order under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Acts.  Again, this is welcome and nobody on any side of the House would have any problem about it.</P>
    <P>I have a problem regarding the family law courts.  It is not often I find myself agreeing with Deputy McCartan.  He asked why the District Court should not be involved.  As a practising solicitor I find the whole procedure of family law in the District Court and the Circuit Court degrading and demeaning to the people involved.  A husband and wife may be hanging around court all day while other cases are being heard and the judges tend to put the family law cases to the very end of the list.  They do so in my district. That means that more particularly the wife is waiting around all day not knowing what is happening.  This causes its own problem.  Recently I had a woman in with me who is going through the barring order procedure and she ended up, having waited in the court all day, going home five minutes before her case was due to be heard, and the husband is still in the house.</P>
    <P>The possibility of getting the District Court involved in this should be considered. Here I see a flaw in the Bill. Why should the High Court be excluded? Apart from its appellate jurisdiction it is to be excluded and the cases are to be heard on the Circuit Court only under the name of the family law courts.  All courts should have a role in this and it should start in the District Court.  From my experience I feel that up to now the barring procedure has been used by spouses in some cases in the District Court as a way of getting a judicial separation. They come in and allege some sort of conduct against the husband or the wife &mdash; usually the husband &mdash; and, as a result, are able to get in effect a judicial separation for a certain period in the house.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to wigs and <Col N="1640" /> gowns is to be welcomed.  Anyone involved in that area knows they have an intimidating influence on litigants in the family law areas.  We should try to get away from the whole idea of &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;.  I agree with the Minister about the provisions in relation to succession. Certainty is an absolute necessity in regard to succession rights and this Bill puts some uncertainty into that area.  If a separation is ordered each spouse should walk away and there should be a clean break.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators have said that this Bill is trying to do away with the whole idea of fault in matrimonial proceedings.  I do not necessarily agree. In any type of court action or adversarial procedure there will be an element of fault, taking human nuture into account. Whoever is making a decision ultimately will have to come down on one side or the other on the facts as presented to him.  Therefore, to say that this Bill does away with fault is not strictly correct, and I would refer particularly to sections 2 and 14 in this regard because there a judge has to make a decision one way or the other based on the evidence put before him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney said that children were regarded as second class citizens to parents.  I do not agree with that.  My experience has been that in any of the cases that have gone through courts the rights of children were always regarded as paramount.  That is the way it should be and she agrees with that but I do not accept that they are treated as second class citizens.  I agree with her that a report on the children should be mandatory and that there is no provision in the Bill in relation to this.  This is something which should be looked at.  I agree with her in relation to raising the marriage age to 18.  It is high time we looked at this area and increased the age because I feel people are getting married far too young and do not realise what they are doing when they decide to get married.</P>
    <P>I do not often agree with Deputy Taylor but I noted he started his contribution by saying that legal remedies were available to certain people only.  As <Col N="1641" /> someone who has been involved in a good deal of family law I have to agree with him.  I am more often not paid than paid. In effect, in a country area one is providing a social service to the people, particularly to a wife who may be in trouble in that she has no money coming into the house and has to feed her children and if she has to go into court she has no money to pay the legal costs involved. The free legal aid scheme is not working as well as it should.  It is totally inadequate. Unfortunately, our budgetary situation may not allow us to amend the scheme but it is something which should be given top priority in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter must be complimented for taking this initiative and the Government have to be complimented too, on the attitude they are taking to it.  There is an opportunity at this time to do a complete overhaul of the family law area and I quote, for instance, the family home.  Perhaps more provision should be included in this Bill in relation to the family home.  On the whole this Bill should be welcomed and I look forward to making a contribution on it on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this most important debate so far as the reform of our family law code is concerned.  I should like to compliment my colleague, Deputy Shatter who has established himself over the years as the expert in the family law code of practice in this country and it is fitting that he should be the one to be responsible for this milestone in legislation, of being the first person to have a Private Members' Bill run a very favourable chance of being enacted, which I think is something we have not had since the fifties.  We can certainly learn from this approach so far as Private Members' time and legislation is concerned.  I should like to see this legislation being the first of many from the Opposition benches to be enacted.</P>

    <P>I should like to record my appreciation of the Government's attitude towards the Bill and of the contribution of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, <Col N="1642" /> when he stated that he was anxious that the Bill be enacted as quickly as possible. I hope that when the Bill is under discussion on Committee Stage, he will not see fit to amend the Bill in the manner in which he may have indicated in his contribution last week.</P>
    <P>During discussion of this Bill so far, it is fair to say that there was an underlying conflict between the Opposition and the Government with regard to the fundamental section of the Bill, that is section 2.  I see a conflict emerging with regard to the report of the Oireachtas joint committee and that of the Law Reform Commission.  I should like to remind the House of the very important role of the Oireachtas joint committee and the very thorough manner in which the entire concept of our family law code was discussed.  It is fair to advise the House of the various sectional interest groups and the wide and diverse participants who played a part in submitting evidence and attending the hearings of the Oireachtas joint committee, groups as diverse and as far apart as the Knights of St. Columbanus, The Workers' Party, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Irish Theological Commission, the Irish Family League, the Family Law Reform Group and the Divorce Action Group. These were people from all walks of life who had an interest in the family law code as it stands in this country today, people who have a sincere and genuine belief in reforming the family law code for the benefit of the people and in particular, for those in most need.  As well as the submissions from the groups I have mentioned 700 written submissions were made to the committee from people throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>Such was the thorough nature of the deliberations of the committee that when producing their report they went into tremendous detail and it would be a pity if we, as a Legislature, were to opt for the Law Reform Commission approach rather than the Oireachtas joint committee approach.  Without demeaning the role of the Law Reform Commission, it must be pointed out that they did not <Col N="1643" /> engage in any oral submissions or invite submissions from any interest groups.  It was though they looked into their own hearts and decided what was best for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I should like to record a welcome for section 2 as it stands.  I hope that on Committee Stage it will not be amended in the form suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals fundamentally with the question of marriage breakdown.  I was interested to hear Deputy Ahern and a number of speakers last week mention the fact that a raise in the marriage age was something that should be considered. I see that as being a fundamental point because many marital problems stem from the fact that people enter the contract of marriage without due and adequate preparation.  In many ways, it is a contract people can enter into far too easily.  It is fair to say that people can enter into a marriage contract far easier than they can negotiate a contract for the mortgage of a house or negotiate a visa to many parts of this earth.  It is regrettable that regard is not given to due preparation for marriage.  Statistics show that in continental Europe and in the US it is marriages between teenagers which unfortunately break down.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill is important as it imposes on the solicitor an onus to advise a client in a family law matter to seek professional guidance and the advice of a mediator.  We cannot underplay the importance of marriage guidance counsellors or mediators in the role of family law.  I will deal later with the lack of training of members of the legal profession, including judges in the whole area of family law.  It is of vital importance that a solicitor advise his client of the need to engage the services of a marriage guidance counsellor.  It was suggested by some Deputies that the advice of a solicitor to his client was too loose and not sufficiently binding.  Deputy Abbott felt that there should be compulsory referral by a lawyer of his client ot a marriage guidance counsellor.  We would want to be careful about things like that.  If it were <Col N="1644" /> compulsory we would certainly lessen the role of the guidance counsellor as far as the court was concerned.  It would be difficult for a court having considered the report of the counsellor to separate a genuine party in difficulty who sought the advice of a guidance counsellor from the person who went to a guidance counsellor simply because the law stated that one must go to a marriage guidance counsellor. This would lead to a lessening in value to the role of the mediator and that would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill deals with the interim measures available to the court prior to a full hearing.  That is important when we realise that we are dealing with the most traumatic of legal difficulties, that of family break-up.  The immediate relief contained in section 8 is quite important when we consider court delays because of the huge lists that have been referred to by previous speakers and when one considers the inadequacies of law centres.  I do not blame the people who work in the law centres but I have noticed that because of the huge amount of work in the law centres adjournments are often the order of the day.  In family law cases an interim measure is important when there is a delay in bringing the case to the floor of the court.</P>
    <P>Section 10 providing 13 ancillary orders is to be welcomed because of the cumbersome and traumatic proceedings in a court hearing.  A person going to court in a family law case wishes that he will have to go to court only once for such traumatic events, rather than having to come in and out of court week after week seeking various orders of redress.  Under section 10 it is possible that a number of orders may be made on the one occasion. This is also a better system with reference to the expense of court appearances.  In the course of submissions to the Joint Committee it was mentioned that the cost of a High Court action can be in excess of £1,000 per day.  In dealing with the expense involved for people who often-times can ill afford to go to court, it is absolutely vital that people get full or as near as possible full redress by one trip to court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> A number of speakers referred to the manner in which family law today operates. Family law is the poor relation and that it regrettable.  We have only to look at the way in which family law cases are dealt with in the courts to see that it is the poor relation.  Family law lists are more often than not read in conjunction with licensing applications, criminal matters, equity matters and civil proceedings. My experience shows that family law lists are put in for perhaps a Friday morning or afternoon at the end of a hard week in the Circuit Court.  That has led to a perception on the part of the judges and the officers of the court that family law is less important than other aspects of the law.  Because courts are being cleared on a daily basis to read over the family law lists, people engaged in other matters feel that they are being pushed out because the court has to be cleared for a family law matter.  It is totally unacceptable that family law courts operate in the same surroundings and at the same time as civil and criminal matters.</P>
    <P>The question of accommodation has to be addressed.  It is regrettable that family law cases are dealt with in the ceremonial surroundings of a courtroom where witnesses and respondents have to take the stand just as criminal witnesses do and that there are formalities such as taking the oath and speaking from the dock. The system needs to be reformed and this Bill is a step towards addressing these inadequacies.  The hostile environment of a court setting is not suitable to family law cases.  I welcome what has been happening in many courts up and down the country where family law cases are held in the less hostile surroundings and the privacy of the judge's chambers.  This is not happening often enough and I should like to see greater advances made in this regard.  The hostile environment of the courtroom and the formal nature of the proceedings give rise to the adversarial aspect of family law matters, which is regrettable.  This is in some way addressed by my colleague's Bill.  A family law case, be it an application for a barring order, or for a judicial separation, is in <Col N="1646" /> many ways a battle &mdash; between the lawyer and his opposing party, between the husband and the wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that something so serious should have to take up the time of this House.  This is the first time in the past 30 years that any Government have decided to suspend the programme of beach nourishment to maintain the very last line of defence against the seas and preserve our facilities at Rosslare Strand. I should say at the outset that Rosslare Strand is one of our most scenic and beautiful tourist assets, creating tourism revenue of well over £1 million per annum and involves splendid facilities by way of hotels, restaurants, all-weather facilities, golf and so on.  It is very much a national asset and a national responsibility to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wexford County Council received a letter in mid-December last from the Office of Public Works and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance outlining that the Government would no longer give money for the provision of essential maintenance provided each year for the past 30 years by beach <Col N="1647" /> nourishment and planting and so on.  Last week, the council sought to meet the Minister of State and for almost two hours last night asked that the Government rescind their decision to suspend that coastal protection programme and ensure that adequate funding be made available to ensure the preservation of this national asset.  Unfortunately, as I said at that meeting, it was dialogue for the deaf.  We reiterated our case time out of number and the urgency of the situation which can only be vindicated by the fact that as I speak there are most serious storms ravaging that beach.  Let us hope, by the grace of God, that our worst fears are not realised.  We can be under no illusion that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance will be directly responsible for any breach on that beach.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council have consistently discharged their obligations and responsibility in this regard.  Last Monday they met to consider the serious dilemma arising out of the Minister's constant refusal to allocate funds towards this beach nourishment.  We have decided to take legal advice because we cannot enter into new responsibilities willy-nilly should the work we do not be adequate. What is needed now is that the men who were sacked by the Government be reinstated.  What is needed now is a recognition that the money legally spent over the past 30 years was rightly spent and that it would be wasted if no further money is spent.  I ask the Minister to go back to the Government, specifically to the Minister for Finance, and obtain the necessary funding.  If he talks to his Fianna Fáil colleagues they will tell him of the serious concern felt in County Wexford about this matter.  Obviously, he has not been listening.  It is important that he realise he cannot indefinitely wash his hands of the issue.  It will not go away.</P>
    <P>The engineers of Wexford County Council do not have the expertise to carry out this work.  Empty platitudes from the Minister about awaiting a proposal from Wexford County Council when the council have an overdraft and debt of over £30 <Col N="1648" /> million and neither the competence nor the resources to solve the problem do not help.  There is no doubt that Wexford County Council and local interests, community and business, will play their part in any proposal of the Minister's</P>
    <P>CIE also have obligations and responsibilities on this issue.  It has been proved that the development of Rosslare Harbour and different changes have had an effect on coastal erosion.  I hope their role in this will not be forgotten.  I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle has seen this very scenic area many times.  There is imminent danger to Rosslare should there be a breach.  The effects could go all the way to Wexford town, given the particular geography and physical lay out of the land.  To make matters worse, I have seen photographs of parts of the coastline in Rosslare that are now submerged. Are we to hand over to the next generation the same legacy of neglect because the Minister of State is doing a Pontius Pilate act, saying that he is no longer responsible?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to go immediately to Cabinet to get the necessary funds for beach nourishment this year.  I ask him to waive the £400,000 debt of Wexford County Council in lieu of the money they will pay as a contribution for work the Government will carry out if this decision is rescinded.  I ask the Minister to ensure the necessary survey as part of the capital scheme, the long-time solution of this problem, is given the go-ahead.  If the Minister makes his best endeavours and explains to his Government colleagues the seriousness and the imminent danger, I have no doubt that we in Wexford can get on with developing a national asset, ensuring the growth of tourism revenue in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in joining my parliamentary colleagues from Wexford in speaking on this issue, to present to the Minister of State a cross-party line.  The fears of the people of Wexford are reflected in all-party unanimity on this subject.  It is significant that we are speaking tonight in the teeth of one of the worst storms experienced in <Col N="1649" /> decades. No doubt, each hour of this night further damage is being done to Rosslare beach.</P>
      <P>What concerns every man, woman and child in Wexford is the fact that since it has been recognised that the beach is vulnerable and that because of that vulnerability a special ongoing scheme must be provided to give it protection.  That scheme has been in place for over 30 years and work has been carried out, week in week out.  From 1 January 1988 the scheme has been discontinued and the employees of the Office of Public Works have been summarily dismissed and the beach at Rosslare abandoned. The fears expressed by Oireachtas Members from Wexford, and especially those expressed by the residents of Rosslare, are genuine.  They are fearful that a breach &mdash; and this happened in the past when we lost the fort at Rosslare &mdash; could occur after one bad storm and decimate valuable property and threaten lives.  I do not think it is too alarmist to say that.  It would indeed open the town of Wexford itself to the sea and make flooding an inevitability in the capital town of the County of Wexford.</P>
      <P>Much consideration has gone into providing a permanent solution.  Indeed the Minister's immediate predecessor announced work on a capital scheme which would, in the long term, provide a permanent solution at a cost of some £5 million.  A survey was carried out and £50,000 was expended on that.  Another survey is required and I hope the Minister of State will find the resources to allow that permanent scheme to go ahead in the fullness of time.</P>
      <P>In the interim,it is imperative that the on-going beach protection work that has been necessary since 1957 be maintained in 1988.  To abandon it, without regard to the consequences, is irresponsibility of the highest order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State met a deputation last week; my colleague, Deputy Ivan Yates, described it as the dialogue of the deaf.  I felt sorry for the Minister of State on that occasion, because he said that he was in sympathy with the cause, that he understood the immediacy and the <Col N="1650" /> urgency of the problem, but that there had been a Government decision that there would be no subhead for coast protection in the Estimates for 1988, and consequently he was debarred, by Government order, from providing this on-going essential maintenance work.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to do something.  There is an emergency in Rosslare.  It is a situation that demands immediate remedial action.  If a Government decision is needed to reverse the decision not to carry out this work, then such a decision must be made, and the Minister of State has a bounden responsibility to go to the Minister for Finance and request a reversal of policy and an exception to be made in this case.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council is not in a position to carry out this work.  We have neither the financial resources nor the expertise nor, indeed, the statutory responsibility.  We cannot carry out the work.  The Minister's Department has been responsible for 30 years for doing the work.  I appeal to him now to give us an undertaking, in the teeth of this hurricane that is going on tonight, to go back to his senior colleague, the Minister for Finance, to request an immediate reversal of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the Minister of State, the incumbent in the office I held this time last year, I accuse the Government of being wilfully negligent in relation to the decision that has been made to remove the Office of Public Works from Rosslare beach.  The irresponsibility of this move will be obvious, unfortunately, as the months unfold. Both Deputy Yates and Deputy Howlin have outlined what will happen as a result of the Government's decision to withdraw a service that Rosslare beach has needed for over 30 years.  Is it possible that any arm of state, any Government Department, will spend hundreds of thousands of pounds over 30 years in providing a service which at the time they considered absolutely necessary, and then just suddenly withdraw and wash their hands saying it is no longer their <Col N="1651" /> statutory responsibility to continue?  If it was not the Government's responsibility, and if they did not consider that enormous amount of taxpayers' money to be absolutely essential when they spent it, I am afraid they must now answer to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to the general taxpayers of Ireland for the money that was obviously mis-spent.</P>
      <P>The Minister's Department should have realised from winding down the operation in the late sixties when the beach in Rosslare had developed to such an extent &mdash; thanks to the good maintenance and care of the Office of Public Works &mdash; that this would be a mistake. With the best intentions, the office of public Works thought they could withdraw and wind down their service because the beach had been put back to its original condition.  A few short years surely taught the Office of Public Works a lesson.  Today we have still not reached the level we were at in the late sixties on the beach because of the severe vertical erosion that ensued, despite hundreds of thousands of pounds more being spent. In fact the last Government spent £0.75 million on the beach in four short years. Despite the fact that CIE, under some severe pressure, did contribute and provide some off-beach nourishment for the strand, it is still not in the condition it was.  Did the Office of Public Works and the Government learn nothing from withdrawing in the sixties with the consequent appalling results of that move?  In fact, I was advised when I was sitting in the Minister's seat, that marine engineering is a specialised aspect of civil engineering; that coast protection engineering is a specialised branch of marine engineering requiring, in effect, specialisation in one area of an already specialised field; that the Office of Public Works has a central pool of the required expertise, and usually local authorities do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that Wexford County Council does not and cannot be expected to have this expertise which is far removed from that deriving from their normal engineering activities relating to roads, bridges, sanitary services, etc.  We <Col N="1652" /> are all agreed on that.  Yet the Government have washed their hands, as my colleagues have said, and said to Wexford Country Council &ldquo;it is yours, regardless of what has happened&rdquo;.  The Office of Public Works have all of this very carefully documented and the valuation on the property down there is a very conservative estimation of what it might realise on the open market.  If damage is done by a breach or several breaches &mdash; hopefully we are not talking of a cataclysmic effect &mdash; our advice as members of Wexford local authority as well as Oireachtas members is that the Office of Public Works, in effect, will be responsible. They have been there for 30 years.  They considered it sufficiently important to spend thousands and thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money.  They have now run from the scene and are reneging on their responsibility and handing it over to a local authority, in itself much under-funded for years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in coming down when a disaster occurs or a breach occurs on the beach.  The Government have considered that a possibility for over 30 years.  There is no point in coming down if such a disaster occurs and finding the money somehow to shore up the damage that has been done.  It is not a question of &ldquo;see you in court&rdquo; as far as Wexford County Council is concerned.  It is fairly and squarely the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  Let the Minister not quote to me the Coast Protection Act, 1963, or tell us that the Office of Public Works is just enabled to do the work the Government have been doing there for the last 30 years.  We have heard it all.  No arm of State would spend millions if they were not empowered to do so and if they did not think it was absolutely necessary to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I say to the Minister of State, and through him to the Minister for Finance who carries the cudgels on this one, <Col N="1653" /> that Rosslare beach is the centre of perhaps one of the busiest home holiday markets in our country.  Generations of children from Dublin and elsewhere have spent many a summer's day on our lovely beach down there.  It does not belong to the people of Wexford.  There is no way, even if Wexford County Council had the finance and the funding, that they should be held responsible for what is, after all, a national asset.  We do not charge the people from the midland counties or Dublin or anywhere else for using our beach, we are so delighted to have them come to Wexford and spend their holidays with us.  It is a matter for the central Exchequer to fund coastal protection in any part of this State.  The shame is that we have not had moneys from Europe and the Regional Fund to help resolve this problem altogether and that we are still only at section 6 of the Coast Protection Act and there are 23 sections in all to be gone through, a laboriously painful procedure which needs immediate updating and rationalising.</P>
    <P>We may use strong words and neither myself nor my two colleagues are mincing words with the Minister this evening.  He has heard it before.  We are accusing him and, through him, the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil Government, of being wilfully negligent in relation to their responsibility to Rosslare and therefore the people of Wexford and to one of the greatest natural assets of this country.</P>

      <P>There should be no need for me to remind Deputies of the necessity in present circumstances to curtail Government expenditure in order to bring the finances of the State under control. Coast protection is just one of the many areas in which the Commissioners of Public Works have been directed by the Government to effect savings but no funds have been allocated for coastal protection in 1988.  The Government decision was to suspend coastal works for 1988 and I want to repeat the word &ldquo;suspend&rdquo;.  Even before my meeting with the public representatives last week I had been considering what options were available to me in coming to some solution to the problem of continued maintenance at Rosslare.  I have been consistently fully briefed on this matter by my party colleagues in the last few months.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of orthodontic treatment has been a considerable cause of concern in the health services for some years past.  In fact competitions held nationally by the <Col N="1408" /> Local Appointments Commission for health boards for positions of consultant orthodontists have been successful only in one instance in recent years.  It is the intention to continue to endeavour to fill posts and in fact some health boards are now sponsoring the training of orthodontists. Discussions are also taking place between my Department and the Dublin Dental Hospital in an endeavour to increase the provision of orthodontic services for eligible patients.</P>
      <P>In the specific case with which the Deputy is concerned I have been informed by the North Eastern Health Board that while the person in question has a serious orthodontic problem he is not a Category I Priority Case.  The health board has stated that there are limitations of the types of orthodontic treatment which it at present can have carried out.  In the circumstances which I have outlined I am sure the Deputy will appreciate the difficulties which the board have in providing orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 15 and 219 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital at Beaumont is one of the biggest in the country and amalgamating two major hospitals and transferring their services to a new site was an extremely <Col N="1409" /> difficult and complex task.  While there have been difficulties, nevertheless the opening of the hospital was a great achievement, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the boards of the three hospitals and the staff concerned for their co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Since it opened the hospital has had the following level of activity: In-patient admissions 4,212, Out-patient attendances 11,508.  This is quite a considerable level of activity by any standards.</P>
    <P>I have paid particular attention to the operation of Beaumont Hospital since it opened for in-patients on 29 November last.  It was appropriate to review the composition of the board and the general arrangements for the management of the hospital once it had been opened. Accordingly, certain changes have been made at board and management level. While the former board had the task of planning for the opening of the hospital, the new board will be concerned with the smooth operation of the various services.</P>
    <P>Problems which have been identified are being rapidly addressed by the hospital authorities.  I will continue to monitor the situation over the coming months to ensure that any difficulties that may arise are dealt with promptly and effectively.</P>

Vacancies arising have been dealt with in accordance with the embargo requirements.  However, the Department have and will be taking on additional work hitherto carried on by statutory agencies, for example, the Health Education Bureau and the National Social Service Board and staff have been and will be redeployed to cope with that work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 55 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 35 cases of AIDS have been reported and there have been 16 deaths. The Government's AIDS strategy in 1988 will identify particular groups for special attention while continuing the information programme aimed at the general <Col N="1411" /> public.  We will continue to provide information to the general public particularly through poster advertising, the National AIDS telephone service and through the AIDS information booklet.</P>
    <P>Sixty per cent of identified HIV positive individuals are IV drug abusers.  This is the group in which the infection appears to be spreading most quickly. It is also the category from which the majority of new cases are coming.  One to one contact with addicts will prove the most effective way of motivating personal behavioural changes.  I have already provided drug agencies with money to enable them to expand their outreach programmes and further substantial funding is being provided this year for major activities, including an outreach pilot project to be run by the Eastern Health Board.  This will include research into the drug culture, with particular emphasis on how intravenous drug abusers are responding to the AIDS threat.</P>
    <P>The priority is to implement the expanded outreach service effectively. The threat to public health which is emerging from the rapid spread of HIV infection among intravenous drug abusers also requires the closest evaluation of other measures, such as needle exchange and methadone maintenance, which might serve to reduce further the serious risks to health.  These will be examined when more information about their validity is available when their value in the context of Ireland's particular drug culture may be assessed.</P>
    <P>The appropriate measures designed to provide information about AIDS to secondary school pupils are under discussion between the Department of Health and the Department of Education at present.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, to meet the needs of pupils leaving school in the present academic year, directors of community care and medical officers of the health boards were asked some months ago to co-operate with local school authorities to ensure that such education is provided to those pupils.</P>

      <P>The Government spent £0.5 million in 1987 on its public information programme.

      <P>asked the Minister for Health in relation to the recent comments made by a person (details supplied) that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin 12 faces a demand for 300 cardiac operations for children each year but because of budgetary and organisational difficulties the hospital will be unable to meet this demand, the steps he proposes to take to improve this situation especially in view of the fact that survival rates for radical surgery in Ireland for children are higher than the British rates for the same operations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26, 190 and 220 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> The child referred to by the Deputies was scheduled for operation on three dates &mdash; 14 December 1987, 18 January 1988 and 1 February 1988.  His admission was cancelled before he left Cork on the first two occasions.  The operation scheduled for 1 February 1988 was cancelled as there was no bed available in the intensive care unit.  The intensive care unit has a complement of eight beds, all of which were occupied on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Crumlin Hospital has said that it will do its utmost to operate on the child on 29 February.  Unfortunately, this can never be guaranteed because of the unpredictability and uncertainty of admissions for heart surgery, where more urgent cases present, they may have to be dealt with ahead of those scheduled. Decisions on priority are a matter for the clinical judgment of the medical consultants at the hospital.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of the demand for heart surgery, Deputies will be aware that waiting lists are, and always have been, a feature of the health services. We, in Ireland, do not differ from other developed countries in this respect.  Waiting lists for elective surgery here are frequently shorter than is the case in other countries.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am concerned about the long waiting lists in certain specialties such as paediatric cardiac surgery and in orthopaedic surgery.  My Department are giving special and urgent consideration to how these waiting lists can be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount spent by his Department to date on the extension to the Mater Hospital (Public) Dublin 7; <Col N="1416" /> when the work was completed; the number of beds it provides; the reason it has not been opened; and the cost of keeping it maintained while closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date £30 million has been spent on the extension to the hospital.  The building was completed and handed over to the Mater Hospital authorities on the 25 April 1986; 350 beds are available in this phase of the overall development.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited resources available it has not been possible to proceed with the opening of the new extension. However, officers of my Department are at present holding discussions with the hospital authorities in the Mater which I would hope will lead to a partial opening of the new wing during 1988.</P>
      <P>The cost of maintaining this new extension to date amounts to £448,000.</P>

      <P>I am circulating in the Official Report a tabular statement giving the information from 1984 to 1987.  Numbers for 1983 are not available.  The total number of student nurses admitted to training in 1984 was 1,060, in 1985, 1,035, in 1986, 1,027, and 720 in 1987.  It is proposed to have an intake of at least 1,126 students for general training in 1988 and at least an intake of 45 for psychiatric training. These will commence training during the year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the Irish Medical Organisation has yet responded to the proposals he made on 7 October 1987 for a new agreement concerning the employment of doctors in the general medical service; and if he will indicate the way in which the present terms of employment of such doctors outlined in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 101 of 22 October 1987 compare with the equivalent terms of doctors working in the National Health Service in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation submitted a memorandum on 14 December 1987 in response to the proposals I had outlined at a meeting with the organisation on 7 October.  The organisation's document and my original proposals are the subject of ongoing negotiations between the parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined in my reply to a parliamentary question on 22 October last, <Col N="1419" /> general practitioners participating in the general medical services scheme are, in the main, remunerated on a &ldquo;fee per item of service&rdquo; basis.  The scheme provides free general practitioner services to some 37 per cent of the population although this percentage varies on a regional basis. The remaining 63 per cent of the population make their own arrangements for the provision of general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>In contrast, the provision of general practitioner services in the United Kingdom differs, both in regard to the scope of eligibility and the terms and conditions under which general practitioners provide services.</P>
    <P>The British NHS provides free general practitioner services to the entire population as of right.  In fact 99 per cent of the population is registered with a general medical practitioner under the scheme. This means that the amount of private practice is negligible.  It follows therefore that practically all British general practitioners have a wholetime commitment to their NHS practices.</P>
    <P>The mode of payment of general practitioners under the British NHS involves a mix of (i) capitation payments (ii) annual allowances (iii) specific allowances and (iv) special service fees.  Currently the capitation payment accounts for about 4 per cent of the general practitioners earnings with the balance comprising allowances and fees.</P>

      <P>There is no crisis in health funding.  I am fully satisfied that with prudent management sufficient funds will be available to meet approved levels of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners were made responsible for the collection of <Col N="1420" /> health contributions from farmers with effect from 6 April 1984.  However, health boards, which had formerly been responsible for the collection from fulltime farmers, retained responsibility for collecting any arrears due from farmers up to that date.</P>
    <P>Health boards are aware of the importance of collecting these arrears which amounted to £5.85 million on 30 September 1987.  The boards are also aware of the measures available to enforce such collection including legal proceedings where appropriate and are making every effort to enforce collection.  I do not see any need to issue special instructions at this stage.</P>

      <P>I am aware that delays are being experienced by patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board. I have been informed by the board that the delays are primarily due to the vacant <Col N="1421" /> post of consultant orthodontist which the board has been unable to fill.  However, the Local Appointments Commission recently re-advertised the post and is in the process of setting up an interview board.  When this post is filled, the waiting time for orthodontic treatment should be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two facets to the question raised by the Deputy.  Firstly, there is the promotion of healthy attitudes to alcohol among young people and, secondly, the enforcement of the law relating to underage drinking which is not, of course, a function of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I believe that health promotion should form the basis of a preventive approach to alcohol-related problems.  The health promotion unit in the Department of Health will be involved this year in the dissemination of information and educational material on substance abuse, including alcohol abuse, in conjunction with the health boards and the Irish National Council on Alcoholism.  In addition the Irish National Council on Alcoholism will shortly be launching a national project aimed at creating a greater public awareness of the use and abuse of alcohol by young people.</P>
      <P>The report of the Study Group on the Psychiatric Services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> recognised that the preventive approach to the overall problem of alcohol abuse would require a commitment to a national policy on alcohol consumption with an integrated multisectoral involvement. This is an issue which I expect will be examined by the recently established Advisory Council on Health Promotion.</P>

      <P>There are a wide range of health and welfare services available to the population generally, including the elderly.  I am satisfied that there is an adequate level of services available generally, though I recognise that there are some problems in relation to the provision of services for the aged.  The overall provision of services for the elderly is currently being examined by a working party on health and welfare services for the elderly.  This examination has involved a comprehensive review of the community, residential hospital and housing services for the elderly and the working part will be making recommendations regarding the future provision and the organisation of these services.  I understand that the working party will be in a position to report to me fairly soon.</P>

      <P>Discussions were held with representatives of the nursing staff and they have been kept informed of developments in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factual position is that I am increasing the rate for those students who entered training last year at £54 per week to £100 per week in respect of their <Col N="1429" /> second year of training.  Furthermore, additional payments will be made for week-end and night duty.  On the basis of these rates it is possible to increase the intake in 1988 by 400 students in the general nursing area.  Overall it is proposed to recruit 1,126 students for general nursing in 1988 as against a figure of 720 recruited in 1987.  The intake of students to the other disciplines&mdash;mental handicap, midwifery and sick children's nurse training &mdash; are being maintained at existing levels while the intake in the psychiatric area will increase slightly.</P>
    <P>Within the limited financial resources available to me for training purposes I have endeavoured to make training available, within reason, to as many young people as possible in 1988.  I am satisfied that this measure is not in conflict with the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>VHI insurance schemes, Plans D and E, are specifically designed for those VHI members who wish to avail of services at the Mater Private Hospital or the Blackrock Clinic.  These two plans are required by me to be self-financing in as far as this is practicable.  VHI therefore only provide cover for treatment in these hospitals to the extent that is warranted by the flow of subscriptions from members of Plans D and E.  Consequently, there is no question of these <Col N="1432" /> hospitals jeopardising the survival of VHI.</P>
      <P>I could not accept that the VHI are developing a two-tier health care system.

      <P>Cases of alleged child abuse, including child sexual abuse, reported to health boards are dealt with in accordance with the revised Child Abuse Guidelines issued by my Department some months ago.  Assessment of cases of alleged child sexual abuse involves an investigation by a multidisciplinary team in each community care area, with support from specialist services, including child psychiatric, paediatric and gynaecology services, as appropriate.  As the investigation process commences as soon as cases are reported to the health boards, the boards do not have waiting lists.</P>

Patients with statutory entitlement to medical services are not charged for this treatment and I am unaware of any other costs to the parents of these children.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed <Col N="1438" /> to the earliest possible ratification of the United Nations Covenants.  In accordance with the practice of successive Governments of ensuring that our domestic legislation is in conformity with an international convention before proceeding to its ratification, a careful examination of our domestic legislation was undertaken.  That examination carried out in the committee established under the chairmanship of the Attorney General to review the situation with regard to the ratification by Ireland of various international instruments in the field of human rights, has now been completed. I am hopeful that it will be possible within a reasonably short period of time to bring forward the necessary legislation, including legislation on the advocacy of racial hatred, which will enable the ratification of the two UN Covenants to proceed.</P>

      <P>I understand that holders of US immigrant visas including the so-called Donnelly visas are advised by the US authorities to apply for green cards, also known as alien registration cards, on their <Col N="1439" /> arrival in the US.  Such applications take on average about six to eight weeks to process from the date of application. Applications are dealt with in strict order of receipt.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, applicants have their passport endorsed so that they can reside and work in the US.  This also entitles them to a social security number and to travel abroad.  Such endorsements have a validity of three months.  In the exceptional cases where the delay exceeds three months, the INS renew the endorsement to stay on the applicant's passport.</P>
      <P>Our missions in the US receive occasional queries on the subject.  They advise callers of the procedure to be followed and suggest that if green cards are not received before the three month deadline is reached the applicant should reapply in person to the INS.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent expressions of concern about the plight of members of religious groups, such as Baptists and Pentecostalists, in the Soviet Union.  Information available to me suggests that their treatment by the Soviet authorities is contrary to the human rights provisions of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and other international commitments entered into by the Soviet Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I continue to believe the CSCE is the most appropriate forum in which to raise situations or cases of non-respect for human rights, including the right of freedom of religion, arising in other participating States.  Irish delegations to <Col N="1440" /> CSCE meetings, including the current Follow-Up meeting in Vienna, have voiced, and will continue to voice, our concern at human rights violations by the Soviet Union as well as other European countries.  It is our hope that these repeated public expressions of concern by ourselves and our partners in the Twelve may effect a change in the treatment by the Soviet and Eastern European authorities of religious groups in these countries, including the Baptists and Pentecostalists in the Soviet Union.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in addition to a retirement pension, the taxpayer is in receipt of a contributory old age pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  However, the contributory old age pension is paid gross and it is standard practice to collect the tax attributable to it by making an appropriate restriction of the tax-free allowances to be set against the retirement pension for the purpose of calculating the tax to be deducted under PAYE from that pension.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax-free allowances was issued to the taxpayer on 7 September 1987.  The correct amount of tax by reference to that certificate is currently being deducted from the taxpayer's retirement pension.  The taxpayer's liability will be subject to review after 5 April next.</P>

      <P>A programme outlining the Government's intentions in relation to the spending of the money to which the Deputy refers was approved by the Commission of the European Communities at the end of 1987.  The money will be devoted to extending the natural gas grid to the Border area and to the development of <Col N="1445" /> tourism in the area.  Under the heading of tourism, it is possible to aid the construction or modernisation of minor roads giving access to tourist areas, and some £3 million in ERDF assistance has been provisionally allocated for this purpose. As the programme deals with the Border area as a whole, it is not possible at this stage to specify how much any particular county will receive in respect of roads.  The other aspects of roads raised by the Deputy are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the expected yield of a 5 per cent social security tax of corporate profits in a full financial year, as recommended by the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tentatively estimated that a 5 per cent social security tax would yield £85 million in a full year.  This assumes that the tax would be levied on the taxable profits of all companies prior to the deduction of capital allowances.  If companies benefiting from &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; relief and export sales relief were excluded from the charge, the yield would be about £70 million in a full year.  However, if the introduction of this measure was accompanied by the removal of the employer's PRSI contribution for corporate employers, these Exchequer gains would become losses.  On the basis of available figures, it is not possible to quantify these losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The above calculations are based on figures for taxable profits arising under the current tax regime.  The Commission on Taxation recommended major changes in the corporation tax, income tax and social insurance structures.  The introduction of a 5 per cent social security tax on corporate profits was recommended as part of this restructuring.  The Revenue Commissioners estimated that for the tax year 1983-84 the implementation of the commission's corporation tax reforms (including the replacement of employers' PRSI by a social security <Col N="1446" /> tax on corporate profits) would prove costly to the Exchequer &mdash; a sum of the order of £200 million would have to be foregone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards (a) and (b), the information requested by the Deputy, in so far as it is available, is provided in relation to the current system of value-added tax.  It is estimated that the yield from the application of a 1 per cent rate to the current VAT base (including the zero base) would be £110 million in the full year 1988.</P>
      <P>Because of the manner in which VAT returns are completed, separate figures in respect of sales of goods and sales of services cannot be given.</P>
      <P>As regards (c) statistics are not available which would enable the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the investment income of companies to be provided.

      <P>The base for the turnover tax in respect of the last full financial year in which it was in operation, that is the year ended 31 March 1972, is broadly estimated at £6,000 million, in current financial terms. At a rate of 2½ per cent the annual yield therefrom would be about £150 million and at a rate of 5 per cent (that is the rate which applied in the above-mentioned year) about £300 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">

      <P>Registered farmers had a VAT liability of £2.6 million VAT in 1985, £3.2 million in 1986, and £4.1 million in 1987 in respect of sales of goods and services. However, as they deducted respectively, £6.5 million, £7.8 million and £9.3 million in respect of VAT incurred on purchases, the net position was that they were repaid by the Revenue Commissioners £3.9 million in 1985, £4.6 million in 1986 and £5.2 million in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to unregistered farmers no VAT liability as such arises.

    <P>(iii)  Having regard to the fact that implementation of the decentralisation programme does not necessarily entail, in the first instance, vacation of entire buildings or indeed of defined areas within buildings, it is not possible at this stage to determine the amount and location of State accommodation in Dublin which will become vacant as a result of the programme.  The extent and location of the accommodation to be vacated and of future office requirements in Dublin is being assessed by the Commissioners of Public Works in conjunction with the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The assessment is being made with a view to achieving the optimum use of space and the maximum savings in rent.</P>

      <P>The detailed allocation of Garda manpower and other resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is proposed to fill a vacancy for an inspector at Tallaght station on 18 February.  The manpower and other resources allocated there are being kept under continuing review in the light of overall resources and other demands on Garda services and extra manpower will be assigned there as circumstances permit. Apart from the resources at the local station, there is a substantial backup service available to the Tallaght area from the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters which can be called on as the need arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are aware of the particular concerns expressed by the representatives of the neighbourhood watch scheme for the Bancroft and adjacent areas and these are being taken into <Col N="1454" /> account in the policing arrangements for the area in question.  I would make the point that it is not the practice to allocate a specific proportion of Garda resources in any area to the neighbourhood watch scheme.  Neighbourhood watch is essentially a crime prevention programme which enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>As part of the redevelopment new lighting was installed, a toilet and shower installed and new cell doors (fabricated at the prison by prison staff and prisoners) were fitted.  A heating pipe had also to be diverted.  The work in question was carried out by prison trades staff as part of their normal duty.  Materials for the work cost in the region of £6,000.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that loitering has become a serious problem in many parts of Dublin; that it is a source of great annoyance to many people especially those whose home or business is adjacent to where loitering takes place; that loitering is very frequently a prelude to a more serious offence; if, in the circumstances he will outline the Garda policy in relation to prosecuting for loitering; if he intends to introduce more severe penalties for loitering; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 15 of 10 December 1987 in which I drew attention to the fact that the statutory offence of loitering with intent to commit a felony has been held to be inconsistent with the Constitution. I also indicated in that reply that the report of the Law Reform Commission on Vagrancy and Related Offences includes a recommendation to the effect that no new general loitering with intent offence should be enacted.  This report is being examined in my Department as expeditiously as resources permit and any legislative proposals which may arise from it will be announced in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that, while they are aware that loitering can be a source of annoyance and, in some cases, a prelude to the commission of an offence, it is not thought to be a serious problem in that it can be contained by diligent Garda patrolling. The Garda take appropriate action, including the institution of criminal proceedings, where a breach of the peace or other such offence is detected.</P>

The legislation also provides that it is unlawful for any person to employ an unlicensed haulier.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main social welfare payments for widows are: (i) widow's contributory pension, entitlement to which is subject to certain contribution conditions, which may be satisfied on the deceased husband's or on the widow's own insurance, and (ii) widow's non-contributory pension, entitlement to which is subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>A widow pensioner may also be entitled to an allowance under the free fuel scheme or, if over 66 years of age, to free electricity allowance, free television licence, free telephone rental and free travel, subject to the conditions for entitlement under these schemes.</P>
      <P>Where the deceased husband was, immediately before his death, in receipt of a social welfare payment which included an increase in respect of his wife, the payment continues to be made to the widow for up to six weeks after his death. Any widow's pension, when it comes into payment, is offset against this.</P>
      <P>Where the widow would, at the date of her husband's death, have been entitled to treatment benefits under the social insurance system as his dependant, she retains that entitlement for as long as he would have remained qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to widow's contributory pension under the social insurance system is not affected by any other income or earnings which the widow may have. Where the widow is herself working and insured under the system she is not required to pay the employee's share of <Col N="1474" /> the PRSI contribution but she can establish an entitlement to benefits and pensions under the system.  However, as a general rule she would not qualify for social insurance weekly payments for as long as she is in receipt of widow's pension. The exception to this is that where she becomes unemployed she can qualify for half-rate unemployment benefit in addition to her pension.  From 1 January 1988 new widow pensioners are no longer entitled to half rate disability benefit in addition to their pension.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for a social welfare widows pension does not confer automatic entitlement to services operated by other Government Departments, which are subject to separate rules and conditions of eligibility.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals to alter the rate of contribution payable by an employer in respect of a widow employee or to restore entitlement to half rate disability benefit in the case of widow pension recipients who commenced claiming disability benefit on or after 1 January 1988.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 120 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to age 18 years.</P>
      <P>However, special arrangements apply in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives or unmarried mothers who are receiving a social welfare pension or allowance.  In such cases increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years if they are in full time education.  This extension of the age limit was introduced in recognition of the special needs of widows and other one-parent families.  There are no proposals at present to apply the extension to other social welfare payments.  Assistance towards the cost of third level education is, however, provided through the grants scheme operated by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>It is a condition for entitlement to unemployment assistance that a person must be available for work.  Full time attendance at a course of education is not consistent with being available for work and a person in this situation would not be entitled to umemployment assistance under existing legislation.  There are no proposals at present to change the legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the extent to which the cost of purchasing a tractor or other farm machinery, paying for such machinery by hire purchase, depreciation of such machinery, cost of running and repairing and insuring such machinery constitute expenses allowable in a farmer's claim for unemployment assistance; the criteria used in arriving at the decision whether or not the various expenses are allowable; and the percentage of the expenses allowable.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 121 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>Firstly in relation to car expenses the position is that the cost of purchasing a car, whether it is purchased outright or by way of hire purchase agreement, is not allowed as an expense in assessing the means of farmers for unemployment assistance purposes.  Neither is the cost of repairing a car taken into account. However, when assessing the means of a farmer, account is taken of motor car expenses necessarily incurred in connection with the running of the farm. There is no set formula used for calculating the amount of motor expenses allowable.  Each case is dealt with on its merits and the amount allowable depends on the extent to which the car is used in the farming enterprise.</P>
      <P>With regard to tractors and other farm machinery, the position is that if the tractor or other item of farm machinery is purchased outright, the capital cost is not allowed as an expense for unemployment assistance purposes but allowance for depreciation relative to usage is made in such cases.  Where the purchase is made by way of a hire purchase or leasing arrangement the full amount of the repayments due under such agreement is allowed in the means assessment.  Operational costs, including the cost of insurance and repairs, in respect of tractors or farm machinery are also allowed as an expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In examining the expenses claimed in <Col N="1477" /> respect of motor car and farm machinery, including tractors, social welfare officers have general regard to the results of farm surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais. These surveys estimate the total expenditure on these items as a percentage of the gross output of the farm.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority, who are the body responsible for industrial development in the Dublin inner city area, have assured me that they are actively promoting the area for suitable industrial projects.</P>
      <P>The IDA have nearly 500,000 sq. ft. of factory space at a number of locations in the inner city.  These include enterprise centres at Gloucester Place-Gardiner Street, Pearse Street and East Wall Road, and small industry units at Prussia Street and in the Liberties, in which over 1,000 people are employed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the IDA maintain close contact with community groups and workers' co-operatives in the inner city and a senior IDA Executive co-ordinates this activity.  Groups who wish to develop their own manufacturing enterprises are actively encouraged and the full range of incentives are made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the IDA were entrusted by the Government with responsibility for marketing the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Dock site, 18 projects, with a job potential in excess of 800, have been approved by the IDA and passed for certification to the Minister for Finance.  As stated in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, &ldquo;the International Financial Services Centre at the Custom House Docks is now estimated <Col N="1484" /> to generate some 7,500 jobs over the next 3-4 years.&rdquo;  While this naturally will take some time to realise in practice, the momentum behind the project and the enthusiasm with which the incentive package has been received internationally gives every reason for confidence. Furthermore it is expected that during the construction phase of the centre at least 2,000 jobs will be created. I have been assured by the IDA that they will continue in their efforts to promote industrial development in the Dublin inner city area.</P>

      <P>In pursuit of the objective of diversifying energy sources and utilising domestic <Col N="1486" /> resources, my Department is favourably disposed towards proposals to use domestic refuse and other waste for the generation of heat and electricity where it is economic to do so.  The Department itself has not carried out assessments of waste incineration as such assessments must take account of particular situations. However it is aware that a number of local authorities and the ESB have had feasibility studies of waste incineration and district heating carried out some years ago.  The economics of such schemes would have been adversely affected by the fall in oil and other fuel prices.  The environmental aspects of any specific proposals are a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Marine if his attention has been drawn to any proposals by the British Government to privatise air-sea rescue operations; if he has considered the potential consequences particularly with <Col N="1489" /> regard to the extensive and isolated coastline of western Ireland; if he has had any discussions with his British counterpart about this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the British Government are currently studying a proposal from a private helicopter company under which the UK military search and rescue service would be put out to civilian contract and that this proposal is being considered by the UK Government in the context of a review of the deployment of UK search and rescue helicopters generally.  I understand that privatisation of services as such is not under consideration, rather the proposal in question is for a contracting out of certain services.  This, of course, is purely an internal matter for the British Government, and I am satisfied that, should their eventual decision have implications for Irish search and rescue operations, there will be ample opportunity to discuss such implications with the UK authorities with a view to any necessary revision of existing arrangements.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the Air Corps Dauphin helicopters will be fully operational on a 24 hour basis by the end of 1988 and this will greatly reduce the dependence of the UK services.</P>

      <P>Extensive monitoring of the waters in Dublin Bay is carried out by the local authorities and by the Eastern Health Board.  I am advised that the health board has recently confirmed its view, as given on numerous previous occasions, that the waters do not constitute a danger to public health.  The satisfactory condition of the bay is confirmed by the survey and monitoring programme initiated in June, 1986, by An Foras Forbartha as part of the preparation of a water quality management plan for the bay.  This programme is continuing.</P>

      <P>I understand that, in their road works programme for 1988, Donegal County Council have made provision for restoration work on this bridge.  As the bridge is located on a county road, the appropriate source of State road grant assistance towards the cost of the proposed work is the block grant which, in the case of Donegal County Council, amounts of £1.04 million this year.  Subject to general guidelines issued by my Department, the distribution of the block grant to eligible works is a matter for determination by the local authority.</P>

      <P>The provisions available for road grants during 1988 have been fully allocated and there are no other sources of finance available to me from which additional grants could now be made. Primary responsibility for the networks of main and county roads, including the assessment of the need for improvement and maintainance works on them, rests with the local authorities.  The extent and nature of the traffic using roads in an area are factors which influence the need for maintenance and improvement works on them and would be reflected in the results of assessments carried out by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is aware of the general condition of the networks of main and county roads throughout the country as a result of ongoing contact with local authorities as well as submissions received from individual authorities, including Kildare County Council, and representative bodies such as the County and City Engineers' Association. Detailed information has been received from all county councils, in response to a departmental circular issued in May 1987, about the condition of the network of county roads together with estimates of the level of investment required to remedy deficiencies in the network.  This information is being considered in the context of the preparation of a blueprint for road development which I intend to publish within the next few months.  The blueprint will address the question of the needs of the entire public road network in the long term.  It will also address the question of the funding of the investment required from State, local authority and private sector resources as well as the <Col N="1508" /> scope for assistance from EC sources of finance.</P>
    <P>Under existing arrangements, the cost of works on main and county roads falls to be financed by a combination of State road grants and local resources.  The relevant State grants are the block grant, county road strengthening grant and special improvement grants.  In the case of Kildare County Council, the grants allocated under these headings in 1988 total £1.204 million which is 18 per cent greater than the amount paid under the corresponding grants in 1987.  I am satisfied that the local authority has received its fair share of the overall grants under these headings.  The level of expenditure from local resouces is a matter for determination by the local authority.</P>

The response to my request has been satisfactory.  I understand from the local authorities that task forces are already in operation in the majority of counties and in most of the remaining counties arrangements are in hand which will ensure that a significant number of farms are surveyed before the silage making season.  The task forces will be reporting to the local authorities as the statutory bodies responsible for pollution control.  It is for these authorities to <Col N="1509" /> determine what remedial measures are required to deal with any sources of pollution identified in the reports on individual farms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206, 207 and 208 together.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of psychiatric services in County Roscommon is being undertaken in accordance with plans drawn up by the Western Health Board. These plans conform with the recommendations of the report &mdash; Planning for the Future &mdash; which provided guidelines for the development of psychiatric services. The discharge policy in St. Patrick's is similar to that prevailing in several other hospitals throughout the country and is in accord with national policy.</P>
      <P>I have seen press reports of allegations regarding shortcomings in several aspects of the psychiatric service in County Roscommon.  In so far as individual events can be identified the comments are at best unhelpful and at times untrue. They can do little except cause worry to patients, ex-patients and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing which is provided for former long-stay patients from St. Patrick's are of good standard with the general range <Col N="1519" /> of modern conveniences including central heating.  No investigation is taking place or proposed into the discharge policy in relation to St. Patrick's Hospital.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric facilities have not yet been provided at the County Hospital, Roscommon.  The question of admitting psychiatric patients there does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>No patient has died as a result of discharge from St. Patrick's.  No patient has been refused admission.  In recent months one patient died in the hospital and one former patient died at home in circumstances which justified referring the cases to the coroner.  Inquests are expected to be held in both cases.  They are also being investigated separately by the inspector of mental hospitals.</P>

This money is being allocated for the implementation of resocialisation programmes designed to assist in the transfer of patients from institutional to community based services. The objective is to ensure that such persons will, through a programme of resocialisation, be in a position to meet the challenge of living independently within their own community.  The programme will necessitate the purchase of houses, provision of day nursing facilities, day care centres and the employment of houseparents to encourage independent attitudes and behaviour.
