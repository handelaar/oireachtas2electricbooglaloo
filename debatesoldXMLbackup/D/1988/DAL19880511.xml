      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 52, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(15) The provisions of this section will apply to the 1988-89 tax year only, and will not be renewed in the 1989 Finance Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 49 has given rise to a number of concerns, and this amendment is moved with a view to meeting one of these. When the Minister announced the proposed levy on pension funds in his budgetary speech, it was framed in a different manner from the way in which it eventually ended up in the Finance Bill. I welcome the change from the proposals on budget day to the proposals now incorporated in section 49, but there are still major difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to explore the area first, and see how we move when we hear the Minister's reply.  As I understand it now, pension funds will be subject to a levy which will be based on the assets of the pension fund with certain deductions allowable on 1 January 1988.  It has been announced that there will be an imputed income of 9 per cent, or realised capital gains on both, and that then a 6 per cent levy will apply.  That is a rather complex formula for finding out what level of tax any particular pension fund will be subjected to.  Am I right in believing now that the calculation is 0.54 of the asset value of the pension fund on 1 January and that then pensions to be paid in 1988 will be deducted from that and that there is a lower limit of £5,000 &mdash; if the answer <Col N="967" /> to the sum is £5,000 or less, that low levy will apply?  Could it be confirmed that this is the procedure?</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like the Minister to do the reverse arithmetic for the benefit of the House.  Starting with the £5,000 exemption limit, could he work back up the figures and indicate what level of assets the pension fund would have before it would be exempt?  What is the Minister's intention with the £5,000 limit?  On the face of it, it seems that smaller pension funds will be totally exempt; certainly, pension funds with about £1 million of an asset base would seem to be exempt.  However, I should like the Minister to give far more detail than he has already given.  I think we should spend some time on this section, because the proposal in the section is not the one made on budget day.  It is very different now.</P>
    <P>With regard to my amendment, the Minister gave assurance on budget day that this was a once-off measure.  Commitments to levies being once-off are frequently made.  There was a commitment that the bank levy would be a once-off levy.  I read somewhere that income tax was introduced as a once-off measure to fight the Napoleonic Wars.  Does once-off mean once off in the traditional sense, once off but it will be renewed next year? The Minister made a commitment in his budget speech that this would be once off but the proposal has changed now.  I understood from him on Second Stage of the Finance Bill that he was reconfirming the commitment that this would be once off.  My amendment seeks to put that provision into the text of the section by way of an additional subsection, that the provisions of the section will apply to the tax year 1988-89 only and that they will not be renewed in the 1989 Finance Bill.  This is reasonable.  I know that it is not foolproof.  Anything of this nature that is put in by the House can be taken out next year by the House.  It does not prevent the Minister from renewing the levy, but it makes it slightly more difficult. It is a far firmer commitment that <Col N="968" /> this levy will be once off than a commitment by the Minister on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>There are very serious implications for pension funds in the proposal as modified in the section from the original proposal of the budget.  Any of the literature that deals with pension funds would suggest that one either taxes contributions on the way into the pension fund, or taxes pensions on the way out of the pension fund, but that while the funds are <i>in situ</i> in the pension fund and are subject to income gains and capital gains which are realised, the fund should be sacrosanct. Pension funds have such a long lead-in time and the actuarial assessment has to be done over such a long period that it is not only unfair but downright dangerous, not only to the pension fund but to the interests of the pension holders, to tax a pension in the manner suggested.</P>
    <P>There are many pension funds.  Some are quite large.  There are very significant funds in the country.  Some of the State companies, for example, have very large pension funds and a very large asset base and others are quite small.  Some funds are very immature.  The effects of this proposal will not be spread evenly, and information which has been provided to all of us in the House would suggest that some pension funds will find it quite difficult to meet their commitments as a result of this imposition.</P>
    <P>I am extremely unhappy about the whole concept of the levy on pension funds.  If there is any suggestion that this is not a once-off proposal and if we do not get a firm commitment that this is a once-off proposal it is completely unacceptable. There are things we have to swallow against a background of adverse financial conditions which in normal circumstances we would not agree with at all.  The proposal regarding pension funds is in that area and I am very uneasy about it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into the scare politics of pension funds becoming insolvent because obviously the effects of this will vary from fund to fund, but it would be of benefit to the House if the Minister could provide information on the effects <Col N="969" /> of this imposition on a range of pension funds, some large some small and some semi-State funds, for instance, the pension funds of Aer Lingus of the airline pilots, the ESB and funds of that nature. They may not be driven into insolvency, and probably will not be by the imposition of this levy for one year but many of the funds now have actuarial assessments done on the basis that they will be able to pay pensions to their contributors and they are extremely worried they will not be able to maintain index-linked pensions for their members who are on pension. Even quite large funds have actuarial projections made on the basis of being able to provide for their members and pay them pensions of half or two thirds of salary as the case may be.  They are extremely worried and have in their actuarial assessments shown that they can only guarantee somewhere between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the projected cost of living increases.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the real value of pensions will be very difficult and obviously an imposition such as this makes it even more difficult.  If we look at it against the background of what is happening to the profile of our population at the moment things can become quite scary.  We have declining numbers at work, declining numbers of people in the productive age groups, an increasing dependency ratio and lower numbers providing the funds which will subsequently pay the pensions of the others.</P>
    <P>There are ways in which one could make a quite frightening case on the prospects for pensioners, even over a 12 to 15-year time scale.  I do not want to go down that road either, but there are real concerns which have not been met by the modification of the budget day proposal and by the substitution of section 49 for that proposal.  It is certainly a move in the right direction but a move which should be taken very reluctantly indeed. I have some other things to say but I would like to hear the Minister's reply before I proceed further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's <Col N="970" /> amendment has certainly been the beneficiary of a good deal of latitude from the Chair because it is a most unconstitutional proposition that this House should seek in one year to bind its successors in another Finance Bill.  Doubtless the amendment will not be pressed to its ultimate conclusion because it seems strange to me that in one Bill we should attempt to bind perhaps our successors as there may be an election between now and the time somebody has to grapple with Deputy Noonan's suggestion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps skittles rather than poker.  In relation to the pension funds levy, this is money which is available in large amounts and which is identifiable both as a capital sum and as a source of income flow.  In those circumstances it was predictable that someone would suggest that it should be made <Col N="971" /> the subject of a special tax.  It is particularly predictable that the impetus for such a tax should come in the last analysis from the public service, because they are in the happy position of having by law as a legal entitlement unfunded index-linked pensions which private people could not with all the money in the world purchase.  There is no way in which a private sector person could buy an unfunded pension equivalent to a certain fraction of his income, no matter what happened and that is what the public service have.</P>
      <P>The capital sums we see in these pension funds, tempting as they are in the fiscal larder, as targets for the hungry fingers of the Exchequer, seem to represent nothing but accumulated saving and accumulated deprivation of spending power on the part of those who contributed to those funds.  The moneys in the last analysis, because they are held inevitably in trusts, must be applied for certain purposes and it is usually payment of pensions to the beneficiaries of those trusts.  That is why the moneys are accumulated and invested in pension funds to provide a mutual form of insurance against a particular contingency, and that is payment of a pension, and also to provide that there should be sufficient funds to pay a contingency which, by definition, is postponed and in some circumstances is unpredictable.</P>
      <P>It is possible on an actuarial basis to decide whether any pension fund at any given time is solvent or insolvent.  Actuarial calculations as Deputy Noonan hinted at, involve presuppositions of longevity of the people who will be the recipients of pensions and in this day and age it is certainly the case that with greater longevity there will, as a general rule of thumb, be a greater and greater draw on those pension funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Minister's levy, I can see that the proposal he is now putting up is a substantial improvement on the original proposal and I can see that to charge a levy of six hundredths of nine hundredths of the capital value of a fund <Col N="972" /> is itself not something which will dramatically change the status or the solvency of any pension fund.  I see, too, that the exemption of the first £5,000 of levy payable under this measure, coupled with the subtraction of pensions actually paid during the year, means that where there would be an instant cash flow problem the Minister has gone a long way towards obviating that difficulty.  What I do not see, and this is where I differ in principle with the Minister, is how in logic he can say that one can subtract pensions paid out now from the amount of money one would have to pay by way of levy and that because those liabilities accrue in the given year they can be taken into account in reducing the liability of this pension fund to this levy, but that future and equally predictable and equally certain liabilities cannot be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The fundamental flaw of this measure is that, even in its own terms and even assuming in principle that it is right to put a levy on pension funds, it does not distinguish between funds which are underfunded with regard to their potential liabilities in the long run and those which are overfunded.  It does not distinguish between the healthy fund and the unhealthy fund.  It imputes to all funds a certain 9 per cent return and provides in respect of all funds over a certain size a 6 per cent levy on that imputed income but it seems to me that no effort has been made to take into account one of Adam Smith's great canons of taxation which is the ability to pay.  In my view ability to pay in relation to pension funds can only be decided on in respect of their present solvency.  When I say their present solvency I mean their present capacity to meet targets today which will put them on line to pay their liabilities in the future.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with this levy is that it totally disregards the fact that one pension fund may be in a very healthy position and able to sustain the amount of the levy without difficulty, whereas another pension fund may already be insolvent and under-funded.  Yet that fund is charged with an equal levy and is made to haemorrhage a little bit more and to <Col N="973" /> become a little bit more insolvent without regard to the fact that it cannot deliver on the trusts for which it was established.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is a once off levy and that it is not intended to reproduce it. The Minister in an aside assured us that that would be the case.  If it is a fair levy and a fair system, I cannot see why it should not be reimposed next year.  If it is something which people can stand over in principle and say that it is fair taxation, I cannot see why, taking one thing with another, it should not be a permanent part of our tax system.  I am not advocating that it should be a permanent part of the system but what I am saying is that it is being presented as a temporary measure and its temporary nature is being put forward as an excuse to explain away its unfairness and the lack of principle and philosophy behind it.  It seems that, come the next Finance Bill when it is reimposed, we will be told it is virtually part of the furniture; it is dog-eared with use; it is accepted; nobody has whimpered about it; it is easy money and there is no clamour to get rid of it.  If we were to be realistic and honest, politically, we would admit that that is by far the most likely thing to occur.</P>
    <P>I will reduce my comments on Deputy Noonan's amendment to this.  First of all, for technical reasons this House cannot possibly purport to bind how future legislation can or cannot be enacted and, secondly, the purpose of this amendment is to disguise a failure to oppose something in principle.  The principal objection which I have is that these funds are not available for taxation in many cases because they are already inadequate to meet the trusts for which they were established and that this measure in no way distinguishes between funds which are capable of meeting their liabilities and those which are not.  I can also see the obverse side of the coin.  People may ask; why tax more aggressively a fund which has been well managed and well run while, at the same time, giving a tax subsidy to pension funds which are under-funded due to the culpable neglect of those who have established them and managed them?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> What is wrong and unfair with this pension fund is that it does not address itself to the real issue of ability to pay.  It flies in the face of the purpose for which these pension funds were established.  As a society we said to employees that we would give them an incentive to put moneys away to provide for old age pensions and the public service were told that they need not bother because we would give them unfunded pensions and that we would take that into account in their wages.  I do not believe that very much and possibly that is the fiction of their salary structure but we the ordinary Joe Soaps in society were told that we must make provision for our old age and that if we could make provision for our old age we would be encouraged to do so and the mechanism which was given to us in order to do this was pension trust funds.</P>
    <P>The moneys which come in to a pension trustee are not automatically benefits to the potential beneficiaries of the trust because, first of all, their interest is only contingent and, secondly, it may well be that even after aggregating all the income in a particular fund it is still insufficient to meet the obligations under the trust deed.  Therefore, from that point of view, no effort has been made to distinguish between those funds which can bear this levy because they are doing well and those which cannot because they are already off the tracks and getting more and more incapable of discharging the liabilities which they were established to meet.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to indicate in relation to this measure why he feels he should have a uniform rate which would make no distinction between funds which are on target and those which are off target, between those which are solvent and those which, in the last analysis, are becoming insolvent.  I would also like him to indicate why in those circumstances it is right to tax such funds while at the same time continuing to agree to pay to the public service unfunded pensions, guaranteed inflation proof, related to their salaries not only at the date of their retirement but also of their successors after they retire.  I would further like the <Col N="975" /> Minister to indicate how he can justify a pension fund levy of this kind which is selective in one sense in that it takes out one group from society who have done something to meet their own social obligations and disregards others who are in a better position and who have pensions which money cannot buy.  I would also like him to tell us why in the formulation of this levy he cannot make a solid distinction not merely on the basis of present outgoings on pension payments but on future outgoings relative to the capital value of the pension fund.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that Deputy McDowell does not stick to the procedures of the House.  The same happened all day yesterday.  At present we are speaking to an amendment to the section.  We are opposed to this section and I intend to give the reasons why we oppose this section when we come to deal with the section.  Deputy McDowell dealt mainly with the section and made only a few references to the amendment.  He made the point that it was ridiculous to put down this amendment but I think, if accepted, it would be an improvement on the section.  Despite the guarantees which have been given by the Minister if there is nothing in the Bill it will not mean anything.  Deputy McDowell missed the point.  If such an amendment was not put down, the levy would continue on under this Finance Bill and would not need to be referred to in next year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The section proposes that the levy should last for one year only.  People involved in pension funds and a number of trade unionists have made contact with me to make the point that, if the Minister cannot be persuaded to drop the levy, I should try at least to ensure that it will be a once-off levy and I promised that I would try.  Deputy Noonan's amendment offers the best way as far as I can see of going about that and I hope Deputy Noonan is also opposed to the section.  I certainly am opposed to the section and I would like to see this amendment accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions contained in this section <Col N="976" /> would apply only in the 1988-89 tax year and would not be renewed in the 1989 Finance Bill.  A Minister for Finance can bring forward anything he likes in a new budget or Finance Bill but if this amendment were accepted it would be a marker that this tax would not automatically be continued and everybody involved in pension funds and trade unionists would know that this levy would cease at the commencement of the 1989-90 tax year and would only reappear if the Minister for Finance decided to reintroduce it.  I think that would certainly be an advance on the present position and for that reason I support the amendment.  I will speak on the reasons I oppose this pension levy when we come to deal with the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

      <P>I wish to deal with the amendment first and then to try to cover the many important points that have been raised, particularly by Deputy Noonan, who asked a number of questions on the section.  I am sure others will have more questions to ask after I have given out more information.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that the 6 per cent levy on pension funds provided for in section 49 of the Bill shall be for one year only and that the Government will be statutorily barred from renewing it.  Section 49 imposes the levy for one year only and subsection (3) expressly provides that: &ldquo;For the year 1988, there shall be charged,... a levy... at the rate of 6 per cent&rdquo;.  I will repeat that subsection (3) states: &ldquo;For the year 1988&rdquo;.  To repeat the levy a provision would be required in another Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated on a number of occasions &mdash; and I repeat &mdash; that this is a once-off levy.  I am advised by the parliamentary draftsman that this amendment is unnecessary and inappropriate. It is unnecessary because, as I have stated, this is a once-off levy and the section will be void next year.  It is inappropriate and of no practical value because, neither the Dáil nor the Minister can be bound in this way as regards the future.  If the amendment were passed <Col N="977" />&mdash; and I think Deputy Noonan referred to this point in the course of his remarks &mdash; it could be overturned by the Dáil next year in the Finance Bill.  This Dáil cannot bind either itself or a future Dáil to future legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not mind whether we continue the debate on the amendment and deal with the amendment first, but if Members prefer I will deal with the questions that were raised on the section.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is drafted by the parliamentary draftsman along the lines of the draft of the bank levy.  What worries me is that all the Minister has to do next year is to say that &ldquo;section 49 of the Finance Act, 1988 be amended as follows, to delete the year 1988 and substitute the year 1989,&rdquo; and <Col N="978" /> here we go again, and around we go.  The type of amendment where you substitute one year for another is so simple that it provides very little barrier to a Minister who is interested in continuing the revenue flow that comes from this levy.  I would like something firmer in the section.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point that this House is not able to handcuff either itself or its successors, or this Minister or successive Ministers, but it would make it more difficult for a Minister to come into the House and simply change the date so that the levy would run again during the next financial year.  The Minister would have to come in and delete a subsection.  There could be a fairly serious debate on the issue.  Now, the mechanism as drafted for renewing the levy is so simple that I am afraid it will become part of the furniture, just like the bank levy, and the year 1988 will be dropped and substituted by 1989.</P>
      <P>Before I proceed further on this issue, I have one question which the Minister might answer.  Is the expected yield from the levy the same as announced in the budget?  Perhaps the Minister would refresh our memories on the expected yield from the levy.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Noonan brings the matter to a vote which he is obviously intending to do, may I make a point in regard to the procedure? Deputy Noonan acknowledges that the amendment has no effect except to make it slightly more embarrassing for a subsequent Minister for Finance to prolong this levy.  That is what he is about.  I wonder whether it is within the power of this House and as a matter of order is it <Col N="979" /> proper for this House to purport to decide in one Act what a subsequent Act may do.  In my submission it is entirely nugatory and it is out of order as an amendment.</P>
      <P>The reason that I am making this point is that it is wrong for this Legislature and it is unconstitutional in every respect for this Legislature to attempt to tell the people that it is enacting laws today which tells a subsequent Legislature what it can or cannot do.  While to some extent it is a matter of mirrors and optics, and I accept that is the case, and its purpose is to make it more embarrassing for a Minister to renew the levy, it is wrong in principle for one Dáil to even purport to tell its successors what they may or may not do.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes to lay down as a point of law of this country what can or cannot be in a subsequent law.  This is law we are talking about, not merely a resolution or a feeling of what we would like to do next year.  This is law, and the law of the land will be that in the 1988 Finance Act there cannot be this kind of measure.  I wonder whether it amounts to actually saying that in the Finance Bill, 1989, there can be no such provision either, because the law of the land would be that such an Act could not deal with this issue and could not re-impose this levy.  Deputy Noonan is now saying that the law of the land is to be that this cannot be in a subsequent Act.  If that is the case, can the House, which is the master of its own procedure and which decides what it can or cannot debate and has full power under the Constitution to state what it can or cannot do, ever by legislation purport to exclude itself from doing something in a subsequent Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that is wrong in principle.  It has never been attempted before.  There must be oodles of precedents, of which I am unaware, where such attempts to bind the Legislature <i>in futuro</i> have been knocked aside as invalid.  It is all very well for Deputy Noonan to outline his purpose.  I see what his purpose is and I agree with it, but he is trying to do something which this House is not competent to do and <Col N="980" /> has no constitutional mandate from the people to do, and that is to say what another House on another occasion may or may not do.  I am genuine when I say that I believe this is <i>ultra vires</i> this House.</P>
    <P>We have no right to say what another Act may contain in the future or to prohibit another Act from doing any such thing.  Because we are masters of our own procedure, we have not the right to enshrine in law what may or may not be in a subsequent Bill of the House.  I am strongly submitting that this measure should not be put to a vote because it is constitutionally outside our powers to do so.  You might as well have a proposal from Deputy Noonan to amend some Article in the Constitution, or to prolong the life of this Dáil for 15 years.  He can say until he is blue in the face that he knows it has no effect, but he should not attempt to put it into law and in my submission it should not be moved.</P>

Of course it is a matter of law; it is not a motion.  I want it in the law that governs <Col N="981" /> this section so that the Minister, or his successor, will not be in a position to come in here next year with a minor amendment, as has happened quite frequently on the bank levy, simply changing 1988 to 1989.

      <P>I had agreed that I would reply to the amendment and to the very important points raised by Deputies. It is best that I give the information I have to the House in relation to the operation of this pension fund levy.</P>
      <P>As we know, the section provides for the charging for the year 1988 of the once-off levy on pension funds announced in the budget.  It is intended that the levy should yield in total £16.5 million, £15 million of which is expected to be received in the year 1988.</P>

As originally proposed, the levy would have been chargeable at the rate of 6 per cent on the investment income and realised capital gains of the year 1988 of any pension fund, be it a self-administered scheme or an insured scheme.  Small self-administered schemes were to be exempt if the chargeable amount did not exceed £5,000.  On an estimated total chargeable amount of somewhat less than £300 million it is expected that the total yield would be £16.5 million.  Up to 25,000 schemes would have been chargeable. Of those some 17,000 are small insured schemes catering for individual, self-employed people or small numbers of employees.  The administrative burden in <Col N="985" /> such cases would be large for a relatively small yield.</P>
    <P>The arrangements now contained in section 49 provide for a chargeable amount determined by reference to an imputed return on the value of the assets of pension funds on 1 January 1988.  That imputed return will be at the rate of 9 per cent.  On an asset base of £4,900 million the imputed income will be £440 million. From this a deduction of approximately £160 million for pensions paid in 1988 will be allowable, leaving a chargeable amount of £280 million.  A levy at 6 per cent on this amount, subject to certain small deductions, will produce the required yield of £16.5 million.  Deductions will be allowed in the case of, first, self-administered schemes, in respect of any interest received net of DIRT &mdash; there can be a refund of DIRT in the case of insured schemes &mdash; and, second, of an amount up to £5,000, if the chargeable amount does not exceed £5,000 in the case of self-administered schemes, so that such small schemes will be exempt.</P>
    <P>The major differences between the scheme, as announced, and the arrangements now contained in the Bill are as follows.  The deduction in respect of pensions paid allows for the fact that the circumstances of schemes differ widely. For example, a young scheme with many currently employed contributors and few, if any, pensioners will have a large income relative to its outgoings.  In contrast, a mature scheme, with many pensioners and relatively few currently employed contributors, would have large outgoings relative to income.  A deduction for pensions paid in 1988 ensures equity between such cases and relates the levy to ability to pay.  Furthermore, in the case of closed schemes, that is schemes which have ceased to receive contributions from either employers or employees &mdash; for example, where a business will have ceased &mdash; the deductions for pensions paid, in most cases, will mean that such schemes are exempt because outgoings would usually exceed income, which would not have been the case under the original proposals.  Under the proposals now contained in the Bill <Col N="986" /> the levy will be chargeable in respect of approximately 1,500 schemes instead of up to 25,000, as in the original proposal.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the administrators, trustees and insurance companies concerned will be capable of dealing with the necessary valuations of assets held at 1 January 1988 and the calculation of the levy.  The original scheme would have imposed a levy on a very large number of small insured schemes which cater for self-employed persons, often on an individual basis, or small numbers of employees.  Furthermore, the initial premiums paid in such cases are already subject to a 3 per cent insurance stamp duty under the provisions of section 92 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended. Such cases are now excluded by virtue of the provisions of paragraph (b) of the definition of &ldquo;excluded assets&rdquo; in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Instead of a levy on actual investment income and capital gains of the year 1988, it will now be based on a notional investment yield of 9 per cent.  This notional basis was suggested in the course of discussions with representatives of the pensions industry.  It overcomes certain problems of an actual basis, for example, the lack of adequate records to calculate capital gains where a fund has changed its investment manager and by a new manager might not know when a particular security was bought.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is less scope for avoidance, for example, by incurring losses on disposal of securities.  On an asset base of £4,900 million, an imputed yield at 9 per cent and a levy at 6 per cent achieve the required £16.5 million yield after the deduction of pensions payable in 1988.  This rate of 9 per cent is slightly lower than the 12.5 per cent average return quoted in two recent surveys of pensions fund performance in 1987 but investment returns may be expected to be lower in 1988 than they were in 1987.</P>
    <P>By way of further information to the House I should say that funded pension schemes enjoy very favourable tax treatment. The funds' contribution income, at least £400 million in 1987, is tax exempt. Their gross investment income &mdash; £325 <Col N="987" /> million in 1987 &mdash; is also tax exempt except for the small part on which DIRT is payable without a refund.  The lump sum payments from the funds are tax free.  In view of this very generous tax treatment it is appropriate for pension funds, with assets of up to £5,000 million, to make this once-off modest contribution to the Exchequer, given that it is estimated that they had a real rate of return of over 9 per cent in 1987.</P>
    <P>I might add that a number of OECD countries tax pension fund income in various ways.  There has been considerable discussion about the tax on pension funds in general.  Other countries which tax pension funds include Belgium and Sweden.  A once-off tax payment of 6 per cent on the 1988 gross investment income will have a minimal or nil effect on the actuarial solvency of the funds, bearing in mind the size of the assets, the annual contribution income and the annual investment income.</P>
    <P>A recent report of the National Pensions Board on the tax treatment of occupational pension schemes acknowledged that a temporary tax is likely to have a lesser impact on the funds than a major or permanent change in their tax treatment.</P>
    <P>Finally I might quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Pension funds levy to have little impact?&rdquo; by Jim Aughney in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 16 February 1988 which had this to say:</P>
    <P>The proposed 6 per cent levy on pension funds will have little or no impact on the funds and will not have to be passed on to contributors, according to a leading actuary, Derek McNamee, of Buck Paterson Consultants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I think that you, a Cheann Comhairle, with your interest in Irish history, will remember the decision in respect of St. Colmcille at Comhdháil Drom Cheat &mdash; to every cow its calf and to every book its copy.  This principle could apply to pension funds also &mdash; to every pension fund the income that accrues to it.  We accept that contributions to pension funds are treated <Col N="988" /> favourably for tax purposes.  Up to 15 per cent of income can be exempt from taxation if it is a contribution to a pension fund.  However, the pensions which are paid from funds are taxable at the highest marginal rates.  I believe it is very bad practice to interfere with the asset base of the pension fund and to put a levy on that.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister's help on a number of points.  First, how widespread is the practice of contribution holidays? Is there any information on that in the Department?  Secondly, the Minister mentioned other countries which impose levies on pension funds and he mentioned Denmark in particular.  I thought the Danish scheme allowed a return equivalent to the rate of inflation and allowed another 3 per cent or 4 per cent on top of that so that there would be a guaranteed income allowed for pension funds.  If pension funds were under-performing in terms of realised capital gains or income, they were protected from the imposition of the levy.  That seems to be a better type of scheme.  I should like the Minister, for the benefit of us all, to provide further information on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent studies have indicated that the average rate of return on pension funds was 12 ½ per cent last year.  I accept that the Minister's proposal is a lesser imposition than this.  In the mid and late seventies when inflation rates were quite high and real returns were small, returns were negative rather than positive.  When one looks at the profile of a pension fund over a period of time one can see that there are significant periods during which there are negative returns but there are other significant periods when the returns can look very good.  We have just come through a period where the returns on pension funds were sizeable both on the income side, as a result of high interest rates, and on the realised capital gains side, on account of the way the equities performed up to October last year.  If one looks at a profile over a period of 40 years, one can see that the peaks have been matched by the valleys and that the great valley in the seventies needed to be matched by the peak of the mid and late <Col N="989" /> eighties.  If one takes too narrow a view of it and says: &ldquo;We have a survey which shows that last year the average return on pension funds was 12½ per cent; consequently pension funds can carry this levy and there will be no problem&rdquo;, one is looking at the problem with too narrow a focus.</P>
    <P>I welcome the information which the Minister has given.  The changes made in the Finance Bill from the original proposals in the budget are major changes. I accept the Minister's statement that the changes were made consequent on discussions with people who have experience of pension funds.  The Minister said that 25,000 funds could have been affected by the proposal as it was put forward on budget day but that the vast majority of these are now exempt.  The imposition will fall on about 15,000 medium to large funds and the revenue flow will be more or less what the Minister predicted on budget day.  I do not have any other point to raise on this section and I know other people are anxious to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the section and the Labour Party are very much opposed to the levy.  There are a number of valid reasons why the House should not accept the levy as proposed. It is, in effect, a charge on deferred income and a charge which was not anticipated by the tens of thousands of superannuation contributory, and in some cases non-contributory, pensioners who contribute to the funded schemes.  It is also a charge which the trustees of those schemes did not anticipate.  Inevitably it will have an impact on the management, the returns and the pension paid to the tens of thousands of workers who are directly affected.  The £16.5 million must come from somewhere and it can only come from the overall viability of the funds themselves.  For these reasons we are completely opposed to the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a panic-stricken measure and the only real rational explanation I heard for the bringing in of this levy is that the Government ran scared when the Fine Gael Party announced that they were <Col N="990" /> totally opposed to any change in mortgage interest relief because all the indications were that there would be a further 10 per cent reduction, which ironically amounts to £16 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason I can give for that is that it was done in haste. It has been completely changed.  It was announced by the Minister in the budget as a form of levy scheme.  It was cobbled together four or five days prior to the budget and I do not think it was subjected to any indepth discussion at Government level.  If it had been discussed internally, the flaws in the original scheme as proposed would have become evident after a ten minute discussion.  A completely new scheme had to be brought in when the Finance Bill was published.  The proposed levy on bank cards was the result of more panic.  Mercifully this has now been dropped.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that when the levy is collected it will be limited to £16.5 million. It will be very similar to the DIRT tax; the original finance computation on the DIRT tax was about £180 million.  Then it was revised upwards to around £200 million and, lo and behold, it is now £300 million, and that was done on the basis of an asset base of what the deposits were.  I would like the Minister to give us some information about the £4.9 billion asset base that he is using.  It has been suggested to me that that asset base is substantially more, that it is well over £5 billion and that it could be £5.5 billion.  I would like to know the official source for the estimated asset base of £4.9 billion as of the estimate of 1 January 1988 on which this levy is semi-applied because the Minister is now talking about 1,500 schemes coming within the ambit of the levy from a derived asset base of £4.9 billion.  I suggest to the Minister that he will, in fact, get more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also point out that the trustees of quite a number of schemes are very worried about the application.  In the case <Col N="991" /> of one closed scheme, trustees told me that they are not going to pay any increase in 1988; they normally would have expected to pay an increase of around 6 per cent &mdash; but they regard themselves as caught.  They may get the exemption that the Minister has referred to and be classified as an excluded scheme but the indications I have from them, and they are a prominent public company, is that they do not at the moment regard themselves as having got that exclusion.  On that basis their pensioners will not get a penny increase in 1988.</P>
    <P>Equally, we have had substantial representations from the managers and the associations involved, and individual representations from a number of occupational schemes, such as the Aer Lingus occupational scheme, who are genuinely fearful about the introduction of this levy. I cannot understand why it is being brought in on a once-off basis.  I do not believe it will be on a once-off basis.  This scheme is now in.  The Minister will get not less than £15 million in 1988 and he says he will get another £1.5 million in June 1989.  I submit he will get far more and I can see the levy staying despite the fact that he has received representations from one trade union who were given solemn assurances across the table that this is on a once-off basis.  If this is so, why have we gone to such inordinate lengths to concoct the scheme and try to build upon the scheme, because with the changes announced here it will be very difficult and will require an investigation of pension fund assets to compile a formal asset base on which to obtain the return talked about here this morning?</P>
    <P>I believe that when the Revenue Commissioners get down to examining all this and when they see the volume of asset money there the temptation to introduce another levy next year may not be resisted.  Maybe the Minister will reduce the charge.  He may well go for an imputed income of less than 9 per cent because he is going to get a higher yield anyway.  In next year's budget he may bring it down to 6 per cent, and the following year, bring it down to 4 per cent <Col N="992" /> but, of course, the asset base of the schemes is growing all the time.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in principle.  Every pensioner here pays income tax on his pension off the occupational scheme.  Now he is going to pay a levy on top of that on the basis of imputed income on the asset base and that is unfair.  It is yet another taxation measure.  We have had so many levies that have come and gone; they are the bane of the Revenue.  It confuses our tax system and it must be heartbreaking that in any endeavour on the part of the IDA where there is a foreign company coming into this country they are told that if they are setting up in 1988 and bringing in £3 million, they will be stuck for 6 per cent but that this will not apply next year.  This is the kind of thing which gives the raising of money a bad name at national level and at international level.  Five years down the road one will meet people in the UK involved in pensions who will refer to the Irish levy even though at that stage the levy may well be gone.  It builds up a climate which is not conducive to rational taxation application and the raising of revenue in the State.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the proposal.  I do not really know why the Minister has gone to such trouble to raise £16 million.  I was in such a scheme when I came into the Dáil and then lost my membership of the scheme because in 1969 it was not transferable; one just got a refund of contributions and went.  That is changed now but those were the days when the schemes were embryonic.  If I were an occupational pensioner I would prefer to pay an extra twopence on the pint of Guinness or on a glass of whiskey by way of optional indirect taxation.  That is where revenue could be raised if the Minister is that strapped because, in the case of people coming up to the late forties, the fifties or late fifties, their pension scheme or the prospect of their pension and retirement is about the only thing they have left.</P>
    <P>In a situation where there is massive shedding of labour, where people are almost being humped out willy-nilly by <Col N="993" /> employers on early retirement, on accelerated pension exits and payment of lump sums, a further impetus will be given because people will just say they are not going to pay any more levy on this but will just close it off and shed more labour because of the cost of paying the State another 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are the anomalies.  This will apply to 1,500 schemes.  There will be 23,500 schemes exempt.  The original application covered 2,500 schemes.  It now boils down to 1,500 major schemes. I am not quite certain how the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance and the Minister have worked out that structure.  It is certainly one which requires further elaboration by the Minister &mdash; but, overall, to go to such lengths to raise £16 million on a once-off basis is shoddy in terms of a Finance Bill and of presenting a budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We in The Workers' Party are opposed to this section also.  We welcome the major climb down by the Minister as between the original proposal and what is now before us but I find it very difficult to understand how the yield remains the same.  I would like if the Minister would explain how he expects the yield of £16.5 million to remain the same having regard to the changed circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would calculate that in the case of a medium-sized pension fund yielding an income of, say, £1 million with a pension pay out of £500,000, 9 per cent of the assets amounting to, say, £1 million, 6 per cent on the remaining £500,000 would amount to £30,000.  Before the change whereby the pension pay out would be taken into account, that scheme would have been paying £60,000 &mdash; 9 per cent of its £1 million.  In cases like that, and probably in many other cases, there would be a reduction of almost half the return to the State under the new arrangements.  I welcome this new arrangements as it changes the situation considerably from the original proposal. Nevertheless, we are totally opposed to the whole principle of this tax and the manner in which it is being imposed by <Col N="994" /> the Minister.  There is no question but that it is double taxation.</P>
    <P>The funded pensions we are talking about are continuously regarded by workers as part of their pay deal and their negotiations and where the employer is making a contribution that is seen as a deferred payment.  That is how trade unions always regard the pension contributions made by the employers.  When the person retires and begins to get that deferred payment &mdash; they have paid tax on it &mdash; they are paying a tax on their weekly payments.  The deferred payment which is put into a pension fund is paid when they reach pensionable age and when that is paid they pay tax on that as well.  The Minister is getting at working people whose earnings and pensions funds are known to everybody.  They pay all their taxes for 40 years of their lives, get their deferred payment when they retire and again they pay tax on that. Now the Minister is taxing their pension fund in the meantime.  Clearly, this is double taxation of pensioners' funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making the argument &mdash; it is an argument that has been made in the past few months &mdash; that these pension funds are huge amounts of, say, £5,000 million, and that when a few million pounds are taken out it will not be noticed, that when £16 million is taken out of these enormous assets of £5,000 million it is not significant.  That is the old argument of tossing out huge figures.  It is like putting together the total wage and salary bill of the entire State and saying that a couple of hundred million pounds out of that enormous figure would not be noticed and that we could take another lump from them.  The Minister in his contribution today said that there is £5,000 million in these funds and that we are taking only a small portion of that.</P>
    <P>In respect of the vast majority of pension funds there was no provision until recent years for inflation and increased pensions.  They were standard fixed amounts.  The investment funds in the pension allows the opportunity for increasing pensions in line with increases in the cost of living.  The Minister quoted a Mr. O'Neill, somebody of whom I have <Col N="995" /> never heard.  I do not know why he bothered quoting him.  Why can the Minister not make his own point?   He quotes Mr. O'Neill to make the point that the Minsiter's proposal will not increase the contributions to the pension funds.  That is possibly true.  As a once-off tax it will not increase the contributions but if it becomes a permanent tax it will very quickly increase the contributions because all the actuarial decisions will be made on the basis of this tax.  That was the important point of Deputy Noonan's amendment, to prevent this tax being included in actuarial assessments.  If there was a specific payment to be made it would stop this year, but that is not in the Bill.  As a once-off item I agree that it will not increase contributions but it can reduce payments out of the scheme immediately.  They will not have to make higher contributions but they can either receive less payments or, at least, no increase in their payments.  There will be no 2½ per cent or 3 per cent rise in line with the cost of living following this year for the people who will be getting their pension next year.  That would be one immediate effect because the money is taken out by the Minister, money which would have been used to give increases in pensions in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot claim that this does not affect the individual.  It affects the individual pensioners, each of whom has spent their 30 or 40 years of service paying their taxes, their employers paying contributions for them, and they are the ones who will get less when they retire.  Regarding this tax, every penny will come out of workers' pockets.  That is what it amounts to.  These are the people whom it is easy to hit because everybody knows what they have and what they earn.  They know every penny that is in their pension fund so it is quite simple for Ministers to grab it.  That is the reason it is done.  It is the simple way out of taking money out of workers' pockets.  It is discriminatory, as has been pointed out, because it is dealing only with the funded schemes and not the unfunded schemes in the public service.  Presumably that is <Col N="996" /> to avoid complications which might arise for the Minister but it is the type of thing which makes the tax a burden on a certain number of people.  Instead of bringing parity, clarity and simplicity into the taxation system, it is complicating it further, creating further divisions among people and being selective and discriminatory.</P>
    <P>When I say every penny will come out of workers' pockets it may well be that the Minister himself had something else in mind which I would agree with but perhaps it is too complicated to get at, that is, to get at the pension fund managers and the pension business.  There is a whole huge business in operating these pension funds.  The various people who have the pension funds give the money over for investment to people who run the investment business for the pension funds to see they get a regular return on their investment.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that last year the regular return they got on their investment was 12.5 per cent, but on their own operations they are making a fat profit for themselves.  It is a huge area in the Stock Market these days and large profits are being made in the operation of these pension funds.  Perhaps that is what the Minister was thinking of, or maybe the impression has been given that the public might think that those other people are being got at.  They are not being got at, at all.  The acturaries, accountants, and so on, are going to make money out of the very fact that the Minister put the tax on this because a whole range of new calculations will have to be made now for which they will charge fees etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great deal of money to be made out of the Minister's proposal &mdash; far from taking money from the people who are feeding off these pension funds. In fact, this money is being taken directly out of pensioners' pockets and that is why we are opposed to it.  We would not object to taxes like the levy on banks' profits if a similar levy was imposed on <Col N="997" /> companies handling the funds for pension schemes and if the tax was seen to be on the profits they make from operating these schemes.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been made by the ICTU in response to the Minister's proposal is that last year as a result of the autumn Stock Exchange crash etc., the value of the present pension funds was reduced substantially and they calculated that the outcome for 1987-88 would be a real return of a mere 1 per cent.  The Minister has calculated 12.5 per cent for 1987.  That will be 1986-87 presumably. Therefore, many things need to be taken into consideration in relation to this tax and the manner in which it is being imposed.  I agree with the Minister that, as a once off payment, it is not going to be paid for by increased contributions, but it is going to be paid for by lesser pension payments, if not by lower payments by at least a lack of increase in payments.  The purpose of the investments is to allow for an increase in pensions in line with the standard of living. Even as a once off issue for this year only, there will be a reduction in the pay outs from the pensions schemes next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said a few things generally about the matter and I was reprimanded by Deputy Mac Giolla, correctly, for generalising on a particular amendment, but at least I have had the benefit of receiving some feedback already from the Minister in relation to the points I made.  This matter requires some examination.  He says the new arrangement as proposed should reflect ability to pay.  Why does he say that?  He says the new arrangements reflect ability to pay in that mature pension funds with greater pay out will pay less than young pension funds whose liabilities are much more future liabilities and not present liabilities.  Therefore, he is talking about ability to pay like a snapshot taken with a camera, ability to pay right now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very point I was making was that it is a very naive and superficial approach to pension funding to say that at the moment, because you are paying out pensions now, you will pay a lesser levy than <Col N="998" /> some trustees who are building up a fund against future liabilities and that in relation to them you have a greater or lesser ability to pay based on what you are paying out this week, this month or this year.  That is precisely what is wrong with the Minister's thinking on the ability to pay front.</P>
    <P>When you are a trustee and your liabilities as a trustee go across a time frame and just cannot be isolated at any given instant, ability to pay depends on the extent to which the fund is on target to meet its liabilities judged over a time frame, not judged today, not because people cannot demand the money back now because it is an immature scheme &mdash; to use the Minister's phrase &mdash; it is not a fully matured scheme which is in the process of paying out.  With all due respect to the Minister, that is not a fair yardstick by which to judge ability to pay. Ability to pay in relation to a pension fund is decided on totally different, absolutely rational and cold criteria.  You ask what this pension fund as at present constituted has to pay out over its entire lifetime as far as we can see that, and where it is going in relation to satisfying its liabilities.  One pension fund may be doing very well and have plenty of funds to meet its anticipated liabilities and another pension fund which may be accumulating money at a fierce rate apparently with no day to day liabilities at the given date we are talking about, 1988, it may be in dreadful trouble because it may be wholly underfunded and going further and further off the rails.</P>
    <P>The Minister's definition of &ldquo;ability to pay&rdquo; is how much of this year's income is immediately spoken for in terms of pensioners who are entitled to receive it now.  That is precisely what is wrong with this measure.  It just takes ability to pay as a simplistic notion of what is available in the kitty now, who is looking for it and what is the difference.  That is like saying that the amount of money in a safe constitutes a bank's ability to pay.  It is naive and simplistic in terms of pension fund arrangements.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy Mac Giolla was perfectly correct.  There is no question of a <Col N="999" /> tax on institutions.  Pension funds are not institutions.  They are solely the aggregate of the people who are entitled to receive moneys from them.  They are not separate.  They are not like a corporation who exist on a separate plane and are entitled to be taxed separately.  Pension funds consist of aggregations of deferred income and the State is saying to people during their working lives: &ldquo;Defer your income; put it aside; make provision for your old age and we will allow you to deduct that from your taxation.  In other words, if you do not take your income now and you defer it to look after yourself in your old age we will not regard it as taxable now but will regard it as taxable when you receive income from it, when it turns into an income flow in the fullness of time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the essence and philosophy of our system of pension funding and what we are doing now is, by any standards, double taxation.  We are saying that deferred income will be taxed when it has been invested in a pension fund and a person is receiving a return on the investment. In the last analysis, the pension fund will be taxed when a payment is made to the person who is entitled to receive it.</P>
    <P>The bigger pension funds in this country are not capable of keeping up with the rate of inflation.  Every Deputy in this House received a very interesting letter from Professor Brendan Walsh, an economist of high repute, who is involved in the airline pilots' fund.  He is one of the trustees of the fund and he pointed out that, whatever about this year or last year, the capacity of pension funds to keep up with inflation, judged over a time frame &mdash; this is where one has to make a judgment &mdash; allows them to keep up with inflation only to the extent of 60 per cent or 70 per cent.  We can argue about the effect on an instant pension fund and the Minister can say that it will have virtually no effect on funds but it will have an effect because, if pension funds fail to keep up with inflation, the people who are deferring their income will get less and less on them.  That is why we <Col N="1000" /> should be very slow to attack the process whereby that sum is attempted to be made inflation-proof by taking some moneys out of a fund which is merely a defence mechanism for deferred income to retain its value.  That is where we are making such a mistake in this measure. We are not taking a long, candid, hard view of the likely effects on insolvent funds.</P>
    <P>In relation to a fully matured fund, which is closed in terms of further people coming into the category of potential beneficiary, of course we can view it on the basis of its aggregated assets, what its payments out are likely to be and what kind of moneys it can afford to pay out each year by way of increases.  However, it is much more difficult to calculate in relation to a young firm which is immature and open-ended in terms of actuarial calculations, predictions of the rate of inflation and the rate of return.  Are the trustees of those funds in a position to give to the people who paid into the fund the real value of their contributions over time?  If Professor Walsh's statement is correct and if keeping up with inflation is beyond some companies, that they are only achieving to the extent of two-thirds in terms of keeping up with the rate of inflation, then you are taxing deferred income which is, itself, becoming less and less capable of dealing with the purpose for which it was deferred, to provide a pension for people over a period of time.</P>
    <P>In defending this levy, the Minister said it is related to a capacity to pay.  It is, if you take a totally simplistic view of what capacity to pay means, or their ability to bear the levy.  However, if you take a view that takes into account the distinctions between immature and mature funds and if you take the view that a fund which simply does not have a liability today or tomorrow is not necessarily solvent, it is obvious that liabilities which have not yet accrued are by no means a yardstick on which to decide ability to pay.</P>
    <P>We are taking £16.5 million out of these funds, and if Deputy Desmond's calculation is correct it could be £20 million or £30 million.  It does not matter, it <Col N="1001" /> is taking those moneys from people, not from inanimate, disembodied, or theoretical entities.  Is taxation of those people fair and equitable?  I will go back to my earlier remarks about the public service. They get unfunded pensions which are inflation-proof and related to their salaries, including productivity increases over time.  Are we indulging in a fair exercise?  Is there a fair balance between them and ordinary people &mdash; employees, not the super-rich &mdash; paying into pension funds?  The incomes of these people in their old age will not be inflation-proof, in fact their incomes will become less and less.  The effect of this levy is to come down hardest on the funds which are most at risk, those which are now immature. The levy is hardest and harshest on the funds whose liabilities are furthest away.  The deductions in the formula provided for in the Bill gives the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; as meaning payments out of pensions this year so the more liabilities you have at present the less this levy will impact on you.  At the moment, deferred liabilities are much riskier and much more doubtful as to whether they will ever be met and that is where the pension levy hits hardest and digs deepest.</P>
    <P>On that basis alone, the effect of this levy is unfair.  Is it right to allow the payments made this year to be fully deductible just because it is a pension fund whose liabilities have now accrued? Is it right, between two pension funds, one of which has a big liability to payments this year and the other may have a liability to pay in ten years' time and to a much more significant extent, that this year one of the pension funds can pay much less than the other whose liabilities are likely to accrue in ten years' time and whose capacity to bear those payments in ten years' time is much more doubtful?  That is wrong and is an error in principle.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say that this is a once-off levy but the more I think about it, the more I realise how unlikely that is as a proposition.  There is a lot of masquerading in the House.  The Fine Gael amendment was a smokescreen for the <Col N="1002" /> fact that they will not oppose this measure. The Minister is, theoretically, correct in saying that this is a once-off levy. The only provision we are enacting today is a once-off levy and some other Parliament will have to decide, in its wisdom, whether to scrap the measure.  If it will yield £20 million, who will come up with that amount next year?  Where will it come from?  That is the issue and it is very unlikely that a Government seeking cutbacks in public expenditure and striving for fiscal rectitude will be in a position to widen the tax base by another £16 million just to get rid of this measure.  It is realistic to see this as something which, once in place, will continue.  On that basis it is reprehensible.</P>
    <P>My last point is in relation to foreign pension funds.  We are going towards 1992.  We are going towards an era in which it will be possible, I believe, to move moneys out of the country for various purposes, including looking after a pension in the last analysis.  I accept that our tax laws at present may require that the pension fund be held in Ireland but, in the last analysis, we are going towards an economic community where these moneys will be mobile.  I do not believe that in those circumstances Irish pension funds should be at a significant disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> foreign pension funds.  The Minister may say it is the intention of the Government to discriminate between funds held in Ireland and funds which go abroad and that people who invest their moneys abroad will not be entitled to the tax relief with the result that there is no question of that happening in the long run.  I wonder if we will be allowed to keep that fiscal discrimination in our laws post-1992.  If we are not allowed to do that by the European Community, if we are not entitled to restrict pension funds to investments in Ireland effectively or to those companies who have their domestic place of business in Ireland for tax purposes, we will be placing Irish pension funds at a significant disadvantage in relation to potential foreign pension funds.</P>
    <P>This levy is flawed in principle and is <Col N="1003" /> likely to be permanent.  When all the huffing and puffing and rhetoric in the House abate, the question that must be answered is: are we going to vote in favour of it or not?  To a large extent the decision on this provision falls firmly into the lap of Fine Gael.  If they want to oppose this provision in regard to pension funds then, forgetting about their amendment, now is the time.  It is on that basis that we are indicating that we are opposing this provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy McDowell in what he said which is absolutely right and cannot be contradicted.  The plain fact of the matter in basic realities is that, if Fine Gael are prepared to vote against this section, as they sought to give the impression they were some weeks ago, it will not be carried and this double tax on pensions will be defeated.  Fine Gael put down an amendment to this section and of all the foolish amendments I have seen, that one took the biscuit.  The effect of the amendment was to confirm what was in the section.  The section purports to declare that this will apply to 1988 only and I wonder why an amendment should be tabled to that effect unless, as Deputy McDowell says, the intention is to create a smokescreen and give the impression that Fine Gael are against the provision although in reality they are afraid to exercise their right to vote against it.  If this tax is imposed today it will be Fine Gael's decision to impose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this proposed double tax on pensions is entirely discriminatory because it applies only to funded pensions and only to 1,500 of the 25,000 funded pension schemes that exist here.  If, therefore, a person is wealthy enough to have a scheme of his own on which the tax payable on the inputed income after deductions and so on is less than £5,000, that person is exempt. However, if a person was not wealthy enough to have a scheme of his own and he had to go into a general scheme, of which there are 1,500 that will not be exempt under this section, that person is <Col N="1004" /> heavily penalised.  On the other hand, if a person works for the public service generally and does not make any contribution but will be paid a pension on retirement from current revenue, from totally unfunded sources, and if the employer has made no provision for that person's retirement, that person is not penalised at all.  That is totally discriminatory. Why should the entire public service, apart from a limited number of institutions that were prudent enough or one might say foolish enough to have funded schemes for the benefit of their employees, be entirely exempt from this?</P>
    <P>If we were not talking about pensions but referring to pay, I wonder if the House would for one minute accept that a certain tax should be put on the pay that some people got but not on the pay that other people received?  Would they, for example, accept that people working for Irish Airlines who have a funded pension scheme, and a very good one run by Professor Walsh and other trustees, should be subject to tax on their pay but that people working for the Department of Transport should not be subject to tax on their pay?  That would be regarded as outrageous but what is the difference if the Minister is going to impose that tax on their pensions?  Why should an official in the Department of Transport be free of this double tax on his pension when a person working for Irish Airlines who has a funded pension will be subject to tax?</P>
    <P>In my view, this is just as outrageous as if it were a discrimination on tax on pay and it is indefensible.  I am sure somebody will challenge this in the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I have long since given up forecasting what the result of this type of case will be because some of what appear to be the more obvious cases seem to get through and others whose chances appear to be rather slim are struck down by the High Court or by the Supreme Court.  For that reason I do not forecast these results any longer. However, I must say that there is a very arguable case in relation to this.  It is indefensible on the basis that it is entirely <Col N="1005" /> discriminatory as between different classes of people.</P>
    <P>The Irish Airlines Pension Fund scheme applies not just to Aer Lingus personnel but to Aer Rianta personnel. I recall that some ten or 12 years ago when the arrangements in Shannon Airport were being changed, the people who worked in what was called the sales and catering organisation, an autonomous organisation started by Dr. Brendan O'Regan, were given the option of either going into Aer Rianta, who were about to take over that organisation, or into the Department of Transport and Power, as it then was, and become ordinary civil servants.  Those who opted to go into Aer Rianta are paying into the Irish Airlines funded pension fund while those who opted to go into the Department of Transport and Power are not.  They are being looked after on the normal Civil Service basis.  Why is it that the person who opted to go into Aer Rianta and has made contributions into a fund over the years will be subject to this tax, while the person who opted to go into the Department of Transport and Power and made no contribution will be free of all tax?</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be basically inequitable and indefensible.  I do not think it should be allowed to go through.  I invite all concerned to have a rethink about this.  I have not dealt with the figures involved but with the basic principle involved and it is my view that it is entirely wrong.  I do not see how it can be defended.  If it is challenged in a court I do not know what argument can be made to convince the court that it is not discriminatory as between people in roughly similar types of employment who happen to find themselves on one side of the line or the other.</P>
    <P>Professor Walsh wrote a letter to the 9,000 or more members and pensioners in the scheme I referred to &mdash; happily up to now it has been a very successful scheme &mdash; and I should like to quote some of the comments he made about it. Brendan Walsh is regarded as an independent, objective and reasonable man and an economist of standing.  He states that the actuary has told them he would <Col N="1006" /> expect to be able to pay increases of between 60 per cent and 70 per cent of the annual rate of inflation.  That is not bad, given that the rate of inflation was very high up to some years ago.  The letter goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Actuary now advises that any tax imposition on the Schemes, even on a once-off basis, would reduce any surpluses likely to arise and seriously impair our capacity to pay future pension increases.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair that those people who have been prudent and provident enough to make arrangements for their own future should be penalised in this way. They can get no increases, but people who have made no arrangements whatever and are relying on unfunded payments of their own pensions out of current revenue are subject to no tax on the funds and no inhibition whatever on the rate of increase.  They will get a full index-linked increase every year or an increase linked to the Civil Service increase.  It is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>Professor Walsh goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Any tax on Pension Schemes is therefore a tax on the retirement provisions of individuals.  Furthermore, as pensions are subject to PAYE, the Government's proposals would be an exercise in double taxation.</P>
    <P>He is perfectly right.  He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The proposed tax is not only based on a flawed view of the nature of pension funds, it is also being implemented in a very inequitable manner because only pensions paid out of funded Schemes would be affected.  The pensions of civil servants and the vast majority of public sector employees would not be affected.</P>
    <P>He also states:</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the proposed tax appears to be based on a tendency to depersonalise Pension Schemes by classifying them as financial institutions. This may be because of a lack of understanding or a reluctance to <Col N="1007" /> accept the basic reality that Pension Schemes are there to provide future financial protection for employees and former employees.</P>
    <P>That letter has been circulated generally during the past two months and I have not seen any of Professor Walsh's assertions contradicted.  The points he makes are perfectly valid.  I am amazed that the Government propose to go on with this. If Fine Gael said they would vote against it, obviously the Government would not go on with it.  It is wrong in principle, discriminatory and unfair and should not be proceeded with.  All concerned should think of it now in that way.</P>
    <P>I will give this much to the Government: what is now in section 49 is very different from what was announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. About 23,000 small schemes have been taken out.  That does not help the smaller people who tend not to be in the small schemes which are often very selective one or two-man operations for people who are relatively wealthy.  The system proposed to collect this money under the scheme as announced in the budget was obviously unworkable.  Major changes have been made and the income is now an imputed income rather than the actual income.  It is also permissible now to deduct actual payments in the present year, which was not the intention of the Minister in the budget.  There are various other major changes of that kind, but it is still onerous, inequitable and discriminatory.</P>
    <P>It is indefensible to try to put through a measure like this.  It is the clear duty of an Opposition to oppose it.  Any Opposition Deputy who does not oppose this today is neglecting his duty to prevent something that is obviously unfair and inequitable.  Irrespective of what one thinks about the merits of it, even if one could convince oneself that double taxation on pensions had some merits &mdash; a point on which I would find it hard to be convinced &mdash; it is not possible to be convinced that it should apply to one group of people and not to others.  In <Col N="1008" /> particular one cannot be convinced that it should apply to those who are provident and not apply to those who have made no arrangements for their future retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the points raised in the recent contributions have been replied to already in the information I have given to the House.  I do not think the contribution by Deputy O'Malley adds anything to the debate.  Deputy McDowell made his party's points extremely well and there was no necessity for the political child's play of Deputy O'Malley's contribution.</P>
      <P>Foreign funds are exempt.  What will happen in 1992 does not arise under this section since this is a once-off scheme for 1988.  Most, if not all, of the arguments on this section were on the basis that it would be permanent.  That is not the case; it will be there only for 1988.  Deputy Noonan referred to Denmark, but their scheme is much more severe and was changed recently.  Regarding the solvency of particular companies and the question of ability to pay, it is quite clear that current returns are good and there is no difficulty in payment of this once-off levy.  There is not much point in going through all the detailed questions again. Most of the arguments made were political and dealt with the scheme as if it were to be a permanent feature.</P>
      <P>Funded pension schemes enjoy very favourable tax treatment.  The funds income contribution was at least £400 million last year and it is tax exempt. Their gross investment income of £325 million in 1987 is also tax exempt, except for the small part on which retention tax is payable without a refund.  This is a very modest contribution and is being seen as such.  Most of the changes made since the announcement on budget day arise from suggestions made in the course of discussions with representatives of the pension industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude on a point which continues to amuse me.  Many speakers have said we do not need this £16.5 million or that it could be found in other ways. Nobody suggested any way in which even <Col N="1009" /> £1 million might be raised.  Deputy McDowell and Deputy O'Malley were trying to amend corporation tax to reduce the rates.  There are plenty of proposals for reducing taxation but none for ways of increasing taxation to raise the funds which the Exchequer so badly needs to reduce our enormous debt.  Where are all the pious statements of 14 months ago?</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall that I indicated in my winding up on the Second Stage that if the associations representing disabled drivers were unable to agree to the terms of the new scheme as designed by the Department of Health, I would consider removing section 54 and allowing the existing arrangements to continue.  Since agreement on a new change has not been reached I have circulated an amendment to remove section 54 from the Bill.  The purpose of this proposal was to expand eligibility for transport grants among a wider category of disabled persons and to secure a more equitable distribution of available funds.  Cost saving was not the objective.  I hope that further efforts to resolve difficulties will be made and that progress can be made towards an agreed scheme in the coming year.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision.  I hope that agreement will be reached.  The decision that the National Rehabilitation Board would be involved instead of the health boards was a very sensible decision and I regret that no agreement was reached before the section was put into the Finance Bill.  Be that as it may, the Minister has withdrawn the rescinding of the previous Finance Act provision.  I am told that a large number of the applications which had been received in the first quarter of the year were not dealt with pending the introduction of the new scheme on 1 May.  Can the Minister tell us whether those applications will now be cleared rapidly?  Provision has been made in the budget for an allocation of £2.8 million this year and £3.3 million in a full year. I do not want to see a scheme being introduced in next year's budget with a reduced allocation because of only £2 million being spent this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to delete this section.  The mistake which was made initially was to attempt to a abolish the scheme without any consultation with the organisations representing the disabled.  I understand the fears which the disabled had about <Col N="1014" /> the proposed scheme in that there would have been a limitation on the amount of money which could be spent on any of the new shcemes which would be proposed whereas there are no such limitations under the present scheme.  Improvements can be made to the present scheme.  The Revenue Commissioners have been implementing the regulations far more rigidly in recent times and those who qualified in years past are now finding themselves in difficulties.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to take into consideration in any new proposals which may be brought forward the position of hand amputees who are not covered under the present scheme.  There are quite a number of people around the country who cannot drive the normal type of car and they are not covered by the scheme.  Now that the heat is off I ask that those organisations representing the disabled, the Minister and the Minister for Health would, in a calmer atmosphere, bring about further improvements as improvements can be made to the scheme.  I note that the Minister recognises that the wrong track was taken initially and that because pressure was put on people they became entrenched in their views.  Now that the heat is off I think a more equitable and flexible scheme can be negotiated by all concerned.</P>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision to withdraw the section.  As Deputy Allen has said, the difficulty arose because of a lack of consultation and it seemed that the disabled were being told that they did not know what was best for them.  They were being treated like children.  Their independence and any issue relating to mobility is of vital importance to them.  It would be great if improvements could be made in consultation with them.  The Minister assures us that it was not a question of saving money.  Nevertheless, as it was introduced in a Finance Bill by a Minister for Finance it was seen as a way of saving money for the Exchequer in one way or another and not as something which would be of benefit to the disabled.  I <Col N="1015" /> think the move the Minister is making is the correct one and will prove of most benefit to the disabled in the long run.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for withdrawing the section. I think he has handled this problem very well.  It was a complicated and difficult issue to handle.  I accept his good intentions in seeking to improve the scheme. I have no objection to the Minister continuing the discussions with a view to achieving a more satisfactory scheme because a more satisfactory scheme could be negotiated and we are all aware of this.  I thank the Minister for withdrawing the section at this stage.  There would be strong support from all parties in the House for modifications of the scheme if the discussions were to continue and the Minister could agree on a satisfactory solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>A response is needed to some of the points which have been made.  First of all, all applications under the existing scheme are being dealt with as we are not now going to change it.  On budget night I said that what we were going to do was improve the scheme and that this would only be done in consultation with the interested parties concerned. Therefore, there was no question of us doing anything without first having done that.  Those consultations did not lead to agreement and that is why I am now withdrawing this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In order that everybody would fully understand what we were trying to do because of the difficulties which many of the disabled genuinely found themselves in let me quote from section 43 of the 1968 Act:</P>
      <P>Where a person shows to the satisfaction of the licensing authority that, in consequence of injury, disease or defect, he is wholly, or almost wholly, without the use of each of his legs, the duty imposed by...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the person had to be without the use of each of his legs.  If they had use of one leg they were not entitled to <Col N="1016" /> this benefit.  If the person was a dwarf or a midget and had the use of two legs they were not entitled to the benefit.  A substantial number of people who are genuinely disabled do not qualify under the existing scheme.  We were trying to change that by agreement with the Wheelchair Association and the disabled drivers.  I understand that the Wheelchair Association were prepared to agree to this but disabled drivers were not.  If their representatives felt that we were not improving things then so be it.  Allegations have been made against the Revenue Commissioners on their interpretation of the law but I think anybody could interpret what is clearly implied in section 43 of the 1968 Act.  If a person has the use of either one or both of his legs he cannot qualify for benefit, he has to be without the use of both of his legs to qualify.  We are trying to change that but we are not being allowed to do so because there is no agreement. As I have said, on budget night I indicated that unless there was agreement arising out of consulations there would be no change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said in that the section of the 1968 Act is rather restrictive and that there are a number of people who would not qualify even if the section was interpreted liberally.  There is something to be said for the proposition that a realistic scheme where the entitlement would not tempt doctors out of the goodness of their hearts to bend the rules a little should be introduced in which the entitlement would be spelt out more clearly so as to make it quite clear as to who is and who is not entitled to avail of the scheme.  In relation to those who suffer from dwarfism their capacity to use their legs can be limited in many cases to walking between 40 and 100 yards.  They are not able to walk much further than that because their legs will not support them. As the Minister has suggested the phrase &ldquo;without the use of each of his legs&rdquo; is capable of being interpreted as excluding them and that is an unfortunate state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> In respect of Deputy Allen's proposal for the Minister to consider extending the scheme to cover people with hand problems I would like to say that I would be wary of doing so, not because of any lack of sympathy for those people because I am sure that they go through an awful lot in their day-to-day lives, but because, as I understand it, the purpose was to give mobility.  People who have hand problems are not normally immobile. It would be a mistake in my view if the scheme was diluted so as to generally cover everyone who for one reason or another had to have a special adaptation to their cars.  This benefit was not introduced to cover the cost of specially adapting a car but rather to give mobility to those people who cannot get around without it.  Let me enter a warning that if we start extending the scheme to cover disabled people who need their cars adjusted in various ways but who can get around without a car we will dilute the whole purpose of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this section has been withdrawn.  I received a large amount of correspondence from members of the Wheelchair Association and from disabled drivers who expressed concern over what was being proposed. Many of their members were not able to enjoy a normal life as they had to remain at home and the provision of these cars meant a lot to them.  It is important that they are able to avail of this scheme.  As the scheme is too restrictive at present I think we should consider extending it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I briefed political correspondents on Tuesday, 3 May about the nature of the contact I had had with the provision of a marina in Dún Laoghaire Harbour following some unfounded statements made earlier in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I explained to the correspondents that I completely rejected any suggestion of any motive on my part in supporting the provision of a marina in Dún Laoghaire Harbour other than the public interest.  I told them that I had no connection or association with any commercial organisation involved and that I was only concerned with the implementation of Government policy for the development of marinas and marine recreation.  I outlined the background to the affair for them in so far as I was aware of it or had any contact with it.</P>
      <P>That background is as follows.  In 1983 a report prepared on behalf of the Harbour Study Group, which was comprised of nominees of four yacht clubs in Dún Laoghaire was formally adopted by the four clubs, signed by each of the commodores of the four clubs and formally submitted to the Office of Public Works for approval.  This was a fully comprehensive study which identified five possible sites and recommended the Coal Harbour and the area in front of the National Yacht Club as particularly suitable for the establishment of marinas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over a period of four years there was discussion and correspondence between the Harbour Study Group, the Office of Public Works and, on occasions, with members of the last Government seeking formal approval for the proposals. During this period Dún Laoghaire Corporation also prepared to plan for marina and associated development at the Coal Harbour and outside the West Pier.  Both <Col N="1020" /> the Harbour Study Group and Dún Laoghaire Corporation's harbour proposals envisaged a marina in the Coal Harbour area of the West Pier.  In 1987 the Harbour Study Group prepared and submitted a further report seeking approval, in principle, for the provision of marine facilities in Dún Laoghaire Harbour and this proposal was again endorsed by the yacht clubs.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, is that the provision of marina facilities in the West Pier-Coal Harbour area has long been sought by responsible interests concerned with the development of the harbour and in particular was fully supported and endorsed by the yacht clubs who funded the work of the Harbour Study Group.</P>
    <P>I was aware of this when I accepted an invitation from representatives of the yacht clubs in Dún Laoghaire to luncheon on 3 September 1987 to discuss a proposal of public benefit which I understood had widespread local support.  The following were present at that meeting: Mr. Cooney, a former commodore of the National Yacht Club, Mr. Johnson, a former commodore of the Royal Irish Yacht Club, Mr. Power, a member of the Royal Irish Yacht and the National Yacht Clubs, Mr. O'Leary, a member of three of the yacht clubs and Dr. Paddy McCarthy and Mr. Tom McMahon of McCarthy and Partners, Consulting Engineers, technical advisers to the Harbour Study Group.  Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick who it is stated is a member of the private company was not present.</P>
    <P>The discussion was in the nature of an informal briefing on the long history of the efforts to develop modern marine facilities in the harbour and in particular to see if any progress could be made in the matter.  The members of the yacht clubs present sought my support on the basis of expediting progress for their proposals through the machinery of the Government Departments concerned and nothing else.</P>
    <P>It was explained to me that the yacht clubs, as such, would not be suited to undertake a development of this kind and, accordingly, it was being arranged that a private company would undertake <Col N="1021" /> it as a commercial development and that this was the only way of having it brought to fruition.  That was the only reference made to the private company.  There was no discussion of any kind about the structure, membership or financing of that private company.</P>
    <P>I indicated to the members my support for the provision of one or more marinas in Dún Laoghaire and that I would see what could be done to have the long-standing administrative delays and difficulties overcome.  As a result, I asked the Office of Public Works to accelerate their consideration of the proposals they had before them.</P>
    <P>In October 1987 the Office of Public Works notified the Harbour Study Group that they agreed in principle to the provision of a marina in the West Pier area of the harbour and in November 1987 they similarly notified the Corporation of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>About the same time, I asked the Minister for the Marine and the Office of Public Works to form a joint working party to expedite development proposals for a marina in the West Pier area in response to the long-standing demand for it.  I indicated that the objective should be to develop a marina as soon as possible, preferably in 1988, in line with the Government commitment to maritime development and to get development projects under way as quickly as possible in view of the appalling employment situation.</P>
    <P>I had no other meeting with any other club or persons about this project.  My sole objective in this matter, therefore, has been to break the log-jam which has blocked efforts being made for many years by responsible interests to advance modernisation and improvement of facilities in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I categorically reject any suggestion that I had any other objective before or subsequent to my meeting with the members of the yacht clubs than the promotion of the public interest through the development of up-to-date maritime amenities and facilities in Dún Laoghaire Harbour. I have no connection or association with any of the yacht or boat clubs in Dún <Col N="1022" /> Laoghaire or with any commercial organisation in any way involved in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  These suggestions are demonstrably untrue.  I call upon those who have put them forward to withdraw them now without reservation.</P>

      <P>To be fair to the Taoiseach I should say I welcome his changed position on the Dún Laoghaire marina project announced last night.  He has acknowledged that his unusual involvement aroused legitimate concerns in Dún Laoghaire.  I would say that cutting through red tape&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is a positive thing but cutting out public scrutiny is another matter altogether.  Following on the Taoiseach's lengthy reply I have two questions: first, did he mislead the political correspondents, or was he misled last week, when he stated that he had met representatives of the three yacht clubs to discuss the marina development?  Does he withdraw his statement that the three yacht clubs have caused this commercial organisation &mdash; MDIL &mdash; to be formed?</P>
      <P>My second question is: was Mr. Freddie Cooney wrong when he was reported in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent,</i> as stating that there were four other people at the luncheon and that only one of them, Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick, had ever met the Taoiseach before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last point first because it has been subjected to some misinterpretation and it is important that it should be corrected.  It is a fact that Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick was not at that luncheon meeting.  Mr. Cooney states that he did not say that he was, but I think it is a matter which can be very easily ascertained beyond yea or nay.  I have given the list of people who were at the meeting.  There was nobody else there and, in particular, Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick was not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> I do not know why Deputy Kennedy should talk about &ldquo;misleading&rdquo;.  I resent that sort of imputation.  I misled nobody in this matter.  I gave a briefing to the political correspondents along the lines I have elaborated in my reply.  My understanding of it was that I was meeting representatives of the yacht clubs.  If Deputies look at the list of people I met I think that would be a reasonable assumption for anybody to make.  There were two former commodores, a member of the Royal Irish Yacht Club and of the National Yacht Clubs, and a man called O'Leary who was a member of the three yacht clubs.  Of course the technical advisers to the Harbour Study Group were also there.  So it was perfectly logical for me to assume that these people were representing yacht clubs.</P>
    <P>The whole history of the thing before that would indicate that they were, because the Harbour Study Group was set up by the four yacht clubs.  The proposal was endorsed by the four commodores. There was a subsequent report in 1987 seeking approval in principle by the Harbour Study Group submitted to the Office of Public Works, again endorsed by the four yacht clubs and that Harbour Study Group was funded by the four yacht clubs.  So it was a very simple, logical thing for me to assume that the people I was talking to were representing the yacht clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's clarification of the position in the public interest.  May I ask the Taoiseach why he did not inform these private individuals, who did not represent the yacht clubs but themselves, at that meeting that the public procedures of Government relating to tendering for State property in the two harbours would have to be adhered to?  Why did he authorise the handing over of the property to those two individuals, one of whom was at the lunch and the other who is well known to the Taoiseach, who, after meeting, him, set up a private company?  Finally, may I ask the Taoiseach if he will in the public interest rescind the Government's <Col N="1024" /> decision giving that State property to those two individuals and arrange, in relation to the harbour management plan, that public tender and public planning applications for all phases, including phase I of this proposed development, will now be brought into full play?</P>

      <P>There was no question of anything going for public tender.  As a matter of fact, in regard to the present proposal, no decision has been taken, the lease has not been signed, the lease is being negotiated.  What happened was that a proposal was put forward by a harbour study group which consisted of representatives of the four yacht clubs and had their full endorsement.  It was that proposal which was put to the Office of Public Works and it was in that connection that that proposal was considered by me, by the Office of Public Works and all those concerned.  It was decided to go ahead with it because it seemed to be the only possible way in which a marina could be provided reasonably quickly in Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>

He had several meetings, to one of which he called in the Navy, to override any objections they might have about the provision of a marina.  It is totally inconsistent for Deputy Desmond to try to suggest that there is anything different in what I proposed and what the Office of Public Works now propose.  A perfectly straightforward proposal was put forward by these people with &mdash; and there is no doubt about this &mdash; the full endorsement of the four yacht clubs for the provision of a marina in the Coal Harbour.  In order to get something underway in Dún Laoghaire and to stop the drift and delay of ten years, I asked the Office of Public Works to get on with their consideration of that proposal.</P>

      <P>Arising from his reply, would the Taoiseach agree that this whole controversy could have been avoided if the Government had followed on the decision taken by the previous Government, in which both Deputy Desmond and myself participated, to establish a harbour authority in Dún Laoghaire? Would he not agree that the function of a harbour authority would be to draw up a development plan with regard to the future development of the harbour and put it on public display for all to see? Would he further agree in view of the fact that the control and management of Dún Laoghaire Harbour has not been transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine that it is completely incorrect for the Minister for the Marine to imply that he has power to grant permission to anybody when this is a function of the Commissioners in the Office of Public Works?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether responsibility for the harbour is transferred from the Office of Public Works to the Minister for the Marine would not affect the setting up of a harbour authority.  The Minister for the Marine could still, if it was thought desirable in the public interest, set up a harbour authority.  I want to clear up that point for Deputy Barrett.  I also have to say to him in all sincerity that whether or not there was a harbour authority or legislation, it would not have stopped the controversy which has been stirred up &mdash; and I think mischievously stirred up &mdash; for the lowest of political reasons.  I want to reiterate that my going out to Dún Laoghaire was purely in the public interest.  I was under the impression that there was widespread local support for this project, that it would be for the benefit of Dún Laoghaire and would get something started in Dún Laoghaire.  I went out in that mood and for that purpose only.  It is totally misleading for Deputy Desmond to say that the luncheon I attended had anything to do with the formation of a company because it has now transpired that steps had been taken to form that company long before I went out to that meeting.  The only reference to that company at the meeting was that it was indicated that yacht clubs themselves were not a suitable vehicle for the providing of any commercial enterprise of this kind and for that purpose a <Col N="1028" /> private company was being established. That was the only reference to a private company at that meeting.  At the meeting I did not even know who was going to be in the private company or who was going to form it.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the personal integrity and honour of Deputy Seán Barrett but that was the rumour and it was an offensive and unfortunate rumour.  In relation to the matter itself, I would like to express deep disappointment at the latest twist to the marina saga as the only Fianna Fáil TD for the area.  Now that the programme has been successfully torpedoed by Deputies Kennedy and Desmond, can the Taoiseach give a commitment as to the future of this amenity?  Will he place a time limit on when the project will begin?  Will he further agree with me that if these plans are not implemented, the future for the economic development of the centre of Dún Laoghaire will be very bleak indeed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Andrews raised those points.  First, I want to say that I sympathise with him in his deep disappointment over this matter because he has been very courageous in standing up for the principle of getting something done in Dún Laoghaire Harbour which is a major national resource and has been lying there under developed for decades.</P>
      <P>I want to say a couple of things to Deputy Andrews.  First, there is a danger that, because of this political controversy which has been deliberately stirred up on this occasion, any desirable projects for that harbour in the future will be endangered; decent people will shy away from it, as I am afraid some of the members of the yacht clubs have shied away from this proposal having backed it up to the last minute.  I want to avail of this opportunity to say that I would not like to be off the Blasket Islands in a force five with some of those Dún Laoghaire yachtsmen.</P>

      <P>I understand Deputy Andrews' concern and I think I can allay it.  What we are doing now in response to legitimately expressed concerns about lack of consultation with certain users and indeed with the discommoding of some traditional users is to delay matters for three months to enable a harbour management plan to be drawn up which, it is hoped, will have the approval of all the users or at least will give them an opportunity to have an input into its preparation. We have set a deadline of three months on the preparation of that plan and it would be still my intention that there would be a marina started in Dún Laoghaire harbour this year.  To that extent I hope that Deputy Andrews and all the others who want to see progress and a development of modern facilities in Dún Laoghaire harbour will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's commitment to the public interest and to the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour and his disappointment that so little development has taken place.  While the yacht clubs harbour study group really involved the yacht clubs, the Taoiseach now knows and acknowledges that there are many other interest groups with a real involvement and commitment in this area also. I would ask the Taoiseach to be flexible with regard to those three months to enable a total exploration of the needs of all the users and potential users of the harbour and an environmental impact analysis to be carried out.  I want to assure the Taoiseach and this House that the groups who have met with him and who have lobbied on this are no Luddites; they care for that harbour and wish for its potential development as dearly as the Taoiseach and everybody else in this House.  I hope that we can build constructively on the meeting the Taoiseach had with the Harbour Watch Committee which is very representative of the interest groups there.  I would ask above all that time be given for the Dún <Col N="1030" /> Laoghaire Harbour Authority and an environmental impact analysis to be set up as well.  That would allay fears and get the support of everybody in the Dún Laoghaire area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Barnes' helpful and constructive approach to this matter.  One of the assurances I can give her is that it was agreed with the people I met last night that the preparation of the harbour management plan would be a function of the planning review group which was being set up but that they would consult with another committee called the Harbour Liaison Committee who represent all the users of the harbour or at least the bulk of them. The planning group will consult with that users committee in drawing up a management plan.  That would meet the suggestion from Deputy Barnes.</P>
      <P>I would hope that it would be possible to prepare a suitable management plan within the three month period but it is not written in stone that it must be done within the three months.  When we have that management plan it would be my wish that it would identify where a marina can be put and then we can get on with the provision of a marina and get something started.</P>
      <P>I do not think we are really going to lose all that much time because it was my original hope that that marina would be in place this year particularly for the tourist industry but I do not think it would have been possible to have it <i>in situ</i> by this summer season.  Therefore, the fact that we will spend this three months now preparing the harbour development plan does not really affect the issue all that much.  It does serve the purpose, and this is in reply to Deputy Barnes, of giving everybody an opportunity to have an input into what is going to happen and see how they will be affected by it.</P>

      <P>In view of the suspension of this proposal for a period of three months or more, as was agreed by the Taoiseach last night, is it proposed now, in accordance with the practice that was established in the financial services centre in Dublin and by the Galway Corporation in relation to a marina in Galway, to invite other proposals or tenders or suggestions from different people as to alternative plans for a marina so that a selection can be made from several proposals as is the normal practice where a public project of this kind is intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows there is no consistent practice.  I am aware of a number of proposals for marinas in different parts of the country where only one proposal was put up and that proposal was decided on its own merits but certainly the harbour study group identified five sites in Dún Laoghaire which are suitable for a marina.  In fact Dún Laoghaire Corporation are thinking of a different one again which would make it six.  So there is a possibility for six different groups to put up proposals for marinas in Dún Laoghaire Harbour or immediately outside it if they so wish.  I have said, again publicly, that if any of the Dún Laoghaire Corporation or any community group or any club or private enterprise wish to put forward a proposal for a marina in Dún Laoghaire Harbour I will make sure that they get every possible consideration.</P>

Is he aware that since July 1986 Dún Laoghaire Corporation have had a request for application to the EC for a grant to develop a feasibility study, and that central to their plans was the idea of a marina development to the west of the <Col N="1032" /> West Pier, not involving the inner harbour at all?

      <P>Tá dualgas Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir leis an nGaeilge leagtha síos in alt 8(1) den Acht um Údarás na Gaeltachta, 1979.  Seo a leanas an fhoráil san alt sin:</P>
      <P>Déanfaidh an tÚdarás caomhnú agus leathadh na Gaeilge mar phríomhmheán cumarsáide sa Ghaeltacht a spreagadh agus cinnteoidh sé gurb í an Ghaeilge a úsáidfear a mhéid is féidir nuair a bheidh a fheidhmeanna á gcomhlíonadh aige agus thar a cheann.</P>
      <P>Bíonn baint ag gach comhalta d'fhoireann an Údaráis le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ar bhealach amháin nó ar bhealach eile.  Den fhoireann a bhíonn ag plé go díreach leis an gceist, tuigim ón Údarás nach bhfuil aon duine le cáilíocht ghairmiúil socheolaíochta/teanga ach go bhfuil an saineolas agus an taithí is gá acu don obair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is as an airgead reatha a bhíonn ar fáil don Údarás (idir deontas-i-gcabhair ón Stát agus teacht isteach ó fhoinsí eile) a dhéantar airgeadú ar imeachtaí na heagraíochta ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Ní thugann an Státchiste soláthar ar leith don Údarás don ghnó sin.  Is ceist don Údarás féin cinneadh a déanamh faoin <Col N="1036" /> tsuim airgid atá ar a chumas a chaitheamh go díreach ar chur chun cinn na teanga. Is ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus leis an nGaeltacht a chuirtear iomlán an airgead Stáit ar fáil don Údarás agus ní fheicimse gur gá na socruithe atá ann faoi láthair a athrú.</P>

      <P>Attendance at this course is considered essential in order that the Naval Service can fulfil their primary role in support of the Defence Forces and their secondary roles in fishery protection, search and rescue and in aid to the civil power situations. The course is of 25 weeks' duration and the total cost, including tuition, use of equipment, travelling, accommodation etc., will amount to £44,000 approximately.</P>
      <P>The aim of the course is to train an officer in the tactical handling of a naval ship and the co-ordinated use of sensors and weapons.  It will enable the officer to maximise the use of the equipment available within the Naval Service, particularly in the areas of surveillance, air-related operations and fire control and gunnery.  On its completion he will be based at the Naval School and on LE <i>Eithne</i> where he will act as an instructor to train other naval officers in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no reduction in overall expenditure on Civil Defence in recent years.  The provision for Civil Defence in the <Col N="1048" /> Defence Estimate for 1988 is £1.765 million. A further £500,000 approximately will be contributed by local authorities.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to a question on this matter on 29 October 1987, Civil Defence provides, among other things, a warning and monitoring network as a protective measure against the hazard of radioactive fall-out in wartime.  This network consists of Department of Defence personnel, the Army Observer Corps, elements of the Garda Síochána, the Meteorological Service, Irish Lights, RTE, certain local authority personnel and volunteer personnel of the Civil Defence Warden Service. It includes radiation-protected national, regional and county control centres with communication links and a broadcasting facility from the national control.  Its equipment includes radiation measurement instruments.  The network is tested once a year through national fall-out exercises and has performed well in these tests.</P>
      <P>Arrangements exist also for advising the public on shelter and on other steps necessary for survival in a fallout situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the risk of fall-out arising from nuclear accident, new monitoring instruments which would give readings down to background level have been acquired for Civil Defence personnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means by saying there has been no cut in the budget or expenditure. My understanding is that from 1985 to 1987 the training budget has been halved with the result that expenditure on Civil Defence is at 1 per cent of the overall Defence budget.  Will the Minister comment on the suggestion that five counties still have to be provided with control centres and that many of the existing control centres in other counties are poorly equipped, particularly in relation to dealing with ventilation and other equipment necessary to secure them during a nuclear fall-out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the budget for training, the Deputy indicated that it has been cut by 50 per cent over a five year period.  In 1983, training costs amounted to £442,871 and in 1988 the amount will be £670,000, an increase of 50 per cent, not a reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made the point that there was a cut of 50 per cent but the reverse is the case.  In order to meet the Civil Defence responsibility for dealing with peace-time accidents, 63 low level radiation instruments were purchased in 1986 and a further 64 instruments will be purchased this month to complete the requirement.  The average number of instruments per county will be three, which is sufficient, as monitoring will mainly be mobile and additional instruments will be issued for monitoring at ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the system each county is expected to have at least one bunker type control centre from where operations can be directed.  I accept the Minister's answer in regard to reading equipment but my information is that in March this year five counties did not have such control centres constructed or available to them and that many of the other centres were substandard.  Will the <Col N="1050" /> Minister comment on that?  This is important from a local authority and national point of view because we are talking about something that does not necessarily arise out of a war.  My question is relevant when one bears in mind that the bulk of our population live within 50 miles of nuclear installations in Britain, such as Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The question in regard to bunker type control centres does not arise.  Monitoring equipment is available in every county.  I should like to point out that the primary responsibility for dealing with hazards arising from peace-time accidents rests with the Department of Energy.  Civil Defence have a supportive role in that as follows: (1), monitoring radition levels throughout the country; (2), monitoring radiation levels on ships, aircraft and vehicles at seaports, airports and border crossings; (3), assisting in implementing decontamination measures as may be decided; (4), participating in the collection of samples of water, grass, vegetables and so on for analysis and, (5), assisting where required in the implementation of control measures.  I must stress that primary responsibility for this rests with another Department.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The ministerial transport jet &mdash; HS 125 &mdash; was returned to service on 17 April, 1988, following completion of a major overhaul, refurbishment and repainting.  A contract for this work was placed with an English firm following the invitation of competitive tenders.  A tender was not received from an Irish firm.  It is not the practice to furnish information relating to contract prices.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the HS 125 should meet the requirements of the ministerial air transport service for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The same veil of secrecy seems to surround the reply to this question as applied to my previous question.  Will the Minister say if there was a hope at any stage that a firm in the Republic or in Northern Ireland would be in a position to tender?  Are we talking about £500,000, £1 million or £2 million because there are wild rumours circulating that this was the costliest aircraft reconstruction that has ever taken place? It is only on the floor of the House that the Minister will allay those fears.  I understand that the successful company was highly paid to refurbish the Government jet.  The onus is on the Minister to dispel all rumours.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> To maximise the possibility of an Irish involvement tenders for the work to be performed were invited in two parts.  One dealt with the overhaul which would require a qualified firm involved in the maintenance of this type of aircraft.  Two Irish firms might have been in a position to meet that requirement and all four <Col N="1052" /> Irish firms might have been in a position to undertake the refurbishment and repainting but no tender was received from any Irish firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have, which I must believe, is that there was not enough emphasis placed on the possibility of a tender from an Irish firm being successful for part of the job.  It appears that the Department wanted a contract for the entire job and were not interested in dealing with subcontractors. I find it hard to understand that at a time when we have reached a certain level of technology here some of our State agencies were not in a position to take up this work.  It is a little glib of the Minister to say that because an Irish firm was not in a position to tender for all the work the contract went out of the country.</P>

      <P>This is a great bone of contention, as the Minister will be aware.  I am sure the Minister has seen the many letters in our national newspapers about the poor level of remuneration paid to members of the Defence Forces.  The matter has come to a head in the last six months after members of the Defence Forces stood in gallantly on behalf of the civil power in the disputes involving firemen and prison officers.  I understand that the differences in the rates of pay of fire officers and prison officers, on the one hand, and of members of the Defence Forces is alarming.  It appears that there is a sea of difference between their rates of pay.  That will not lead to content in the Army.  In reviewing his policy the Minister should do something about the remuneration of the lower grades in the Army.  We will not have happy members in our Defence Forces if there is a great difference between their remuneration and that of people in like occupations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47b:</P>
      <P>In page 55, subsection (3) (a), line 46, to delete &ldquo;£100,000,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£102,000,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Government have recently received an unanimous recommendation from the central review committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which brings together trade union, employer and other interests asking that the Government consider the £10 duty.  The committee stressed their concern about the possible impact of the duty on the moves towards systems of cashless salary and pay transactions. Having considered the views of the committee and the views expressed in this House during the Second Stage debate, the Government have decided not to proceed with the £10 ATM card charge.  I am therefore proposing an amendment to delete section 62.</P>
      <P>I am also proposing amendments to section 60 in order to raise by way of an increase in the bank levy the £6 million which would have been raised from the ATM charge.  The bank levy has not been increased for five years from the 1983 level of £25 million, despite the very significant jump in bank profits in that period.  The increase to £36 million now proposed is justified, especially in the context of the low corporation tax contributions from the banking sector.  The amendments to section 60 will secure this increase.  This will be done by altering the first tranche of leviable resources from £100 million to £102 million and by increasing the co-efficient applied to leviable resources in excess of that amount from 0.36 per cent to 0.45 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister for his explanation of the amendments.  Naturally we are pleased that the proposal to impose a £10 levy on <Col N="1090" /> ATM cash cards is being withdrawn as a consequence of these amendments being moved.  It would have been better if the Minister had found alternative means for raising the £6 million yield which he is foregoing as a result of deleting section 62.</P>
      <P>I welcome the move to abolish the cash card levy.  Our opposition to the measure was always presented on the basis that the Minister would have to find the revenue elsewhere.  A better way of doing things might have been to nominate other bank charges as a substitute, but I understand why the Minister is raising the levy to give a corresponding yield.  Is he outlining his intentions for the future in regard to the bank levy?  Does he regard this as coming under the general heading of excise duties which will have to be harmonised as we proceed towards 1992?  If so, is he not making life more difficult for himself or his successors by loading the levy in this manner rather than ensuring an adequate take from the banking sector by other means?</P>
      <P>I accept the amendments and will not oppose the section, on the basis that it substitutes for section 62.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan.  The substitution of the increased levy for the stamp duty on ATM cards is a good idea in the circumstances. I am worried as to whether the particular hostility to the ATM card levy was based on temporary considerations such as the development of Irish banking now or more long term considerations.  I know the Minister is withdrawing the section but I should like to ask what revenue effect the introduction of ATM cards had on stamp duty and other similar revenue items.  Many people like myself use cash cheques as a means of generating revenue.  Is there a noticeable decline in the unit of stamp duty on cheques by virtue of the wider use of ATM cards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give some indication as to the way he sees the bank levy going in the years ahead?  I know it is customary for Ministers for <Col N="1091" /> Finance not to give any indication of what they intend to do in any future year, which is quite convenient from the point of view of the administrators and quite politically expedient from the point of view of the Minister.  However, it does not necessarily lead to good financial or fiscal planning.  It seems that the continued reliance of Irish financial policy on bank levies will be, to say the least, short term in its duration.  Remembering that we will have complete freedom of movement of capital as a result of the introduction of the Single European Act, I realise that the Government have put in certain derogation markers as far as that is concerned.  I do not think this will survive very long.  If we are, as we wish to be, recipients for the doubling of the structural funds, many of the derogations which we have claimed will prove to be as flimsy as the paper on which they are written.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a stranger to theory, Sir, in matters of this kind.  The very practical consideration is that if the withdrawal of the ATM card levy is being financed by an increase in the bank levy, how long can the bank levy continue given that there will be complete freedom of competition between banks established here that will be paying the levy and banks established elsewhere that will not?  The question I ask myself is: can this stratagem last, which the Minister has chosen to get himself out of this political difficulty into which he voluntarily went?  If so, for how long?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can it be reconciled with 1992 freedom of competition and the ability of people, if they want, to bank with the Banco Ambrosiano or with the National Westminster Bank in London, or any other offshore banking institution in <Col N="1092" /> which they can write their cheques and have their accounts &mdash; banks that are not paying the bank levy and are competing directly with the banks here who are running large overheads and bank structures in this country?  How will we be able to make that levy stick?</P>
    <P>I realise that we give a hostage to fortune straight away, that Governments other than that represented by the Minister have used the bank levy as a convenient method of filling up a hole in the budgetary arithmetic, usually rather late in the budget-making process.  I am not claiming any superiority over the Minister in terms of the political side of the matter in this regard.  We all know that the bank levy has been used and abused as a method of filling a gap.  However, the fact is that it is not something that will last, or can last, if we are to have a genuinely competitive banking sector.</P>
    <P>There is much worry here at the moment about 1992 but it is largely unfocused worry.  People feel that they should be worried about something, but are not quite sure what it is that they should be worried about.  In my opinion, one of the things about which we should be extremely worried is employment in banks here.  Banking, far more than manufacturing industry, and the financial services sector generally far more than manufacturing industry, are those which have most to fear from 1992.  They are the sector that are going to face the real competition in 1992.  It is bad enough that most surveys have indicated that we have a rather inefficient banking sector, possibly a rather overstaffed, under-automated one.  If, on top of that, we have a special, unique Government tax, that will add to the difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have many firsts in this country in the area of taxation.  We have been more ingenious in devising new taxes than most &mdash; that is credit to somebody but I am not quite sure who.  One of our ingenuities has been the banks levy.  It seems that will not have a very long life in the Europe of 1992, given that our banks are supposed to compete.  I cannot produce the figure off the top of my head but given <Col N="1093" /> that there is a very substantial number of people employed in banking here, given that they are going to face the greatest threat, possibly, of all sectors in the post-1992 era, I wonder if the bank levy has a long-term future and if the Minister could &mdash; to use the American phrase &mdash; share with us his thoughts on this matter as to where this bank levy is going next year and the year after?</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to have the bank levy excluded from the budget arithmetic for 1989, now is the time when he should be getting Government agreement to such course of action in view of 1992.  There is not much point in leaving it hanging and allowing his colleagues in the last few days before the word processor has started rolling on budget documentation to say at that stage that they forgot to point out that the bank levy should be got rid of because it cannot be sustained for very long.  If the Minister intends to get rid of the bank levy in view of 1992, now, or about now &mdash; possibly away from the budget process itself &mdash; the Government should be making a decision.  I should like to press the Minister as to his intentions thereon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton particularly will know, it is difficult enough to deal with one Finance Bill at a time without talking about what one may or may not do or consider doing in 1989.  A number of Deputies have raised the question of what will happen in 1992. In that year it is hoped will come the harmonisation of indirect taxes, not direct taxes.  The whole reason for the bank levy is the corporation tax contribution from the banking profits and other factors.  That is why it was introduced in the first instance.  How long term it might be one can only judge from the fact that it has been in place since 1981 and is being renewed again this year, 1988, and being increased.  In that regard, I should like to put on the record that in the period between 1983 and 1987 the post-tax profits of the two main associated bank groups grew, by 65 per cent in the case of AIB and 76 per cent in the <Col N="1094" /> case of the Bank of Ireland.  The bank levy, in contrast, has remained unchanged at £25 million since 1983 and is being increased this year to £36 million, which is a rise of 44 per cent.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell spoke about the impact that the ATM cards may have had on other stamp duties.  We could see that as only marginal.  Stamp duty on cheques is steady so we did not think there would be any problem in that regard.  It would be only slight if there was one.  It was not taken into the arithmetic, anyhow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing slightly the point I was making.  I acknowledge that there is not a requirement to harmonise direct taxation.  I know that corporation tax was left out of the White Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but I know that it is not part of the 1992 process. However, that is not the point I was making.  Perhaps I did not put it too clearly.  It was that there would be freedom of establishment and free movement of capital in regard to banking and freedom of services as well as freedom of establishment, as I understand it, in banking.  One does not have to have a bank here.  One would be able to sell banking services into the market of another member state without having a bank here at all.  At one end of the computer terminal one can conduct one's business.  In other words, the big accounts that have that facility would be the ones that would be targeted by banks in other parts of Europe.  The Minister says with justification that bank lending has not increased as rapidly as bank profits since 1983.  On the other hand there is not a bank levy of this kind on any of the competitor banks with the Irish banks, so that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. In the very competitive environment in which they will now live, will <Col N="1095" /> they be able to easily bear such a levy? Whether it is required to be harmonised out of existence or not does not really matter.  If the competitive conditions are such that the Irish banks cannot afford any extra levy, they will be at a disadvantage. That is really my point.  In the era of the open playing field in terms of European banking can a levy of this kind be justified?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned increases in profit levels in the banks between 1983 and 1987 and quoted figures for AIB of a 65 per cent increase and a 67 per cent increase for the Bank of Ireland.</P>

      <P>They are related to the section.  I have not kept re-establishing the link verbally but I will do so.  This <Col N="1096" /> section and these amendments are replacing the ATM charge with the bank levy.  This legislation, in the absence of amendment will have a lasting effect. Therefore, one is entitled to speculate about the viability in future years of the proposals being made here today and that is strictly what I am talking about.  I would respectfully suggest to the Chair that I am keeping very much within order, for this once, anyway.</P>
      <P>I am essentially worried that this is not a very viable proposition.  I know the banks have expressed that view and they are well able to speak for themselves.  I am not concerned particularly about the banks but I am concerned that we should not put a measure in place to make the budgetary situation for this year look good if this cannot last in subsequent years.  My contention in this argument is that by replacing the ATM charge, which is a silly tax, with the bank levy which is essentially a temporary tax, the Minister is not solving anything in long term budgetary terms.  The Minister has not yet answered that point.</P>

      <P>A lot of points similar to those raised in the first instance by the Deputy have been raised, more or less implying that we can and should tell him what may or may not be done in future years.  Nobody likes taxation.  I am sure Ministers for Finance do not like imposing it or imposing levies for that matter.  As the Deputy and the House will know, what will happen to this levy in future years will depend totally on the corporation tax contributions from banking profits.  That will be the criteria in the end.  Of course it does not matter what the issue is, when one is talking about increased revenue in whatever form it comes to the Exchequer.  It is there for a number of reasons but mainly because of the high levels of expenditure we have and the high level of borrowing and debt and because we are still borrowing substantial sums of money.</P>

Let nobody be under any illusion; the facts are that the banks are charging for the use of automated teller machine cards.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Can the Minister tell us what is the purpose of reducing the rate from 6 per cent to 5 per cent and can he justify the fairly tight parameters within which it falls, between £50,000 and £60,000?

      <P>The stamp duty thresholds on houses and lands have remained unchanged since the mid-seventies despite increases in property values in the meantime.  Because of the big cost involved there is no prospect at this time of any major downward adjustment in the duty.  I am particularly concerned, however, at the rather drastic impact of the transition from the 4 per cent rate of tax to the 6 per cent rate on the threshold price of £50,000 and, therefore, I am introducing a rate of 5 per cent for houses and lands in the price range of between £50,000 and £60,000.  This modification <Col N="1101" /> will cost the Exchequer about £700,000 this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Minister is aware that at the very least there is considerable avoidance and probably evasion of paying stamp duty under the guise of selling fixtures and furnishings and the like with premises in order to avoid thresholds such as this one.  It strikes me that it might be worth the Minister's while to consider restructuring stamp duty completely and to introduce a flat-rate of stamp duty with a basic allowance.  I think this is the position in England where the first X amount of money is disregarded and thereafter it is charged at a certain percentage.  I think the rate is lower there than it is here but there might be fewer artificial transactions if there was a flat-rate of stamp duty and if the lower rates were effectively done away with or modified and replaced by an allowance of a certain sum of money to be disregarded in each transaction.  I am interested to know whether the Minister would consider this as a more preferable way of approaching this problem.  I agree with him that it is necessary to do something to stop these steps having an artificial effect on transactions. The right way to go about it would be to ignore, say, the first £10,000 or £20,000 and put a flat-rate of 4 per cent on everything above it with a view to arriving at the same level of revenue in overall terms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a minor drafting error in paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of amendment No. 48a in my name.  The reference in that paragraph to subparagraph (i) should be a reference to subparagraph (ii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 58, before section 63, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;63.  &mdash; The Second Schedule of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976 is hereby amended by the substitution of `£30,000' for `£20,000' in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 1 of Part I of the Schedule.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose for putting down this amendment is to put the proposition to the Minister that the threshold in respect of certain capital transfers has not been amended for a significant period of time. The reason I raise this issue is that a man who lives in Blackrock and who is not a constituent of mine wrote to me to say that he was living with his sister in a house and that they were of very modest means. Because the threshold of capital acquisitions tax in respect of brother and sister inheritances has not been amended, he fears that the effect of the failure to index the amount of that particular limit &mdash; he owns the house &mdash; would be that his sister would have to sell the house on his death whereas she would not have had to sell it if he had died at the time the limit was fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure to index the threshold for payment of that tax has led to a position where fairly modest transactions between brothers and sisters as opposed to between husbands and wives &mdash; both of these people are elderly and this house is their only abode &mdash; attract fairly heavy rates of taxation and in the circumstances there should be some effort made to keep <Col N="1103" /> the real value of thresholds in this area up to date with the real value which they had at the time the limits were fixed.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to estimate how much this would cost the Exchequer and I am not putting it forward on the basis that I am demanding this as a matter of urgent necessity but what I am saying is that the purpose of putting down this amendment is to try to elucidate why comparatively small transactions are becoming more heavily taxed at a time when the people affected by them are not in a position to meet the tax liability.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that I am not quite happy with the differentiation between brother and sister transfers of wealth and father and son or grandfather and grandson transfers of wealth.  It seems that the direct lineal descendant is entitled to a far better threshold than a brother or sister &mdash; I think I am right in saying that &mdash; and that in some circumstances this can be a grave injustice. A grandfather and grandaughter transfer could be much more at arms length and a much more taxable transaction in moral terms than a brother and sister transfer in circumstances where they are an elderly couple dependent on their own home.  I ask the Minister to quantify the cost of what has been proposed in the amendment and to indicate why it is that such transactions are becoming more and more heavily taxed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to increase from £20,000 to £30,000 the class B threshold which applies in the case of gifts and inheritances taken by a lineal ancestor, a lineal descendant other than a child or certain grandchildren, a brother, a sister, a nephew or a niece of the disponer. The yield from capital acquisitions tax, excluding taxes on discretionary trusts, is in the order of £20 million.  On average the tax from gifts and inheritances subject to the class B threshold has been around 55 per cent of the total and in a full year would amount to approximately £12 million.  It is estimated that increasing the <Col N="1104" /> threshold from £20,000 to £30,000, would cost £5 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because of the cost involved and the fact that it would narrow the existing tax base of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point about a brother and sister living together in the family home and when one dies the other inheriting a property which would have a market value of £50,000.  In such a case the inheritance tax could be anything up to £8,000.  There are two points which are of relevance here: first, the proceeds of approved insurance policies are exempt from inheritance tax where the insured took out the policy expressly to pay inheritance tax arising on his or her death.  In other words, a person can insure against liability to capital acquisitions tax in the same way as they would for other potential liabilities arising on their death.  Second, the scheme of capital acquisitions tax bases the taxable value of an absolute interest in property on the market value of the property but bases the taxable value of a life interest in property on the market value, reduced by a percentage, dependent on the sex and age of the life tenant.  If the brother and sister referred to were to take the house as life interest rather than absolutely, the liability to tax would be reduced considerably. For example, the sister, if aged 75 years, on an inheritance valued at £50,000, would pay no tax if she took a life interest in the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that observation because, in relation to the people I was talking about, it does afford them a way out.  It is something I had not thought of and they had not thought of either.  However, it does leave unanswered what is at the heart of all of this, that is that the differentiation between husband-wife transactions and parent-child transactions, on the one hand, and brother-sister transactions does not seem to me to be a very fair one.  I know these things have to be crude, they have to be subjected to an objective test and cannot take into account the <Col N="1105" /> closeness of relatives; for example, sometimes a brother in Australia might never have seen the person to whose estate he was succeeding.  It does seem to me that to fail to index link some of the thresholds which I believe are low and to leave what I believe to be unduly high thresholds as between the closer group to which I referred earlier, represents a value judgment difficult to defend in individual circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell in regard to this aspect of thresholds.  It has been brought to my attention that these thresholds may inhibit markets, say, for standing timber in forestry where there could be difficulties encountered with this £200,000 threshold.  Has the Minister considered the effect that the non-examination of these limits would have on the creation of sales of forestry &mdash; which for this country would be a new market &mdash; between various finance houses in the future?  I do not believe there has been any loss to the State to date in this regard because nothing has fallen due.  However, in the future this may well occur.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the threshold.</P>

      <P>If we were to do what Deputy McDowell's amendment suggests it would amount to more than one-third of the actual cost.  That is out of the question.  We can all agree with further narrowing the tax base.  That is very laudable but one must pose the question: can we do it in the context of the budgetary and financial circumstances prevailing generally?  That is the issue and every single pound counts.  As I have said, in many cases, people can insure against this liability.  As I have outlined to the House they can also do it in a different way &mdash; take life tenancy rather than absolute ownership, overcoming what can be a very severe tax liability for them.</P>

      <P>There are two aspects to the creation of the forestry market about which I speak.  There is no loss at present under the current threshold.  However, I contend relief should be granted under the provisions of section 61 for stamp duty on the transfer of semimature timber when this market is created. After all it should be remembered that the new forestry board being set up by the State will require to trade in this market, when it will be seen that this 6 per cent stamp duty will constitute a disincentive.  I should like to table an amendment to section 61, seeking such exemption, on Report Stage if the Minister is not willing to concede an examination of the matter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I see that in the explanatory memorandum there is a separate note on section 64 (8) which reads:</P>
      <P>Section 64 (8) will enable the Minister for Finance to use savings arising from debt management to directly reduce debt service costs.  At present savings have to be brought into the Exchequer as Miscellaneous (Non-Tax) Revenue.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance always refuse to allow other Departments to operate in this manner.  Is there to be one rule henceforth for the Department of Finance, with the other Departments still being debarred from dealing with transfers in this way?</P>

      <P>I suppose it is best to put on record the note I have here on section 64.  The system operated through the Capital Services Redemption Account is designed to amortise the expenditure on voted capital services over a 30-year period.  The amortisation payments which are paid into the Capital Services Redemption Account each year, in respect of each year's voted capital services, are charged on the central fund, thus against the current budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year a new 30-year annuity is set up based on estimated expenditure on voted capital services in that year.  In the following year when actual expenditure <Col N="1108" /> is known, the annuity is adjusted for the remaining 29 years.  A portion of each annuity is earmarked as the interest element and a sum not exceeding the total of these interest elements may be paid from the account towards meeting interest on Exchequer borrowing each year.  The balance of the annuities is used in any of the ways specified in the Finance Act, 1950, which set up the account <i>vis-á-vis</i>, that is, for debt redemption or for investment in Government securities or in certain other specified areas.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to facilitate the issuance of securities by Bord Telecom Éireann and Irish Telecommunications Investments plc.  I want to put a question to the Minister, and I know it may be a rather awkward one to bounce off him now.  Do the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, in relation to the issuance of securities apply to these two bodies and, in particular, do the set of provisions in the Companies Act, 1963, which relate to prospectuses accompanying the issuing of debentures by these bodies apply to them?  Maybe I am not making myself very clear.  Under the 1963 Act if a limited liability company issue debentures or securities they are obliged, if they resort to accompanying documentation, to comply with the rules of the Companies Act in relation to prospectuses. Any documentation issued to support the floating of debentures or securities is required to conform with the rules of the Companies Act relating to prospectuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I am asking this question in relation to these two companies is that <Col N="1110" /> there has been considerable disquiet expressed on the part of some of our banks who find themselves unable to issue paper securities accompanied by relevant advertising or promotional material.  They are unable to float these securities with any accompanying material because they are deemed to require a prospectus under the Companies Act.  Does it apply to these companies? I do not expect the Minister to have this advice available to him now but could he indicate tomorrow whether the Government have any plans to relax the provisions of the Companies Act in relation to the issuing of debentures and securities by certain groups, including banks, so as to excuse them from the onerous liability of preparing a separate prospectus for each issue.</P>

      <P>The existing legislation governing the fees and expenses to be paid to sheriffs and county registrars for their services in the execution of warrants for the recovery of civil debts, including tax debts, is set out in the various sheriff's fees orders 1926 to 1963. The sheriff is entitled in law to seize and sell the debtor's goods to recover the debt due.  In most instances, however, seizure is sufficient to encourage the debtor to pay the debt without recourse to selling the goods.  In either case the sheriff is entitled to poundage on the amount of the debt.  The sheriff's rights and entitlements in this regard are not in doubt. However, because of the large number of warrants for tax debts that have been placed in the hands of sheriffs in recent years, the practice has grown up whereby sheriffs demand payment of the outstanding tax debt and the relevant poundage in a written application to the defaulter before moving to the seizure stage.  I understand that the tax and the poundage are paid in most cases on foot <Col N="1115" /> of this application.  This practice has certain positive aspects.  It affords the debtor a final opportunity to pay over his debt before seizure, and it avoids the large-scale disruption and sense of grievance that seizure involves.  However it now appears that there may be some legal uncertainty as to the entitlement of sheriffs to poundage in these circumstances. While the Attorney General has expressed the view that there is possible authority for the proposition that poundage is payable in respect of money collected by sheriffs on behalf of the State without recourse to seizure, nevertheless he considers that legislation should be introduced to put the matter beyond doubt.  This is the objective of the provisions before the House which relate only to tax debts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank the Minister for his information. I can see the necessity for moving this amendment.  There is a fairly strong body of opinion that there is no legal basis at all for poundage on tax debts in the manner in which the Minister has described.  For the benefit of those of us whose memories of sheriffs are a bit vague and for whom the relevance of sheriffs in our lives disappeared when we stopped going to cowboy films and have only become relevant again in the last 18 months or so, would the Minister outline the poundage rates which apply now when sheriffs proceed to collect tax debts?  Second, would the Minister explain to me whether the poundage is an additional amount calculated on the amount of debt recovered but additional to that debt, or whether it is a deduction from the debt which is returned to the Revenue Commissioners?  To put it the other way around, if the sheriff proceeds to collect £1,000, is the poundage which arises on that £1,000 an additional payment which the tax defaulter has to make to the sheriff, or is it part of the £1,000 recovered which the sheriff deducts <Col N="1116" /> before he transfers the debt to the Revenue Commissioners?  I presume it is additional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If it is additional does it not seem to be carrying it a little bit too far to inflict the full poundage fee in cases where the Revenue Commissioners put a particular case in the hands of the sheriff and the sheriff proceeds to recover the debt and sends a letter or a warrant or whatever the legal term is to the tax defaulter, which encourages the tax defaulter to settle.  I would have thought the poundage fee originated from the concept that a sheriff was entitled to be paid for the work he carried out, particularly if he seized goods and sold them.  Obviously the difficulties created by that sequence of events and the amount of time and effort spend by a sheriff and his staff on that justified the poundage.  Certainly the case could be made very strongly if the seizure resulted in the sale of goods rather like a sale by an auctioneer when a certain percentage would go to the sheriff who organised this.  I can also see that, if the sheriff had gone to the stage where he seized the goods and then the debt was settled and the goods were recovered, poundage would arise.  But it seems to be the practice now, and may be the Minister could throw light on this, that where there is no question of sale, where there is not even a seizure, once the initial move is made by the sheriff to recover the tax outstanding and the tax is paid over, the liability for poundage arises, and that liability can be quite large when the amounts due are large.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is what is questionable and that is what the Minister is putting beyond doubt here in the section.  Surely it is time to look at the whole question of poundage charges and relate them to the amount of effort that has been put into the process.  It <Col N="1117" /> seems to me that quite large poundage charges arising simply from the delivery of a letter or its equivalent from a sheriff's office to a tax defaulter might suggest that the sheriffs are being overpaid in that respect.  I would like the Minister to throw some light on that area.  He knows what I am getting at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put firmly on the record of this House that I believe we must have an efficient system of tax collection.  We must have a system which is business like and which does not mollycoddle those who are not complying with their obligations.  I want that assumed for the purpose of what I am now going to say, which is that this measure as proposed by the Minister is highly unjust.  It is not intended to be unjust but it is.  The reason it is unjust is set out in 2 (a) on page 2 of the list of amendments before us.  It provides that:</P>
      <P>Where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an execution order or certificate...</P>
      <P>that is, a certificate effectively of tax due from a relevant revenue official</P>
      <P>relating to a relevant amount is lodged, whether before or after the passing of this Act,</P>
      <P>and this is the first thing, that it is going to apply retrospectively,</P>
      <P>with the appropriate sheriff or county registrar for execution,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the sheriff or, as the case may be, the county registrar gives notice to the defaulter of the lodgement or of his intention to execute the execution order or certificate by seizure of the property of the defaulter to which it relates, or demands payment by the defaulter of the relevant amount,</P>
      <P>and I pause there to question whether that is retrospective because I do not think it is, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> (iii) the whole or part of the relevant amount is paid to the sheriff or, as the case may be, the county registrar or to the Collector-General, after the giving of the notice or the making of the demand, aforesaid, then, for the purpose of the liability of the defaulter for the payment of fees and of the exercise of any rights or powers in relation to the collection of fees for the time being vested by law in sheriffs and county registrars&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>effectively the sheriff is deemed to have entered into possession and seized the goods and, second, the payment shall be deemed to have been levied by the sheriff and fees shall be payable accordingly, including poundage fees.  What does that mean?  Let us suppose that in relatively innocent circumstances &mdash; and I am not suggesting that every person who does not comply with their tax obligations is free from fault &mdash; due to non-availability of funds I owe the Collector-General, say, £100,000; I am putting together the wherewithal to pay what I owe the Collector-General, fully intend and am making strenuous efforts to pay it, and have negotiated a loan with the bank to raise it; on the day I go down to my bank manager to ask him for accommodation to pay the Collector-General this money, an envelope comes from my local sheriff notifying me that he has received this certificate and is demanding this money and by that very fact becomes entitled to commission even though I am on my way to pay the money and even though it is my intention to pay it.</P>
    <P>I am picking out a hard case where somebody intends to pay and is putting his money together and while he is doing that a demand comes through his letterbox from the sheriff.  The sheriff, as Deputy Noonan has said, has done nothing except fill out a form and send it off and he will become entitled to a percentage of the entire sum.  I suggest that there is an easy way around this.  I would ask the Minister to take on board the point I am making.  If you allow some period to elapse, for example, seven days <Col N="1119" /> or 14 days, between the arrival of the demand note from the sheriff and the liability to pay poundage, at least, the person cannot claim that he was just on his way to pay the debt.  There will be cases where people will get the sheriff's letter at a time when they had the money ready to give to the Revenue Commissioners and by an entirely artificial process of filling out a form they will become obliged to pay another percentage to a person whose efforts in recovering the money have been minimal.</P>
    <P>I accept that I am taking a hard case. Hard cases make bad law and I accept that, too but we are here to make a just law.  It seems to me that if the Minister were to amend subsection (3) to provide that the whole or part of the relevant payment be paid to the sheriff at a date later than, say, seven days after service of the notice on him then, at least, it could be said that the sheriff's threat was the casual factor in securing payment. Somebody receiving the letter would become aware that because the letter came through his letterbox he was liable, if he did not pay the debt within seven days, to poundage fees.  It is unfair to allow somebody to take a commission on a debt simply by writing a letter, if it is not the causing factor in the payment of that debt.  The best way, I suggest, to differentiate between cases where the payment was about to come and cases where the letter intervened by accident is to leave a time limit between the two. If the Minister would say seven days or some other period, injustice would be avoided.  I have put down parliamentary questions on this matter.  Some sheriffs are doing very nicely out of the whole arrangement.  I do not criticise them because they took on an onerous job, and to some extent it is not a very socially acceptable job.  Since the days of the Bible the publican or tax collector has been execrated as the lowest of the low.  I do not deny them their percentage where they do the work because it is not pleasant work; it is hard and stressful work but by getting a clerk in an office to send off a <Col N="1120" /> standard form sheet they are to receive a percentage commission on a very large sum of money which the person who was obliged to pay fully intended paying anyway, and was about to pay, seems to me to be unfair.  I would ask the Minister to put in a limit of, say, seven days for poundage and to restrict the rights of sheriffs to receive their poundage commission to cases where the payment was not made within seven days of the demand being made.  That would, in my view, obviate unfairness.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think this is nit-picking but I do not.  I am trying to prevent an injustice being done.  I would prefer not to have a vote on this amendment but as it is, it is a bald demand of a tax debtor. The mere fact that he receives another letter in the midst of his efforts to clear up his arrangements makes him liable to a further sum of money is too harsh.  It is giving a benefit to the sheriff which is not due to him in any moral sense.  The writing of a letter could not give rise to an entitlement to a percentage of the take unless there was a delay between the time the notice was given and the payment being made.</P>

    <P>I am not condoning tax evasion.  I cannot do that but I object to the strong arm tactics of the sheriff and his henchmen, or deputies.  I would like to describe them as latter day Gestapo people.  They are using terror tactics to get their pound of flesh.  I would like to ask the Minister to create a buffer zone similar to what Deputy McDowell was talking about so that people who are genuinely making an effort to offset their tax liabilities would not be subjected to what they are being <Col N="1121" /> subjected to by the Gestapo, by the sheriff and his staff, and that time be provided to allow for the orderly payment of money or, indeed, part payment of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to encourage the Revenue to take a more compassionate approach to people in difficulty.  In my part of the world almost everybody who has survived is in difficulty.  I believe that a compassionate approach to people who are genuinely in difficulty but who are prepared to meet their obligations is needed. The Revenue Commissioners are using the strong arm tactics &mdash; and I cannot approach it in any other way &mdash; of the sheriff to extract revenue that, perhaps, has been owing for ten years.  They are now making an effort to get that tax in in one year.  In an area which has all but succumbed because of neglect by successive Governments, and this Government are no exception, to cram ten years of arrears into one year is impossible. That is why the sheriff has reaped a rich harvest in the Border area from the hapless people who are still carrying our business there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should introduce some type of compassionate clause to allow the genuine people, who want to pay their debts and who are not running away from them, to pay them in a phased and orderly manner over a period.  I am asking him to create a buffer zone to allow people to negotiate with the Revenue, through legitimate and certified accountants, and not to subject people to having the sheriff <Col N="1122" /> arrive on their door and demanding &mdash; in some cases kicking down the door &mdash; the goods belonging to wives and children.</P>
    <P>People in this country are now being subjected, because of business failure, to the goods and assets of wives being seized.  In many cases the assets are the remnants of old family businesses.  The people concerned could have avoided their liabilities &mdash; as many of the sophisticated companies do &mdash; by seeking to go into liquidation.  These people have to be protected from the ravages of the sheriff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I must deal with Deputy McGahon's points first.  Like the Acting Chairman before you, Sir, I say it was wrong that he described sheriffs in the way he did.  They are only doing their job under the law as laid down by this House, no more and no less.</P>
      <P>It is no harm as we discuss this issue to put on the record the position as we find it in recent times in so far as the level of compliance is concerned.  It is far from satisfactory.  The delays in remitting PAYE, PRSI, and VAT are at a chronic level.  That is money collected by people from the public at large not being passed over to the Exchequer.  In the course of a year about 900,000 monthly PAYE and PRSI returns and bi-monthly VAT returns are still not received six weeks after the due date.  In some 400,000 cases payments are received between six weeks and 12 months after the due date.  Deputies will appreciate the difficulties that will have on the cash flow for the Exchequer. Non-compliance in the case of taxes at present directly assessed by the Revenue Commissioners, that is non-PAYE income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax, which are due once a year, imposes an additional burden on enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For income tax there are at present some 46,000 items where the Revenue Commissioners are pressing for payment and 444,000 items under or awaiting enforcement by sheriffs and the courts. For corporation tax 6,000 items are under collection and 48,000 at or awaiting <Col N="1123" /> enforcement.  For the health contribution, youth employment levy and arrears of the income levy abolished since April 1986, 480,000 items are under collection and 790,000 awaiting enforcement. Due to the shortage of computer staff in the Revenue Commissioners and the lack of capacity at sheriff level up to now, no enforcement action has been taken in respect of the health contributions or the levies.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is happening here now and what has been happening since 1986 from that sort of perspective and background.  I can tell Deputy McDowell that there is no doubt many hardship cases will be involved in those tens of thousands and even up to a million cases. No matter how we try, there will still be some hardship cases but we will do our utmost to alleviate in any way any hardship involved.  Basically, we are talking here about huge arrears of tax due to the Exchequer.  We have had, and we may even have before this debate concludes, crocodile tears for the PAYE sector and the amount of tax they pay, and the high levels of tax being paid by them at present.  That tax is stopped by employers to be handed over to the Exchequer and in some 900,000 cases PAYE and PRSI and bi-monthly VAT returns are not handed over six weeks after the date they were due.  How can anybody run the State and all its expenses with that sort of delay in payment?</P>
    <P>From that sort of background we had the introduction in 1986 of this new regime.  Because of the doubt that has been raised in relation to the levying of poundage we want to put it beyond doubt in this amendment here today for this new section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan rightly raised the point in relation to fees and expenses payable to sheriffs and I will give the details as I have them.  The fees and expenses which are in general payable by the debtor are set out in the Sheriff's Fees Orders, 1926 to 1963, and are broadly as follows: a lodgement fee of 35p on lodgement of the execution order with the sheriff; the poundage fee of 5 per cent on the first <Col N="1124" /> 100£ and 2.5 per cent on the balance of the amount levied on foot of the execution order: 75p for the services of the court messenger; travelling expenses of 7.5p per statute mile if the place of execution is more than five miles from the sheriff's office; 45p per day for a man left in possession of goods if he is boarded and 62.5p per day if he is not; the actual and necessary costs and expenses incurred in removing, maintaining, storing and selling the seized goods.  Quite a number of those charges could be updated and modernised because I think nothing has been done with them since 1963.</P>
    <P>I think most of the information was given in reply to a question some weeks ago but I will give the position, leaving Dublin and Cork out of it.  Since the new sheriffs came in in 1987 there were 5,962 certificate warrants leading to a collection of £16,340 million.  To 30 April 1988, 4,000 such warrants were issued and collection was made of £11,968 million approximately.  Therefore, we can see enormous progress is being made.</P>
    <P>One can appreciate the difficulties Deputy McDowell referred to in relation to people assembling all and waiting for payment.  They would have had ample opportunity to pay prior to the sheriff being involved at all.  We would obviously need to have the sheriff with all his powers before people would really take any notice even of the notification from the sheriff.  I will give some further information.</P>
    <P>Issues of section 485 certificates as they are called in recent years have been very heavy in order to counter the chronic late payments problems that have emerged. I have referred to those.  In 1987 the numbers issued had risen to 122,809. Given volumes on this scale, clearly it would not be possible to seize in all cases but if poundage was not imposed on the defaulter the sheriff's sanction would be literally useless.  A defaulter could with impunity ignore all warnings and threats from the Revenue Commissioners and the sheriff and delay payment until seizure was imminent.  It is vital in order to <Col N="1125" /> secure collection targets that the deterrent effect of sheriff action is maintained. This requires that the poundage charge must be automatic and unavoidable once a charge is referred to a sheriff.  I think in general that covers some of the points that have been raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I preface my remarks by saying I want the system to work.  I agree there has to be a certain deterrent aspect to the sheriff, otherwise the system will not work, but there are circumstances in which the Minister is now standing by a measure which is going to create injustice.</P>
      <P>If I am a sheriff and I get a certificate for £100,000, say, for capital acquisitions tax from a family who are putting together the money to pay, which is not easy in this day and age if you own a property, the very fact that I send a letter through the post gives me, on what the Minister has told this House, the right to receive £2,500 for sending a letter.  That is a scandal.  One cannot support the fact that someone gets £2,500 for sending a letter.  People talk about social justice but it would not be socially just to give a sheriff £2,500 at the expense of a family who are trying to put together £100,000 to pay capital acquisition tax because they received a letter to pay the money the week they were putting their affairs in order.  It may be a deterrent &mdash; so is a nuclear bomb &mdash; but you cannot use disproportionate means to achieve unfair results just in the name of efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By adding the words &ldquo;later than seven days&rdquo; in subsection (2) (a) (iii) before the words &ldquo;after the giving of the notice&rdquo; it would mean that when the sheriff's letter came a person would know that, as an automatic consequence a week later, he or she would be liable to pay £2,500 in the circumstances to which I referred.  It seems to be an enormity to provide for the fact that, irrespective of whether the letter had any effect and that you intended going to the bank to get the money together, you are liable for £2,500 to a man whose sole input in the transaction has been to send you a letter. There would be no injustice in a sheriff <Col N="1126" /> not getting his poundage until seven days after he sent the letter.  It would not take away the deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister, in many cases, is dealing with hard necks but, on a sum of £100,000 which many families have to pay on capital acquisition, it is wrong to give a sheriff £2,500 for writing a letter.  Deputy Noonan made a very good point, that the amount the sheriff gets is supposed to represent the effort he put into getting the money.  We are now deeming him to have made every effort to recover the money and to have done all the work by the fact that he sent a letter.  If the Minister would allow a period of seven days to elapse between sending the letter and the sheriff's entitlement to receive the money it could not be an injustice to the sheriff.  He could be given a fee of £30 for the letter and that could be contained in regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations at present are grossly antiquated.  Giving people 40p per day to stand guard over goods is a laugh and giving them 7p per statute mile for travel is a joke.  However, giving them £2,500 for sending a letter is a sick joke if it has no effect whatsoever except to intervene between what would be payment of money and the date on which the sum became due.  I cannot see why the Minister will not accept the basic justice of allowing seven days between the sending of the letter and the entitlement to poundage.  In most cases, in any event, the sheriff will not be out within the seven days.  Deputy Noonan pointed out that the Minister is giving a man a commission rate of 2½ per cent on very large sums of money, in some cases, without any regard to the effort made by the person concerned. I cannot see why the Minister will not accept a basic measure of this kind, which is designed to create justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving people a licence to print money because when a sheriff knows that a debt is about to be paid &mdash; for instance, if he knows that Michael McDowell owes £100,000 and will pay it tomorrow &mdash; all he has to do is to get the letter to me before I pay and he is entitled to £2,500.  He merely has to serve notice <Col N="1127" /> at a time he knows I intend doing something, get it in before I achieve it and he gets his entitlement.  That is unjust, it is giving money to people for work they have not done and it is adding to the liabilities of people who, in many cases, through no fault of their own, are not in a position to bear an extra burden.  A simple amendment of that nature would create justice and I ask the Minister to insert the words to which I referred.  If he wants to change regulations in regard to the poundage fees for sheriffs, he could give them £50 or £100 for writing a letter, regardless of its effect, and then give them the 2½ per cent if the money is not paid within seven days.</P>
    <P>During those seven days people will rush to pay the money because they know the 2½ per cent will go to the sheriff if there is a delay.  The Minister's point is that the sheriff's letter has a deterrent effect but that is not so because they are liable to the 2½ per cent anyway.  The amendment I propose would make the system more efficient and just.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware, from reported cases, that money already sent in payment to the Revenue does not prevent the sheriff from calling?  Does he get his commission in that case?  Does the Minister accept that there is a need for greater liaison between various branches of the Revenue and the sheriff's office?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to reintroduce the local tax inspectors who, for many years, did a very good job until they were dispensed with some years ago by the Department?  That has been responsible for the terrible backlog of uncollected debts and there is a clear need for the reintroduction of local tax inspectors.  Given the incidence of fraud within the Revenue Commissioners and the fact that many of the people in that section are under investigation, are tax assessments valid and legal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that point in a minute.  Quite a lot was said by Deputy McDowell, particularly in regard to capital acquisition tax cases <Col N="1128" /> and the hardship involved.  I have just been informed that in the case of capital acquisition tax, the sheriff would only execute the decree of a court for recovery of tax after plenty of notice had been given.</P>
      <P>In general, in these cases, the tax inspector in the local area and their staff are available whenever they are required in relation to any query that a taxpayer may have about assessments and bills or delays they envisage in relation to payments of tax due, PAYE, PRSI or VAT I am sure that in some cases &mdash; it could not apply to all &mdash; the tax inspectors will be flexible.  I am sure that sheriffs have in some instances made arrangements with clients for a reduction in the poundage. However, that is a matter for the sheriffs. What underlies all these arguments is the fact that the genuine taxpayer has nothing to fear and that is what we have to keep foremost in our minds.  Some people pay when they know the sheriff is coming but that is too late.  I am not aware of any cases where people would have paid prior to the sheriff being issued with a warrant for collection.</P>
      <P>The procedure in the office of the Collector-General is to intercept payments of tax which have been referred to the sheriff and to divert the payment to the sheriff so that he can pursue the question of poundage.  If payments for tax which had been sent to the sheriff were accepted by the Collector-General, a certificate would have to be recalled from the sheriff and the defaulter would not have to pay poundage.  Such a practice would, effectively, undermine the sheriff's sanction because defaulters would deliberately send their payments to the Collector-General when they received a demand from the sheriff.  The imposition of poundage on payments made to the Collector-General is defended on the grounds that the payment was made in response to a demand from the sheriff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logic underlying the proposition is that since the defaulter has delayed payment in spite of the issue of a reminder, an estimate, a demand and a certificate having to be issued to the sheriff, a payment is unlikely to be made <Col N="1129" /> without some additional stimulus.  If the money comes into the Collector-General's office after the sheriff has communicated with the defaulter it is reasonable to treat the payment in the same way as money paid directly to the sheriff.  The Revenue solicitor has advised that the procedure is sound legally provided the payee is informed of the diversion of his payment.  It is a standard part of the procedure that payees are so informed.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can change this because it would undermine the efforts made by sheriffs.  It is my sincere hope, as I am sure it is the hope of any Minister for Finance, and all Members of the House, that we will reach the stage in the not too distant future when we will not require the services of sheriffs and that people will pay what they owe.  There is little point in amending sections of the Bill to make it easier for those who have been evading and avoiding paying tax for a long time.  Later we will be dealing with a section which introduces incentives to people to pay outstanding taxes.  Since I was elected to this House almost 20 years ago I have been listening to Ministers and Members referring to this problem.  From 1986 on efforts have been made to tackle the problem and I hope we succeed in dealing with the mess.  If we succeed it will be of benefit to all taxpayers particularly the PAYE sector about whom we are all concerned.  Surely we should not be asked to give any concession to those who collect PAYE and PRSI from their employees and do not hand it over.</P>

      <P>I should like to reiterate that I do not hold any brief for tax evaders although I was sorry for Lester Pigott.  I know the Minister is a compassionate person and I appeal to him to introduce some compassion into the system for genuine people.  Deputy McDowell referred to people looking for £100,000 in a hurry.  I do not know too many of those people in my constituency but people may look for £10,000 and have grave difficulty in getting it.  I am referring to self-employed business people who find themselves in trouble.  I am <Col N="1130" /> asking the Minister to introduce a system of phased repayments for such people &mdash; it could be in the form of a guarantee from a bank manager in regard to post-dated cheques &mdash; rather than closing down small businesses and selling the goods for a fraction of their cost, effectively giving them away, and putting people on the unemployment register. That is not a progressive way for the Revenue Commissioners to treat owners of small businesses.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the system adopted by the Revenue Commissioners of returning cheques?  Is the Minister aware of the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of an Ashbourne garage owner who had had a substantial cheque returned to him?  Undoubtedly, that played on his mind.</P>

        <b>:</b> I accept the burden of the Minister's arguments. The Government of which I was a member extended the practice of the Revenue sheriffs in 1986 and I believe they have been working efficiently since. They create difficulties in certain areas and Members have brought that to the attention of the Minister.  Is it the Minister's intention to update the regulations he has just read out in regard to fees, 7p per statute mile and 63p if watching over property requires boarding and so on?  In my view they should be updated.  Does <Col N="1131" /> the Minister intend to move from poundage to flat rates in the circumstances as outlined by Deputy McDowell where the input of sheriffs into the tax collection process involves no more than filling out the standard form and sending it to a tax defaulter?</P>
      <P>When a sheriff collects tax due from a defaulter, together with the poundage, is there an obligation on the sheriff to return it immediately to the Revenue Commissioners?  I understand that it has become the practice for sheriffs in certain circumstances to top up the poundage by lodging the tax collected for a period of time at the best interest rates available and, subsequently, forwarding a bulk sum to the Revenue Commissioners.  Has this been brought to the attention of the Minister and, if so, will he say whether there are obligations on sheriffs to return tax collected forthwith to the Revenue Commissioners?  If there is a delay in returning the tax, on the basis of the Columcille precedent, to every cow a calf and to every book its copy, would not the interest accruing be the property of the Revenue Commissioners rather than of the sheriff who collected the outstanding tax?  In the event of a delay in returning the tax would it not be proper that not only the tax collected but the interest earned while on deposit should be returned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is a good one and it to be welcomed.  I have reservations about the powers of sheriffs. The Minister said that genuine taxpayers did not have anything to fear but we are all aware of the garage owner referred to by Deputy McGahon.  I should like to refer to an interview with a widow which I heard on the Marian Finucane programme, &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;.  I was saddened by that interview.  The widow outlined how industrious her husband had been during his lifetime.  He got into arrears with his tax and was making genuine efforts to pay the amount due.  He tried everything but was not succeeding in sorting out his financial problems with the Revenue Commissioners, with tragic results.  That <Col N="1132" /> was one interview on the Marian Finucane programme.  There are many other widows in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>These problems are experienced by small shopkeepers, small farmers and big farmers, the owners of factories and many very respectable, hard-working people.  I recently came across a businessman who would not be &ldquo;good on books&rdquo; and would not know anything about company law, yet he was an excellent worker who employed quite a few people.  The sheriff came and withdrew some machinery from his premises.  That machinery was later returned in a damaged condition. I spoke to the individual concerned who had spent a lifetime building up his industry.  He was a very sad man.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement can on occasion do harm to the institution of the State if it is not carried out with common sense.  The man to whom I am referring said that approaches for the collection of tax can drive young men into the Provisional IRA, especially when the seizure of machinery causes the loss of their jobs.  I understand in some instances that VAT and PRSI have not been paid.  I do not condone this but I understand that many small shopkeepers and business people are finding it very difficult to make a living.  I know people who are attending doctors and psychiatrists and turning chemists into millionaires by the amount of money they are spending on medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Companies Bill has been in the Seanad for so long that I do not know what Stage it has reached.  The draconian powers in this Bill will succeed only in hitting the small shopkeeper, factory owner or farmer.  The sheriff is not affecting the fly-by-night operators who are beating the system by forming companies and then liquidating them.  We are not gearing the system to deal with such people.  This amendment will help to compound an already difficult situation. The Companies Bill must be pushed through the Seanad to get at the people who are ripping off the Revenue Commissioners. Big companies are setting up which are catching the decent people down the line, the suppliers and so on. <Col N="1133" /> They liquidate and a few days later start the same rip-off again.  This is wrong. Instead of putting through legislation such as that before us it is incumbent on us to catch the people who are beating the system.  This Bill is hitting the small business people who do not understand company law and never go near a solicitor or an accountant if they can manage it. These people need assistance, not the big stick.  I meet them right across my constituency and they are to be found in every county.  Shopkeepers are in real difficulties.  I do not know how many publicans are also in difficulty but I would estimate that 50 per cent of them are living below starvation level.  I visit people in my constituency and talk to them.  Anybody who walks down the main street of a small town can see what is happening to the shops.  Emigration has devastated the young population.</P>

      <P>I must live in the same real world as Deputy Enright and Deputy McGahon since I agree wholeheartedly with what they have said.  There is an extraordinary anomaly in the existing law and I have a fair amount of practical experience in this regard.  The people who are really ripping off the system will not be caught by this measure.  The Minister may think that the appointment of Revenue sheriffs will make a great difference. The ordinary small business <Col N="1134" /> person who does not have limited liability is attending the doctor or the hospital, just as Deputy Enright said.</P>
      <P>I wish to declare an interest in the matter as I am a practising chartered accountant.  I deal with many small business people.  If a person was cute enough, he would start up a limited company at a cost of £250 or thereabouts, take two shares run up an extraordinary VAT liability and corporation tax and every other type of tax, go into liquidation overnight and, as the law at present stands, start up the next morning doing the same job and all the taxes would be just written off. The Revenue Commissioners do not bother at that stage and more power to them because it is not much use.  They do not even bother to turn up at liquidators' meetings because there is nothing there for them to get.  I have acted in such liquidations.  The ordinary shopkeeper or publican who had a decent business down through the years, perhaps successful once and still reasonably successful, did not go to the bother of forming a limited liability company.  He built up his tax liabilities over good times in the seventies and early eighties.  Now, when retail sales are down according to statistics and business is very bad, he has enormous tax liabilities to meet.  These people are being put out of business.</P>
      <P>At present if you want to find out information from the Collector-General's office about what you owe them they will not answer the phone because there is a go-slow once again.  Let us suppose that six weeks ago you wanted to clear up your liabilities &mdash; and I am not talking about enormous sums of money &mdash; and you sent in six post-dated cheques, it takes about five weeks to get a reply.  I have got back post-dated cheques at times saying that they cannot be accepted because they have gone to the Revenue sheriff.  If you ring the Revenue sheriff's office, they have not received the warrant. You again ring the Collector-General's office and they will not answer the phone because of the go-slow.</P>

    <P>No matter what business I was in, whether it was standing on the street <Col N="1135" /> corner selling papers or outside Punchestown racecourse selling race cards, if a fellow wanted to pay me in pound notes or tenpenny pieces I would accept them. The outcome depends on individual people in the Collector-General's office. That office is in total disarray and has been for a long number of years.  Even individual inspectors of taxes, whether dealing with VAT, PAYE, income tax, schedule D, or corporation tax, cannot get answers from the Collector-General's office.  There are very nice people in that office, but there are some there who do not care about anybody.  There does not seem to be a boss there.  Each individual can make a decision in each case.  Some withdraw the warrants from the Revenue sheriffs, but others will not bother.  What kind of a system is that?  Unbelievable figures have been put out and it is a case of cloud-cuckoo land.  Officials of the Department of Finance and the higher officers of the Collector-General's office can tell the Minister for Finance anything they like.  They tell him the same old stuff, that everything is grand, but the practical reality is that it is not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright has asked what we are going to do about the ever-increasing draconian measures given to the Revenue sheriffs, powers of attachment and everything else.  They are not going to catch the big boys.  They might get the odd one who will slip up, but it is the ordinary, decent people they put out of business.  I have grave reservations about these exceedingly draconian powers which have been given since the 1983 Finance Act.  As Deputy Enright has pointed out, we are paying the Revenue sheriffs on a poundage basis.  I must say that the Revenue Sheriff for Carlow and Kildare is a very decent, practical person, not like some others throughout the land.  He uses his head.  There is a ridiculous system in regard to the powers given to the Revenue sheriff.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tax amnesty, you have until 30 September to pay your taxes to qualify for the interest grants.  Some people can pay by seven or eight post-dated cheques on 1 January, others <Col N="1136" /> cannot.  Perhaps they could not get the amount in one application to their bank. If some of the warrants are in the hands of the Revenue sheriffs they qualify for the interest amnesty, but some officers in the Collector-General's office were interpreting this as being that you would have to pay the tax in the Revenue sheriff's hands plus the interest on that and then when you have paid your taxes on 30 September, the Collector-General's office may refund you the interest.  Many officers are interpreting the matter like this, but others are not.  If a man has to pay, say, £3,000 a month over six months, that is a lot of money to a small businessman when sales are going badly.  If he is expected to pay £4,500, he will not be able to do so.  He might have the option of getting something back, but the banks may not be disposed to let him write cheques so what would be the use?</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity of putting on record the absolutely chaotic state of affairs.  As Deputy Enright says, we have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. The reason the system in the Collector-General's office fell into disrepute was that, under the old system with the county sheriffs, the collection procedures were not followed up and people just ignored them.  We have gone from that easy-going method to the new system of collecting the amount there and then at a time when business could not be worse. I appeal to the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to recognise that basic fact.  People in this House, both Deputies and Ministers, and officials in the Civil Service, are paid out of the taxes of those business people down the country who are not on the dole and who are keeping things going.  They are not drawing benefit from any arm of the State.  An easier system should be developed.</P>
    <P>The only way we are going to have a decent tax system or a decent system of tax collection is to have, all in one place, the people who deal with income tax, corporation tax, directors' tax and PAYE tax.  A person running a shop nowadays would find that there were 12 different agencies of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1137" /> dealing with his affairs and they are in buildings spread throughout Dublin and everywhere else and one arm does not seem to know what the other is doing. The only way to have these affairs straightened out is to ensure that everything is done in the one place in towns throughout the country.  That is the only solution.  The collection procedure at the moment is total chaos.  I do not want to see more draconian powers being given to any arm of the State with regard to the collection of tax.  The only booming industry in the next six months will relate to doctors and chemists because I know of many people who are attending them due to the pressure they are under because of the chaos in the tax system.  I agree with Deputy Enright that that is pure fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with an amendment proposed by the Minister at a very late stage and its purpose is to regularise the position of Revenue sheriffs and their entitlement to receive certain fees for the work they do.  Section 2, paragraph (b) gives retrospective effect where sheriffs have already received these moneys and pocketed them under the impression, on the part of the payer to the sheriff, that he was obliged to pay these moneys to the Revenue sheriff. They are now being told by this paragraph that they were always deemed to be liable to pay them and that the Revenue sheriff is entitled to keep money even <Col N="1138" /> though at the moment as things stand it is more than likely in legal terms that the Revenue sheriff was not entitled to receive such money at all.  We are giving people retrospective entitlement to keep that which they got from others under a mistake in the law.  It is a draconian thing to do, but maybe it is well deserved since people who have paid it up are probably not whinging to get it back now.</P>
      <P>Revenue or any other sheriffs are entitled to fees for work done.  Their fees were called poundage and that arose from the term of the sheriff's pound, that one impounded goods, collected them, disposed of them and liquidated the proceeds and gave them to the judgment creditor.  That is the origin of the thing. Subsection (2) is deeming certain fees to be due to a sheriff as if he had done his work, where he sends a letter.  Where a sheriff sends a letter and the money is paid whether to him or the judgment creditor it is deemed that he has carried out his work and done the needful and that he is entitled to his 2½ per cent.</P>
      <P>I believe in a percentage system.  I do not agree with Deputy Enright on that. Deputy Enright is on very thin ice in this because no solicitor would collect a debt except for a percentage of the amount, and they would not glue it to 2½ per cent either.  No solicitor could in conscience look to his client for a percentage of a large sum of money if he had sent a letter and the next day without knowledge of the letter the other person was already engaging to pay the sum due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I proposed in relation to this, that there should be something there to reflect the reality that the sheriff should not be entitled by merely putting an envelope in the post, to get 2½ per cent of moneys whether or not he was involved thereafter in their collection.  The seven day delay which I suggested should be put into this section, was proposed in the interest of justice.  It does not take away from the deterrent effect.  At the very most it delays the deterrent effect for seven days. As Deputy McCreevy will agree, when one sends in cheques to the Collector-General at the moment, if they are dealt with in the month it is an amazing fact. <Col N="1139" /> Time is not of the essence in Earlsfort Terrace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>One week to sort out the differences between people who are being forced by the sheriff to pay and people who are not, seems to me to be a just differentiation.  If the Minister refuses to change this section and put those four words into that subsection, he should at least give the House an undertaking to positively consider Deputy Noonan's suggestion which is that he must update the regulations as to the basis of remuneration of sheriffs, as they are a joke.  The Minister could easily say that where the payment to made within a week of a letter being sent out, and that is the only involvement of the sheriff, a flat-rate such as £250 or 2½ per cent of the sum due, whichever is the lesser, would be payable in respect of such an operation by the sheriff.  It would be easy to bring in just regulations to prevent the injustices about which I have spoken, and it would be easy to put in place a fair system which does not add to the indebtedness of somebody who is already crippled and already on the ropes financially, by adding another debt of 2½ per cent of the amount due just because he got a letter. We are giving people 2½ per cent of sums due where a letter was sent out and nothing more was done and we are deeming all the work of revenue sheriffs to have been done where that letter is sent and the money is subsequently recovered. We could easily put a flat-rate sum there and say that that, or the percentage, whichever is the lesser, will be payable if the money is paid within a week of the sheriff's demand.  If the Minister was interested in doing justice to those people who are often at breaking point psycholigically and financially, when they are at the receiving end of a sheriff's letter, he would accede to what I am saying by indicating that he would be positively disposed towards reforming the system of sheriff's fees to give effect <Col N="1140" /> to a small liability, where the effect of writing a letter secures relative and immediate payment.  No sheriff could complain if he got £250 for writing a letter and the payment was made within a week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan rightly pointed out that sheriffs get a very good break at the moment.  They are entitled to put the money they receive on deposit and pocket the interest.  Solicitors, under the Law Society regulations are not entitled to do that.  I am amazed, if the Minister is serious about getting every last half penny out of the tax collection process, that there is not something here about making the Revenue sheriff liable to him for the interest on the moneys due to the State.  Why should those sums of money accumulate interest in a deposit account or in some Merchant Bank, for the Revenue solicitor?  It is an injustice.  It is money not due.  The 2½ per cent is often far too generous when it comes simply by virtue of sending a letter.  If the Minister is not prepared to accede to what I am asking by way of amendment to subsection (2) (a) he should at least give an indication that in the context of revising these sheriff charges, which must be revised, because they are a joke, he will give serious thought to providing a flat-rate where there is immediate and voluntary response to a sheriff's letter.  That is required by justice and no injustice would result and no dilution of deterrent effect would result either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I am the least offender in this regard. I have been very reluctant to intervene and have only done so where it was necessary for me to respond to some of the points which had been raised.  I have avoided repetition as far as possible throughout the course of this debate.  There is one general point I would like to make before going on to deal with a number of points which have been raised.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate and over the past 20 years I have had to listen to arguments on our high levels of PAYE tax and on the amount of uncollected taxes.  We have been taking action since 1986 and yet we still have Deputies crying crocodile tears in respect of those who have defaulted in paying their taxes.  Let us make no mistake about it, those whom we are talking about here are those who have not paid their taxes.  Those on PAYE, who will receive their pay cheque on Thursday or Friday of this week, will have had their tax and PRSI deducted. Those we are speaking about here are those employers who have stopped that tax and PRSI and have kept it for between six weeks and 12 months before handing it over to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the argument which has been put forward that people will be put out of business simply and solely because those who we are talking about are those who withhold PAYE, PRSI and VAT which is due to Exchequer and not to the individual who collects it and which has been collected from the consumer or the worker.  The other kind of taxpayer we are talking about are those who have made profits from their businesses and who have not paid tax on those profits.  Therefore, I cannot understand the argument which has been put forward that people will be put out of business.  These taxes are due to the State.  The PAYE worker will not get a letter in the post, their tax will be stopped at source on a Thursday or Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Deputy Noonan raised the question of fees and poundage.  This is a matter for the Department of Justice and I will ask the Minister for Justice to consider this question to see if any changes are warranted such as introducing a flat rate, poundage or income.  All these matters would arise in such a review but it is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In relation to the payment of interest, the position is that the sheriff must pay over the amount due.  He can keep the interest as it has always mounted to part of his fee.  He can keep the interest but he must hand over the moneys collected by the middle of the following month to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is no harm to put on the record what a typical sheriff's office might be like.  It might perhaps have four office staff and two full-time staff on the road.  I think most solicitors would agree that a solicitor's office whose business would involve the activities of a sheriff would not attract other kinds of legal business.  I do not know whether that is true or not but it has been suggested that that is the case. The cost of running an operation on this scale would be in the order of £100,000 per annum and this would not include any personal remuneration for the sheriff.  In order to cover his running costs the sheriff would have to recover poundage in respect of debts amounting to some £4 million.  Some do and some do not.  In fact, most sheriffs cannot meet their running costs out of poundage alone and that is why they receive the interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to some aspects of company law and sheriff law. This is being examined at present by the Law Reform Commission.  Among the issues being considered are the limitations on sheriff action because of various legal devices such as retention of title and appointment of receivers.  The Revenue Commissioners have made submissions on these points to the commission and I am sure that they will be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright also raised the question of paying fixed salaries to sheriffs. If poundage were not leviable, sheriffs might have to be paid significant fixed <Col N="1143" /> salaries.  The cost of these salaries would have to be met by the Exchequer and, consequently, by the general body of taxpayers, including complying taxpayers. Being fixed, the salaries would not have the same incentive effect for the sheriffs. The advantages of poundage are that the expenses of collection are borne by the defaulters who occasion the expense and, being related to the amounts collected, represent a very efficient form of performance-based remuneration.</P>
    <P>Some of the contributors over the last hour referred to draconian powers being taken under this amendment.  We are doing no such thing.  What we are doing is regularising the position which has existed for some time, no more and no less.  I would like to refer Deputy Enright who spoke about draconian powers to the statement of the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, who announced on 23 October 1985 his Government's decision to appoint the Revenue sheriffs in the context of a more rigorous approach in dealing with tax abuse.  He made the following statements and I quote from the Official Report, vol 360, col. 281.</P>
    <P>Public opinion must be mobilised to improve tax compliance.  It is important that the defaulter should be identified and punished.  Payment of taxes is a civic obligation and delays due to inefficiencies and for other reasons help to shield defaulters who exploit slackness in the system.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that in our society, among the majority who pay what they owe honestly and fairly, there are still more than a few prepared to rip off the rest of the community for the sake of their own gain.  These &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; are a contributory factor in the burden that honest working people carry.</P>
    <P>The measures I am announcing are a further phase in eliminating this scandal, and in ensuring that the people who are robbing the ordinary taxpayer are dealt with.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to some of the <Col N="1144" /> points raised by Deputy McCreevy.  As the Deputy is aware, the whole thrust of the Government's measures in this Bill is to eliminate tax arrears.  We are moving towards self-assessment and introducing an incentive and the power of attachment. I agree with Deputy Noonan that we should now go on to discuss the power of attachment because I am as anxious as he is to discuss it and have the various views put on the record.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to regularise the taking of poundage and thereby ensure the sheriffs' sanction.  All of these measures will help to solve the administrative problems referred to by Deputy McCreevy.  I have taken careful note of the points he made and I can assure him that the Revenue Commissioners and the Collector-General are working on behalf of those of us in this House who pass legislation imposing taxes.  They are working on our behalf to ensure that sufficient revenue is brought into the Exchequer to run the services being provided as a result of decisions made in this House.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties which many honest and genuine taxpayers are confronted with and the high levels of tax which they have to pay.  It is interesting to note that Deputy Mac Giolla has not made any contribution on this part of the Bill.  During the past couple of weeks he spent hours talking about the problems facing the PAYE sector and on the amount of taxes which they have to pay.  Now when we are dealing with those issues in an effort to help the genuine taxpayers, we note his silence.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 61, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the amnesty to capital acquisitions tax.  On first reading I thought the provisions of the section did extend to capital acquisitions tax.  I do not think they do now, which is my reason for moving this amendment, to enable the Minister to tell us why it applies to all other taxes with the exception of capital acquisitions tax.  I am particularly interested that it would apply to the inheritance aspect of capital acquisitions tax.  I cannot see any good reason that somebody with a liability to inheritance tax would not come within the terms of the amnesty when everything else seems to.</P>
      <P>I presume the Revenue Commissioners feel that, in cases of default of payment of capital acquisitions tax, they will always get the defaulter anyway, that they are fairly sure of collecting eventually, so that they do not extend it this far. However, I do not intend to delay the House on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental reason for not including capital acquisitions tax under the incentive scheme is that it is not subject to the same collection problems as are the other taxes covered by the provisions of that scheme.  The majority of claims for capital acquisitions tax or for inheritance tax arise in respect of benefits payable on the death of a person either under a will or in a case of intestacy.  An application for a grant of probate or administration of a deceased <Col N="1147" /> person's estate must be accompanied by an inland revenue affidavit, certified by the Revenue Commissioners, to show that disclosure had been made of potential claims for tax arising on that person's death.  Before the inland revenue affidavit is certified the Revenue Commissioners ensure that all necessary information is supplied to enable claims for capital acquisitions tax to be prepared.</P>
      <P>Assessments of capital acquisitions tax are made by the Revenue Commissioners on returns received from the taxpayer. Over 75 per cent of the tax so assessed is paid within 30 days.  Unpaid capital acquisitions tax remains a charge on the property comprising the gift or inheritance. A vendor of a moveable property must obtain for a purchaser a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners to show that there is no outstanding claim for capital acquisitions tax on that property. While the tax due in a specific case may be substantial, tax arrears and the collection of tax are not problems associated with this tax.  For that reason it was not considered necessary to provide, in relation to capital acquisitions tax, the incentive to clear up arrears of tax provided for in section 68.  In line with that neither was it considered necessary to attach the financial assets of defaulters in paying capital acquisitions tax which might have been done under the provisions of section 69.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment proposed might well act to the detriment of a taxpayer. Section 68 envisages that all tax arrears must be paid before outstanding interest charges and penalties will be waived.  There is a statutory provision for payment of capital acquisitions tax by five-yearly instalments.  Consequently, it might not be possible for a taxpayer to pay all outstanding instalments of capital acquisitions tax due by him in order to be in a position to avail of the incentive in relation to other outstanding taxes due by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final point I would make is that waiving outstanding interest on capital acquisitions tax would reduce the yield <Col N="1148" /> from that tax since interest is an integral part of the yield, collection of which causes no undue difficulty.  From the point of view of the Exchequer it would not make sense to forfeit something which would normally be collected, thus reducing the already low yield from the tax by getting nothing in return.</P>

I know there is not the difficulty of collection in the case of inheritance tax that applies in the other tax areas but it is anomalous for the taxpayer, on whose inheritance tax a large amount of interest had accrued when they see other tax defaulters, frequently in better circumstances, availing of the terms of the amnesty and they in a position &mdash; frequently after a family bereavement &mdash; in which a large amount of interest would have accrued.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider extending the amnesty to this area, not for the purposes of collection but in ease of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We indicated our approval of the amnesty when the Minister announced it in his Budget Statement but it is anomalous.  It tends to apply the parable of the labourers in the vineyard to tax collection.  I was never too impressed by the idea that if one came at the eleventh hour one should get paid as much as those who had laboured all day long.  There are circumstances now created in which people who settled <Col N="1149" /> their tax affairs and paid their interest prior to the Minister's budgetary announcement are feeling fairly sore and frustrated.  At the human level it is understandable that they should because people who made no attempt to settle are now availing of the terms of the amnesty, the interest and the penalties being waived, whereas those who settled earlier, for example, in the last six months of last year, paid their interest in full.</P>
      <P>In particular I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of extending the terms of the amnesty on non-publication of the names of tax defaulters and to people who settled, say, between 1 July, 1987 and the end of that year. From the defaulter's point of view it is bad enough to have settled and paid the interest due without seeing others availing of the amnesty and not having to pay interest.  But to be held up to public ridicule as a tax defaulter as well by having one's name appear in the national newspaper &mdash; in circumstances in which the terms of the amnesty are being availed of quite widely &mdash; is anomalous.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage which would at least back-date the terms of the amnesty in so far as they extend to non-publication of tax defaulters' names in the national newspapers.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan in relation to the last matter.  It would be very unfair that some people should be singled out for public opprobrium whereas others, who come in afterwards, receive kid glove treatment.  I do not believe that one should excuse or feel sorry for the people who paid interest prior to the amnesty, because there is the labourers in the vineyard parable to deal with them.  People who paid cannot complain if others are treated more lightly afterwards but if names remain unpublished it would be very unfair to single out those people for public oppobrium when the people who came in later get more favourable treatment.  The last point made by Deputy Noonan is a fair concession to the equity of the situation <Col N="1150" /> without undermining the nature of the amnesty.</P>

      <P>It was interesting to listen to the debate and to see Deputies McGahon and McCreevy coming out of the woodwork in response to the Minister's amendment and opposing it.  This is apparently a measure which will ensure the collection of outstanding taxes.  I think there were two previous amnesties. There was an amnesty about 18 months or two years ago &mdash; I believe it was the amnesty given by Deputy Bruton &mdash; which was a total flop and I do not think anyone would say that it was anything else.</P>
      <P>When people go into the area of the black economy it is very hard to pull them out of it.  Things are too good, too free and too easy for the people in there. In 1987 the chances of somebody being caught in the black economy were reckoned to be 100 to one.  Those are fair odds so people are prepared to take that chance of carrying on in that business without being caught.  The Minister is trying to catch the people he does not know about and who have not disclosed the non-payment of taxes.  Surely he is not after the people whom he knows owe tax and interest already?  That money is properly due and if the Minister knows the people who owe those taxes he should use the stick he has at his disposal to ensure that they pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amnesty is being introduced to try to bring out those people who are afraid they may be caught.  Perhaps things are getting hot for them at this stage and they may be prepared to come out and disclose the crimes they committed during the past number of years because they owe a huge amount of interest.  If the total <Col N="1151" /> amount of the taxes they owed during the past number of years was disclosed a substantial amount of interest would be involved.  Those are the only people who may be interested in this type of amnesty. The amount of interest involved would need to be almost as high as the amount of taxes involved.</P>
    <P>As soon as Coopers &amp; Lybrand heard about this amnesty they started to tell people how they would sort things out for them.  They said they would provide, free of charge, a totally confidential initial consultation to consider the implications of availing of the amnesty.  People can tell them what they have been up to in total confidentiality.  They can tell them what kind of income they have been earning in what areas and, if it is found out by the Minister, how much tax they will owe.  Coopers &amp; Lybrand will tell those people how much interest they will have to pay.  At the end they could say that the amount of interest they owe would not be as much as the tax they owe and they should hang on and take a chance because they may not be caught for another five or ten years.</P>
    <P>I do not think this amnesty will bring many people out of the black economy. The people who will avail of it are those who are known already and who, because they are having difficulties, are in arrears and interest is accumulating.  They will now have an opportunity to get rid of the interest payment and paying off the tax they owe.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it was the Minister's intention in bringing in that amnesty to let off the people whom he know owes taxes from having to pay their interest payments.  The interest payment was the penalty which would make them pay their taxes in time.  That was the purpose of the interest payment &mdash; the longer people held on to the money the more interest they would have to pay.  During the time of high inflation people held on to the money because it was to their monetary advantage to do so.  Interest charges were put on the outstanding amounts in order to force people to pay up in a hurry.  Now the Minister is giving this amnesty which <Col N="1152" /> will abolish that interest and people will say: &ldquo;It paid us to hang on for a couple of years.  We will get rid of the interest we owe for the past six or nine months while the people who paid up have lost out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe this scheme will bring in the taxes which are due.  I am all for getting in the taxes due as quickly as possible but I do not believe this scheme will bring any new people out into the open.  It is going to let off those who are already out in the open.  I do not think it will encourage more people to come out of the black economy.  The only way to root them out is to put more people to work on the ground so that they can discover who they are and impose the strongest possible penalties on them. There should be no amnesty for them when they are found.  They should receive the full rigours of whatever powers are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to the question raised about publication in the past and the fact that those who pay up from budget day will not be caught by that.  There has to be a cut-off point in any situation and that is the position here. All of the people who were listed in the publication which was issued some months ago can feel aggrieved because it has already been published.  As I stated already, I could not do anything from budget day.  I appreciate the problems raised by Deputy Noonan and supported by Deputy McDowell.  I deal with these every day and I am as sympathetic to them as are the Deputies.  If we do it from 1 July, what about the people before that?  Some of their names may not have been published already and we would have had to go back to the names which were published for the years 1986 or 1987. As a public representative I had dealings with people regarding clarification of arrears who had settled earlier this year. In fact, some had settled their arrears just days before the budget.  Substantial amounts of interest were involved in those settlements.  Obviously those people were not too anxious to talk to me a few days after the budget when I <Col N="1153" /> met them because they could have settled for a lot less a week later.  People can be caught in a system that has changed or a new scheme that is brought about.  I could not consider waiving publication in cases prior to budget day.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla nobody can have a glass ball and say what is the reasoning behind any particular individual paying up, whether he is in the existing regime and is a known defaulter or is in the black economy.  All the matters that are contained in this package of measures since the budget and now being legislated for in this Finance Bill are for the purpose of streamlining the collection procedure, of bringing in arrears and releasing staff to get after more people in the black economy and so on.  We have already beginning to emerge a totally different climate in relation to tax arrears and tax default.  I am sure that by this time 12 months it will be right into the heart and mind of every single individual that it does not pay, from here on to default on payments of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 51:</P>
      <P>In page 69, between lines 50 and 51, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(19)  Nothing in this section gives a right to the Revenue Commissioners to act in a manner, which would deprive an individual or family of an income sufficient to provide for their individual or family needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I appreciate that many Deputies want to contribute here so I will set my amendment in the context of what the section proposes and do it as briefly as possible to allow a number of Deputies to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power of attachment is being given to the Revenue Commissioners in this section.  It effectively means that if a tax <Col N="1154" /> defaulter is owed a debt by a third party, the third party can be required, by a notice of attachment, to pay the money to the Revenue Commissioners rather than to the tax defaulter to whom the money is owed.  It would apply, to a large extent, to tax defaulters other than PAYE tax defaulters because I notice that wages and salaries are exempt.  I would like the Minister to clarify exemptions, other than wages and salaries, to the power of attachment.  How widely cast is the idea of a contract of service? It seems it would apply to agricultural co-operatives of all sorts and that money owed on foot of the supply of milk, for example, to a farmer by a co-operative could be attached and the co-operative could be required, under penalty, to pay that money to the Revenue Commissioners. I understand that it would also apply, in similar circumstances, to the sale of cattle at a cattle mart and the sale of cattle to a meat factory.</P>
    <P>It also applies, according to the section, to money on deposit in financial institutions, and I would like the Minister to deal with this in some detail.  Does it apply to all money in financial institutions, regardless of the circumstances? What is the position of the bank if there is a prior liability?  What is the situation if one account in a defaulter's name is in surplus whereas the other one is in deficit where two accounts are held by the one person in a bank?  What is the position in regard to wages and salaries that are paid directly into a bank account?  Do they cease to be wages and salaries when they are paid directly into a bank account and do they become money on deposit in a financial institution?  Consequently, are wages and salaries not completely exempt?  In circumstances where they are paid into the bank do they fall within the terms of this section?</P>
    <P>In the operation of the section, will the Revenue Commissioners have the right to direct notices of attachment to the head office of the financial institution rather than to the individual branch?  Will the onus be on the management and the directors of the financial institution to <Col N="1155" /> establish whether, in any of their branches in the State or outside the State, money is held to the benefit of a tax defaulter?  Is it the case that this may be attached and the bank will be required, under penalty, to make the returns to the Revenue Commissioners within the ten days specified in the section?  I would like the Minister to clarify that because it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with the powers of disclosure which are being taken by the Revenue Commissioners. How extensive are they?  Will this be on a kind of trawl basis?  I know that it is customary in the accounts of companies to specify the bank of the company, so the Revenue Commissioners will not have a problem in identifying the appropriate bank in the case of corporate tax.  But on the collection of individual tax under the power of attachment, how will the Revenue Commissioners acquire the knowledge that a tax defaulter (a) has money on deposit in bank (b) in town (c) somewhere in the country?  How does that relate to the concept of non-disclosure? The Minister informed the House on Second Stage that there was no extension of disclosure envisaged in the introduction of this section.</P>
    <P>What is the position of normal trade credit?  What, in the Minister's opinion, will be the effect on normal trade credit of these provisions?  Will the Revenue be a prior creditor in each and every case where a notice of attachment is sent out? Specifically in a situation where, in the traditional manner in Ireland, the co-operative is carrying the farmer over the winter, will the Revenue Commissioners have a prior right over the co-operative itself in situations where money is owed, on the one hand by the farmer to the co-operative and, on the other hand, by the co-operative to the farmer for milk supplied, for example, what is the relationship?  It seems to me that the prior right is with the Revenue Commissioners and even in situations where money on the second account is owed by an individual to the co-operative the Revenue could require the co-operative, against <Col N="1156" /> their own interests, to treat them as the prior creditor and to return to them moneys requested under the power of attachment.</P>
    <P>The last point, to come to the precise amendment, is that I notice that if sufficient money is not available in a bank account or in a co-operative or in a company that the notice of attachment remains <i>in situ</i> and can operate over a period of time until enough money accumulates to pay the debt to the Revenue Commissioners.  In circumstances such as this it is possible that a small shopkeeper or publican or, in particular, a farmer would be in a situation where a notice of attachment arrives to the co-operative in the month of April and runs on to April, May, June or July and, in effect, all the creamery cheques, to put it bluntly, are sucked into the warrant of attachment and there is no family income left?  There is nothing there to require the Revenue Commissioners to act in a manner that would not deprive an individual or a family of an income sufficient to provide for their individual or family needs.</P>
    <P>The first indication I had of powers of attachment operating under the law here was when the ACC discovered that they had some power under a mid-nineteenth century Act.  But the ACC, in cases of liquidation, instruct the liquidator to make provision for family income and the liquidator is required to ensure that no injustice is done, to put it bluntly, that families are not left destitute by the operation of the section.  There is nothing of a similar nature in this section.  In the way it is drafted, whereby a warrant of attachment remains in place until the full amount required under it is paid &mdash; and it can remain <i>in situ</i> over an extensive period of time &mdash; it could operate in a manner which, in effect, would eliminate family income for three months, six months or a whole year.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister to accept the amendment that I have suggested here.  I am suggesting it as a subsection (19) at the end of the section that &ldquo;Nothing in this section gives a right to the Revenue Commissioners to act in a <Col N="1157" /> manner which would deprive an individual or a family of an income sufficient to provide for their individual or family needs.&rdquo;  It is up to the Revenue Commissioners then to operate under that direction and to establish the regulations which would be required to ensure that no injustice along the lines I have suggested would occur.</P>
    <P>There are two final questions I would like to ask the Minister.  First does the warrant of attachment extend to the Post Office and post office savings funds? Second, is it intended that the powers of the section would be devolved to the Revenue sheriffs under this section?  I notice that one of the subsections in the normal way, gives power to the Revenue Commissioners to devolve the power. Have they the power under the section to devolve it to Revenue sheriffs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>If you wish I will reply to some of those questions, and in fairness to Deputy Noonan I know that other Deputies will not mind.  Amendment No. 51 seeks to prohibit the Revenue Commissioners from applying the power of attachment where such application would deprive an individual, or family, of income sufficient to provide for his or the family's needs.  At the outset it must be said that attachment may only be applied where a taxpayer has failed to pay to the Revenue Commissioners tax due under the law.  In the case of the fiduciary taxes. <Col N="1158" /> that is, PAYE and VAT, the tax will already have been collected by the taxpayer from his employees or customers, while in the case of Schedule D income tax or corporation tax, the tax will have been determined on the basis of the profits of the business.  There can be no doubt, therefore, that the taxpayer should have had the money to pay over to the Revenue Commissioners the tax due under the law.  Because he has failed to do so, he leaves himself liable to have debts due to him attached.  This, in effect, puts him in no worse a position than the PAYE worker who suffers deductions from his wages every week or fortnight in respect of his tax liability.</P>
      <P>As to the precise wording of Deputy Noonan's amendment, it must be said that such wording is entirely without precedent in tax law.  The amendment is also ambiguous, to say the least.  Individual and family needs vary considerably from case to case.  Who would decide or, indeed, who could decide on whether a certain level of income was sufficient for the needs of a particular family?  I appreciate that the Deputy may be worried about the effects of attachment on individuals and families.  The remedy, however &mdash; if I can call it that &mdash; is entirely within the taxpayer's hands.  If all taxpayers paid their lawful tax liabilities attachment would never be used.</P>
      <P>I must also point out that under the legislation defaulting taxpayers will receive ample warning that if their tax bills are not paid, the amounts involved may be subject to attachment.  In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to reply to and I hope that Deputies will bear with me.  I will give the information because I am anxious to put this on the record of the House for the proper interpretation of the operation of this scheme by all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the abdication of the power of attachment in situations where credit is advanced was raised by Deputy Noonan during the Second Stage debate and it has since been raised by the ICMSA.  The matter may, therefore, <Col N="1159" /> come up in some detail.  There is no question, under the legislation, of the Revenue Commissioners attaching normal loan repayments made by the defaulter to a person who has advanced credit to him.  In such an instance there is no debt due by the third party to the defaulter. Situations may arise, however, where a defaulter both owes and is owed money by the same third party.  For example, a defaulter may have both a deposit and loan account with a financial institution. In such instances it may be that the outstanding loan is being repaid by instalments from the proceeds of the deposit account and the outstanding loan may, in fact, be in excess of the deposit account balance.  The Revenue Commissioners will take the view in such circumstances that the legislation will allow them to attach to amounts in the deposit account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say also that it includes all financial institutions such as post office savings.  A somewhat similar instance has been raised by the ICMSA and by Deputy Noonan involving transactions between a farmer and his co-operative.  Apparently it is common practice for co-operatives to extend credit to farmers for purchase of feed, fertiliser etc.  This debt is then paid off by offsetting amounts due to farmers for milk deliveries etc., to the co-operative. The ICMSA have queried if the Revenue Commissioners could attach the amounts due in respect of milk deliveries which the co-operative was offsetting against the farmer's credit facility. The Revenue Commissioners have confirmed to me that the legislation does not preclude them seeking to attach, in such instances, as the value of goods supplied by the farmer would be a debt due to him by the co-operative.  If there were agreement that the payments due would simply go to reduce the farmer's debt to the co-operative, in the final analysis it would be a matter for the co-operative to <Col N="1160" /> decide how it would respond to a notice of attachment in such instances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment deals with the power of attachment and brings it into focus.  Regarding the power of attachment I want to make a general point and then a specific point. The general point is that it is an easy method of collecting tax arrears, it is free of court procedures, it does not have any bureaucratic difficulties about it and it does not appear, at this stage, to be fraught with constitutional problems. Time will show whether that is so.  Obviously, it must be a very attractive weapon to the Revenue Commissioners and there will be a great temptation to use it widely. It will also establish a priority in advance of winding up.  Obviously there is a great attraction to use it and to use it widely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of general comment, I would like to urge the Minister to recommend to the Revenue Commissioners that it is a power to be used exceedingly sparingly, particularly in the commercial context of this country today; I do not say within the economic context because we have <Col N="1161" /> all been bamboozled by the good performance of a very narrow sector of manufacturing industry who have distorted the national statistics and give the impression that we are in a situation of economic growth.</P>
    <P>One narrow sector of the economy is showing growth but it is a distortion of the real position.  The proof of that is that, notwithstanding the good national statistics, there has been a drop in employment and there has been a shortfall in income to the Revenue Commissioners. Obviously, there is something wrong.  This narrow sector of the economy is not contributing proportionately to its performance because of the tax holiday it is on, with the result that the commercial sector of the indigenous economy &mdash; and the Minister must be aware of this as he comes from a country town just as I do &mdash; and the people who are manufacturing for that sector are on their knees, and if there is indiscriminate use of this power of attachment I have no doubt that it will put a great many businesses over the cliff by interfering with critical cash flow.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister read out, a little sanctimoniously, the response to the accusation that this power might be draconian or difficult.  He said it would be exercised only in relation to cases where tax had been established and found due and had been deducted.  He talked about VAT also having been collected. However, he did not take into account the cases of VAT payable on invoice and not on collections.  That can be very serious for many firms who in turn have not been paid because of difficulties of cash flow.  I warn the Minister that this power must be used extremely sparingly, otherwise it will put many businesses over the brink by interfering fatally with their cash flow.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to comment on the position of a person in my profession who has given an undertaking to a financial institution in respect of funds in his hands on behalf of a client.  That undertaking does not bring with it any liability to be used by the financial institution.  The sanction, if it is not complied with, would <Col N="1162" /> be imposed by the professional body concerned and could even lead to striking off and there is no indemnity that I can see in the section for a solicitor who has given an undertaking in respect of funds in respect of which notice of attachment subsequently comes in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem there and I think the Minister is taking a bit of a run at that last matter.  The person could not possibly be totally exempt just because it is in a client's account in a solicitor's office.  Nobody could immunise his or her assets from this by solely doing that.  Deputy Cooney was asking the Minister whether, if there was a prior undertaking to another institution which conflicted with payment out to the client, he would be safe to resist payment out to the Revenue Commissioners and pay it to the person in whose favour he had made an undertaking.  That exposes a slight defect in this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats said, at the very beginning before this was ever produced, in one of our tax documents that we were in favour of a power of attachment. I am not running away from that now, but one thing that strikes me is that where there is a power of set off or counter-claim this legislation is totally inadequate to deal with it.  It talks about a debt and a dispute.  I might owe somebody money and have no dispute about the fact that I owe him that money, but I might have a perfectly valid counter-claim or other head on which he owed me a counterbalancing sum.  In those circumstances there would be no dispute about the debt and, whatever the Minister thinks, a court will hold that there is no dispute about the debt but it still will be the subject matter of a setoff or counter claim.  Deputy Cooney will agree with me that nothing in this procedure deals with set offs, counter claims or prior equitable interests in any debt.  I ask the Minister to think long and hard between now and tomorrow or whenever about what happens in regard to an equitable <Col N="1164" /> assignment of a debt or a legal assignment of a debt.  Is that to immunise that debt from a power of attachment?  If the Minister is wobbly on that it will be used wholesale to defeat this measure.  He may give his answer now to Deputy Cooney about client accounts but I think a court interpreting this section will interpret it as I have suggested.</P>
    <P>One thing I welcome about this provision is the fact that only one notice of attachment can be used at any given time in respect of any individual person.  That suggests to me that at least the Revenue Commissioners cannot use it in a scattergun way just to pepper all targets and seek repayments from a number of people at the same time.  They must go from one individual who owes a substantial debt and have that debt paid over.</P>
    <P>The phraseology of it is defective.  The Minister has not taken sufficient account of the right of set off or counter claim. One instance of this is his admission just a few moments ago that a bank which has money in a deposit account on a back-to-back basis with an overdraft would be liable to pay out the deposit account moneys to the Revenue Commissioners. That is crazy.  No bank could operate on the basis that, when they are on what appears to them to be a contractual basis with one of their customers, with money in one account setting off another debt, they can be obliged to part with half of that money and be left holding the baby. That could not possibly be.  It would not make commercial sense.  It could not be fair.  Banks would be in chaos if every time they gave a right of set off between two accounts the Revenue Commissioners were able to plunder whichever account happened to be in credit and leave the bank holding the baby.  The interpretations the Minister is receiving now may be the Revenue Commissioner's views on these matters, but a court would take a different view, that because it is not a sum due to the individual, if a bank is entitled to a set off between two accounts it is entitled to say, &ldquo;No, we will not pay out on your deposit account.  We are taking all the <Col N="1165" /> money and applying it to the current account.&rdquo;  I think the Minister is wrong in that and time will prove him so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal quickly with that, but before you, Sir, put the question and perhaps rule me out of order, I will draw the attention of the House to a minor drafting error in the first line of (b) in subparagraph 2 of Amendment No. 53 relating to the Third Schedule.  The word &ldquo;subsection&rdquo; is incorrect and should be replaced by the word &ldquo;subparagraph.&rdquo;  Also I want to notify the House that by virtue of the removal of section 54 from the Bill this morning I will table an amendment on Report Stage to remove the reference in italics to section 54 in section 71 which, of course, has now no relevance.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the points raised by Deputy McDowell and Deputy Cooney, in a house or land purchase transaction the solicitor for the purchaser will receive money from his own claimant in respect of a deposit and from the client or lending institution in respect of the balance of the purchase money.  The solicitor is required by law to keep these moneys in a client account.  This means a current or deposit account in the name of the solicitor and in the title of which account the word &ldquo;client&rdquo; shall appear at a bank or any other financial institution authorised by the client in writing.  It follows, therefore, that a client account is not for the sole benefit of the solicitor and as such it would be outside the scope of attachment.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I made the point that the 1963 Act was the first comprehensive piece of legislation which had been put on the Statute Book.  It replaced a mixed bag of legislation dealing with town and regional planning.  I also made the point that the Act was now 25 years old and was beginning to show distinct signs of wear and tear.  Perhaps, surprisingly, I had agreed with the analysis by Deputy McCartan that it was correct to say that our planning laws had not been entirely successful.</P>
      <P>Our planning laws are cast in the shadow of a relatively rigid Constitution. The Constitution has had its provisions on private property more emphasised by the judicial review process than have been the general rights of the community. This emphasis is no doubt due more to the nature of the cases brought before the courts than to any perversity on the part of the members of the Judiciary. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the compensation issue is continuously to the fore in planning.  While neither the objective of the 1963 Act nor the intention of the drafters of Bunreacht na hÉireann was to award windfall financial gains to spurious or mythical plans drawn up with the intent of trawling for compensation, we have seen the issue all too often head in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us at its core deals with the vexed issue of compensation.  Indeed, its treatment of compensation is one of the two main points of focus.  It is wrong that those who own land on the edge of expanding areas or those who acquire land in scenic areas should be allowed effectively to blackmail the community <Col N="1170" /> at large by threatening to rush into compensation claims.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt with the compensation issue at length.  He pointed out that the general exemptions in section 56 of the 1963 Act are such that they mean that there is no general right of compensation.  It is comforting to see that of the 183,000 planning applications decided by local authorities, between 1982 and 1986 only 130 actual claims for compensation arose.  Less comforting, however, is the news that compensation claims have totted up over the years to the ludicrous sum of £70 million.  The compensation threat, sometimes veiled, sometimes open, had an impact beyond the actual number of cases taken.  The Minister rightly touched on the insidious problems which arose.  Compensation can hang like a sword of Damocles above the head of the planning authorities and of its members.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Wicklow County Council and that planning authority has had more than their fair share of planning problems and more than a small number of planning controversies.  On the one hand they have had to protect the most remarkable natural beauty bestowed on any part of this island and, on the other hand, they have to try not to impede worthwhile development and progress. In the past two years the compensation issue has reared its ugly head on a number of important occasions.  In the case of the woodlands at Coolattin the deficiencies in the planning laws were emphasised first by the threat of a massive and ruinous compensation claim against the planning authority.  In the face of that threat the county council were forced to permit felling and to grant licences.  A very real lacuna in the planning laws then came to light when the local authority tried to enforce the planning permission and the licences that they had given.  At this crucial stage the developer could claim while he was felling everything in sight that he was complying with the law by leaving the odd sceach, the occasional seedling and a scattering of holly standing.</P>
    <P>Given the spurious, trumped up and totally dishonest clamour which has been <Col N="1171" /> put up by a rag-tag and bobtail mob purporting to represent the borough on what they wish falsely to portray as high level intervention, it is worthwhile recalling that the very welcome personal intervention by the Taoiseach was the factor which led to the halt of the devastation of that irreplaceable part of our natural heritage, the beautiful woodlands of Tomnafinnogue.</P>
    <P>Another case where the threat of compensation was used to mug the local councillors in Wicklow was the case of the ESB 220 KV powerline which is now winding its ugly and obtrusive way through the garden of Ireland from Arklow to Carrickmines.  Here a State company in a most unethical and unpardonable manner has trampled over the rights of residents of small estates like Countybrook Lawns in Enniskerry, has ignored the fears of the parents of children at Kilmac national school and has cocked a snook at the rights of the special children who attend St. Catherine's School for the handicapped.  Recently the same ESB, threatening possible compensation claims, tried to force the manager and the members of Wicklow County Council to bow before its imperious might and to extend a 1980 planning permission which the ESB, the council and all and sundry know to be unconstitutional. The permission in question is unconstitutional on the same basis as was another 1980 permission granted by Wexford County Council.  I refer to the case of Gormley <i>v.</i> the ESB.  The ESB in their dealings with the council and with the courageous landowner who sought to protect the national treasure at New-townmountkennedy used the threat of compensation in a most extraordinary manner.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has welcomed, as I do, the raising of the compensation issue in this Bill, he has pointed out the possible deficiencies in the manner in which the proposal before us addresses the problem.  The fact that the Bill's provisions would not stretch to cover a case such as that of Coolattin would, in itself, warn me off the Bill.  The possibility of <Col N="1172" /> further constitutional difficulties renders this part of the Bill unsupportable.  The Bill's failure adequately to identify a community-funded value is a further defect.  The Minister has outlined the route he is taking in the proposals before the Attorney General to deal with the compensation issue.  Those sponsoring the Bill &mdash; and Deputy Keating in particular &mdash; should be satisfied with what the Minister has outlined.</P>
    <P>The second major problem dealt with in Deputy Keating's Bill is that of unfinished estates.  We in Wicklow have suffered, as have people elsewhere, from the blight of maverick developers in some estates in bray, Greystones, Kilcoole and Wicklow town.  Home owners are struggling with the aftermath of dealings with the quick buck merchants.  This is a very real problem which must be addressed.  I am inclined to the Minister's view that the provisions of sections 5 and 6 of the Bill are too particular in this matter.  It is undoubtedly correct to suggest that better administration and practice at local government level by the planning authorities, in addition to more rigorous enforcement, would tackle much of the problem of unfinished estates.  Frightening statistics have been outlined by the Minister in regard to this plague.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the office of planning receiver but it is hard to see how this concept, novel though it is, would work. As Deputy Flood pointed out last night, the planning receiver's ability to raise funds on estates left unfinished without any major realisable assets would be questionable.  I should like to see the existing law in this area used more carefully and perhaps strengthened.</P>
    <P>In the case of large estates, there is an argument for phased planning permissions with later stages of development being allowed only after earlier phases have been completed.  Early action by local authorities to ensure that the details of planning permissions are being met, more vigorous planning enforcement programmes and adequate security for completion would address the problem of unfinished estates in a better way than <Col N="1173" /> the untried concept of the planning receiver.</P>
    <P>This Bill, while welcome, has its defects.  Perhaps its most glaring defect is that its focus, while very important, is too narrow.  After 25 years the whole operation of the Planning Act is due for a rigorous review.  The development side of the Act requires attention.  The use of the infamous section 4 of the 1955 Act in conjunction with the 1963 Planning Act needs review.  Planning and development is a comprehensive issue.  While I welcome the focusing of attention on compensation and on unfinished estates, I feel that planning and development will be more appropriately dealt with in the comprehensive legislation promised by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill addresses in a twofold way the question of the payment of compensation in certain cases of planning refusal and the process of regulating the development and completion of estates.  I am not sure it was appropriate for the sponsors of the Bill to combine their attempts to resolve problems in these two areas in one Bill.</P>
      <P>The comments of Deputies on all sides of the House indicate agreement on the need for action in the area of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I must say that I am very much at one with the comments of Deputy Quinn who last week suggested that perhaps the most fundamental problem in this area relates to the manner in which compensation is assessable under the 1919 Act rather than as to whether compensation should be allowable.  A measure of the complexity of this problem is that, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, virtually every conceivable solution has been mooted in relation to this matter over recent years and none of them has so far passed successfully the Attorney General's office in such a way that it has been published as a Bill put forward on behalf of any of successive Governments. I say that deliberately as a prelude, to indicate the complexity of the problem and the difficulty in trying to find a solution which gets the balances right, which <Col N="1174" /> addresses the problem and which sits easily inside the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that this present and latest attempt proposed by the Progressive Democrats also falls far short of an ideal solution and, in fact, quite a number of the proposals in it, not only in relation to compensation claims but in relation to the matter of unfinished housing estates, are, I suspect, so unworkable that it is questionable as to whether some, at least, are improvements at all on the present situation.  It is, additionally, difficult to establish just how the proposers of the Bill felt that it might work in practice because of the extraordinary &mdash; I venture to suggest almost unique &mdash; wording of the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, which appears to be more of a political polemic than an explanatory memorandum.  It might perhaps have been more useful from the point of view of the sponsors, had they genuinely wished for support for the Bill, if they had attempted to write an explanatory memorandum which explained the Bill and how its provisions might work, rather than berating successive Houses of the Oireachtas for their inactivity in this area.</P>
    <P>This is a problem the complexity of which is known to everybody in active politics and I am not at all surprised that there are the sort of deficiencies I have noticed in this measure and which other Members of the House have also commented on.  This entire area is a problem to which there is no ideal solution.  What we must endeavour to achieve, as Members of the Oireachtas, is to put in place the most workable and most achievable of measures which help to guide the area of development and redress the problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>What we must try to achieve in the area of compensation is the very difficult task of bringing about a balance which defends the interests of the genuine landowner and, at the same time, which defeats the intentions of those who seek to use the provisions of the planning code in a manner which was neither intended nor fair.  That latter example in relation <Col N="1175" /> to some quite extraordinary compensation claims, as opposed to amounts actually awarded in recent years, has to a large extent prompted this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>It is equally fair to recall that it would be a genuinely generally held view in this country that people are entitled to private property and to the use and enjoyment of such.  That is established clearly in the minds of the people.  It is part of a national aspiration &mdash; perhaps not an unusual aspiration, it is reasonable to say, for a peasant race to have.  One need only think back to the activities of Davitt and the Land League to realise how highly Irish people value land and ownership of land.  In the context of the time and preparation of the Irish Constitution 50 years ago and, indeed, in comparative constitutions both prior to and later than ours, it is not unusual to find the right of guarantee to private property in these. Indeed, it might have been looked on askance had the Constitution been put before the Irish people at that time without constitutional protection for the right to private property.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in their proposed alternative Constitution the party who are sponsoring this Bill repeated, some months ago, virtually word for word the provisions of the 1937 Constitution regarding the right of the individual to enjoy private property and the benefits therefrom.  I do not disagree with that in any way.  But we must try to protect, of course &mdash; and the general public would not thank us if we did not &mdash; the situation where the relatively small landowner, down to perhaps an exaggerated example of the person who owns no more land than that on which his house is built and his front and back gardens, is protected against that front or back garden being expropriated by the State without any right of hearing, or right of appeal on the part of the landowner and without any right to legitimate compensation if, after an independent hearing, it is decided that that land should be acquired by the State.  That small landowner would expect that the Oireachtas <Col N="1176" /> would defend his small but to him very important property rights and the right to enjoy that property in privacy.</P>
    <P>Taking that a stage further, the owner of, say, two, three or five acres of land which perhaps also has been in the family for generations, would feel particularly aggrieved if he were to have that property removed from him compulsorily, without any right to recompense or compensation. He would feel that he had a right to seek to improve that property and to benefit from its enhancement.  That is what the Constitution initially and subsequently, the planning legislation set out to try to do.  Equally, there devolves an onus on the Oireachtas to ensure that when misuses of statutory provisions come about, the Oireachtas moves to try to cure that situation.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that, in a number of compensation claims which were made in recent years, the provisions which were designed to protect the common man and his right to private property have been deliberately misused by certain speculative developers in an effort to force compensation from the public purse into their coffers in return for their carrying out virtually no work or enhancement whatsoever.  On the other side, as has been pointed out, the level of compensation which has actually been paid out in recent years is indeed relatively minor &mdash; somewhere in excess of £80,000 but that is not to diminish the fact that it is also well known that in quite a number of cases the planning authorities had decided that it was better to grant a planning permission of some type which they might rather have chosen not to, so as to avoid compensation cases. To have an idea of the full picture, it is fairer that we should realise that, apart from the money actually paid, there have been instances of permissions actually granted where it seems those permissions might not have issued had it not been for the compensation provisions.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that any attempt to mend this problem will have to involve the 1919 Act and the method in which the level of compensation is paid.  Any <Col N="1177" /> measure put forward ought to include some provisions of that nature.  I was somewhat surprised that this present Bill did not do that.  The difficulty in trying to remedy the problem by including further non-compensatable reasons is that, as Deputy Birmingham pointed out last week, when he quoted from the book or article on this subject written by a member of the Irish Bar who has apparently particular knowledge and perhaps expertise in the area, at present the list of non-compensatable reasons is as long as one's arm.  Despite that there are still cases where individuals could and do take compensation claims.  No matter how many further non-compensatable reasons the Oireachtas attempts to include in the legislation there will still arise from time to time cases where the general public, quite rightly, feel that compensation ought not to have been paid in a case, and that a case was a misuse of statutory provisions.  That is not to say that there should not be an attempt to include further non-compensatable reasons, but they need to be workable.  I find some difficulty in the additional non-compensatable reasons that have been included in section 3 of this Bill.  I am not sure that they will improve the situation.  I am surprised that there has been no attempt to address a problem that arises regularly.  When a planning authority refuses development for clearly non-compensatable reasons and the decision is appealed to An Bord Pleanála, the appeals board will then quite regularly confirm the decision of the planning authority in refusing permission but will exclude from the reasons for refusal the non-compensatable reasons. As long as that situation can continue, we can write a volume of non-compensatable reasons but the refusal will still be compensatable because the appeals system will allow for decisions to be made which do not include non-compensatable reasons.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that so little discussion in this debate has centered on section 3(c) of the Bill because in a manner which is not in the present legislation this paragraph clearly allows for compensation to <Col N="1178" /> be paid to land owners if they are refused permission for reasons of public policy. For example, where a planning authority decide that an area should be zoned for public open space, this Bill is actually including a new and definitive compensatable reason which was not previously as clear.  It is rather strange, reading the contributions from the sponsors of the Bill that they do not advert at all to section 3(c).  It is not a paragraph to which I take particular exception because if it is deemed to be in the public good that one piece of land ought to provide the amenity for other lands which are to carry development and if it is felt that the public should have the enjoyment of that land, the public should be prepared to pay fair compensation for its use.  It is interesting that a new compensatable reason in a separate paragraph to be added to a section other than section 3 is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that in recent years members of the Judiciary have pointed out that the remedy in this matter lies with the Oireachtas.  It is fair also to point out that there is clearly not unanimity among the Judiciary in relation to the problem and how it might be dealt with.  The recent issue of <i>Administration</i> which was devoted exclusively to the Constitution, carried articles by Mr. Justice Brian Walsh and his successor as chairman of the Law Reform Commission, Mr. Justice Keane.  Mr. Justice Walsh in a very trenchant defence of the private property Article, said that the Irish Constitution unusually, with one exception, makes no express provision for the payment of compensation and he went on to draw comparisons with the Constitutions of France, the US, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, Greece and with the First Protocol to the European Convention of Human Rights, all of which specifically make provision for compensation, and he said that a Professor Where in his book on modern constitutions suggested that the Irish Constitution in the absence of specific provision for compensation payment hardly goes further than the Constitution <Col N="1179" /> of Yugoslavia.  After that trenchant defence of Article 43 by Mr. Justice Walsh, his successor Mr. Justice Keane suggested that there is some obvious deadwood in the Constitution and specifically that the utility of some of the Articles specifying individual fundamental rights is at least questionable. That and private property is an obvious case, he said.</P>
    <P>There is clearly disagreement even among the Judiciary as to how the protection of property rights ought to be carried out.  A lot of the case law in this goes back to the definition by Mr. Justice Kenny when he examined the 1963 Act and found it to be constitutional, when he referred to a bundle of property rights which everybody has and suggested that the removal of any one of those rights was not necessarily compensatable.  It is difficult to understand, for example, the decision of the courts in some of these cases taken with their decisions in other cases.  I mention in passing the O'Callaghan case where the Supreme Court ruled that compensation was not payable to a land owner who had had an order under the National Monuments Act placed upon his land, although they held equally that the ESB could not expropriate land for the purpose of erecting pylons without some form of appeal situation. On the other hand in the case of Druher <i>versus</i> the Irish Land Commission they ruled that the absence of compensation provisions was not unconstitutional. The extra-judicial pronouncements of members of the courts in a volume like <i>Administration</i> and indeed the contrasting court decisions shows that the courts and members of the Judiciary often have divided views on this matter.</P>
    <P>I noticed with interest that one of the references in the course of the debate was to the fact that some people seem to feel that there has been an over-rigidity in our planning laws and that there was perhaps in recent times an attempt being made to have a more open and flexible attitude on the part of the planning and development authorities.  The effect of section 3 would be to impose an even greater rigidity into <Col N="1180" /> the system and place a paramount importance on developing plans many of which are outmoded and well outside the time for their statutory review.  I am not sure just how realistic this extreme emphasis on the development plan would be from the point of view of practical development.  Before I turn to the other part of the Bill I would make the point &mdash; and the case is referred to specifically in the explanatory memorandum &mdash; that under section 3 (c) of this Bill the XJS case in Killiney which caused so much furore is clearly provided for as a compensatable case.  It would be extraordinary if the amount eventually awarded by the arbitrator under paragraph (c) of section 3 was any less than the amount which the arbitrator awarded in the XJS case.</P>
    <P>What is also relevant is that the entire area of Killiney Hill was offered to the local authority at a cost of £50,000 but for their own reasons they chose not to buy it.  If a local authority decide that they want to purchase an area as a public amenity then they have to be prepared to pay a realistic and a reasonable price for it.  In the XJS case because the local authority chose not to acquire the land at a very reasonable price, they later ended up having to acquire a smaller portion of it at a greater price.  There is a lesson to be learned from this.</P>
    <P>The proposal in respect of obtaining orders in the Circuit Court and that those orders should be of a mandatory as well as of a prohibitive nature along with the general provisions contained in section 4 are welcome.  Last week Deputy Birmingham made the point that orders obtained under section 27 of the 1976 Act were originally intended to be made not only against a development company but against the directors and shareholders of a development company.  In recent years the courts have moved away from imposing such a liability and for a resolution to this problem there would have to be a return to that provision whereby orders obtained under section 27 of the 1976 Act could be made against the shareholders and directors of a company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> I suspect that the passage of the Companies Bill, which will place greater responsibility on the directors of a company generally, will have very welcome spin-off effects in the area of development in that unscrupulous developers who set up one company after another would no longer be able to do this in the same way because of the personal responsibility they would have to carry as a director or shareholder of a previous company.  It is important to remember that the Companies Bill would make a very important tool available to planning authorities who are endeavouring to secure more orderly development.</P>
    <P>At present it is difficult to see how this problem can be resolved.  It is not possible to discriminate against a planning application on the grounds of the person sponsoring it because the planning application must be considered from the point of view of suitability to the land in question. It may very well be that the planning authority with a little bit of imagination might be able to take cognisance of the previous track record of the applicant through the size of guarantee bond which it would decide to impose.  I do not think that this course of action is resorted to very often.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1963 Act as amended by the 1976 Act offer far greater scope for finding a solution to the problems of unfinished estates and non-compliance by developers.  One of the things the Minister could do is to encourage planning authorities to pay more attention to their powers under the 1963 Act as amended by the 1976 Act and to encourage them to have a much more &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; approach to developments as they are taking place rather than just issuing permission and then later discovering that there is a problem in that the estate has been left unfinished.  The planning authority should monitor the development as it is taking place.  Any attempts to simplify the provisions contained in section 27 of the 1976 Act such as contained in section 4 of this Bill are to be welcomed but it would be far more preferable if the planning authority were able to <Col N="1182" /> sequester the guarantee bond and use those moneys to resolve some of the problems.</P>
    <P>The issuing of letters of compliance should also be resorted to more often by planning authorities.  It would be fair to say that better management in planning authorities would result in a resolution to many of the problems and would prevent many of the problems becoming intractable.</P>
    <P>My difficulty with this Bill lies with the way in which the sponsors of this Bill have attempted to address the problem of unfinished estates in sections 5 and 6 of the Bill because essentially they are Utopian.  If we lived in a Utopian world, there would be no need for legislation as those problems would not exist.  Section 5, for example, takes no account of the existing state of the construction industry and no account of the difficulties which would be presented for purchasers who were endeavouring to get finance in order to buy houses if a restriction was inserted that they would not be allowed to occupy those houses until the estate had been completed to a particular standard laid down by the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains an extraordinary manner for appointing a planning receiver.  I do not see what function a planning receiver would have unless he was going to obtain title to a property. As we are all aware, most development companies obtain funds from financial institutions and a financial institution will not advance money to a development company unless they have first charge on the property.</P>
    <P>If the first charge is to be set aside in favour of the planning receiver, then the financial institutions are not going to advance money.  There certainly would not be a problem because a development did not take place.  If the first charge is not going to be set aside then the planning receiver is going to have a thankless task because he would have to liquidate the remaining assets of the development company on foot of paying off all or part of the first charge of the financial institution who bankrolled the development in the first place.  Whatever about some <Col N="1183" /> of the more meritorious aspects of this Bill, and section 7 which endeavours to address this problem falls into that category, whoever dreamt up section 6 did this Bill a serious disservice.  I have to say, with respect, that section 6 contains a rubbish proposal which does not deserve to be contained in any measure which claims to seriously address this problem.  The solution to this problem is to allow the local authorities more ready access to guarantee bonds, for them to have better management expertise and for them to maintain closer touch with developments as they are taking place. They should also have the power of acquisition and the power of charging the development or associated companies. The concept of having a planning receiver amounts to nothing more than gloss; it contains no depth when one examines it.</P>
    <P>I have expressed our reservations on major aspects of this Bill and I have to say that if it passes Second Stage we, in the Fine Gael Party, will be proposing major amendments on Committee Stage to section 3 and possibly section 5 although I suspect we may be more inclined to oppose section 5 particularly because of the way it is worded at present.  Certainly section 6 will be opposed outright on the basis that it is unworkable and is not suitable for inclusion in any serious legislation.  I agree wholeheartedly with the provisions contained in sections 4 and 7 and I accept that attempts should be made to address these problems.  However, I would have to suggest to the House that while the aspiration is laudable, the solution is suspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am <Col N="1184" /> pleased to speak on this important debate.  The Minister has already outlined the Government's position in some detail.  We accept that this Bill is a serious attempt to make necessary changes in the law on planning compensation.  Some of the proposals we can support but we believe that the Bill does not go far enough and our Bill will be a much broader and wider ranging one.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has explained, a Bill on planning compensation is at present being drafted in the Attorney General's office and I can guarantee the House that this is being given top priority.  Our view is that the Bill, when drafted, and prepared with the benefit of the Attorney General's advice, will give us a sound framework for dealing with the difficult issues involved.  We see the value of the present Bill on a number of these issues and we will take these on board in finalising our Bill.  We will also be fully open to all reasonable amendments when the Government Bill is debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For these reasons we have asked in the most constructive possible way that the present Bill should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modern planning law stems from the 1963 Planning Act.  The system has changed considerably since then, but the law in the area of planning compensation is basically the same as that under the 1963 Act.  Section 55 of that Act gives the general rule which is that a person is entitled to compensation where a refusal of planning permission or the laying down of planning conditions reduce the value of his interest in his land.  However, section 56 sets out a list of exceptions to this general right to compensation.  These exceptions are so wide that, in the words of one commentator, one might be forgiven for wondering which is the rule and which is the exception.  In addition, section 57 prevents the payment of compensation where certain other development is allowed or where compensation has already been paid.  Under section 58 the Minister may, in certain cases, require the payment of compensation under section 55 even though the claim <Col N="1185" /> for compensation would otherwise be blocked by sections 56 or 57.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 to 58 of the 1963 Planning Act have generally provided a fair system for planning compensation but a number of Court rulings have raised doubts as to whether the system still protects the common interest as strongly as was intended when the 1963 Planning Act was passed.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement among all of us in this House that we have a problem which must be faced up to.  There is clear need to amend the law on the payment of planning compensation.  We all seem to agree on this.  I can also agree that the time to do it is in the short term rather than much further down the road.  I am glad that because of the time we have given to this we are now in a position in which we have made up our minds on what is required and can deliver in the short term.  We have already given very careful consideration to the very difficult problems involved in changing the law. Like a number of other speakers on the Bill, we are satisfied that worthwhile amendments to the law on planning compensation can be made without giving rise to constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Bill before the House does not go far enough to solve the problems in this very difficult area.  I congratulate the promoters of the Bill on bringing it forward and on the efforts they have made.  It would be a pity at this stage to miss out on the benefits from the detailed consideration which we have given to the large problems which have come to the surface in this area.</P>
    <P>I believe that section 3 (a) of the Bill will create its own problems.  The section provides for a wider definition of &ldquo;use&rdquo; for the purpose of section 56 (1) of the 1963 Act.  It is intended to reverse the effects of the Viscount Securities case but it could mean that practically every form of development would be caught by the changed definition.  These developments would then be non-compensatable in respect of an adverse planning decision. This, I believe, goes too far and could give rise to new serious problems in relation to planning compensation.  The <Col N="1186" /> Minister for the Environment has given details to the Dáil of the Government's new proposals regarding compensation. He has promised considerable extension of the scope of non-compensatable circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I said, I can support some provisions of this Bill but they do not go far enough.  The Minister for the Environment has been reviewing all aspects of the law on planning compensation to ascertain what changes can and should be made.  This review has taken full account of recent court cases on the compensation issues.  It has also dealt with the problems brought to light by the Coolattin situation and looked carefully at possible constitutional difficulties.  The review is now completed and a general scheme is now with the Attorney General.  Drafting is being given top priority with a view to the earliest possible circulation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We propose, for a start, to restate and, as necessary, amend the present rules for determining the amount of compensation in planning cases.  These will be included in a Schedule to the Bill.  A number of new rules will also be added &mdash; these will largely reflect the recommendations on this question of the Report of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  Power will also be given to the Minister for the Environment to vary, by regulations, the list of rules, subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We propose also to amend the law on &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; to give planning permission so as to have regard to the judgment in the Grange Developments <i>v.</i> Dublin County Council case.  Local authorities will be in a position to resume use of this arrangement.</P>
    <P>In general, we propose not to allow the payment of compensation in any case where the refusal of permission is on the grounds that the proposed development would conflict with an objective of the development plan.</P>
    <P>The new Government Bill will amend section 45 of the 1963 Act so as to limit the payment of compensation under subsection (2) as a result of a tree preservation order.  Our Bill will provide that <Col N="1187" /> a proportion of the trees included in an order can be preserved, in the interests of amenity, without compensation.  The aim of this change will be to strike a better balance between the need to preserve the amenity value of woodlands and the reasonable rights of the owners of commercial woodlands.</P>
    <P>Our Bill would also include suitable transitional provisions to cover both claims and rights to compensation arising under previous legislation.  Transitional arrangements of this kind are not included in the Bill before the House. Our Bill will deal with the questions of deficiency of water supply and of rights of connection to public sewers and mains in a manner broadly sinilar to the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes a number of other amendments to planning law beyond those dealing with the central issue of compensation.  It wants a greater involvement of the Circuit Court in enforcement procedure; and also to allow the courts to order repair or reinstatement works on an application under section 27 of the Planning Act, 1976. Works of this kind can of course already be required under an ordinary enforcement notice.  In general, I have an open mind on the merits of these proposals. As the Minister has said, we will certainly be prepared to consider them fully in the next review of miscellaneous planning law improvements.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes extensive new powers to deal with unfinished development, including the appointment of a planning receiver.  I have to say that I regard these proposals as over elaborate. They are unlikely to produce as much improvement on the ground as the more energetic approach to planning administration which we are trying to encourage in local authorities.  The Minister has spoken of the detailed survey of this problem which the Department have now completed and of his initiative in involving the Construction Industry Development Board to advise on a solution.</P>
    <P>So what else can I say to the House? The Government share the concern for <Col N="1188" /> early and sound changes in the law on planning compensation.  As I have said our proposals for this are well advanced. The intention is to have our Bill circulated before the summer recess.  All of us want to have the best Bill possible on this very difficult topic.  It is in this spirit that I ask the promoters of the Bill to withdraw it so as to enable progress to be made on a much wider measure.  All of us can hopefully then share in the success of a good Bill, a Bill which will strike the proper balance between the rights of property owners and the common good.</P>
    <P>It is a high priority of the Government to bring a Bill before the House as quickly as they can.  It will be open to debate and we will be sympathetically disposed to accepting any amendments which would improve the Bill.  If they are designed to improve the Bill we will do our best to accommodate them as far as we can.  It is the Government's aim to introduce a comprehensive Bill on this matter before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Geraldine Kennedy for giving some of her precious time.  Like the Minister I would like also to welcome the fact that the Progressive Democrats have taken the initiative in putting forward this Bill. It is good that local government planning and development and the Acts relating to these subjects should be discussed in the House at this time.  Such a discussion is long overdue and it has been obvious to many people for a considerable number of years past that radical reform of our planning laws is also long overdue. This Bill is well intended and contains many useful and necessary proposals. <Col N="1189" /> While I support many of the new measures proposed by the Progressive Democrats, I must make a number of criticisms of the Bill, and I do so as somebody who has worked in the building industry for most of my life.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the implications of many of the proposals.  As Deputy Boland said, even the explanatory memorandum is not much help and one would want to study the details of the many court cases cited in the document and which took place between 1978 and 1987 to be able to deal with and grasp many of the points in the memorandum. Unfortunately one has to take much of the Bill at face value and this is not a reliable method of coming to terms with such a complex matter as planning.  There is also considerable duplication of existing legislation in the Bill.  Perhaps this is inevitable but it does not help to clarify many of the sections and parts of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, there are good and urgent reasons for the reform of our planning laws.  Some of the decisions and interpretations of the Supreme Court in recent years have been extreme and perverse. Such decisions have nothing to do with good planning or the public interest and when these planning laws were being framed 25 years ago one could never have envisaged that such decisions would be made by any court.  One can also say that as a direct result of these decisions planning is now an expanding and lucrative area of law in this country.  In their judgments the courts are giving the maximum weight to the rights of private property and the so-called free market but little weight to social responsibility and the common good.  The position is that the rights of private property have always been canonised in our society.  I do not want to sound alarmist but because of Supreme Court decisions in recent years in upholding, and in some cases extending, the almost unqualified rights of private property as laid down in our Constitution, there is a strong possibility that much of our present planning legislation could well be found to be unconstitutional if tested in the courts.  It is hardly desirable that our planning laws <Col N="1190" /> are forced to operate in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>During the course of his submission to the House Deputy Boland invoked the name of Michael Davitt.  I wish I had more time to deal with what he said because Michael Davitt was a very sorry man that he ever founded the Land League.  The cry &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo; must surely have been a sad and cruel misnomer because the people of Ireland never got the land. Only a small minority of them got the land and the people who had the land when we got self government in 1922 probably still have the land now.  This is hardly a desirable state of affairs but perhaps it is something I can take up elsewhere.  To invoke the name of Michael Davitt in this context tonight is a cruel mockery of what the man stood for.  I am sure that if he had his time over again he would not give a drop of sweat, not to talk of a drop of blood, for the Land League and the cry &ldquo;The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  He was a sad man at the end of his days when he saw the way things turned out but he would be even sadder today if he knew that after 65 years a small number of people have used the concept of private property to make themselves rich at the expense of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in the Kenny report have not been implemented because people have said they are unconstitutional. I do not accept that.  These measures should be implemented in the interests of the public and the Constitution should be amended accordingly. Phrases like &ldquo;common good&rdquo; and the &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; are useless if our Constitution continues to remain unchanged and if the Supreme Court continues to give bizarre decisions on compensation.</P>
    <P>There are some good parts in this Bill. I welcome those and I wish I had more time to expand on them.  However, I have great difficulty in coming to terms with many other parts of the Bill.  It does not take account of the fact that some of the rogue developers have been known to put in as many as six applications for the one site.</P>

      <P>I will wind this up in half a minute.  It is very difficult for any court or planning authority to know what planning application or what part of it a developer is carrying out.</P>
      <P>I must agree with what Deputy Boland said about the question of unfinished sites and not allowing the residents to take up residence in those areas.  If that happened it is not the developer who would be punished or penalised but the unfortunate house buyer who already has to pay bridging finance for long periods.  In this case the buyer would pay the cost and not the developer.</P>
      <P>I wish I had more time to speak, on more aspects of the Bill.  It is unfortunate that one who has worked in the building industry and knows a little bit about it cannot say these things whereas other people who have very little knowledge of it can ramble on for a long time.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Progressive Democrats are using their fourth Private Members' Time since I was elected to bring forward a major initiative in the planning area.  This Bill is long overdue.  If my relatively short career as a Deputy has taught me anything, it is that aside from social welfare problems, the most frequent inquiry from constituents relates to their experience with planning problems and rogue developers. It is in the sure knowledge of this fact that I have taken a determined stand on the need for the full planning process to be invoked for the marina in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this new Bill is to do much more than merely amend and widen the local government and planning Acts dating back for 20 years now.  Its real purpose is to provide, for the very first time, the facility to combat the <Col N="1192" /> menace of cowboy builders through inexpensive planning enforcement by both the planning authorities and by aggrieved individuals of communities and, in particular the residents of unfinished housing estates.</P>
    <P>I support the aims of our Bill and I notice that most Deputies who have contributed to the debate over the last four nights would be in agreement with its aims also.  I hope that the Opposition parties in this House will vote for our Bill tonight rather than go along with what the Government are proposing, that is, to put the grave problems in the planning area on the long finger once again and into the category of promised legislation.</P>
    <P>The most remarkable feature of the Progressive Democrats' Bill is that it changes the law so as to ensure the completion of unfinished housing estates.  The powers conferred under this Bill will enable local authorities to direct, through the planning process, the sequence of building work and prohibit occupation of unfinished developments until all the essential works are completed.  Far too often, as most Deputies in the House will know, cowboy builders have been able to erect houses in an estate and sell them leaving either uncompleted or, unsatisfactorily completed, the pavements, roadways or open spaces that are an integral part of the environment of a housing development.  A common practice relied on by unscrupulous developers of large scale housing projects is to incorporate their activities on a house by house basis with another and separate company holding the freehold title to the development site and, on completion or sale, these one-house companies are put into voluntary liquidation and the unfortunate residents have no useful legal redress.  In relation to this abuse of the principle of incorporation, one of the proposals canvassed in the preparation of our Bill was that the controlling principles behind development companies be required to apply jointly in their own names, along with the company, for planning permission. This would have the advantage of enabling people to know with whom they are dealing.  However, to be really <Col N="1193" /> effective major changes would be necessary in our company law before this ideal could be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>Leaving that problem aside, this Bill provides a mechanism to prevent cowboy builders from taking their money and running, abandoning residents of unfinished estates and leaving them to their own resources and to the financially hard pressed local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates the function of planning receiver for the first time in a role analogous to that of the receiver and liquidator in company law.  For the first time in planning matters we are proposing that the court can call a halt to rogue developments in accordance with the planning permission granted and in the interests of the community involved. This feature is unique because it takes an offensive attitude to planning problems and overcomes the bureaucratic and financial inertia that inevitably affects local authorities when left to clean up the mess of cowboy builders.</P>
    <P>I believe that this feature would work well in practice even though Deputy Boland disputes it; he is quite welcome to do so because any further proposals could be debated if this Bill were put into Committee, and I think that our proposal of a planning receiver in time would be worth extending to permit control over property that is deliberately being allowed to go into dereliction.  No longer will an irresponsible property owner of, say, a listed building be permitted to remove the tiles off the roof shared with his neighbours so as to hasten the decline of his property in order to defeat the planning controls on a change of use.</P>
    <P>The Bill also seeks to prevent and curtail the abuse of compensation provisions of the planning Acts by property speculators. It is necessary to point out, considering the lack of attention given to these matters, that this serious shortcoming in planning legislation which continues to be exploited to the cost of local authorities should have been addressed and attended to by the Government immediately on taking office last March in the wake of the XJS case in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> The Bill also proposes to close off another loophole where property speculators are able to use existing sanitary legislation to compel local authorities to provide sewerage facilities to sites that have not received planning permission.  It also enables authorities to seek financial contributions to the cost of providing sewerage facilities.  In this way developers who have ignored their planning responsibility cannot force local authorities to recognise their activities after the fact.</P>
    <P>The other major change proposed by the Progressive Democrats is to confer on the Circuit Court the jurisdiction at present exercised by the High Court in relation to section 27 planning injunctions. This would automatically have the effect of overcoming the invisible barriers to High Court litigation such as the divergence in scale between small planning problems and expensive recourse to the High Court.  In this way recourse to the courts by aggrieved communities in the protection of their environment would become more realistic; people would be able to afford it.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes further than that, however, in dealing with the anomalies and limitations of the so-called planning injunction provided for in section 27 of the Planning Act of 1976.  Subsection (1) of section 27 as it stands only permits the court to prohibit the continuance of development or unauthorised use where permission has not been obtained but does not permit the court to go further. Our Bill is intended to rectify this anomaly and to make express the court's jurisdiction to order and direct as it sees fit in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>This would bring about an enormous improvement in the planning laws as they affect the ordinary residents' associations in many estates throughout the country. I have been presented with a problem created by the limitations of the section 27 injunctions as they are being encountered by the residents of 100 to 110 Quinn's Road, Shankhill at present.  This problem has been going on for years and still has not been resolved.  When these ten houses were being built the developer <Col N="1195" /> took part of their gardens and a side entrance to the development for his building materials.  The full gardens have never become the property of the householders. Dublin County Council sought an order in the High Court last year in respect of the discontinuation of the unauthorised use, the removal of the concrete sheds, the removal of the false boundary wall at the rear of 100 to 110 Quinn's Road and the incorporation of that area into the rear gardens.  In his judgment delivered on 6 October 1987, Mr. Justice Gannon stated that, as the law now stood, he was unable to order the removal of the concrete sheds nor the removal of the wall at the rear of the gardens nor the closing of the gate and passage from Quinn's Road.  He did, however, under his powers under section 27, grant an order restraining the continued unauthorised use of the piece of land and preventing it from being sold.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> The limitation in section 27, as illustrated by this case, means that the residents of this area and Shankhill have never been able to appropriate their full gardens as provided for in the planning permission for this housing development. Under our proposed change in the Bill, the High Court or Circuit Court would have been enabled to make an order not merely restraining the continued unauthorised use of the lands but delivering back to the residents the ownership of their rightful property.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am very pleased that we have presented a major change in the planning laws in our fourth Private Members' Bill to the House.  I would appeal to the Opposition parties to support us.  If they do not agree in full with some of the proposals we have put forward, they can be debated in full on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this Bill last week I made the point that I did not intend to be repetitious but to concentrate on some of the more general features as they would impact on agriculture in terms of its productive capacity, and I drew attention to the serious contrast that exists between the aspirations for employment creation in agriculture and the food industry and the cuts that were taking place.  I said that the shedding of 1,000 jobs nationally could have the effect of letting the market dictate those to whom agricultural services would be directed.  I drew attention also to the impact on western agriculture and gave some details of the existing programme in relation to agricultural advice and research in such counties as Galway and Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand how any serious Minister for Agriculture and Food can suggest that the proposed development targets for western agriculture that have been outlined in one <Col N="1199" /> study after another from the original seminal study of Dr. John Scully to the present day are achievable at the level of the cuts now being suggested.  In a very few minutes this evening I want to make a few more general points.  One that to me is very important, and I repeat it because I have stressed it previously is that in moving towards a system where by agricultural advisers will have to generate revenue for their services, inevitably those who can afford to pay the charge will be able uniquely to capture &mdash; so to speak &mdash; the research functions of what was up to now a State function.  Many people who work in the field in agriculture have told me that their ability to generate an income from, let us say, farms in the west is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>I will give the approximate figures given in a number of different studies on west of Ireland agriculture.  If I remember correctly, over 70 per cent of the holdings are under 50 acres and perhaps half are under 30 acres.  They have a very high degree of fragmentation.  The soils and drainage in many of these farms are deficient and they are remote from the market.  Most of the economies of scale in agriculture do not prevail and there will be a massive withdrawal of farmers who are below the line of commercial farming.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what many people may think, I have experience of living on a small farm, having been reared on one in County Clare.  Since I have lived in County Galway, I have had a number of dealings with the county committee of agriculture and, indeed, at one time decided to use an opportunity I had because of the strange, fortuitous way of political fortunes, when I held the balance of power in Galway County Council, to nominate someone who was not associated with my direct political life to the county committee of agriculture.  I refer to Professor Michael Cuddy with whom I have had a number of discussions about the workings of the county committee of agriculture.  He drew my attention to the kind of discussions that took <Col N="1200" /> place in that committee.  Those committees function very well and they provided a very valuable source of information on the way that agricultural proposals impacted on the ground.  Dr. Cuddy later carried out a very valuable study on the impact of the different Community Directives in relation to retirement, land structures and so forth and the obstacles to their implementation in western agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to advise the Minister of State that a committee dominated by members of his own party in County Galway were among those who unanimously passed a resolution opposing the abolition of the county committees of agriculture and the cuts in relation to AFT-ACOT.  I wish to pay a tribute to the brave members of Fianna Fáil who put the interests of their neighbours, the small farmers in the west, before party loyalty on that occasion and who drew attention to the effects of these savage cuts.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a few more points which have arisen in the debate but which have not been explained so far.  The projected budget of ACOT for 1988 was a £10.5 million State source contribution, £3.9 million from local authorities, £2.8 million from EC funding, £1.5 million for charging for services, £2 million from miscellaneous sources and £9.5 million from AFT.  The total expenditure comes, in the case of ACOT, to £20.7 million but the expenditure for 1987 and £29 million.  This leaves a shortfall of £8.3 million for the projected activities for 1988.  I should like the Minister to state how this shortfall will be adjusted and how much will be met by moneys which the advisers will have to collect.</P>
    <P>If you take the calculations in the case of County Galway, with which I am familiar, it means that advisers would be asked to collect between £5,000 and £7,000 each.  If you ask advisers how they will generate this income they will very quickly tell you that they can only do so by cutting out visits to those who are unable to pay.  The way it now works is that advisers pay one visit and, if the charges are not paid, they will not visit <Col N="1201" /> again.  We need to be very clear about this.  In County Galway, it will have the effect of reducing the number of advisers from 35 to 23 and it will also endanger a number of outlying stations and advice centres.  Not only will this have an effect in structural terms in abandoning the entire social case for bringing those below the development line up to development, it will also have another effect in so far as it will lead to a great demoralisation among the farming community.  It is very difficult to swallow all the guff and rhetoric about western packages and integrated programmes while at the same time being asked to accept the withdrawal of research advice.</P>
    <P>This is against all the evidence of what is achievable by the impact of the advisers.  All we have to do is to look at the time when we had a shortfall in fodder and how quickly it was gathered in these counties.  It was directly attributed to the activities of the advisers and of the people working within the institutions which will now be merged, ACOT and AFT.  I should like to say, <i>en passant,</i> as somebody who speaks Irish in this House, that it is a most monstrous abuse of the language to call something that is given in its English appellation, Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Bill, 1987, Teagasc, An Foras um Thaighde, Oiliúint agus Comhairle Talmhaíochta agus Bí.  I ask those who draft these strange terms to have some respect for the language and to realise that the use of the term Teagasc in this way, followed by a hyphen, with a jumble of neologisms in the Irish language is in no way related to the English translation.  Teagasc, as all of us who have been involved in it either as a verb or a noun know, is an abuse of the language.  It is a minor point but if one is involved in the butchery of the State institutions responsible for advice and training, we might at least, like a good elegant butcher, have respect for the terms given to the operation.</P>
    <P>There will be, of course, in the national effect of the cuts in the new merged entity a number of very serious national effects. Let me put it simply because I want to leave time for other contributions and <Col N="1202" /> this Bill should come to a close soon. There is the notion that the last thing you should do is to plan.  These proposals represent the death knell of any orderly arrangement for increasing productivity in the basic agricultural sector or of developing value added if you are talking about the food industry.</P>
    <P>I should like people to explain how it can be planning to toss figures into a so called <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and, at the same time, dismantle the research and advisory infrastructure that might enable people who are below certain productivity levels, to achieve new levels of targets.  It is rather like saying that we will withdraw everything which might have facilitated or expanded productivity but, at the same time, uttering some kind of prayer that the food industry is the thing.  Those people are wandering around the country repeating those statements like mantras, 3,500 jobs in tourism while the tourism promotion budget is cut back and a whole series of daft arrangements are set up to make it impossible for people to come here and spend their money on recreational fishing and so on.  Equally, in relation to agriculture we are going to create a food industry but we will, of course, cut out thousands of farmers who might have access to advice.  Where has such a policy worked?  There is no place in the peopled earth where such strategies have worked.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on addressing the issue of the food industry because we have lost so many potential jobs by not harnessing and capturing the employment potential of value-added in the transition from agriculture to food. How will we do that if at the very base of agricultural productivity the Government are withdrawing services?  The Government may say they will concentrate on those to whom the advice will now be directed.  As far as I can see they will fall into categories, those who will be able to pay the charges and get a minimal level of advice and research and the people in the upper commercial level who will now be able to get unique access to those who have left AFT and have set <Col N="1203" /> themselves up in consultancy firms.  The myths might go like this: will they generate the productivity to create the capacity for the food industry to expand? I invite the Minister, and his advisers, to look at the statistics for agricultural production here and say if they are the people who are producing more per acre. Of course, the evidence is that they are not, that the most intense productivity levels per acre are concentrated in the middle ground.  It makes no sense to be moving to an American-style agriculture and to be saying at the same time that we are hoping to create more jobs in farming and in the food industry.  It is an absurdity.</P>
    <P>What we are witnessing is a rhetoric that stands as a substitute for planning, cuts that are real, the removal of more than 1,000 people from the advisory and research functions in agriculture and the total withdrawal of research and advice from those who need it most urgently if they are to develop and retain their farming households in areas that have been neglected over the years.  There is nothing as bad as killing by hypocrisy.  I do not believe that this is a malign attempt.  I believe it is a case of people having no concept or commitment to planning stripping away the planning infrastructure, the advisory and research infrastructure.  Those taken together are little less than disastrous.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, an outside study of AFT and ACOT has been carried out.  It studied the deployment of staff within those agencies and how they might be best deployed in the future. There has been no attempt in the speeches from the Government side to refer to the distance between what is now proposed and the suggestions made in that outside professional study.  There is no recognition of the very considerable stripping away of staff that has taken place since 1982 within the institutions that are affected.  In 1982 there were 1,030 people involved but 193 of them have gone.  There were further cuts between 1985 and 1987.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The expert opinion in agriculture, obtained from those who do not have any axe to grind, is that money spent on advice and local research is well spent. The decision to remove the local input by getting rid of county committees of agriculture will be disastrous.  When I began in politics I visited the Maam station and had a conversation with the dedicated official who was developing a certain breed of sheep.  However, that project has been closed down.  It was relevant to the area particularly to those involved in sheep farming but somebody decided that that activity should be removed from its natural ecological locale to somewhere else.  There were other innovations which were opposed initially by conservative people and it is my belief that members of the agricultural community are no less conservative than others.  Those innovations related to the use of helicopters for staking, seeding and fertilising the land but what will happen to them in the future? Is the Minister going to tell me that those services will continue after he has allowed the market to dictate the flow of services and innovation into the agricultural sector?</P>
    <P>What will be the relationship in the new order of things between Teagasc and the local authorities?  Who will take up the gap in contributions?  Is somebody going to tell me that the hard-pressed local authorities, facing cuts between 12 per cent and 14 per cent, will be able to put more money into gaps left by the cutbacks in finance?  That will not happen.  Agricultural advisers, and those who work in the area, tell me that there are among those on whom they call farmers who cannot be asked for money because they do not have it.  I have looked at suggested changes in the delivery of advice in a number of countries and what is unique in ours is the abrupt changes in overall agricultural emphasis in the past ten years from different commodities. That shows the absence of a long or medium-term commodity policy.  Those changes have been introduced in a very short period of time.</P>
    <P>When right-wing governments, the <Col N="1205" /> equivalent of ours, took office in other countries they did not attempt to bring in a single year such drastic changes in the infrastructure of agriculture.  In Britain, and elsewhere, they have allowed a longer period of time for the changes. The shortest period is about three years. What will happen to the great developments that were taking place in relation to different sectoral activities in the western counties?  I am thinking of the programmes that were developed between the county committees of agriculture and those who were administering the advisory function.  Is anyone telling me that they can stay in place?  I am thinking in particular of the different sectoral activities that were brought into being by an inspired staff at the Galway office.</P>
    <P>The ACOT corporate plan for the period 1986 to 1990 had as its main theme, better and not just more.  That is a most admirable aspiration if one is talking about the transition from agriculture to a food industry because it addresses the question of quality.  In Galway specific targets were established for dairying in relation to building up the yield per cow by 30 gallons per annum, the reduction of calf mortality and the improvement in the quality of milk.  In relation to cattle, there was an emphasis on a reduction in calf mortality and an increase in suckler cow numbers annually by 6,000.</P>
    <P>In regard to lowland sheep, there was acceptance of the target of increasing ewe numbers of 268,000 by 13,000 per year. Eighty per cent of finished lambs were to be of a higher quality.  There were specific programmes and schemes aimed at hill sheep and there was a tremendous effort by way of education to deal with the problem which Scully had identified. There have been great changes since his work of nearly two decades ago.  He identified the fact that very many farm operatives had little access to post-primary education.  An attempt was made to ensure that all new entrants to farming would have at least some sort of certificate in farming.  A great number of special short courses were being run to enable people to return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> Then there was another curious arrival on the scene, An Bord Glas.  Literally translated it is the green board, whatever that might mean.  It is presumed in this House to have something to do with vegetables. In horticulture specific targets were established for the organisation of centralised purchasing and more adequate marketing and branding.  In County Galway when these proposals are implemented less than half the number of farmers will have access as heretofore. Under the existing scheme of things, even with the cuts, since 1982 there had been an increase in all the areas I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Milk yield had increased by 40 gallons per year per cow.  There had been a 2 per cent reduction in calf mortality and there had been programmes in relation to mastitis control.  In addition 90 per cent of all farmers with more than five suckler cows were visited and there had been encouragement to use continental AI.  Prices of lambs had been maintained.  There was no glut but rather an orderly production for the market.  Ewe numbers increased by 7 per cent per year in 1985 and 1986. Mountain sheep programmes had been established, including a cross-breeding programme.  Fertilisation, spraying and fencing schemes had been introduced using new technology.  Five thousand farmers participated in short courses in 1987 in County Galway.  In that year three groups of students were awarded certificates in farming following a three-year course.  In the horticultural area there were a few new producers of mushrooms.</P>
    <P>Where a development programme had been established by ACOT nationally, it had been interpreted in terms of a number of specific targets across sectors in that county.  The achievement of these targets had been brought about by the available staff who visited people living on small farms and encouraged them. There was a demonstration effect as the targets were achieved.</P>
    <P>It is little less than scandalous to ignore the social consequences of the removal of advice and research.  It is little less than scandalous to say to people who had the advantage of an academic training but <Col N="1207" /> who put on wellingtons and went out along bad roads to small farms that they are to be moved back and that some of them are to be relocated in administrative areas.  They have told me they will not choose to sit at desks.</P>
    <P>This is the madness of taking a gross figure and saying it has to be cut from the budget of two merged organisations, AFT and ACOT.  It is madness to think that this new body, Teagasc &mdash; whatever that might be &mdash; can operate with fewer staff and abandon so many people in the agricultural community.  We are asked to believe this is a good thing.  It is a good and progressive thing for this Government to be interested in developments in agriculture, horticulture, fisheries and the food industry but if they keep on setting targets and, at the same time, refuse proper planning and remove the capacity for production and for the creation of value added, people will say this is just another area of failure.  I do not want to wish failure on this country.  I am interested in the maximisation of the employment potential of agriculture and the food industry.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the land use map of County Galway and the small number of commercial farms.  Figures show that between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of all the products of that county are exported without any value added whatever. The same applies in most of the western counties.  There is the inevitable regional loss of that employment.  How can we say that the remaining commercial farmers will be a sufficient base for production to fuel that kind of employment potential?  Nobody in his senses can operate like that because it does not work. Economic historians and economists dealing with the land problem here have drawn attention to the fact that it has a highly regionalised structure.  There is a lack of explicit planning in relation to agricultural production.  It was quite mad to say that volume production of milk in its day which suited a pattern of Munster agriculture was somehow suited to the fragmented small-scale farming in most of the western counties.  It is equally mad <Col N="1208" /> to say that we will be able to benefit from any kind of merged social and regional funds, integrated packages or whatever, while we walk away from the agricultural capacity of farms below a certain level in these counties.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons the Labour Party are opposing this Bill on Second Stage. We believe we are not talking about a very significant innovation.  We are talking about cutting jobs and reducing access to services, as well as the limitation of services to a very much smaller group of people.  Even if one accepted the arguments for the new merged institution, it is not only its name that is an absurdity. to what extent has the independent research function carried out by AFT been removed into the new institution?</P>
    <P>The references to the Minister in the text of the Bill indicate an entirely different relationship when compared to the independence and autonomy of research enjoyed by AFT.  There are many other new features and changes in structure which would cause worry, even in an operational sense.  The biggest issue is the idea of removing so much money while, at the same time, creating a new entity and removing so many people from the advisory service who had overcome many obstacles in securing access to small-scale farming in particular.  Their removal will be little less than disastrous.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by simply saying that it is becoming almost unfashionable now to think about unemployment or the consequences of unemployment or emigration. In the fifties, in most of the agricultural communities there was an average emigration between the age cohorts 15 to 19 years and 20 to 24 years of between 40 and 55 per cent and even in the period when out-migration stopped the end of the fifties to the seventies, there was a continued out-migration, if you like, from rural communities.  Since we joined the Community we have less than 40,000 farm families living and gaining employment from agriculture.  If we were to try to create employment, there was and is an enormous capacity from agriculture and the food industry.  There were enormous benefits also.  The raw <Col N="1209" /> materials were there.  We still have these. The possibilities for gaining every possible job slot were there and are there.</P>
    <P>This was in quite a contrast to an industrial policy which, over on the other side of the economy, was filing last year £1.254 billion in tax breaks to the private sector to try &mdash; to use an agricultural image &mdash; to get the sick cow of the Irish private sector to get up on her feet and give a dribble of milk.  In 1986 we spent £997 million and so forth.  Even when we have captured significant foreign investment we can see that the outflow of profits running at £1.5 billion, joined now by the so-called patriotic Irish savers of about £500 million in savings flowing out of the country, there is great advantage in agriculture in that the basic commodity is here, the activity is here and the advantages still exist.  I agree with the Government that there is an enormous advantage in developing the food industry but you will not develop it if you cut back on the very basics that are necessary for creating a more productive agriculture.</P>
    <P>All the evidence was that if you drew a line through the total number of holdings, the greatest capacity for expansion in productivity was below the line rather than above it in terms of farm sizes.  Equally, in relation to that expanded productivity, the employment content was very much higher below the line than it was above the line, in terms of size of farm holding.  It is the employment potential of agriculture and the food industry that is being endangered by these disastrous proposals.</P>
    <P>I speak in absolutely no negative sense at all.  I doubt how anybody can be serious about planning the expansion of agriculture and the food industry and, at the same time, say you can withdraw resources from it and restructure them in so much more an administrative way, rather than in a research way or in a way that will deliver the services on the ground.  You will not make Irish agriculture productive by withdrawing back to desks and telling the people who achieved the targests I have listed that they will now be able to achieve them by doing <Col N="1210" /> sums on paper.  That has been a recipe for disaster in relation to our industrial policy and what will inevitably follow from this will be a return to and an increase in the levels of emigration from the Irish rural communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to follow the colourful contribution of Deputy Higgins. With many of his remarks relevant to the west of Ireland I can express sympathy and agreement.  This Bill has been in this House for quite some time.  It is played out to a certain extent.  There has been an amount of back slapping on the one hand and objections on the other. Most contributions have centred around the various centres in the country, at AFT or ACOT level, where individual Deputies have had concerns expressed to them about continuation of operations there.</P>
      <P>Obviously, in the context of this Bill against a background where agriculture is continuing to be extremely important in our economic framework, we have to expect changes.  This change and the merger of ACOT and AFT are supported in principle by this party.  The original Bill was drafted back in the seventies by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton.  It was opposed bitterly both from a personality point of view and from a statement point of view by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The wheel has come full circle in that regard.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the Bill which have been referred to and spoken about over the last number of weeks.  In the context of change, the report recently published by the IDA in terms of food industry expansion, emphasises strictly the need to change from an agricultural processing industry as supplying intervention material, etc., to a food industry supplying quality food for the European market.  That is a fundamental change in itself.  It is very important in the context of 1992 and the tax barriers across Europe coming down at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also critical in the light of the proposals made last year by the United States at the World Trade talks, from the point of view of the proposal that food <Col N="1211" /> subsidies and farm support over a ten-year period would be abolished and phased out.  The Common Agricultural Policy is of critical importance to our county, spending almost £1,000 million a year.  The development and announcement of the company to be publicly quoted in terms of food is a very interesting development and one that probably should have come about quite some time ago.  We look forward to seeing how it will operate in the competitive world of agriculture from here on.</P>
    <P>The overview given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in a leaflet published earlier this year sets in context for us the position with regard to this Bill and other matters relevant to the Department. It is difficult to see how the Minister can reconcile his Government's bible, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> where the stated view and aspiration of the Government is that the amalgamation of AFT and ACOT &mdash; and I am quoting here from page 21 &mdash;&ldquo;will provide the kind of services required to meet presentday needs and gear the agricultural food industry more appropriately to the fundamental changes now occurring in these sectors including the application of the latest technological developments&rdquo;, with the consequences of what will happen once the merger has taken place, been put through and is serviced by a 43.5 per cent reduction on the 1987 provisions.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has protected his own Department and has left the front line services to the wolves.  It will not be possible for the merged body of AFTACOT, this hybrid animal Teagasc which has been dealt with, from a parsing and analysis point of view by Deputy Higgins, to deliver the quality and the extent of service to comply with the Government aspiration as stated in their <i>programme for National Recovery.</i> How could it be, when the amount of money has been cut back from £35 million to a block grant of £20 million on this occasion?</P>
    <P>The party on this side of the House are allowing this Bill through for a variety of <Col N="1212" /> reasons.  We accept the principle of the merger.  I have referred to the introduction in the seventies of the Bill by the former Minister for Agriculture.  The move to implement the present proposed merger was started by the previous Government and the joint head of the two bodies was appointed on January 20 of last year.  The Fine Gael Government had decided to proceed ahead with the merger of AFT and ACOT and we, therefore, support the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I regret the delay in having the Bill circulated and that sufficient time was not allowed in the earlier stages for all of those who wished to contribute, to do so. It is necessary that this should go through, because the structures at the moment are crumbling.  It is obviously necessary to have an organisation set up and running within the constraints and the facilities given to them, that would allow the agricultural industry to recover somewhat from the damage already inflicted on it. There has been an unholy mess with the merger.  An interim director should have been appointed.  Possibly we would not have the low morale and confusion that has existed about his merger if that had been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture seems to have protected his own Department and has left front line services to be savaged. There will be insufficient money to run Teagasc and the organisation will run out of money before the end of the year.  Will we then see a supplementary estimate being introduced or will savings be found in the Department of Agriculture which might be shified to the new body to allow them continue their work to the end of the year?  I understand that already there is an overdrawing of approximately £1 million in terms of the budget already allocated to the two organisations.  It is difficult to see where in the present Estimate sufficient moneys are allocated to run the organisation until the end of the year.  Will the Minister clarify that when he replies to the debate?</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about the excusion of some areas of research from the proposed umbrella organisation.  The <Col N="1213" /> reduction in finance for research and development is nothing short of scandalous. To stand still in terms of research and development is really to go backwards in a European context; it is to cut off the possibility for potential expansion in the future.  It is critical in a changing competitive environment that research and development relevant to the needs of our community and to what others demand from us, continue to be made available and that resources be given to the people qualified to work in that area.</P>
    <P>Last week it was suggested that people qualified in research and development should be employed on a contract basis. That is worth considering.  Those who emerge from the universities and training areas at an early age have the initiative and the enterprise to do the highest level of research and development.  There is a certain amount of merit in that suggestion and it should be examined.</P>
    <P>Research and development is allied to the education process that has been going on for a number of years.  We are an unusual race.  We can be pushed so far, we can be given so many facilities and told how to do things and why things should be done, but often there is not the individual motivation to carry these things through to fruition.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the method of appointment to the board of Teagasc by the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister proposes to make five direct appointments and to make five further appointments after consultation.  That is fine from the Minister's point of view but does that mean that when the Minister and his advisers meet with the various representative organisations they will accept at first hand whoever the organisation proposes to be appointed to the board, or does it mean that the Minister will conduct a sort of high level interview for a particular kind of candidate?  Alternatively, does it mean that the Minister might be subject to political pressure to appoint various people so that we end up with a nice cosy arrangement and a board subject to the Minister's every whim so that nothing of real relevance emerges from the umbrella body.  We do not want <Col N="1214" /> people to be appointed from various cumainn around the country so that Ministers are ringing up various hostelries and hotels seeking people to tell them the good news before it is told in the Dáil. We do not want that sort of thing either. There is merit in what the Minister proposes, but I would not like him to fall foul of political pressures.  The people on the board should have something real to offer in the critical area of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In speaking to people working in AFT and ACOT I have found that there is very low morale at the moment.  People are confused and are not quite sure whether they will be made redundant or will be redeployed.  People do not know whether their centers will close, where they will be next year or what kind of programmes of work will be laid out for them.  I understand that something like 800 people out of a total of 2,000 have applied for the redundancy scheme. Some of these people would obviously be in for redeployment and many applied because they were told that if they did not apply, redeployment might not be open to them next year either.  A staff operating under that kind of constraint leads to poor morale, lack of initiative and a generally cynical attitude about the whole operation.  That was allied to the fact that advisers last year had to go around the country and more or less sell tickets to the farmers saying that they had to generate so much money in order that they could come out and tell the farmers how to dose their cattle, grow their cabbage or whatever else.  Some agricultural instructors are very good salesmen and have done a fine job at that. Those who are interested are willing to pay, but others in their thousands are now being left a side.  Many farms will turn to weed and will be over-grown within the next few years.</P>
    <P>The service demanded by the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> cannot be delivered when the consequences of what will happen to agricultural instructors are realised.  In many of the western counties distances are vast, and with early retirements, acceptance of redundancy and non-filling of vacancies <Col N="1215" /> there will be great distances between where agricultural instructors work and live.  Instructors will not travel from 50 to 80 miles to farmers who might require their services and farmers will not be too keen to actively look for that kind of service.  Allied to that is the fact that a great number of those who completed 100 hour courses and took various pieces of advice from ACOT and AFT have left the western regions and have gone to Australia, America and Britain in their thousands.  The tears that were shed for them by the party on the other side of the House when in Opposition do not seem to shine as bright now.  The service is being denuded of its brightest and best. They are leaving for private operations and for the prospect of better jobs elsewhere. If researchand development is to be forced to run down, this country will be all the poorer for that agriculturally and in the times ahead when we will face increasing competition from Europe, that will not put us on the footing on which we should be in terms of what will happen in 1992.</P>
    <P>The fact that a proposed merger will bring about a change from a county system to a regional system has to be examined somewhat seriously.  I regret that the county committee system is being abolished and it is interesting to note that this was strongly opposed by Fianna Fáil public representatives and members on the county committees for many years. Many of these committees did a fine job, relative to their local needs, yet they are now being abolished.</P>
    <P>The creation of a two regional system, comprising east and west, possibly indicates the Government's thinking on the way the country should be run.  The western region will comprise the 12 western counties and commercially run programmes will be set up in the east and south which have natural advantages over the west, with rural development programmes being set up in the west.  Somebody once wrote a play entitled &ldquo;The Monday Scheme&rdquo;, the gist of which was that a wall should be built around Connacht in order to make it an international <Col N="1216" /> graveyard.  With the cutbacks in the AFTACOT budget how is a reduced number of instructors going to cater for those farmers who show initiative in going ahead to improve their lot?  Is this going to mean that those involved in agriculture in the west are going to have to diversify into as many areas as possible, such as pigs, poultry, mushrooms, bee-keeping, cheese making, agri-tourism or forestry development?  At present a battle is waging on the charges being imposed in respect of certain pastimes connected with the tourist industry and because the disadvantages far outweigh the advantages the Government should take another look at this proposal.</P>
    <P>I think there should be equal representation on the board from east and west.  In fairness, as there are only two divisions being proposed there should be equal representation from east and west. In my own county in 1980 there were 36 advisers.  Today there are only 19 and instructors have now got to travel greater distrances.  For example, there is one instructor based in Belmullet and two in Westport.  The distance between the two towns is 50 miles and it will not be possible for them to provide a decent service.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas in the western region have been ravaged by emigration and as a consequence spending power in the west has been greatly reduced.  Those who would spend most on social activities, food and clothing are those who are leaving and the reduced spending power has caused many problems in these areas. Those who remain are the older age group of farmers who have not participated in any of the 100 hour courses and who have not availed of any of the advice which is available.  The reality is that many of these smaller farms are just going to disintegrate.  The headquarters of ACOT in the disadvantaged area are based in Davit House in Castlebar. Under the county committee system, offices were opened in Ballina, Ballinrobe and Westport and I would not like to see these headquarters being closed down.  Fears have been expressed in this regard and I seek clarification from the Minister that this office will remain open <Col N="1217" /> and will continue to liaise with the county council the VECs and other bodies.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the recent announcement concerning the western package.  Every so often there have been colourful characters in the west who have made announcements and carried on in a political way but what happened recently literally took the biscuit.  There was a rush to deliver the good news concerning the western package and frantic efforts were made by MEPs to announce this good news in Europe.  It was nearly as good as the stroke which had been pulled by a fine-hearted Mayo man and former Deputy of this House, Deputy Flanagan, who announced some years ago that he had a £500 million package all sown up for the west.</P>
    <P>It was like Rommel's triumphant cavalcade from the desert or Chipperfield's Circus when gaily painted State cars, seven in all, arrived at the ACOT headquarters in Castlebar to inform the people about the millions of pounds which were going to be made available and dished out.  There were going to be no more bad days, difficulties or worries. One could call it the cavalcade of millions. Ministers were beaming broadly and Ministers of State smiled and waved at people expecting cheers of exultation in return for this wonderful announcement but what happened?  It appears that Moses struck the rock twice and nothing happened.  What do we now find?  We find that not alone has an application not been lodged in Brussels but that the amount is to be reduced by £80 million while the area to be serviced has been increased by 15 per cent.  We receive television, radio and newspapers in the west and I must say that this whole exercise was typical of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party and an insult to the intelligence of those who are involved in agricultural development in the west.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you have a long and honourable tradition of visiting certain parts of the west and you are aware that those in the west have often accepted things at face value but many of those have now called to see public <Col N="1218" /> representatives and to the ACOT headquarters in Castlebar seeking application forms to apply for some of these millions of pounds which they were told were going to be made available but all they have found is that not alone is there nothing there but no information is being made available to them.  Public representatives on the other side of the House have repeatedly said that these application forms would be available from 1 June.  I do not know whether that commitment is going to be honoured but I intend holding the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, to it.</P>
    <P>I have to say that those in the west have changed their attitude towards the Government and their concept and philosophy of the better way.  Gone are the days when they climbed on the old steam trains, waved their caps, said goodbye forever and cheered de Valera and his band.  Gone are those days; they are now understanding and very ciritical.  This practice of Government Ministers arriving in seven State cars in the town of Castlebar, waving to all the people, smiling broadly, delivering nothing, was one of the most cynical political exercises I have witnessed in very many years.  Those concerned ought to be ashamed of themselves and be man enough to stand up and apologise publicly for what they did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am afraid not.  I want to say to the Ministers of State sitting opposite that many points arising from the new umbrella body will present difficulty for the western region.  For instance, in the area of lamb production, what has been happening to date is that on average the lambs produced were between the 26 and 32 pound weight.  Apparently, that is no longer required in Europe.  In Italy they demand lambs over 25 pounds and in France over 36 pounds.  The market has not actually disappeared but has <Col N="1219" /> changed.  I am not sure whether the Ministers might be involved with Coras Tráchtála Teoranta in terms of finding an alternative market for the kind of lamb produced in western regions.  It would be difficult for such producers to change in a short period of time.  Naturally the more lambs one has the more disease one will have and the more assistance and advice one will require.  If there are to be fewer instructors, less money with which to pay them enabling them to travel around the country, it will be a self-defeating exercise.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues raised related to the research centres, the ACOT centres and with regard to fears of closure.  It was said in the <i>Programme for National Recovery:</i></P>
      <P>&mdash;a revised Western Development more suited to the specific needs of the West will be introduced in 1988.</P>
      <P>I welcome that commitment because, emanating from the Government's bible it cannot be wrong, or so we are led to understand.  If a revised western development programme is to be more suited to the specific needs of the west there must be direct Ministerial intent to so do.  I should not like to see the only research station dealing with sheep disease, drainage and pollution in the entire disadvantaged area abolished.  I am referring to the centre at Creagh outside Ballinrobe, owned, lock, stock and barrel by An Foras Talúntais.  Indeed in the early seventies An Foras Talúntasi themselves proposed its closure.  There were grave concerns expressed at the time and after much political pressure and so on it was kept open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that the disadvantaged area comprises 55 per cent of the total area of Ireland, contains 70 per cent of suckler cows, 55 per cent of total sheep and 85 per cent of hill sheep.  The centre at Creagh has been intimately involved in dealing with the specifics of requirements.  When that centre was given the brief of undertaking research with specific relevance to agriculture and the development of land use in the west, I should say that is exactly what they did. <Col N="1220" /> They carried out works in relation to many areas relevant to that region, for example, on ewe nutrition, on the evaluation of forage, on the fattening of store lambs, on grazing systems for sheep, work in the area of mixed stocking, on the hill sheep systems and research into the epidemiology of parasite infections which is of great significance in dealing with disease in that branch of sheep production.</P>
    <P>The centre also dealt with the monitoring of health problems in hill and lowland sheep, providing recommendations on how such problems might be controlled or eliminated.  As the area contains a good deal of the marginal land of the country great work was undertaken in the development of drainage machinery, of systems and new methods for the construction of playing fields sited on difficult ground.  There has also been quite an amount of work done, and continuing, on the control of pollution and the monitoring and control of water pollution. Obviously that will be of great concern to the two Ministers of State present, the Minister himself, and my county colleague, the Minister for the Environment. Most of the farmers we have met are willing to undertake remedial work provided they receive assistance from the Department of the Environment or some other Department where a problem can be identified.  In the context of a European pereception of this country, of free fishing, clean waters and clean air, that perception should be nurtured.</P>
    <P>The research centre at Creagh, likewise, have done excellent research work on game and deer and this is continuing. I might point out to the Ministers of State present that the work carried out in this research centre always has been related directly to the environment, the type of agriculture that can be developed from native resources in the western region.</P>
    <P>I am aware that each Member will already have made his or her case in relation to their local AFT station.  When the relevant decisions are taken, obviously some will fall by the wayside.  I want to impress on the Ministers &mdash; in the <Col N="1221" /> context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in which it is specifically stated that a new programme, geared to the needs of the west, will be introduced in 1988 &mdash; that this station is owned by An Foras Talúntais, there are no leasing or purchase charges involved.  It is located there and should continue to be used where it is, right in the centre of the disadvantaged area, working in that kind of environment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the future of the centre, I should say that work is already under way in terms of improved and more efficient systems for lowland sheep. Farmers have been considerably educated in recent years in terms of reducing the mortality rate of their sheep and lambs, much of that work having emanated directly from the Creagh centre.  I appeal to the Minister to retain this centre and allow it to flourish.</P>
    <P>One criticism I have had of An Foras Talúntais over the years is that they never really brought home to the farmer on the ground the value and quality of their work.  It would have been in their interest if they had many open days, or whatever, when the people of the locality were invited to observe the consequences, effects and beneficial results arising from quality research and development.</P>
    <P>We are letting this Bill through.  We believe it is necessary.  We support it in principle but we are concerned about the amount of money actually allocated for this year.  I should not like to see the new body, Teagasc, build up a head of steam and fall flat on its face by the end of December, or have a cloud hanging over it by way of a directive from the Department of Finance for a further 10 per cent reduction, so that they would get lost in this amalgamation of £400 million we hear that the people over there will have to decide, discuss and incorporate in the Estimates for 1989.  We have problems with various sections of the Bill and I am told we will be tabling appropriate amendments on Committee Stage in relation to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I do no have much time because the Minister has to <Col N="1222" /> wind up the debate.  I should like to welcome this Bill because I believe it will be an improvement.  Like the previous speaker, Deputy Enda Kenny, I too would be afraid that anything would happen to the Ballinamore research station in County Leitrim which is in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  This centre has done much good work during the past number of years and a lot of research has been carried out there. There was an epidemic near where I lived and some sheep died on the mountainside. The farmers took the sheep to the research centre at Ballinamore, found out what was causing the sheep to die and rectified the matter.  That is one of the reasons I do not want the research centre at Ballinamore to be closed.  I should like the Minister to keep that in mind when a decision is being made.</P>
      <P>During the fifties there were 500,000 farmers in this country but today there are fewer than 160,000 farmers.  There has been a massive drop in the number of farmers and we must ask ourselves why there has been such a drop.  I suppose that when small farms were not viable two or three farmers sold their land and one farmer bought it so that today one farmer is making a living off a farm which was owned by three farmers previously.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer in particular to cattle headage and the off-farm income. I was very disappointed at the decision to bring down the limit for off-farm income from £6,400 to £5,200.  Small farmers in the west of Ireland cannot make a living off small farms and have to get part time jobs in order to survive.  I hope that in the proposed new western package the off-farm income for part-time farmers will be increased considerably to a realistic limit.  Before I came into Leinster House I was a small farmer and I was unable to get a headage grant because I had an off-farm income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the new ideas in farming and the way farming is going, farmers need a lot of advice from the farm advisory service.  The biggest problem facing farmers who make silage is pollution.  The sooner the western package comes in <Col N="1223" /> with an increased grant for farmers to enable them to provide effluent tanks for their farms the better.</P>

The western package which was introduced in 1981 was supposed to last for ten years but it did not last for ten years.  Hopefully when the new western package is implemented it will last and benefit the farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to hold up the Minister and I will finish in a few minutes.  At present farmers use large milk bulk tanks to bring milk to their local co-ops.  Sometimes they have to travel quite a distance but the county roads in the west of Ireland were not made for milk bulk tanks.  I hope that there will be money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for five minutes of his time.  I am concerned about the off-farm income limit for small farmers in the west of Ireland in the new western package.  As I said at the beginning if the present rate of £5,200 is not increased to at least £10,000 or £12,000 in the new western package it will not be worth the paper it is written on.  I know that part-time farmers in the west of Ireland would not work in the county councils or the forestry if they did not have to do so.  If they could make a living off the land they would stay on the land but unfortunately their farms are so small they have to subsidise their income by going to work.  I want the Government to increase the off-farm income limit and not decrease it.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture will do this.  We raise this matter at our agricultural committee meetings and I am not afraid to raise it in this House.  I should like the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, to take note of the fact that we want the off-farm income limit increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies for their very worthwhile, constructive and wide ranging contributions to this debate.  They ranged from potholes and slurry tanks to the odd expedition down the west of Ireland.  I will not comment on some of those points because I do not think they are very relevant to the Bill.  I want to acknowledge some of the contributions made and to thank my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for facilitating the speedy passage of this Bill.  The contributions were contructive and I think there is a desire by all Members to allow this legislation go through the House so that the new board can be set up, that a <Col N="1225" /> national director be appointed and the new body can get on with their job.  While there were some Deputies who expressed reservations on certain sections and aspects of the Bill, I believe there is broad agreement on the desirability of amalgamation, and recognition of the benefits that can accrue from the rationalisation and streamling of agricultural training, advisory and research services under a unified management and direction.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have expressed concern at the level of funding for the service in 1988.  While funding is a separate matter, it is a question for decision by the Government in the context of the overall Estimates, and I should refer the Deputies to the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks in this regard in his introductory speech; he recognised at that time that there could be difficulties for the bodies and gave an assurance to the House that in the event of the new authority being set up, and set up quickly, it would not lack for essential funds.  I wish now to reiterate and reaffirm that position. There will be no running out of funds and there will be no lack of essential funds for this new body.</P>
      <P>Let me now turn to the specific references made to the provisions in the Bill itself.  The main questions which appear to be causing concern to Deputies are: ministerial control in sections 8, 13 and 19, board representation in the First Schedule, the provisions on disclosure of information in section 14, the restriction in the area of veterinary research and, finally, the name &ldquo;Teagasc&rdquo;.  Indeed Deputies Michael Higgins and Enda Kenny, in their own colourful way, referred to the title of this Bill and I will come to their reservations in relation to it later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of ministerial control appears to be causing particular concern, especially to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  He counted the number of times there is reference to a Minister in the Bill.  But if any of the Deputies had a look at other, similar legislation passed by this House, I am sure they would find comparable references to ministerial control.  Such provisions are not unique to this Bill.  The <Col N="1226" /> vast majority of these are standard in recent, similar legislation.  The Labour Services Act, 1987, is a case in point.  I do not regard having ministerial control as any great problem.  Deputies and Ministers in this House are elected by people. In a democratic system they are entitled to have a degree of control.  It annoys me personally to get from time to time responses from State bodies saying clearly to me that it is none of my business to inquire into any particular matter in relation to some of these boards.  I do not think that is the way business should be done in a democratic society and I have no personal problem in relation to ministerial control in this legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 8 on the control of staff numbers about which Deputies O'Keeffe and Stagg appear to have some difficulty, the position here is that this reflects the present reality of the need for central control of the total numbers and the numbers in each grade in State bodies which are funded to a very substantial degree by the Exchequer.  Such controls are placed on Departments in the Civil Service and State bodies and it would be logical and consistent that similar controls would apply to the Agriculture and Food Development Authority.  I can assure both Deputies that such controls do not, as has been suggested, extend to normal management matters such as the redeployment of staff within the Authority. The intention here is to ensure that there is no unnecessary increase in staff costs and numbers in the public sector.  I would also remind the Deputies that such provisions were in the legislation initiated by the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to the points raised regarding ministerial control in sections 13 and 19.  These provisions are intended to give the Minister a say in advance on the broad thrust of the programme of activity in the Authority, that is, without becoming involved in the day-to-day activities which are specifically excluded. I would like to remind Deputies that we are dealing with a State body which will require substantial Exchequer funding. In my view it is not unreasonable, given the amount of State aid which the body <Col N="1227" /> will receive, that the responsible Minister's consent should be required in advance of committing significant annual public expenditure of taxpayers' money. It would indeed be strange if the Minister had no legal right to see that national research, training and advisory operations took account of Government policy priorities for the agriculture and food sectors of the economy.  I would emphasise that it is not the intention that the Minister should become involved in the management of the Authority but rather that he or she should indicate particular policy areas to be given attention when this is considered necessary or prudent.</P>
    <P>The position concerning the composition of the board is that the Government decided that a small board of high calibre and well qualified members would be best fitted to serve the needs of the new Authority.  It is important that the Minister be given maximum flexibility in deciding the composition of the board, and I do not think the Minister would be concerned about ringing people up in public houses or in hotels.  May be that is what happened in Deputy Kenny's party's term in office but it has no relevance whatever in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To those who would suggest that such a degree of flexibility will lead to the selection of people other than those best fitted, I would say it would not be in the interests of the Minister to have other than the most suitable people on the board of the Authority.  I want to pay tribute to the dedication of the present board under the chairmanship of Mr. Matt Dempsey.  They have done quite an outstanding job in recent months under difficult circumstances.  We want people of this calibre and dedication on the new board also.</P>
    <P>On section 14 in regard to the disclosure of information, I find it difficult to understand why some Deputies have expressed reservations on this.  The section states that a person shall not, without the consent of Teagasc disclose any information obtained by him while performing duties as a member of <Col N="1228" /> Teagasc.  It is not unreasonable that the board of Teagasc should have a legal right to grant or withhold that consent.  At the end of the day any such information obtained by employees of Teagasc in the performance of their duties on its behalf is the property of Teagasc and not of the individual research worker.  Even from the point of view of common courtesy it is only right that an employee be obliged to seek that consent.  I might add that there is freedom for Teagasc, under section 8, to delegate this function of consent to the director or any staff member, so that no undue obstacles need arise in the rapid dissemination of research results.  Moreover, such an obligation rightly places responsibility on the board of management for the publication of such information thereby protecting the individual from any personal liability. In recent years, under the whole system, it became a fact of life that quite a substantial amount of concrete research was done by An Foras Talúntais and this will happen to a great degree in the future.</P>
    <P>For commercial research confidentiality is absolutely essential.  There is no way in which any commercial organisation will fund a research project unless they are absolutely assured of the confidentiality of the results and of the ongoing development that is taking place. They do not want to read about their research project in the newspapers or find a competitive industry introducing the findings of their funded work, so I do think that confidentiality is absolutely important in this situation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have questioned the exclusion from the new Authority's remit in the field of basic veterinary research of certain activities specified in section 1. There is no question here of introducing new restrictions on research.  The provisions of the Bill reproduce precisely the veterinary functions currently enjoyed by An Foras Talúntais, no more and no less. The exclusions mentioned go back quite a long way.  They were in fact applied, and correctly applied, by the Mark Clinton legislation of 1977.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> The activities excluded relate to regulatory responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The diagnostic work on individual animals or poultry arises mainly from normal veterinary feed practice where serious disease could be in question.  It is essential because of the responsibilities of the Minister for Agriculture and Food under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, that the work should continue to be done by the Department's veterinary officers at Abbotstown and the regional laboratories. The other activities specified relate to the animal health schemes for which the Department have responsibility. The veterinary investigation, tests or inquiries, referred to constitute an essential back up service to the operation of such schemes.  The involvement of Teagasc in these regulatory functions would clearly be quite inappropriate to its wider research mandate and would, moreover, lead to a wasteful duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the county committees of agriculture.  I know a good deal about these organisations because I was chairman of the Cork County Committe of Agriculture on a number of occasions.  Several Deputies have expressed regret at the passing of the county committees of agriculture and paid tribute &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; to the contributions they have made to agricultural development.  I share those sentiments but as I stressed in my opening speech the realities of the present time dictate that the maintenance of the county structure can no longer be warrented. I do not think anybody would disagree with the proposition that an organisation which services any industry must ensure that there is accurate feed back from the users of that service particularly where the users are expected to pay.  It is a question of how best to get that feed back.</P>
    <P>The review group who have recently been looking in detail at the operations of AFT and ACOT were convinced of the effectiveness of ACOT's system organised on a district rather than a county unit basis.  They were impressed <Col N="1230" /> by the value of the advisory committees in each district.  As representative of the direct users of the service I am satisfied that the best way to go in this matter is to leave the organisation full discretion as to the mechanisms it may establish to ensure that it is responding as closely as possible to the needs of its clients in each area of activity.  This is provided for in section 17.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made by a number of Deputies, especially Deputy Jim O'Keeffe to the desirability of the new organisation maintaining close liasion with the universities and indeed other agencies which may be carrying on research in the area of agriculture and food.  This would, of course, be an essential role of the new organisation in discharging the principal functions set out for it in section 4 (1) of the Bill which includes the co-ordination of agricultural research and development.</P>
    <P>An Foras Talúntais has developed links with the universities over the years and the new Authority which will have all the present powers and duties of An Foras will, no doubt, maintain and strengthen the ties of co-operation with the universities.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the closure of centres and particularly centres and field stations in their own constituences.  Deputy Avril Doyle expressed her fears as to the significance of the reference in the Minister's opening speech to the fact that Teagasc will concentrate on the essential service and that those of lower priority would be reduced or phased out.  There is nothing ominous in that statement and, indeed, the Minister has not decided to close any of these centres.  The question of deciding priorities or on the reduction or increasing of particular activities will, in the first instance, be a matter for Teagasc.  That statement was made on the reasonable assumption that in the amalgation of the two bodies &mdash; AFT and ACOT &mdash; there is scope for rationalisation and savings. Even if the Minister had any centres in mind &mdash; which he did not &mdash; it would be totally inappropriate for him to suggest <Col N="1231" /> these as such matters are for the board of Teagasc to decide.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed serious reservations on ministerial controls in the Bill and called for full freedom for the new body to manage their affairs. I think it is incompatible for any Deputy to urge, pre-empt or usurp the decisions which will be a fundamental function of the new Authority.  It is not possible for Deputies to have it both ways, on the one hand to have reservations about ministerial control and on the other hand to leave the management of the affairs to Teagasc.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also cited statistics designed to show that governments in the developed northern European countries now spend relatively more on research than on advisory or training services than we in Ireland are providing.  The suggestion made was that because countries such as Turkey and Nigeria are similarly giving greater support to advice and education we are somehow backward and ill advised.  Surely, we should not be deciding our priorities in the allocation of resources on the situation in any other country, developed or otherwise, but on the needs of the people and on the needs of industry in Ireland.  I would invite Deputy Doyle's consideration of the special priorities which were attached to farmer advice and training by her own Party in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987..</i> I quote:</P>
    <P>The Government believe that efforts to accelerate growth in agricultural output must concentrate on that segment of the farming population which has real development potential. ACOT is, therefore, being asked to concentrate its advisory services on those farmers who have the resources and motivation to achieve such development.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the Irish Government funding on agricultural research, in absolute terms, is very low by European standards, the fact remains that we devote a higher proportion of State funded <Col N="1232" /> research and development to the agricultural sector than do most of the member states.  The latest figures available show that over 30 per cent of our total research and development funding went on agriculture.  That is the highest percentage among the twelve countries of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle also referred to the efficiency audit in the Department of Agriculture and Food, AFT and ACOT. The result of this audit will be used to assist the management in my Department and in the Department of Finance in determining appropriate staffing levels. Surveys of this kind are a regular feature of staff management in the public service and it is not the normal practice to publish such internal audits.</P>
    <P>I have noted the reservations expressed by many Deputies as to the suitability of the name Teagasc and their fears that it may not readily lend itself to the marketing activities of the body.  This is a matter of subjective opinion.  I have no difficulty with the matter and I think it is a peripheral issue.  However, in deference to those views which, I have no doubt were sincerely held, I am prepared to reconsider the point should an alternative name which wins a wider degree of acceptance emerge between now and Committee Stage.  I will make a box available in my office to anybody who wants to suggest a suitable name and we may come up with something more acceptable.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the most important points raised on the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill provides the most appropriate and effective framework for the delivery of research, training and advisory services essential to the success of the agriculture and food industry in the years ahead.  It brings together, in a cohesive unit, services which were formerly dispersed.  It should maximise the benefits that will accrue to the industry from the funds invested in the services by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I understand and I note the reservations and anxieties expressed by Deputy Kenny in relation to Creagh, in his own constituency, and by Deputy <Col N="1233" /> Mattie Brennan in relation to Ballinamore. Deputy Brennan also raised the matter of off-farm income.  That does not come up specifically under this legislation but I will, nevertheless &mdash; as he made a sincerely held plea &mdash; have <Col N="1234" /> another look at the question of off-farm income.  I will note the Deputy's reservations in that regard.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pat McCartan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment a matter concerning a former Chilean refugee to this country, Luis Tricot, who is at present imprisoned in Chile.  Shall we say ten minutes for the Deputy and five minutes for the Minister to reply?  Is that satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to make this plea on behalf of a former associate and friend who spent a number of years in this country having fled the terror of the Chilean régime under General Pinochet.</P>
      <P>Luis Tricot came to this country in June 1975 shortly after the takeover there by the junta under the leadership of General Pinochet.  From 1975 to March 1987 he sought to make a livelihood in this country, to pursue an education and rear a family which includes two young children who are citizens of this country.  In March 1987 he returned home, following his wife and two children on the understanding &mdash; tacit though it was &mdash; that he would be well received and well accommodated. Unfortunately, within a few short months, this young man was in the grip of the secret police, interrogated and suffering from severe spinal injuries caused by his interrogators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is a man of talent who in the years he spent here pursued studies at Trinity College and at Essex University in England which led to a doctorate in Latin American Government and politics.  I associated and worked with him in the cause of solidarity with Chile in his years <Col N="1236" /> here.  His arrest has been a cause for concern by the Government and all parties in the House.  Initially, his arrest was on the basis of complicity in an alleged Kidnap of Colonel Carlos Carrena.  The colonel was subsequently released unharmed but, unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Luis Tricot.  There was no evidence to substantiate his arrest and subsequent correspondence established that the current accusation against him is the alleged possession of a piece of detonating wire.  The accusation has been constantly denied by this young man and I have no doubt that the wire was conveyed to the scene of his arrest in the comfortable concealment of the pocket of one of those who arrested and later accused him.</P>
    <P>In February this year, through various hands and devices, I received a letter from Luis Tricot written in his cell in Santiago.  I cannot do more for the cause of this young man than to read some of the letter:</P>
    <P>Dear Friends,</P>
    <P>It is now six months since my detention by the State police (CNE) and I still keep getting cards and letters of solidarity from hundreds of Irish men and women.  People I've never met, but nontheless feel very close to my heart, since they have been a constant source of support not only for myself and my family, but for all political prisoners.</P>
    <P>When one finds oneself in a situation like ours, a few beautiful words from a young girl, from Bandon or from a trade unionist in Dublin, acquire a very special dimension.  We know we are not alone, that people elsewhere do care.  Your solidarity and concern makes it more difficult for them to continue torturing us, or simply kill us. For this is Pinochet's Chile, a country where terror and violence are systematically used by the dictators in order to suppress any expression of dissent.</P>
    <P>In Chile, death has become a form of life.  Beneath that air of normality and tranquility you can &ldquo;breathe&rdquo; the <Col N="1237" /> screams of those being tortured, the anguish of the disappeared, the hunger and misery of the shanty towns.</P>
    <P>This is not the country I grew up in, but I came back because I believe in freedom and the beauty of man, in his creative hands, in his capacity to overcome mediocrity and build a dignified future for all.  I came back because Chile is not the partrimony of a few, it's the land of Lantaro and O'Higgins, Rodriquez and Allende, of millions of compatriots whose only dream is to be free, and they fight for it and it is hard and painful, you may even cry at times, but you also smile and laugh and keep up the struggle when you realise that more can be transformed into action, when you know that you are not alone, that your brother is fighting in Copiapó and your sister is challenging the police in Temuco...</P>
    <P>Chile needs your solidarity more than ever before.  Myself and my wife's ordeal constitute nothing but a tiny drop in an ocean of oppression.</P>
    <P>Thanks Irish friends for your help and support.  We will never forget you, do not forget us.</P>
    <P>Just like you tendered us a friendly hand when we needed it and accepted us as refugees, we will, one day invite you all to come to a free Chile, for I am absolutely certain that we shall, overcome.</P>
    <P>The beauty of that letter is not just in the words so ably put but in the fact that it was written by a man who at this stage must be in a desperate state.  He has a wife and young family who live outside the country without hope or expectation. He was arrested on charges that were not sustained but later substituted and he has been in cusody for almost eight months without trial.  Mr. Tricot has very close links and affinities with our country and we must all extend our hand of help and support to him.</P>
    <P>I must express some disappointment at the response to date of the Irish Government to this case.  I understand that the <Col N="1238" /> Irish Government have made representations and for that Luis, and ourselves, thank them but there is implicit in all their representations an acceptance that he has not been tortured and of the explanation that the serious back injury he suffered arose from an epileptic fit. That is unacceptable.  The suggestion came initially in a report from the Red Cross which was responded to by us on 4 November 1987.  We said that there was no basis for the Red Cross conclusion in regard to this.  There was a suggestion, in correspondence on 14 December '87, that the correct information was available and that the Irish Government were acting upon it.</P>
    <P>As far back as October 1987 I made the suggestion to the Irish Government that they might request a represenative from the Buenos Aires Embassy to travel the short journey, 100 miles, to Santiago to discuss with Luis his experiences and report on his physical condition.  That is not a big task to ask the Government to undertake but it is as urgent as many of the visits by delegations from the city to London on behalf of Irish prisioners there, Luis is a friend of our country.  We have a responsibility to him.  I hope his plight will be highlighted more earnestly as a result of this Adjournment debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that if Luis's intent is direct in expressing an interest in returning to his country he would intercede on his behalf. I presume that the letter of 1 March last from Luis Tricot has deen received by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  In that he explained that he was anxious to return with his family to live here, though reluctantly.  His country is Chile but circumstances beyond his control make it impossible for him to live there for the time being.  I urge the Minister, on behalf of all of us, to continue with his earnest efforts, to ensure that he is safe and well and to initiate his safe return to this jurisdicion where he will be received by all of us with the respect he deserves for the long years he has spent in his determined campaign to oppose the excesses and wrongs of the Pinochet regime.  I should <Col N="1239" /> like to thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to make this appeal.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be able to respond to this debate on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I should like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter, The Government are concerned to do what they can to help to protect the welfare of Mr. Luis Tricot. Mr. Tricot has been in prison in Chile, since last September on a charge of illegal possession of explosives.  When reports reached Ireland of allegations that Mr. Tricot had been mistreated in prison, the Government made representations on his behalf to the Chilean Government through the good offices of one of our European partners with an embassy in Santiago.  We were advised by the Chilean authorities that Mr. Tricot has suffered a series of epileptic attacks, for which he had previously received treatment in Ireland, resulting in a fracture of a vertebra.  He was, we were told receiving medical attention daily in line with the treatment prescribed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In January 1988 the Amnesty International report became available to us which contained allegations by Mr. Tricot that he was threatened, beaten and subjected to electric shocks and that, in consequences, he suffered an epileptic fit and a fractured vertebra.  Mr. Tricot's statement substantiates reports of his mistreatment and torture which reached Ireland after his arrest last September and on the basis of which the concern of the Government was expressed to the Chilean authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been considering making representations to the Chilean authorities to have Mr. Tricot released so that he can return to this country as a refugee.  We are prepared to allow Mr. Tricot to return to live in this country &mdash; where he previously lived for several years as a refugee &mdash; if the Chilean authorities are willing to release him.  On Friday last, 6 May 1988, the Minister for Foreign Affairs received a photocopy of a letter, dated 1 <Col N="1240" /> March 1988, from Mr. Tricot in which he says that he is prepared to travel to Ireland as a refugee if it would facilitate his early release from prison.  Further representations are now being made to the Chilean authorities with a view to securing the release of Mr. Tricot without delay.</P>
    <P>I was touched by the moving letter read by Deputy McCartan to the House indicating the difficult conditions in which Mr. Tricot finds himself.  Ireland, which has a great record in humanitarian cases, will continue to do all possible to have Mr. Tricot released as quickly as possible. In this context I should like to mention the plight of two Irishwomen who were captured while working with Concern in Ethiopia.  They are Mary Coen from Lurgan, in the parish of Mullagh, Ballinasloe, which is in my constituency, and Fiona Quinn of County Kildare.  I accept that those women are being held for a different reason and in a different environment and we hope and pray that not alone will Luis Tricot be freed but that those women will be released unharmed and allowed to return to their perturbed parents and loved ones.  I should like to assure the Deputy and the House that the Government will continue to do all they can to protect Mr. Tricot's welfare.</P>

        <i>Limerick West):</i> In relation to the request for a commemorative medal to be struck to honour the Niemba deceased it is felt that this might be construed as suggesting that the ultimate sacrifice made by the men of the Defence Forces on UN service in other arenas, such as Elizabethville, South Lebanon, was in some way less than that of the Niemba victims.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces and the State honour and will continue to honour the memory and indeed recognise the sacrifice of the men who died in the service of peace at Niemba or in any other theatre of United Nations operations.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is considered that it would not be appropriate for a commemorative medal to be struck to honour the Niemba deceased.</P>

      <P>The latest figures available are for 1987.  They are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  A total of 638 people were employed directly in 1987 in bilateral assistance provided by the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>This total is made up of 80 employed abroad in our Bilateral Aid Programme; 455 on assignment abroad with APSO (the Agency for Personal Service Overseas); 20 employed on the headquarters staff of APSO and a further 25 employed by other smaller bodies.  In addition, as noted below, some 58 consultants were employed by the Bilateral Aid Programme on an occasional basis on particular projects.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to be specific about the level of indirect employment arising from our bilateral assistance.  This arises in part through training courses here but mainly in the semi-State sector through consultancies and other projects in Third World countries in which it can be said that Irish agencies were favourably placed to become involved because of the connections and good reputation arising from our Bilateral Aid Programme.  The best available estimate is that made for 1985 by DEVCO, the State Agencies' Development Co-operation Organisation, which calculated the employment arising in this way as 1,200.</P>
      <P>(b) Approximately 70 per cent of the total of £17.29 million provided by Ireland in 1987 as bilateral assistance, was spent either on goods and services in Ireland or by way of payment to Irish personnel working with the Bilateral Aid Programme or with APSO at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>(c)  Some 58 individuals were engaged as consultants, either independently or as employees of one of the 14 consultancy companies whose services were employed under the Bilateral Aid Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  These consultants were involved in activities which related mainly to the health, education, agricultural and other advisory programmes through which the Bilateral Aid Programme provides technical expertise, training and related <Col N="1068" /> goods and services in Third World countries. The following is a list of specific projects where consultants were involved: Bethlechem University, Jordan; Blood Transfusion Service, Lesotho; Centre for Accountancy Studies, Lesotho; Chilanga Cement Company, Zambia; Community Forestry, Sudan; Dairy Development, Zimbabwe; Dairy Produce Board, Zambia; Farm Animal Monitoring, Zambia; Gezira Dairy Co-operative, Sudan; Handknitting Project, Lesotho; Hololo Valley Co-operative, Lesotho; Hololo Valley Rural Development, Lesotho; Horticulture Project, Sudan; Hotel and Catering School, Zimbabwe; Institute of Animal Production, Sudan; Institute of Public Administration, Sierra Leone; Kasama Rural Water Supply, Zambia; Khartoum Polytechnic library; Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre; Kilosa Dairy Farm, Tanzania; Kilosa District Development Programme, Tanzania; Kwe Kwe College, Zimbabwe; Lesotho Airways; Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre; Lesotho National Development Corporation; Lesotho Treasury Support; Livestock Study, Sudan; Management Training, Liberia; Management Training Course, Zambia; Medical Laboratory Technicians Programme, Lesotho; National Institute of Public Administration, Zambia; Peat Development, Burundi; Peat Development and Papyrus Research, Rwanda; Pemba Livestock Improvement, Tanzania; Pilot Project in Sanitary Disposal, Kenya; Primary Health Care, Sudan; Rapid Laboratory Test Project, Zimbabwe; Shukaba National Dairy Research Centre, Sudan; Small Industries Development Organisation, Tanzania; Sokoine University, Tanzania; Tanzanian Carpet Company; Tanzanian Posts and Telecommunications; TB Control Programme, Lesotho; Technological Education Institutes, Zambia; Telephone Network Rehabilitation, Uganda; Trade Promotion, Zambia; University of Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania; University of Zambia; Vegetable Dehydration, Swaziland; Village Water Supply Scheme, Lesotho; Village Water Supply Scheme, <Col N="1069" /> Sudan; World Bank/Institute of Public Administration, Zambia.</P>

      <P>Under the farm improvement programme grant rates of 25 per cent in less favoured areas and 20 per cent elsewhere are available for waste storage facilities (principally slurry and silage effluent).  This is higher than the rates for fixed assets generally.  In addition, a 10 per cent grant is available towards the cost of slurry tankers as part of a storage and spreading system.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers recently agreed proposals for a revised western package.  And for pollution control measures will be a key element of the new programme.  The aid will be available outside a farm plan and in all less favoured areas and not just the western region as heretofore.  A detailed programme for the revised package has been approved by the Government and an announcement will be made when it has been approved by the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>The aid under the farm improvement programme and that proposed under the western package, taken together, will provide a satisfactory framework of State support for pollution control.</P>

      <P>A production aid for flax, at present in the region of £100 per acre, is paid by the EC.  Information and advice on flax growing are available to farmers from An Force Talúntais and ACOT. Trial acreages organised in County Cork by commercial interests in 1985 and 1986 have provided additional information on the cropping, harvesting and marketing of flax.  A further trial area is being grown in East Cork by another commercial interest this year.</P>

      <P>The Government have a strong commitment to the development of the horticulture industry, including vegetables.  The Ministerial Office for Horticulture has been established within my Department with a view to realising the potential of the industry.  The aim is to improve the production and marketing of vegetables and other horticultural crops in order to increase exports and reduce imports to a combined level of some £70 million over a 5-year period and in the process create 1,500/2,000 jobs.  A new State body &mdash; An Bord Glas &mdash; has been set up, on an interim basis pending statutory establishment, to prepare and implement a development plan to achieve this aim.  The board has already set up a number of commodity teams to look at the problems facing the various sectors of the industry, including vegetables.  The reports of the teams are currently being examined by the board in the context of preparing a plan for the future development of the industry.</P>

      <P>Under the Community regulations milk quotas are based on deliveries made in 1983.  As the person referred to did not deliver milk during 1983 he does not, therefore, have any entitlement to a milk quota.  However, within the limited degree of flexibility available to me under the Community regulations, I have tried to assist farmers in this situation.  I have provided that the first priority category of farmers for the allocation of quotas in the arrangements for both the restructuring scheme, which I negotiated as part of last year's price package, and the distribution of fleximilk, are producers with no quotas or whose quotas do not exceed 25,000 gallons. Furthermore, under the clawback scheme that I set up at the end of last year, I have provided that among the categories to benefit from the reserve are young farmers with no quotas who satisfy certain educational and training qualifications.</P>

      <P>The case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the appellant was not incapable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1981 in respect of the period from 27 April 1987 to 11 January 1988 and was not entitled to be paid in respect of that period.  He appealed against the disallowance of disability benefit subsequent to the date of the appeals officer's decision and he will be examined today by a medical referee in connection with his appeal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effort and cost involved in compiling data going back over 20 years covering all the information requested by the Deputy is not warranted. However, in so far as it is published, the information is contained in the Insurance Annual Report (The Blue Book) for the relevant years and is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the supervisory authority my primary role is to monitor the financial soundness and solvency of insurance <Col N="1078" /> companies in order to protect the interests of policyholders.</P>
    <P>As regards life companies, new regulations entitled the European Communities (Life Assurance Accounts, Statements and Valuations) Regulations, were made on 18 December, 1986 and took effect from the 1986 year of account. These new regulations contain specific measures aimed at regulating the precise manner in which reserves of life offices are determined and the methods to be used in valuing assets and liabilities, and complement the solvency and reserving requirements set out in the earlier 1984 Life Assurance Regulations.  From the supervisory point of view, the new returns enable a much greater in-depth analysis to be carried out on individual undertakings.</P>
    <P>Actual fund management is a matter for each individual company.  Therefore the level of returns to policy holders will vary from one company to another and as between one policy holder and another depending on the particular type of policy held and the performance of the relevant fund.</P>
    <P>I understand that some life companies provide their policyholders, at least on an annual basis, with a statement regarding performance and the up-to-date position of their policies.  In addition policy holders can at any stage, request from companies, details of the performance of their policies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if her attention has been drawn to the urgent need for the provision of extra facilities at Scoil Uí Dhálaigh, Leixlip, County Kildare; the exact nature of these requirements as represented to her by the school authorities; the estimated cost of same; the likely time scheduled for the provision of same; if this schedule is likely to meet with the needs of the school authorities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I accept that conditions at Scoil Uí Dhálaigh, Leixlip, County Kildare are not satisfactory though the situation has been considerably improved <Col N="1088" /> by the recent provision of four prefabricated classrooms and the installation of new toilet facilities.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of a permanent extension to the school was discussed recently with the school authorities.  This extension will comprise eight standard classrooms and the proposals are acceptable to the school authorities whose architects are preparing a sketch plan and a cost plan.  When these documents have been completed the matter will be further discussed with the school authorities.</P>
      <P>Because there are a number of factors which would affect progress on the project it is not possible to say when building works might commence and this is understood by the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The cost of the project has not yet been established but in any event it is not the practice to divulge individual costings to outside parties because of the need to preserve a bond of confidentiality on the matter with school authorities.</P>
