    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides special major increases for the unemployed. However, I am concerned to ensure that the quality and dignity of the service provided to people who have to rely on social welfare is of an acceptable standard. Even in the present tough budgetary times we must ensure that the less well off do not suffer indignities when applying for or collecting social welfare payments. In this regard I call on the Minister to ensure that the work on the new employment exchange for Cork proceeds with all possible speed.  The two existing exchanges are inadequate to provide the kind of modernised, humanised and dignified approach we should be adopting in the latter years of the 20 century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the efforts being made by the Minister to improve the quality of the service in Cork.  Last January he visited Cork employment exchange to inaugurate a new computerised payment system for the unemployed in Cork.  I understand that this new development is part of the Minister's plan to make Cork a major link in his strategy to improve considerably delivery of social welfare services at local level.  The new computer system enables computerised payments dockets and pensions to be produced in Cork while the claim information is <Col N="2368" /> stored on computer in Dublin.  The two centres are linked by a telecommunications network.  This new system will provide a number of benefits which I have been seeking for social welfare claimants in Cork.  It will give better information on their claims, a faster response to changes in their circumstances and quick payment which is an essential development.  It will mean more time and attention for claimants and it will increase the options for more flexible payment and signing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The other benefit of the computerisation of unemployment payments in Cork is that it improves the Department's control of unemployment payments and helps to cut down on fraud and abuse.  About £600,000 is paid out in unemployment payments at Cork exchange each week.  Already 1,200 claims have been transferred on to computer and the remainder will be on by the middle of the year.  Plans are in hand to extend this system to Cobh in County Cork.</P>
    <P>The computerisation is central to the development of the comprehensive new service, the one-stop shop, which the Minister is introducing nationwide. Already several significant developments have taken place in this service in the Cork area following discussions I had with the Minister.  Six months ago a facility was introduced in Cork which enabled sickness certificates to be entered on computer at the Cork exchange.  This has speeded up payment of disability benefit to people in the Cork area.  Now 2,500 sickness certificates are processed in Cork each week.  Cork was the first location to have this new service and I hope it will be introduced in other locations from now on.  Decisions on unemployment assistance claims which formerly were made at headquarters here in Dublin, causing a number of delays, are now all made in Cork.  This approach, which was introduced in Cork on a pilot basis, is designated to cut down on the time taken between application and payment of unemployment assistance and is very welcome.  A scheme which allows <Col N="2369" /> unemployment assistance to be paid without a further means test to people from families whose means have already been assessed by the Department is also in operation and results in a quicker and better service.  On-the-spot means testing for unemployment assistance began in Cork in December 1987 and enables decisions to be taken on many applications without a home visit.  I welcome that very much because people were waiting for up to three or four months for this investigation to be carried out.  This procedure ensures that the time taken between claim and payment is kept to an absolute minimum.  Already the new claims being dealt with in this way in Cork city average about 30 per week.  In addition to Cork city this facility is now operating in Bandon, Dunmanway, Macroom, Mallow and Fermoy and throughout the county.  It is a very progressive development.</P>
    <P>These new developments are of major practical importance for people awaiting social welfare payments.  They reduce delays inherent in sending claims to Dublin, they eliminate red tape and bureaucracy and mean that people concerned have money in their pockets more quickly to enable them to provide basic necessities.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare rates contained in the Bill are a concrete example of our commitment to meeting the needs of people dependent on social welfare.  Fianna Fáil have a great tradition of caring for the elderly, the sick, the disadvantaged and the unemployed. I am proud to be part of that tradition and to be here today to support the Government in the major advances we are making.  The increase of 11 per cent in the lowest rate of payment shows clearly that this Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to take the action required to improve the lot of those on social welfare. While other political parties have spoken at length about the special needs of people on low payments, this Government are prepared, even in the very tough times we face at present, to make an additional £53 million available for those on long-term unemployment assistance <Col N="2370" /> and supplementary welfare.  In the course of the budget debate the Leader of the PDs said such increases were not necessary. Lest there be any misunderstanding, I refer to the Dáil debate of 11 February 1988, column 1914.  There was some reference yesterday to asking the Minister to withdraw some statement he made regrding this, but I want to quote the Official Report.  Deputy O'Malley said:</P>
    <P>. . . I have reservations about the increased payments of up to 11 per cent for the long-term unemployed.  Every Deputy and party supports improving the lot of the long-term unemployed, but is this the best way to go about it? I do not believe so.</P>
    <P>This is as clear a statement as one can get that the Progressive Democrats have no time for the less well off in our society. It reinforces the yuppie tag they received initially and which they have been trying to shake off ever since.  This Fianna Fáil Government know that these people need help now and they are giving it to them.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the budget major play was made in certain sections of the media about the need for a change in policy to make provision for welfare recipients on the lowest payments. The Government saw that group as a priority.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided that the Government would maintain the value of social welfare payments and give special increases to the lowest paid.  The Government took decisive action and introduced a major change of policy to make special payments to this group of people.  Yet the media have been silent. They should recognise these increases for what they are, a real transfer of resources to those most in need.  The additional expenditure involved is about £30 million. This is a major boost, given the present constraints on the public finances.</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party have been congratulating themselves on maintaining the value of social welfare payments during their period in Government, they made no special provisions for those on <Col N="2371" /> the lowest payments.  In no area did they give increases of over 8 per cent in real terms as a special extra bonus to people they claim are most in need of special assistance.  They simply gave increases to match inflation or slightly more.  They talked about the great steps they took by setting up the Commission on Social Welfare.  What happened after that? They seemed to recognise the need but took no action.  They talked rather than acted.  These increases, together with the special increases for children, are meaningful in money terms and will ease the burden on the more hard-pressed sections of society.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, appears to regard this Bill as very disappointing.  How did he feel when he was a member of the previous Coalition Cabinet that made no special provision for people on the lowest welfare payments.  Worse still must be his shame at the Fine Gael Government's decision to defer the social welfare increases in 1987 from July to November of that year. How can he seriously suggest that this Government are not concerned about the welfare of people on social welfare?  His lack of concern is evidenced by his lack of action on behalf of the same people about whom he now professes to be passionately concerned.  Where was that compassion when he was sitting around the Cabinet table?  What special measures did his Government take to improve the lot of the less well off in society?</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell is on his hobby horse when he talks about giving loans to people who are caught in the grip of moneylenders but is that the answer to their plight?  Even if he considers that it is the answer, let me ask him what action he took during his period as a Government Minister to do anything about tackling this problem.  It is time to face up to reality.  This Government have taken more initiatives and decisions in the past year to improve and develop the social welfare system than the previous Coalition Government did in its four years in office.  This Government care about the <Col N="2372" /> people and these increases and this Bill are clear evidence of that.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to extend social insurance to the self-employed is a major new development in social insurance.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommend the extension of social insurance to introduce greater equity into the financing of the social insurance system.  Even before the commission was established I understand the present Minister, Deputy Woods, had developed proposals for the extension of social insurance to the self-employed.  In over four years in office the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government, were unable or unwilling to make further progress on this scheme.</P>
    <P>The speed with which the scheme has progressed to the stage where we are considering legislation today indicated the type of decisive action which this Fianna Fáil Government are prepared to take.  I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues on bringing this legislation before the House.  I believe it is important that widows and old age pensions should be available as of right for people who are self-employed and who contribute towards the financing of the overall cost of social insurance.  It is a move towards treating citizens equally so that the self-employed will enjoy the same rights as employed persons who have basic pension rights without a means test.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, however, about the amount of misinformation that has been generated on this same subject.  I will refer to two items.  The first was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 19 February 1988 in which the headlines stated that this scheme would cost £800 million.  This is totally incorrect.  The economist author of the article appears to have based his assumptions on a fundamentally flawed basis with the result that his conclusions were way out of line.  I am glad the Minister has dealt at length with this aspect of the matter in his speech.  However, I would go further than the Minister and call on the person concerned to acknowledge his error and set the record straight from his professional viewpoint.  His article received widespread coverage in <Col N="2373" /> other sections of the media.  I do not have the detailed reference but it is only reasonable that an opportunity should be given to show the correct position.  Lest anyone thinks I am being unduly harsh in one particular area, it is well to bear in mind that this article got widespread coverage and conveyed an impression, highly erroneous, that this scheme will be an intolerable burden on the taxpayer in the longterm.  That is not the position. Furthermore, the assumptions in the article were used by a second economist in an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> magazine which, in effect, retraced the original heresy.</P>
    <P>These views appear to have been taken on board by Deputy Mitchell and others without any checking or cross-referencing. The original author has a moral and, dare I say it, professional duty to acknowledge his erroneous assumptions as regards the income to be collected from the new system.  If he has any doubts about the error of his ways I am sure the Minister would be only too pleased to advise him of the details.  This should be done and done urgently.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board with its acknowledged experts worked out figures based on actual calculations which showed that the particular economist has his figures wrong.  Why he did not study that report, as appears to be the situation, is strange.  I am not suggesting he has any improper motives or intention to mislead but he appears to have created a lot of uncertainty among people who have not studied the position and examined the facts.</P>
    <P>A second item of misinformation I want to refer to relates to the advertisement published by the Irish Farmers' Association in the daily media shortly after the decision was taken to extend social insurance to self-employed persons, including farmers.  That advertisement tried to create the impression that the self-employed were being unfairly discriminated against as compared to other groups.  The IFA were alleging that civil servants were paying only 0.9 per cent for the same benefits that farmers would get for a higher rate <Col N="2374" /> of contribution.  This is totally misrepresenting the situation.  Established or permanent civil servants pay 0.9 per cent for contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, deserted wife's benefit and limited occupational injury benefits.  Farmers will receive a contributory old age pension which is not payable to civil servants. The IFA, in a handbill which they are circulating calling for equal treatment and fair play for self-employed persons, including farmers, say that equity demands that all citizens should pay the same contribution for the same benefits. I believe that equity, morality and fair play also demand that the IFA should not seek to misrepresent the situation.  The IFA deliberately misrepresented the position in relation to different groups in society.  It is not true to say that the civil sevants get the same social welfare pensions as do the private sector employees or the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed arrangements social welfare insurance for farmers and the self-employed will come into operation from April 1988.  The IFA stated that they would not accept the situation where the following contribution rates would apply for pensions: civil sevants, 0.9 per cent; private sector and some of the public sector 2.4 per cent; self-employed, 3 per cent, increasing to 5 per cent over two years; for contributory old age pension and survivors pension 66 years of age.</P>
    <P>Civil servants are not covered for contributory old age pensions and, accordingly, they are not liable to contribute towards the cost of such a pension.  They do, however, pay the correct rate towards widows' and orphans' pension.  If the IFA are suggesting that everybody should pay the full rate of PRSI then that is a separate matter and I want to emphasise that.  I understand from the Minister that the question of social insurance cover for civil servants is one of the items that will be examined by the National Pensions Board.  In the meantime, it should be borne in mind that there is an occupational retirement pensions scheme for <Col N="2375" /> civil servants which provides the basic income in old age.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with the question of higher rates for self-employed persons and this seems reasonable to me.  I fail to see how any farmer or self-employed person could argue that they should be treated as an employee.  I can see the logic in the Minister's approach in not treating the self-employed as being both employer and employee.  That would mean that they would be liable for the combined contribution.  Self-employed persons are in a different category from employees.  Employers pay a contribution in respect of their employees and it is unreasonable that the self-employed should pay at the same rate as an employee.  The Government's decision to go for a higher rate for the employee but not as high as the combined employer-employee rate is a sensible and workable one.</P>
    <P>On the overall financing of social welfare, I am concerned about the burden of PRSI on the lower paid.  The Commission on Social Welfare have recommended that the upper income limit for contributions for PRSI should be abolished. The present Bill raises the upper income limit from £15,500 to £16,200.  I would like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to consider further raising this upper income limit.  For instance, how much would an upper income limit of, say, £20,000 to £25,000 raise?  PRSI is regarded as a regressive tax in that it bears more heavily on the lower paid. Some of the additional revenue raised should be used to provide an exemption for, say, the first £3,000 of income.  This would ease the burden of PRSI on the lower paid and would not result in any cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition frequently quote from documents.  In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> we made a commitment in regard to caring for basic values in social welfare in particular. Our intention is to continue improving the status, dignity and security of older people in the community.  In regard to the pre-retirement scheme the <Col N="2376" /> over 60s and the long-term unemployed will not have to sign on at employment exchanges.  This is a very positive step and is part of our commitment.  We also stated that we would examine sympathetically cases where people fail to qualify for pensions because of a change in the structures of the system between 1950 and 1970.  We are also implementing the <i>pro rata</i> pension scheme.  All the conditions in our manifesto clearly show that in this area of social welfare, which is a very sensitive area where the most vulnerable sections of the community are affected, Fianna Fáil have taken a very positive line.  We have implemented in a very short time, many of those conditions.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  He has made tremendous progress in a very short space of time.  I have worked very closely with him.  I am glad he listens to what we have to say and as a result there are very positive provisions in this Bill which will affect people throughout the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The merit or demerit of PRSI for the self-employed has for a long time been the subject of discussion.  Generally speaking, most people will accept it as a positive and progressive approach. However, we have to examine closely the reasons for its introduction, the thinking behind it and the attainments at the end of the road.  There are quite reasonable grounds for believing that perhaps on this occasion, meritorious though the principle is, the introduction may not have been for the best reasons.  Was it introduced to achieve equality or was it for monetary reasons?  Was it introduced on the basis that it could produce a certain figure within a certain space of time or was consideration given to the possible liabilities that it might place on the Exchequer in, say, ten or 15 years time. I am quite sure that the Minister, in considering this proposal, thought out all those issues fairly &mdash; I hope he did. We, on this side of the House, believe that, notwithstanding all that, there is still reasonable grounds for suspicion and for the belief that it may not well be the boon <Col N="2377" /> it is being held out to be by speakers on the opposite side of the House at present.</P>
      <P>This Bill will eliminate the situation where people who are self-employed and self-sufficient all their lives find themselves, at the end of the day, having to be assessed to ascertain whether or not they can obtain a pension.  It will eliminate the humiliation and, in many cases, hardship for people who are self-employed. Not everybody who is self-employed is a millionaire.  Many of the people whom we all deal with on a daily and a weekly basis are small business people, people with car repair businesses, confectionery shops and so on.  They are deemed as self-employed people, and they are self-employed but their income is very small.  Many of them may have leased a shop all their lives and at the end of the day they have very little.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the investigation branch of the Department of Social Welfare treat those people fairly.  However, there have been instances where the applicant has not been able to identify exactly where his or her assets have gone. There are such things as expenditure and day-to-day expenses which very often elderly people are not able to identify, and figures appear for which they cannot directly and accurately account.  The result is that they are assessed as having an income from the value of their assets. The value of their assets could be determined by property from which they cannot get an income or from an assessed amount of money for which there appears to be no account.  In many cases that has caused serious hardship.  While I accept that the investigating officers generally have been affable and amenable to representation, discussion and explanation, there have been instances where that has not been the case and the sufferers have been the applicants.  This Bill, if it works as it is intended, should eliminate that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have said, the benefits will be that the Exchequer will get a contribution from the people and in turn those contributors will have something put by for retirement as opposed to the present system whereby they have to rely <Col N="2378" /> entirely on the State.  However, there is the important factor in relation to contributions, that of contributing in line with the benefits they will receive.  There is a serious doubt as to whether the level of contribution is correctly related to the benefits they will receive under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is considerable confusion, stress and worry felt by many people about the provisions of the Bill, people who will ask themselves the very serious question whether &mdash; having regard to what should be a constructive and progressive piece of legislation which would cater for them at retirement age and, at the same time, alleviating some of the burden ordinarily placed on the State &mdash; it might well turn out to be another source of taxation? For example, could they find themselves contributing over and above the level of benefits they will receive when they reach retirement age?  I believe there is a strong possibility of that.  While I accept the principle involved, I have serious doubts about the benefit to one side or the other at the end of the day.  It could well mean that a whole bureaucratic system could become involved, resulting in the taxpayer finding himself paying more and the hopeful beneficiary finding himself in a similar position.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers on the opposite side of the House have lauded the present Administration &mdash; I will make no personal reference to the Minister present &mdash; in regard to the social welfare benefits at present available.  That is true; we are a caring society.  I admit freely that at present the Government are probably doing what they can to alleviate the burden on the unemployed and the less well off in our society.  However, it should be remembered also that approximately 37 per cent of our population is in receipt of social welfare benefit of one kind or another at present.  If one takes into account the vast number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance, then one must identify and realise the very large burden it imposes on our economy.  On the one hand, while we can pat ourselves on the back and say we are a caring society, that we look after <Col N="2379" /> our people, those who are less well off in our society, that we provide for them, their children and so on, on the other hand, it is a very sad reflection on our society that there are so many people in need of these benefits at present.  We have no reason whatever to pat ourselves on the back when we see all of the people around us, for example, all of the people who visit our clinics weekly who experience serious hardship.  I might also point out to the Minister &mdash; and here I mean no reflection on him whatsoever &mdash; that since I first entered public life I have never experienced the volume of queries week after week from people who ordinarily never had to have recourse to social welfare, good, bad or indifferent, and certainly never had to have recourse to a public representative to make their case.</P>
    <P>I had the experience within the past few days of meeting and talking with a PAYE worker/contributor practically all his life, over a period of 25 years.  Fortunately he had never been ill and had never drawn unemployment benefit or assistance.  A couple of years ago he was made redundent but he did not lie down under the burden.  He decided to invest his redundancy money in a new venture along with a partner.  Of course, he had to put up security.  It so happened that the business did not go well and is now on the point of closure.  Of course the bank hold his security.  He has now had to get out of the business.  He has a wife and three children.  He has been refused unemployment assistance on the basis of his alleged assets but the alleged assets in his case cannot be touched, they are held as security by the bank.  Therefore, when and if the business flounders the bank will move in and collect those assets.  That is a supposition on which his social welfare assessment is now based.  If the bank do move in and collect those assets.  That is a suposition on which his social welfare assessment is now based.  If the bank do not move in and collect the assets then he will get whatever remains of that security at the end of the day.  In the meantime he has been refused social welfare assistance: a contributor over a period of 25 years is not in a position to get his just payments for all his contributions. Therefore, he has had to <Col N="2380" /> resort to supplementary welfare payable by his health board when there is another assessment system that comes into play.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Minister's proposal in regard to the one-stop shops is welcome and will eliminate a great deal of duplication.  Now that this Bill is before the House I ask that the Minister would examine carefully the effect of this and other legislation in relation to assessment for pension or benefits of one kind or another where such is found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>There were a number of references to training schemes, unemployment and so on.  Here I might make a passing reference. I have always felt that in times of high unemployment it is much better to train people, to have them engaged in training of one kind or another than have them unemployed.  It is much better to have them, as it were, continue their education in some kind of a training scheme, the results of which will be of some benefit to them later rather than have them sitting on the unemployment scrap-heap with nothing to do and no purpose in life.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the cases made by a number of speakers on the opposite side of the House in regard to the Jobsearch programme and various other new-fangled investigative practices now being pursued by the Department of Social Welfare, if a little more time and effort were devoted to the work of FÁS it might have the advantage of eliminating some of the problems encountered in relation to unemployment, allowing people who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed to continue training or education, thus benefiting therefrom.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conditions and manner of payment of various social welfare benefits, could we not devise some system whereby payments could be made other than as obtains at present when people applying for unemployment benefit and assistance must queue up at local employment exchanges, many of them decrepit, unsuitable buildings, there for generations, where there is absolutely no provision for privacy, for protection against the weather and, most important <Col N="2381" /> of all, no regard to people's dignity and self-respect.  It is something to which a great deal more thought should be given. Some people now applying have found themselves in need of social welfare benefit for the first time ever.  It must be accepted that those applying for unemployment benefit, social welfare assistance or whatever do so not by choice but rather out of necessity and at least they should be able to attend at a building that affords some recognition of the need to preserve their dignity.  I will speak at greater length about that matter some other time.  Unfortunately, the tragedy of the present economic climate &mdash; and here I do not blame the Minister personally &mdash; is highlighted by the example of the individual who had been reasonably well off up to the time he or she had to apply for benefit of one kind or another.  When they did not qualify they had to apply for supplementary welfare and for the first time they found themselves in a long queue which appeared to them to be a very impersonal queue.  In many cases they could overhear the discussions which took place with other people in the queue.  They felt that their dignity, privacy, pride and whatever else they had left was being eroded by becoming involved in that process.  That did more to kill their spirit and initiative than perhaps losing their jobs had done beforehand.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to that area in the context of the legislation now before us.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to say again that not everybody who is self employed is wealthy and that the supposition that they are should be well and truly scotched.  Those who are self employed and wealthy do not have any need for pension schemes.  They are capable and able to provide for themselves in the ordinary sense whether or not a compulsory scheme is introduced.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the scheme is to glean more money in order to balance the books and to provide a satisfactory out-turn at the end of this year or at the end of next year, it is being introduced for the wrong reasons.  I also hope that it was not used as a bargaining factor in the <Col N="2382" /> preparation of the <i>Programme For National Recovery </i> or on the basis that, &ldquo;if you produce one element we will produce another.&rdquo;  I hope it is being introduced in order that equity will prevail in the social welfare system that there will be a provision whereby people outside of the PAYE sector can contribute directly to their retirement pensions and that, as a result, the present system of assessment and counter-assessment, of claim and counter-claim can be eliminated. If it is being introduced for those reasons, it is being introduced for the right reasons.  I hope that is the case.</P>
    <P>I know a self-employed person who had a very small business.  When he retired he applied for an old age pension but he found himself with the old story that allegedly he had assets.  Oddly enough, when he retired he decided to sell his home and move elsewhere and he found himself in a very awkward situation with regard to the title of the property he purchased.  He was stuck with bridging finance for something like three years. This is a very unusual situation but it did happen.  Very often people of 65 years of age or more find it very difficult to explain clearly to an investigating officer exactly what they did with every penny and pound they had.  Obviously, this man was not able to explain what he had done with his money and he was awarded a reduced pension of about £25 per week.  Representations were made on his behalf in all good faith, as was the response I might add, but it was discovered that he had been overpaid and, following a reassessment, his pension has been reduced to £10, despite the fact that he has no assets whatsoever, that the profit he got from the sale of his previous house was lost in the subsequent long transaction which took place and the hardship and trauma it caused him.  That man is now deemed to have assets of somewhere in the region of £16,000 or £17,000, which he simply has not got.  His next option is to apply for supplementary welfare benefit but I do not think it should happen that way.  There should be no necessity for all that trauma.</P>
    <P>On reaching the age of 65, one would <Col N="2383" /> hope that one would be entitled to some kind of recognition for a long life of effort and contibution to the community, society and the economy.  One would expect better treatment at that stage than the kind of treatment that is being meted out to this individual.  We hope that the passing of this legislation will eliminate once and for all that kind of nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this very important Social Welfare Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill as it provides for a number of important improvements in the social welfare system.  In his presentation of the Bill, and from my discussions with him, I know that the Minister's main concern at all times is for the weaker sections of our community.  This comes through very forcibly in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill comprises four parts and its main purpose is to provide for the increase in the rates of social welfare payments and other improvements in social welfare schemes announced by the Minister in the budget, and for the extension of social welfare to the self-employed. Provision is also made for the introduction of a pre-retirement allowance for the long-term unemployed. Expenditure on social welfare during 1988 will exceed £2.6 billion.  Other startling figures show that in excess of one million people are involved in social welfare payments.  Section IV of the <i>Programme For National Recovery</i> commits the Government to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits and also indicates that special provision for greater increases would be made, where funds would be available, to those receiving the lowest income payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abuses of the social welfare schemes have been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, since 1982, I can say that his reports have shown various frauds which have been detected within the system.  In 1985 an examination of pension files was carried out by his office and this brought to light <Col N="2384" /> a number of cases in which books of warrants had been issued for the payment of pensions at higher rates than the claimants were entitled to.  The Department, when questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, claimed that the cause of this problem was the changeover from a manual to a computerised system and that most were due to misfiling of stencils which were used to impress the claimants names and addresses on the pension books.  The overpayments detected amounted to approximately £33,000 but I wonder how much was not detected.</P>
    <P>Various efforts have been made to tackle this problem and I am satisfied that the Minister is doing this.  I am satisfied also that he has the full co-operation of the staff in his Department.  They have made a determined effort to stamp out this type of petty fraud.  This will increase the fund for genuine and deserving cases. I appeal to the Minister to further streamline the method of accountability within his Department.  I have been told that there is only one financial comptroller but I believe there should be at least six and I ask the Minister to consider this.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the possibility of regional centres dealing with claims, such as special disability claims, on a computerised basis.  In this way there would be a direct link with Dublin and a lot of overlapping would be eliminated.</P>
    <P>The appeals system is also a cause of concern and I hold that an applicant should be given the full facts relevant to his or her case in the event of a refusal, especially when a further appeal is involved.  Due to the present unemployment problem many families on benefit are allowing children over 18 years of age to continue in full-time education and, as a result, they are being deprived of benefit.  This is very widespread throughout rural Ireland.  Their only hope of allowing them to continue for a further year or two is if they qualify for some type of assistance.</P>
    <P>Changes in the family income supplement scheme under section 5 provide <Col N="2385" /> for adjustments in the scheme as a consequence of the general increase in rates. The maximum weekly family income for entitlement to the family income supplement in the case of a one child family is being increased from £104 to £108.  The increased rate for each additional child up to and including the fifth child is being raised from £22 to £23.  This will come into force on 28 July.  This is a step in the right direction.  A married man with five children, earning £150 a week, can now claim £25 a week in family income supplement, bringing his income to £175 a week.  This is a further incentive to people to work and I hope that the scheme will be published so that people who qualify will be made aware of its existence.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made under the Bill for the extension of the social insurance scheme for the self-employed.  For the first time, the self-employed would be covered by contributory old age and widows' and orphans' pensions.  Under that system they will be liable for social insurance contributions.  The self-employed and farmers have been calling for years for some form of contributory scheme and I am glad that the Government have responded in a very positive way.  Up to now the less well off in these categories have had to rely on the various social assistance schemes and that cost is met directly out of general taxation.  In 1987 this figure was estimated to be in excess of £320 million.  The direct contribution to be made by the self-employed and farmers to the cost of social welfare payments will reduce the burden on the general taxpayer, not just in the early years when income from contributions will greatly exceed the benefits being paid out but also over the long term.  I also welcome the decision to phase in the contributions over a three year period. The care and commitment of the Government was shown by starting off with 3 per cent in the first year, increased to 4 per cent in the second year and 5 per cent in the third year.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement of the Minister that a good social insurance scheme should be comprehensive and all-embracing. All must contribute and there can be <Col N="2386" /> no provision for the better off to opt out. The Bill makes special mention of the dental and optical scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to pursue and improve the facilities for dental and optical treatment for spouses and I welcome his decision to implement the scheme for dependent spouses of insured workers.  I understand that in excess of 18,000 women have submitted claims for treatment and that now 150 dentists operate the scheme, together with all opticians throughout the country. These figures indicate how important it was to extend dental treatment to dependent spouses, mainly housewives working in the home.</P>
    <P>Last year, the Government co-ordinated the work of National Manpower, AnCO and social welfare under the auspices of FÁS.  This has proved to be in the best interests of the long term unemployed; out of it developed the national Jobsearch programme which is already a tremendous success.  The figures are so impressive: 141,500 on the live register were interviewed to help them assess their strengths as prospective employees and assist them in their search for employment.  Of these, 40,400 were placed on Manpower schemes, AnCO training courses and the Jobsearch programme and approximately 5,000 found suitable employment.  When invited to avail of the Jobsearch programme, 12,700 left the live register.  The national Jobsearch programme, as a result of its success in 1987, is to be continued.  It has been of direct assistance to many thousands in their search for work.  The co-ordinating effort of it services has provided a better service for the unemployed. Many of them, having completed one or more of these courses, agree that it has given them more confidence in seeking employment.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's commitment to the voluntary social services organisation and their assistance to many of these bodies through the voluntary great scheme.  Many people caught in the poverty trap need more than just financial help.  These courses help in a practical way to resolve their financial problems. The Deaf and Handicapped Groups of <Col N="2387" /> Kerry have made a very comprehensive report to the Minister for facilities in Kerry for deaf children, in particular for educational purposes.  At the moment these children travel each week to Cork and Dublin for such facilities.  I hope the Minister will respond positively and make a commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's suggestions about the Combat Poverty Agency to examine many issues that are facing that agency.  He has asked them to come back very quickly with suggestions.  He mentioned, in particular, the question of the moneylenders who are the scourge of the weaker sections of our community.  Any steps that the Minister could take to resolve the situation would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to <i>provide pro rata</i> pensions for elderly people who did not qualify for contributory pensions because of the method of calculating entitlement.  This anomaly resulted from changes in the income limit for social insurance contributions between 1953 and 1974.  As a result of these changes, some people who became insured in 1974 did not qualify for contributory pensions because of gaps in their insurance records.  The Minister intends to rectify this problem.  Those who are affected by the anomaly will now be able to claim a pension.  The rate or pension they receive will vary depending on their contributions.  It is estimated that some 1,200 elderly people will benefit from this improvement, which will come into effect in October.  In introducing these provisions, the Government are also implementing one of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare who suggested that those affected be given old age and widow's pensions on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil election <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated that Fianna Fáil in Government would maintain the value of social welfare payments.  In the national plan agreed with the social partners last year, this commitment was reiterated.  Indeed, the plan went further and said that special efforts would be <Col N="2388" /> made to give higher increases to people on low social welfare payments.  This Government, in keeping with the great and proud Fianna Fáil tradition, have more than met that undertaking. Increases have taken into account the cost of living and it is a clear statement of our concern for these people in our community who are forced to rely on social welfare to meet their needs.  Part of the agreement prior to the budget was the need to redistribute resources to social welfare beneficiaries.  This Bill gives the first real distribution designed specifically to meet the special position of those on low payments.  I am satisfied that this Bill is in keeping with that commitment to the weaker section of our community.  I welcome the Bill and again congratulate the Minister, as it has improved the position of social welfare recipients.  I recommend it to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute, on behalf of The Workers' Party, to the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1988, a Bill designed to implement the budget proposals for the coming year.  I already had the opportunity to make some remarks to the House with regard to the very disappointing aspects in the proposals when the budget was being debated in its general form in the days and weeks after its announcement.</P>
      <P>The Bill helps us to concentrate more precisely on many glaring omissions, the failure to address social reality and inflated claims made by the Minister and the Government in regard to the perceived improvements in the welfare scheme generally.  Indeed, the Minister in his opening remarks referred to the Bill as the most comprehensive social welfare legislation since the early seventies. He should be reminded of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which must be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That was purely a consolidation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That Act must be the <Col N="2389" /> most comprehensive social welfare legislation ever enacted.  The 1988 Bill is a piecemeal document and could not be considered comprehensive or progressive. If it was comprehensive, one of its first objectives clearly would have been to contribute to a streamlining of the welfare code, a feature which has been looked for for so long by people who have attempted to cope with and to advise those coping with the welfare code.</P>
      <P>Until recently, there were 40 categories of different entitlements and 32 rates of payment.  This Bill in some respects increases the number of categories and rates of payment.  It is quite the opposite of comprehensive.  It does not address one of the most fundamental problems highlighted in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, the need to rationalise and to make the social welfare code easier.  The Minister was slightly carried away with his notions of the fundamental improvements which the Bill suggests to him.  In his budget speech, the Minister emphasised the very generous increase in the level of increased payments across the board of 3 per cent and as high as 11 per cent in respect of the long-term unemployed and other like recipients.</P>
      <P>The whole approach of percentage increases is fine if one accepts that the base figure increased by the percentage is itself a fair and just payment.  The report of the Commission on Social Welfare clearly indicates that, even with the 11 per cent increase, we are only two-thirds of the way to the level recommended as a fundamental base in August 1986 when the report was published.  We are far out of line with the recommendations of the commission after very comprehensive investigation by them.  It must be understood that a small percentage of an inadequate payment remains inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that the unemployed and disadvantaged want is work.  I know this point is not relevant to the Bill but it must be mentioned in any debate on payments to the unemployed.  The economy needs people to be employed <Col N="2390" /> because social welfare payments are the biggest single annual drain on our resources.  We pay more in servicing that bill than in servicing the horrible national debt about which we so often talk.  The only way we will ever decrease that level of payment is by creating jobs and paying people to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister contends that the Government are committed to maintaining the overall value of social welfare benefits.  In the context of the 11 per cent increase and the generous overall 3 per cent increase, one must compare them to what happens in other areas relating to prices.  The Government give with one hand but they readily and quickly take it back with the other.  They propose rent increases for local authority tenants, they have increased the cost of ESB bills by the imposition of VAT.  They have allowed increases in bus and other public transport fares and they have not stemmed the rising cost of food and other items of household needs.  Inflation continues to rise although we are told that the rate of increase compensates for this. The increases to social welfare recipients are miniscule compared to the increases they must carry in charges right across the board, including charges to hospitals and all the services at local level.  The Government cannot maintain they are sustaining the overall value of social welfare benefits which are falling behind in real terms.  That cannot go unchallenged in this debate because it is another vaunted claim by the Minister in regard to his proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Bill as comprehensive legislation but I am immediately struck by the division that exists between urban and rural rates of payment.  There is a glaring anomaly in the Minister's constituency, which I have the duty and honour to share with him. There are streets within half a mile of where the Minister lives where people on one side are entitled to &mdash; and get &mdash; the urban rate and people at the other end who get the rural rate.  I wrote to the Minister recently instancing a case of a man who moved to a house no more than a few hundred yards from where he had <Col N="2391" /> lived previously.  Because of that, his entitlements under the social welfare code dropped by £12.  The only change in the circumstances of that individual was that he moved to a house a short distance up the road.  It is admitted that this disparity existed in areas divided for administration purposes between Dublin City Council and Dublin County Council but since 1985 all that area has been administered by Dublin Corporation.  More particularly, all of it has been urban-based and consists of urban land.  Those who reside there live under the same conditions as people in provincial towns.</P>
    <P>I wonder why a rural rate applies to any person who lives in Dublin city or county.  It is ridiculous that it should be so in this day and age when those who live on the periphery of the greater Dublin area must pay more to survive. They pay the same local authority rents but they are obliged to spend a lot more on bus fare to avail of the services in hospitals and other State agencies which are based in the city centre.  However, because of an anomaly in the social welfare system, they are paid under the rural rates scheme.  People living in the Minister's constituency are affected by that anomaly.</P>
    <P>When dealing with a piece of legislation which has been described by the Minister as the most comprehensive Social Welfare Bill since the early seventies the Minister should correct that anomaly rather than sending me a letter to the effect that he was investigating my complaint.  He has an opportunity to deal with the problems I have highlighted.  I have no doubt that those who suffer as a result of the anomaly would greatly appreciate a change in the system.</P>
    <P>Another matter in need of urgent attention and which should be dealt with in a comprehensive piece of social welfare legislation is the inexplicable discrimination against widowers.  They are paid at a rate below single mothers and widows.  I cannot understand why that anomaly is allowed to continue.  The origin of the idea, based on anachronistic notions, was that a man while he lives <Col N="2392" /> alone through the misfortune of the demise of his wife nonetheless had a better chance to provide an income.  The Minister should address that problem.  I have no doubt that he, and many Deputies on the Government side, have encountered the phenomenon of widowers who are discriminated against simply because they are male.  I do not know why it is taking so long to rectify that wrong.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable to read again that single mothers will be involved in the next stage of the great charade and the hyperbolic claims of the Department that they will tackle fraud.  Such people have been singled out by the Department for special attention in their efforts to halt fraud.  One of the problems in regard to this is that there is a perception about that single parents because they cohabit or share a dwelling with another adult are being maintained or in some way assisted by the cohabitee.  That is not always the case, if at all, but little consideration is given to it by Department investigators when considering the entitlements of such people to benefit.  I reject the suggestion that such people should be singled out for special attention by investigators. I do not believe they are any more at fault, if we are talking about fault, than any other group in society.  I reject the notion circulated by very conservative and Right-wing commentators &mdash; thankfully, it is a view that departed from this Chamber when the likes of Deputy Glenn was not re-elected &mdash; that single mothers purposely get pregnant as a means of getting a maintenance allowance. I must point out to the Minister that if he and his officals insist on cutting back on the allowances paid to single parents the ones to suffer will be the children.</P>
    <P>The increase in the allowances for children are insufficient.  We have been told that the Minister proposes to streamline benefits.  The word &ldquo;streamline&rdquo; is a buzz word used in connection with what has been described as comprehensive legislation which ignores more than it addresses.  It is important that we should consider in detail the Minister's efforts to <Col N="2393" /> tackle what has been described as fraud in the social welfare system.  In the Dublin North-East constituency which the Minister and I represent it appears there is a concerted attack on young people who are drawing social welfare unemployment benefit or assistance.  It is clear that a decision has been taken at Ministerial or Government level not to tolerate or accommodate young people drawing social welfare assistance.  That is the only conclusion I can come to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the only conclusion I can come to when I hear people at my clinics say that for no apparent reason, and in the face of incontrovertible evidence, decisions are being made by Department of Social Welfare investigators not to pay young people assistance. They appeal to the appeals officers and leave happy in the knowledge that they have put their case on the table but some days or weeks later they are advised that their appeal has been refused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remember that a person who has an appeal rejected is no longer entitled to social welfare assistance from the Eastern Health Board.  In other words, they are cut off from that benefit and there is no point in them going to the health board or the Department for help.  Many parents have told me that they must put their children who are not contributing to the family income out on the road because they cannot cater for them on the paltry sums they receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The form of notification issued under section 138 of the Consolidated Act to a young constituent on 26 February states that the applicant is not genuinely seeking and unable to obtain suitable employment.  The Minister might look at the provisions of section 138, particularly the wording of paragraph (1) (b) which <Col N="2394" /> lays down the conditions which a claimant must satisfy.  It is provided that he must be capable of work, available for work and genuinely seeking it but unable to obtain employment suitable for his age, sex, etc.  For some odd reason the conjunctive word &ldquo;but&rdquo; has been converted to &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  Therefore the declaration from the Department of Social Welfare is to the effect that the applicant is not genuinely seeking employment and is unable to obtain it.  It suggests that the failure of the applicant to get a job is due to some fault of his or hers.  This is insulting in its present form.  The Minister should look at the wording of the Act and at least carry out a cosmetic exercise in the interest of being a bit more diplomatic. These rubber stamped documents are sent out to people telling them they are no longer entitled to social welfare, without any grounds being given.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Social Welfare has left the Chamber.  I want to tell the House what he told one of his constituents last Saturday at his Baldoyle clinic.  A gentleman went to him along with two others to explain the difficulty he was having as a labouring man in finding work in the Dublin area.  He had brought in notes and cards of refusal from employers in his locality.  He told the Minister that he could not find labouring work in Dublin although he had been a labouring man all his life.  He produced the evidence which he had brought to the Department of Social Welfare but he had been unable to get assistance because, he was told, he was not entitled.  The Minister's reply was that there was plenty of work for labourers in England.  That exemplifies the attitude of this Government when they talk about the care of the unemployed and those who must live on social welfare because they are in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not just an attitude of the Minister for Social Welfare. This position was first declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, and represents an endorsement by the Government of emigration as a <Col N="2396" /> solution to work problems.  It is now becoming a reality to young people in my constituency.  A young man came to me the other day with an envelope so large that he could not carry it in his pocket. It contained cards from people stating he had called looking for work but that none was available.  The man was refused assistance and when he appealed he was also turned down.  In the face of overwhelming evidence produced by claimants to the Department of Social Welfare, there is a clear policy which can only come from ministerial or Government level to deny people as far as possible their proper entitlements and to remind them that the boat and the plane are there to enable them to go elsewhere for work.  That pattern exists and must be forcefully challenged.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this uncaring double dealing is the decision repeated in the Bill not to introduce increases, small and inadequate through they are, until 29 July.  During the last election campaign I attended a meeting in my constituency on 9 February at which Dr. Woods gave an unequivocal guarantee to the Darndale Unemployment Action Group that as Minister for Social Welfare he would redress what he described as the very unfair system of delaying until later in the year the introduction of increases announced in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>He has redressed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>He promised to introduce them in April but the increases this year are being delayed almost until August.  It is typical of the pettyminded approach which has to be seen for what it is.  The allowance for children's footwear was introduced by the Minister in mid-September, two weeks after the schools had opened and long after parents had already bought shoes for the new school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points I want to raise very quickly in regard to fraud is that for every person accused of defrauding the system there are at least ten who are not getting their full entitlement.  I agree that people who are receiving payments to which they <Col N="2397" /> are not entitled should be confronted but if the Minister is going to police the system he should also promote it and inform people fully of their entitlements. He should see to it that those who are being underpaid receive their just pay.</P>
    <P>There is one small curious provision in the Bill which I ask the Minister to look at and that is the intention to deny the courts the opportunity to impose the Probation of Offenders Act on persons found in default.  That Act may not be imposed until they have paid back the full amount of money.  That is unrealistic and what will happen is that proceedings will be protracted and carried on for an inordinate length of time.  It will also mean that lawyers will be paid more through the legal aid system to defend them. What could happen is that a justice may say that he will not impose the Probation Act but that he will impose a nominal fine of £5 in order to get a case off the list. The Probation of Offenders Act often provided a useful means for the courts to allow the pre-existing arrangement between the Department and the defendant to repay the money.  Many times I have seen repayments start six months before a case is actually brought.  That is a small point which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to refer to what the present Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, said so succinctly in a speech in this House on 29 January 1986 on the Budget Statement. He said that any Government who ignore the plight of the growing number of the unemployed, the sick and those dependent on our economy, can expect an angry response not just from those social welfare dependants but from all of society.  Those words are a timely reminder to any Minister for Social Welfare and any Government that they must take seriously the plight of the unemployed. People will become angry and are becoming angry and I hope the Minister will respond to some of the points which have been made in this House.</P>

      <P>Politics are debased by the sort of performance we have just witnessed. I find it difficult to understand <Col N="2399" /> how a man who claws £105,000 a year out of the system as well as a Deputy's salary can lecture and hector us on poverty. What does this yacht-owning, silk-tie wearing gent know about poverty? Political promises are becoming a debased currency but no more debased than are the promises which come from The Workers' Party.  That party promise everything in the safe and secure knowledge that they will never have to deliver on anything.  In addition to the untruth he peddled about the Minister, Deputy McCartan stood here for a half an hour and misrepresented and sought to rubbish this progressive legislation which, if he had an ounce of sincerity in his body, he would have found some reason to welcome.</P>
      <P>The protestations of concern for the poor from Deputy McCartan have all the sincerity of a kiss from a lady of the night. He comes from a discredited party.  He is a mountebank and a carpetbagger of the worst order to come into this House and peddle that sort of nonsense.  Let me pick up one of his misrepresentations of fact.  In connection with the problems of families dependent on social welfare he referred to hospital charges, rent increases, service charges and a variety of other issues.  As Deputy McCartan knows and as we all know, rents can be and are abated by the local authorities taking into account the income of the family concerned.  If unfortunate families depending on social welfare in Deputy McCartan's constituency were foolish enough to seek his advice &mdash; I am not appraised of this fact &mdash; then Deputy McCartan is not well representing their interests.  As we all know those who hold medical cards are relieved of hospital charges and all local authorities operate a waiver system.  I am aware that Deputy McCartan knows this and that he is energetic in pursuing it.  So I am at a loss as to why he should try to misrepresent the facts as being otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  To my mind it is very progressive legislation.  It does not bring us to the end of the road with regard <Col N="2400" /> to all that can and should, and undoubtedly will, be done under the guidance of this Minister.  The Bill contains many items for which to commend it and I will deal with a number of points, nine in all, in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first point I wish to make is in relation to the general increase of 3 per cent in widows' and old age pensions, unemployment and disability benefits and in all other weekly payments.  This increase has been downgraded and dimissed but as the rate of inflation is expected to be below 3 per cent it is a very welcome increase.  It is also welcome that it will be paid in July rather than in November as was the case.  As I have said on a previous occasion in this House, we would all wish that we could pay it earlier in the year and I have no doubt that the Minister is working in that direction.</P>
    <P>The second proposal I would particularly like to deal with relates to the special arrangements for the low paid. To my mind this is a progressive and very welcome step forward.  This is the first time that the position of people on those low levels of payment has been directly tackled by any Government.  The payment of an additional 11 per cent recognises the special needs which exist among those who find themselves at the bottom of the ladder.  I accept, and other Deputies should acknowledge, that this welcome improvement does not come cheap. It will cost the State and the taxpayer, who ultimately will pick up the tab, £31 million and no one will find fault with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also referred to the streamlining of the child dependant rates with extra payments at the lowest levels. He dealt with this matter in a rather disparaging way.  As the Minister said earlier there are 36 different rates of increase for child dependants.  That is ludicrous and impossible to understand. I imagine it is virtually impossible to administer.  The commitment of the Government to streamline this area is welcome particularly as it will mean that those who are at the bottom of the list will make some, albeit marginal, gains. As I have already said, the Government <Col N="2401" /> this year, like last year, will pay the increases earlier than was the case with the previous regime.  The increases this year are to be paid from July rather than from November and that, despite the griping comments of Deputy McCartan, is an improvement.</P>
    <P>The Bill also extensively deals with the question of PRSI for the self-employed. Part III of the Bill is devoted to this issue. The extension of insurance to the self-employed is something which must be welcomed because it is an important administrative and progressive change in the social welfare system.  Arguments against PRSI for the self-employed which have been circulated are a combination of bluster and actuarial nonsense.  I speak in particular of the contribution of Deputy Jim Mitchell.  At present 70 per cent of those who were formerly self-employed qualify for some form of social assistance pension.  There are payments to which these people have not directly contributed.  This is clearly unjust to the general body of taxpayers who contributed £331 million to these payments last year.  The scheme introduced will bring equity into the social insurance scheme and surely that should be welcomed by anyone who is fair-minded.  It will mean that for the first time the self-employed will be contributing to their pensions.  It will also create pension rights, and that must be welcomed.  The concept that has been canvassed, that we should allow some people to opt out of the system is not acceptable.  The pensions system should be as wide and as uniform as possible.</P>
    <P>Arguments have been made that this will operate as a drain on the Exchequer and on the general taxpayer.  As the Minister has already outlined, the new scheme of social insurance for the self-employed will at the very least meet costs if we take it over a 50-year span.  The additional cost of the scheme introduced here will be £6 million by year five.  That will gradually increase to £21 million in year ten and the actuarial tables will show it will extend to £89 million in year 50.  Income from the scheme will be £50 million in each of the initial years.  In the first decade there will <Col N="2402" /> be an accumulated surplus well in excess of £360 million.  These are the actuarial facts.  It is difficult, therefore, to understand the basis in logic of some of the arguments put forward by Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes important provisions regarding fraud and abuse.  Notwithstanding what Deputy McCartan said, if there was some way in which we could look into his soul and find out what he would like in justice for the taxpayer and for the poor I am sure we would find that he would welcome all the provisions that were introduced here with regard to fraud and abuse.  Sections 19 to 22 contain a whole series of important measures in relation to prosecution proceedings, fines and jail terms for those who transgress. These provisions have much to commend them and they should be welcomed.  A criminal is a criminal no matter what class he comes from, whether he is an employer who fraudulently encourages a worker to abuse the system or whether he is a person who lives off the backs of others in the black economy.  We are far too ambivalent about this area.  We all accept the lads pulling a stroke, dragging in the few shillings on social welfare.  The harm in that is that those who are entitled to the benefits are denied the full amount because the generosity and the willingness of the taxpayer to share income with the poor is being abused by people who defraud the system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and the officers of his Department on their actions in the past 12 months.  There has been a lot of hollow rhetoric about fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. There have been important improvements here.  While it is undoubtedly true that there can be improvements, it is equally true that fraud, abuse and theft from the social welfare system has reached such proportions that they must be addressed.  Later I will deal with some issues where the Department could behave more sensibly towards individuals.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to the harshness of the Department in the case of cohabiting adults.  I cannot understand <Col N="2403" /> his logic that suggests that a couple cohabiting out of wedlock should be treated more favourably than the married tax paying couple.  I am sure taxpayers cannot understand that logic.  Perhaps this was a flight of oratorical excess from Deputy McCartan but that certainly was the import of what he said.  It is extraordinary to suggest that a cohabiting couple should be subject to less rigorous scrutiny than a married couple paying tax.  I am certain that the million or so social welfare dependants and their families and the tax paying public cannot understand the logic of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will address it to the Minister at that stage. Another welcome administrative change is the decision that the ludicrous contribution from the local authorities to the cost of unemployment assistance is to be removed.  This contribution has existed for 50 years.  It amounts to something of the order of £500,000 a year and it probably costs more to do the book-keeping exercise for the transfer of these funds than the transfer actually brings in.  This change is welcome.  At this stage we need to tease out all the areas of legislation and administration to look for anomalies such as this.  I congratulate both Ministers on removing other circulatory transfers. <Col N="2404" /> The more of this we have the better for everybody.</P>
      <P>Moving to a more substantive issue, I will refer briefly to the pre-retirement scheme introduced in the Bill.  This is a very worthwhile proposal which I am sure is agreed by all Deputies in the House. Elderly long-term unemployed age 60 plus find it undignified to have to continue to follow the unemployment assistance procedure.  This provision introduces a degree of dignity for elderly unemployed. It provides a flexible approach and recognises the reality that many of the elderly on long-term unemployment assistance are semi-retired.  This provision is long overdue and should be welcomed.  There is an additional benefit to the people concerned and that is that they will no longer be forced to undertake the sort of travelling Deputy McCartan was speaking about.  That is something to which I will refer later.  It means that a very real benefit will accrue to these people because they will not have to travel to sign on, collect dole etc.</P>
      <P>Another substantive proposal in this Bill is the introduction of <i>pro rata</i> pensions and the ending by the Minister of the social welfare anomaly which has been criticised so many times in every Deputy's clinic and on several occasions in the reports of the Ombudsman.  I am sure every Deputy has cases of people coming and pointing out that because they were promoted they slipped out of social insurance cover at some stage between 1953 and 1974.  This is a very real injustice.  Only last week I was speaking to a pensioner affected by this anomaly.  The point he was making to me was that it was not the economic loss that affected him most deeply but the real sense of injustice he felt because of the anomaly.  The Minister is to be congratulated. He is fulfilling yet another pre-election promise and this in spite of the hard times we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other improvements, in particular the improvement in the family income supplement.  This is welcome.  It brings the new rates into line with the general social welfare increases.  The FIS scheme requires to be reviewed. <Col N="2405" /> Undoubtedly it contains small chinks that could be corrected and evened out.</P>
    <P>One area which is being dealt with by a number of Deputies and which does not arise in the context of the Bill is administrative reform in social welfare. In 1980, if my memory serves me correctly, the present Minister was in office in Social Welfare and took an important step in his Department by introducing anti-anonymity measures by requiring officials to adopt the simple practice of wearing name badges.  The Department have slipped back in that regard.  Deputy Boland while Minister for the Public Service tried to introduce similar requirements. Sad to say, now when you ring the Department again you are told you were talking to &ldquo;disability 9,&rdquo;&ldquo;disability benefits 7&rdquo; or whatever.  Improvement in creating a human face for the Department should be pursued.  It is important that officials who deal with the social welfare system, who we all accept have a trying, sometimes difficult and even dangerous job to do, recognise they are not simply dealing with numbers or files. Clients, the customers of the social welfare system, should themselves feel they are not dealing with cyphers, anonymous people from the back of the Department. An effort should be made in the Department to create a greater sense of client-public servant relationship.</P>
    <P>Another area which urgently requires redress and was dealt with by Deputy Wallace to some extent today, is the degree of centralisation in the Department of Social Welfare.  It is ludicrous that virtually everything in social welfare still emanates from Dublin.  I know the Minister is making efforts in this regard; nonetheless I am impatient for a greater degree of decentralisation.  I would like to see every social welfare office make decisions on 80 to 90 per cent of the cases coming in to them from their catchment area.  That would be a welcome administrative change because it would obviate a great deal of the clientelism associated with social welfare.</P>
    <P>More important, the social welfare system would be administered more economically if the decision officers were <Col N="2406" /> closer to those people about whom they were making a decision.  Fewer errors would occur in the system; therefore the cost of correcting errors would be lower and less of the administrators' time would be taken up with answering public representatives and correcting errors.  The most important improvement of all that would flow from a higher degree of decentralisation in the social welfare system would be that the people who are dealing with the Department would feel they could contact and have direct access to the people who make the decisions concerning their lives in the first place.</P>
    <P>Another area under this general administrative heading is the delivery of services.  Efforts have been made to make improvements at the physical point of delivery of social welfare; nonetheless a great deal still requires to be done here. For example, in Bray the social welfare exchange is housed in a new building but people still have to queue in the open. That is undignified, uncomfortable and unnecessary.  It should not be beyond human capacity to establish some queueing system that would treat people with more dignity and afford them a greater degree of comfort than is the case at the moment.  The Minister initiated visits some time back to exchanges.  The Taoiseach when he was Minister was probably the person who first initiated this practice. We should look at how we deliver these systems and even at basic things like the physical structures being used. Many exchanges are still housed in buildings which are totally unsuitable.  I realise there will be a cost implication in making improvements here.  At the same time for people who suffer poverty and loss of employment and are dependent on the social welfare system, the minimum we should try to ensure is that they are treated with dignity in all their dealings.</P>
    <P>While the Department have made considerable improvements on the information side, other aspects of their communications with their customers leave a great deal to be desired.  Recently I communicated with the Minister's office on the standard form which is now sent out to people who are being denied, for <Col N="2407" /> example, unemployment assistance. Form UB 27A, if my memory serves me rightly, came to my attention recently. It is a particularly undesirable form, a mimeographed sheet of paper not particularly well printed and in the empty spaces where the judgment is delivered there are various rubber stamps.  Probably the only thing on which I agree with Deputy MacCartan is that it is very difficult to understand what the form is saying.  More to the point, you would have to have access to the full social welfare code and a variety of legislation before you could interpret what the officials are trying to communicate to the unfortunate recipients of this form. There must be a better way of doing it.  In a world where modern technology provides us with things like word processors, surely it should be possible for the Department of Social Welfare to communicate on a more individualistic, more specific basis, in far simpler language, with their clients than is the case.</P>
    <P>Finally under this heading, people still have to travel long distances to sign on. People unemployed in Greystones, for example, travel to Bray.  People from Kilcoole travel to Greystones.  People from Newcastle travel to either Kilcoole or Newtownmountkennedy.  That is extraordinary because you have to spend a considerable portion of your allowance or benefit on travel for the purposes of meeting with the Department's requirements. This strikes me as being a cast back to the poor law mentality and really has not much place in 20th century thinking. I do not understand why it is necessary, for example, for an unemployed person in Newcastle to walk three miles to Newtownmountkennedy to sign on and then walk three miles back along an open road, sometimes in very inclement weather.  I do not understand why we cannot have a system whereby people can sign on in their own area.  I would ask the Minister to look at this.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this legislation is progressive. I am at a loss to understand why it is necessary for Members of this House to continuously say that everything that <Col N="2408" /> is done by the Government is rubbish. Perhaps if I were here a few years longer I would be as guilty of that as others but a little forebearance and more self discipline is called for.  There are progressive measures being introduced in this legislation, and rather than dismiss them we should take it upon ourselves to see where we can identify further improvements and better communicate the improvements that will be agreed when the House passes this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the last sentiment expressed by Deputy Roche in regard to the amount of rubbish spoken about social welfare legislation.  It is a pity the Deputy was not a member of the last Dáil but the record shows that when I was Minister for Social Welfare there was a lot of rubbish spoken and much filibustering on every piece of social legislation that was brought into the House, particularly in regard to the legislation setting up the Combat Poverty Agency when the Deputy's colleagues in Fianna Fáil spoke nothing but rubbish and held up that Bill for well over 12 months in this House for no apparent reason.  If the Deputy, having read the report, feels that what I am saying is wrong, he is welcome to come back and tell me.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to speak any rubbish on this measure.  It is a pity that such major social welfare legislation is being put into what has become a routine Bill, the annual measure to give legislative effect to the budget improvements.  It would have been preferable to have a separate Bill dealing with the extension of social welfare to the self-employed.  I know that eventually it will probably be consolidated into the main Act.  Nevertheless people wishing, in a few years time, to refer to the legislation extending social welfare to the self-employed will be puzzled because there is no Bill with such a title.  Because this is a whole new area it justifies a Bill of its own, independent of what I have described as the routine annual social welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could say a lot about the inadequacies of certain increases under the budget. <Col N="2409" /> That has been mentioned.  I want to use my time to refer specifically to a number of areas.  Before I do that I want to highlight once again the creeping restriction on social welfare entitlements.  A number of ministerial orders were made and a number of measures taken in the past 12 months, all of which have the effect of taking from people what they were previously entitled to.  I refer particularly to the new requirements of increased contributions and credits now for many benefits. The impression given is that these measures were necessary to combat fraud.</P>
    <P>All of these measures have only one purpose and that is to take from people what they are rightly entitled to and prevent people claiming what they were rightly entitled to.  Someone who is unfortunate enough to get a serious illness is now told that benefit cannot continue beyond 52 weeks unless they have the required number of contributions, that is, five years paid contributions.  It is now virtually impossible for a young worker who falls into that category to have that requirement and this results in severe hardship on the person and on his family. This is a form of legalised fraud whereby the State changes the rules to prevent people who are otherwise entitled to benefit from getting it.  It is particularly despicable when it is aimed at people with prolonged serious illneses.</P>
    <P>I hope that some amendment will be made to those provisions, particularly with regard to younger workers, because now more than ever, the chances of young workers getting five years paid contributions under the social welfare system before the age of 30 are becoming more and more remote.  Therefore their insurance cover is a kind of fraud, because the whole idea of insurance is to ensure against certain calamities, one of them being a breakdown in health.  It is amazing that temporary breakdowns or minor health ailments are covered because a person is covered for 52 weeks, but the more serious ailments, the ones that take over 52 weeks to cure or which are incurable are the ones that are directly hit and the benefit is withdrawn. <Col N="2410" /> I feel very strongly about this because there are people confined to wheelchairs or who are in very bad situations and who will find themselves cut off from benefit in a few months time simply because they were not fortunate enough to have five years fully paid up stamps before the tragedy hit them.  I appeal for some recognition of this fact so that insured workers, even under a certain age, say, the age of 30, could still avail of the continuous benefit for a period in excess of the 52 weeks because the chances of having more than five years paid contributions over the age of 30 are greater than for people under 30.  There are very strict rules and regulations regarding the qualification for these benefits, in particular the degree of incapacity has to be clearly established.  It is very critically examined and there is no question of somebody getting benefit by pretending he is sick, ill or injured.</P>
    <P>Another area in which this Government have acted despicably is the area of cutbacks on the entitlements of widows and deserted wives.  I do not know why these areas have been picked on by the Government.  I refer to the withdrawal of the overlapping benefits arrangement. Here again there is a category of people &mdash; widows &mdash; who are in a very vulnerable position &mdash; I cannot think of many categories who are in a more vulnerable position. This Government have undertaken a very dastardly act in denying these people the very modest arrangement that obtained down the years whereby if they had their own insurance record they could claim partial disability or partial unemployment benefit and at the same time their entitlement to the widow's contributory pension would not be affected.</P>
    <P>Many widows have struggled to go out to work in order to gain this entitlement. Because they are not &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; enough to have been on disability benefit before 31 December 1987 they will get approximately £20 a week less than widows who were in receipt of the benefit before that date.  How can you explain to a woman who has become a widow since 1 January this year that, even though she has worked all her life, paid her social welfare <Col N="2411" /> contributions, contributed handsomely to the State and is now in a state of health where she has to claim disability benefit &mdash; her husband would have worked all his life and paid into the social welfare fund, taxes and so on &mdash; just because her husband died since 1 January this year she will be approximately £20 a week worse off?  It could be unconstitutional to deny people this benefit, they having contributed on the basis that they were going to get it.  If the Government had decided that this would be the position for all new entrants to the social welfare system from 1 January it would be bad enough but to introduce the measure in this retrospective manner will bring nothing but hardship and suffering on this section of the community who are already carrying a severe burden and sorrow, having lost their husbands through death. It is a despicable act.  These widows have earned that money.  The partial receipt of benefit was a reasonable and fair arrangement.  It recognised these people's contributions to the system.  It was very mean of the Government to cut back in this area.</P>
    <P>Many wives whose husbands are a few years older than they and in receipt of the old age pension get the benefits of free units of electricity and free television licence and avail of free travel with their husbands.  When their husbands die, if they have not reached 66 years of age, those benefits are withdrawn.  I recognise that is a problem and I know that area has been looked at to try to maintain these benefits.  It is cruel to withdraw the benefits when these people have been receiving them for some years but I admit it is not easy to devise a system to overcome that problem.  To introduce this other mean attack on widows is beyond my comprehension and it cannot be defended on the basis of fair play, of saying they have an advantage over other widows.  They have contributed to that scheme and they are entitled to some recognition of those contributions.</P>
    <P>Whatever good this Government might do &mdash; I still have to see signs of the good they are doing in the area of social <Col N="2412" /> welfare &mdash; the measures which hit at minority groups, groups who are not in a strong position, such as the seriously ill, the long-term ill, widows and deserted wives, measures which make their position even more disadvantaged in relation to social welfare entitlements have to be highlighted.  This area has not received the kind of attention in this House that it should have.  I hope that more Members, particularly on the Government benches, will put pressure on the Government to withdraw these very mean and despicable measures, which are not contained in this Bill.  This Bill is a public relations exercise. These measures have been slipped in very quietly in other ways and they are affecting the unfortunate widows and the long-term sick people, people who are not in a position to shout loudly about them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the whole area of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  In this area there is a crazy practice where recipients of these benefits are sent around like fools to various employers looking for letters to the effect that the employer concerned has no work available for them.  The position has got so bad in the last few months that some factories I know of have put notices on their doors that they are not issuing letters to these people.  I know one factory where the management claimed they would have to have a full-time clerk typist typing letters to the local exchange down the road telling them that there is no work available.  I cannot think of a more crazy system.  The Government are providing all kinds of inducements to do away with jobs.  I am thinking of the redundancy packages particularly as they pertain to rural areas where a manual worker's main hope of getting a job rested with his local authority, working on roadworks, drainage, building of local authority dwellings and so on.  That was the main source of manual workers' employment in rural areas.  The Government have effectively done away with all of those jobs.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I might add that people in rural areas are being cut off from benefit and <Col N="2413" /> the dole.  The common practice appears to be that they receive a letter out of the blue informing them that as they are not seeking employment their assistance will cease this week.  I have knowledge of a man with nine or ten young children who around 9 or 10 December last received a letter without any warning informing him that his unemployment assistance was to be discontinued because he was not seeking employment, and that in a rural area where everybody knows there is absolutely no employment to be found.  As will be appreciated, that family had a miserable Christmas.  If that type of practice is to be carried on, then the Department should at least wait until after Christmas.  There is this kind of harassment of people in this respect.  I have heard of another case of a woman, a health board worker, who availed of the Government's redundancy package and when she claimed unemployment benefit she found she was disqualified on the basis that she was not seeking work or had voluntarily left her employment.  She won her case on appeal.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand the logic of this type of practice, of people having to appear before appeals officers producing anything up to 20 letters from all kinds of people, shopkeepers, farmers, whoever; they have to tramp the roads appealing for these letters.  I should be very glad if the Minister would offer some explanation of this practice.  After all, we have a very efficient, widespread Manpower service which monitors closely any job opportunities or any prospect of employment in given areas.  That being the State way of doing things, surely that should be sufficient in this day and age to satisfy that State requirement?</P>
    <P>I know that employers are now refusing to issue such letters because they cannot see the sense in doing so.  I do not know where all of these letters are filed in the Department.  There is one particular source of employment in my constituency which must be issuing, on average, 100 letters a week on this basis.  One letter from one factory should be sufficient, saying: &ldquo;We have no jobs, there is no prospect whatever of employment here <Col N="2414" /> in the next 12 months.&rdquo;  Why should every Tom, Dick and Harry who sign at the local labour exchange have to beat a path to that factory seeking a letter to the effect that there is no work available there?</P>
    <P>I see the need for the pre-retirement scheme and the need to extend its provisions to an age below that at present mentioned.  There is now, unfortunately, a new form of unemployment thanks to this Government's policy of creating so much unemployment in rural areas through the withdrawal of funding from local authorities.  Many people who lost their jobs in this area at an age much lower than 60 will find it extremely difficult ever to get employment again.  That is a most unfortunate plight for such people.  This scheme should be kept under review.  Possibly the age should be lowered next year because unemployment benefit and assistance were never regarded as permanent payments by the beneficiaries or applicants. However, the way things are going many people may find themselves permanently dependent on them.  This is tied in with the argument Deputy Roche advanced earlier about people having to travel long distances to employment exchanges to sign on.  Indeed, some constituents of mine in County Carlow must pass one local exchange in their village to travel to Deputy Roche's constituency in Baltinglass to sign there.  It is very difficult to explain to such people why they must cross county boundaries into the town of Baltinglass to sign on there.</P>
    <P>I refer to another point raised by Deputy Roche, that of the ambivalence of people with regard to social welfare fraud.  Even within the terms of this Bill there is a certain ambivalence to be detected about social welfare fraud.  The provisions of section 9 allow for an amnesty to defaulting employers whereas there is none allowed in the case of employees.  I find it difficult to understand why that should be so.  I would be very much in favour of mercy and forgiveness in cases of real hardship where it is obvious that because of a set of unfortunate circumstances PRSI contributions were <Col N="2415" /> not paid up.  However, we all know of cases of blatant disregard for the law, for the rights of employees, blatant misuse of workers' contributions.  The fact that these defaulting employers should now be given an amnesty appals me, people who blatantly and fraudulently deprived this State of its rightful contributions from employees.  I contend there should be no mercy shown such people but, that being said, I am very much in favour of mercy in genuine hardship cases.  I would welcome an amnesty in such cases but there should be no semblance of an amnesty for the former category.</P>
    <P>There are a few other matters I would like to have referred to but I want to refer briefly to one other important point. There is a tendency by Deputies in this House to attack social welfare officers. These people have a difficult job to do and it is unfair to make general attacks on them.  Taking all the factors into account, by and large they do a very difficult job very well and very courteously. As in every group there will always be a few people who may not have the most suitable personality for these very difficult jobs but by and large they do their job well.  There is a need, as Deputy McCartan and Deputy Roche have said, for further information to be given to recipients.  Many claimants for benefits do not seem to understand the role of the social welfare officer.  They regard him as an enemy when in actual fact he should be regarded as a friend. This happens because claimants are not fully informed about the role of social welfare officers and also because they are not fully informed as to why certain decisions are made.  Sending forms to claimants and quoting sections and subsections of Acts is of no help to them. They should be given more information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this Social Welfare Bill, it is worth noting that we spend over £7 million per day on social welfare payments and that in so doing we cater for 1.3 million people.  I do not think any of us can quarrel with the need to pay social welfare and I believe all of <Col N="2416" /> us would wish to see a continued improvement in the level of payments to people on social welfare of one kind or another.</P>
      <P>However, in reviewing the payments I have referred to, this Government or any other Government would have to have regard to the economic and financial circumstances of the country.  Notwithstanding this fact, the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated for continuing to provide, in some cases, major increases for those who are on the lowest level of social welfare payments. An example of this, is the 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance and the 6 per cent increase for dependant children.  Those two increases are extremely welcome and are very necessary during the expensive times in which we live.  In money terms, the increases I have referred to will mean an extra £4.20 per week for a single person and £6.70 per week for a family with three children who are on long-term unemployment assistance.  Taken together, the total package of social welfare increases will amount to £101 million in a full year, which is very substantial in anyone's language.  I note that the Minister is making continued provision for the payment of equal treatment payments which will cost £20 million.  All of us welcome that payment.  The Minister has taken a number of decisions in this regard since coming into office and I am glad he is continuing with his commitment to the payments because they are necessary and, I am sure, all of us support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of PRSI to the self employed is a major feature of the Bill. This has been discussed for a number of years and at last some real decision making is taking place.  I welcome very much the Minister's decision at this time to extend social insurance to the self employed.  It is a major step forward in the ongoing development of our social welfare system.  I do not think it is widely known that the self employed have never been catered for in terms of social insurance and it is only right and proper that this scheme should be extended to <Col N="2417" /> cover them and that it should be available on the widest possible basis.  That is the important point I wanted to make about it.  What the Minister is doing in this regard is simply picking up from where he left off when he was Minister for Social Welfare in 1982.  At that stage the Minister had developed to a fairly fine degree proposals for extending social insurance to the self employed.  I have to make the point that after leaving office in 1982 no further specific progress was made on the matter until the Minister came back into office in 1987 and basically took up from where he left off.  Decisions are now being taken in relation to PRSI and given effect to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The extension of PRSI to the farming community is very welcome.  It is only right that they should contribute to this scheme.  It is evident to many of us that a great number of widows of self employed people have been left without any guaranteed independent income and this, in many cases, has given rise to substantial hardship because of changed family circumstances when a husband died at an early age, often leaving a widow with young children and leaving also, perhaps, some financial commitments. Therefore, the extension of this scheme will be a major help to widows and will also ease the worry and strain on families who, unfortunately, find themselves bereaved by the death of the breadwinner at a crucial stage in the development of a family.  Under the Minister's scheme widows of self employed people will have the same rights to a basic pension, without having to undergo a means test, as widows of employed persons currently have.  That is a very caring and humane way to approach what can sometimes be a very sensitive and distressing problem.</P>
    <P>Of course, this means that the self employed must for the first time make a direct contribution to the cost of social welfare pensions.  It is only right that the Minister should seek a contribution from the self employed for pensions because we have to take account of what might be termed the &ldquo;good risks&rdquo; and the &ldquo;poor risks&rdquo;.  We have to spread the load across <Col N="2418" /> the widest possible number of people and take account of the fact that the self employed may, for a number of years, enjoy substantial incomes.  It is only right that we as a nation should seek to compel them to make provision for their retirement pensions through the scheme the Minister has outlined.</P>
    <P>In deciding to phase in the contributions over a period of three years, the Government and the Minister have been mindful of the need to allow time to the new contributors to adjust to making their contributions.  The Bill stipulates that the rates of contributions, to which I have referred, will be phased in over a three-year period starting on a 3 per cent basis from 6 April 1988, with an increase to 4 per cent from 6 April 1989 and an increase to 5 per cent from 6 April 1990.</P>
    <P>One point about the phasing-in aspect is that the legislation to give effect to this is contained in this Bill.  Therefore, as I understand it, no additional legislation will be required next year or the year after.  The Minister and the Government were wise to incorporate the phasing-in scheme in the proposals in this Bill over the next three years without any additional activity being required in this House.  The Minister should be applauded for recognising the need to approach the matter in that fashion.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to refer to the pre-retirement scheme.  Here again an indication of the caring attitude of Deputy Woods in his role as Minister for Social Welfare is the bringing forward of the decision to introduce this scheme.  Many elderly people who are close to their retirement years accept generally that they are in a semi-retired situation and are very unlikely to go back to full-time employment.  Perhaps many do not wish to go back to full-time employment and for that reason payment of their benefits should be made as easy for them as possible. The need to sign on on a weekly basis is superfluous and we should be addressing ourselves to that issue, as the Minister is doing.  He has decided that those who qualify now for participation in the scheme will be able to opt, if they so wish, to have their payments made by <Col N="2419" /> means of a pension order.  This will enable them to cash their weekly pension orders at their local post office, without the necessity of having to sign on weekly. When people have reached those pre-retirement years that is the least to which they would be entitled.  The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing in that proposal.  It is new and will certainly be of benefit to those to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>Another small point is the abolition of the need for local authorities to pay contributions toward the cost of unemployment assistance.  That requirement on local authorities amounted to £500,000 per annum and the Minister and Government have decided to fund that directly from the Exchequer.  I am sure a great deal of administrative cost was involved and perhaps much supervision, but it is not before its time that this was changed.  It is right that it should be taken out of the area of responsibility of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>During the course of yesterday's debate some reference was made, I think by Deputy De Rossa, about the implications for local authority tenants who receive social welfare increases.  He was critical of the fact that these tenants sometimes found their social welfare increases practically nullified by immediate increases in rent.  I am not sure if Deputy De Rossa is aware that the rent scheme is organised by the local authority and the changes in rent are the responsibility of individual local authorities.  They do not increase rents under a directive from central Government.  Each local authority decide the rate to be charged on their property and it is only right, as a member of a local authority, that I should point this out.  However, local authorities will have to take more account of the manner in which they fix rents for tenants and they will have to be more compassionate in terms of increasing rents based on increases in social welfare payments, about taking away the financial benefit accruing to tenants once a Bill such as this is enacted and the increased rates come into force in July.</P>
    <P>There has been some recent discussion <Col N="2420" /> in relation to the income from social insurance for the self-employed and some suggestion that it would cost the State a great deal of money.  Having critically examined the scheme, I do not believe that will be the case.  When one takes into account the existing arrangements, the additional cost of the scheme over and above the arrangements to which I have referred will go from £6 million in year five to £21 million in year ten and £89 million in year 50.  By the end of year ten, the scheme will have accumulated a surplus of something in the order of £360 million.  Some of the recent erroneous statements were based on the interpretation of the expected yield in 1988 and that was just extended year by year. One cannot take it on that basis.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has rejected suggestions that the self-employed should be allowed to opt out of the scheme and I agree with that.  The self-employed must participate in this scheme.  It is an attempt to bring equity into the social insurance system by bringing in the self-employed to contribute to the financing of their own pensions for the first time.  We all must contribute to the scheme, those who would be considered good risks as well of those who would be considered doubtful risks.  We must all participate to ensure the success and stability of the scheme. The information available at present is that 70 per cent of former self-employed people qualify for social assistance pensions for which they have not contributed a single penny.  We should not allow that to continue and the Minister's decision is to be welcomed.  Ultimately it will benefit all of us.</P>
    <P>One of the areas of social welfare in which I am particularly interested is changes in administration.  There have been consistent complaints about the manner in which the whole area of social welfare is administered.  The Minister has taken this matter very seriously He has shown himself capable of being extremely innovative in terms of bringing in new technology to deal with social welfare applications and payments.  last year, if my memory serves me correctly, the Minister obtained a sum in excess of £2 <Col N="2421" /> million for the commencement of substantial computerisation of his Department. The new technology available in terms of transmission of information from computerisation systems can only streamline the operation of the Department of Social Welfare.  The payments affect 1.3 million people so the amount of paperwork under the old system must be absolutely colossal.  The new technology should help us to cope more effeciently with the development of a social welfare system that is mindful of the people's needs and that is caring and efficient in terms of meeting the demands of those who need help at a time when they are finding things extremely difficult.</P>
    <P>The programme initiated by the Minister to develop computerisation in his Department will play a very significant role in helping the Department to meet their obligation to those who have occasion to do business with them in terms of social welfare applications and payments.  I know the Minister is extremely committed to that programme, in which I have a very great interest.  I shall be watching developments in the years ahead.  The Minister has set himself a three or four year target to achieve rationalisation and computerisation of the service in the local areas.  For that reason, I support his efforts and those of his officials in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also very committed to the one stop shops.  This has a bearing on what I said in relation to computerisation, etc., and the Minister has already begun his programme in regard to the establishment of one stop shops as he is seeking to meet the growing demand among social welfare claimants to be paid in their own localities.  It is the Minister's intention that one stop shops will speed the delivery of service to applicants and do away with the unnecesary recourse to supplementary welfare which is a stopgap payment while the system is sorted out in relation to an individual applicant.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in my own constituency in Tallaght, social welfare cheques which were forwarded through <Col N="2422" /> the post failed to arrive because, unfortunately, the postman was held up. About 600 families were severely inconvenienced that week as they had been expecting payments on Friday.  At the last minute, the Minister had to make arrangements in the local health centres to cope with the demand from those who had not received payments.  If we could streamline the service, as suggested by the Minister, incidents such as the one to which I referred would not arise.  The establishment of the one stop shops would help to prevent that type of problem arising.</P>
    <P>Computerisation could help us to allow social welfare beneficiaries to go to the shop on the high street if it was suitably geared to cope with a link-in to the Department of Social Welfare so that social welfare recipients could cash their cheques there.  They should also be able to make claims in that regard.  The lottery promoters have said that computers will be installed in various locations throughout the country and the social welfare system could also be geared in that way, although perhaps not as widespread.  The employment exchange or the health centre need not be the only centres which deal with social welfare benefits.  This would put a more humane face on social welfare and there would be a more caring image in regard to payments.  If people are entitled to social welfare we should ensure that they get such payments in the most efficient and caring way possible. The old attitude was that life should be made difficult for social welfare recipients although I do not think that is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Taking the Social Welfare Bill as a whole, the Minister and the Government have succeeded in providing major increases for those on the lowest social welfare payments, which is obviously very welcome.  Fianna Fáil Governments have always stated their commitment to maintaining the real value of social welfare payments and they have succeeded in that regard.  The Government have always stressed the need to introduce greater equity in financing the social welfare system and have extended the social <Col N="2423" /> insurance scheme to the self-employed, including farmers.</P>
    <P>One cannot talk about social welfare and ignore the complaints regarding fraud and abuse of the system.  The Minister has addressed himself to the problem, not only in the area of social welfare beneficiaries but also of unscrupulous employers who employ people without putting them on the books.  That practice must stop.  The employee is not necessarily the beneficiary of such a scheme, the unscrupulous employer is the main beneficiary.  These people must be rooted out and told that such a practice is not acceptable.  One must also ask if an employee in such a situation is covered for accident and injury suffered in the workplace.  There must be very grave doubt as to whether the employer's legitimate liability insurance would cover such an accident.  I very much doubt it.  There are major implications for the person who allows himself or herself to be employed in that manner.  The Minister must be supported in all his efforts to try to deal with that abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials for preparing this very substantial Bill, for keeping faith with the lowest beneficiaries in the social welfare system and for ensuring that they get an 11 per cent increase.  The Minister has also improved the benefits under the FIS scheme.  It was right to meet our responsibilities in this regard because some people in employment find it extremely difficult to meet their commitments with mortgage repayments, ESB bills, etc.  I compliment the Minister and the Government for what they have done in the Bill.  They have honoured their commitments and will continue to review social welfare incomes.  As each budget over the next three years comes before the House, there will be a considerable, continuing improvement in the level of payments to social welfare beneficiaries so that their real income increases year by year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increases in the Bill for social welfare recipients. <Col N="2424" /> They are small increases but they are a step in the right direction.  I am amazed at how active the social welfare officers have been in the past 12 months in their operations all over the country.  There has been a countrywide blitz in regard to investigation from the Department of Social Welfare in relation to recipients of unemployment assistance, to old age pensioners and to the underprivileged sections of the community.</P>
      <P>There is a need for tightening up the social welfare system in regard to fraud but the actions of the social welfare officers are not confined to apprehending the people perpetrating such frauds.  Far from it; they are actually harassing old age pensioners and the less privileged in our society.  I am aware of a number of cases where investigators from the Department of Social Welfare decided to terminate benefit under the free electricity and free telephone scheme given to old age pensioners simply because a person who was paid the prescribed relative allowance lived with them.  There is nothing humane about that action.  Did the Minister give a direction to social welfare officers to carry out such gestapo-type investigatons?  Old age pensioners who call to my clinic have been in tears when explaining to me that their free electricity benefit had been terminated. Most of those people had great difficulty in having the benefit restored while others are still awaiting the result of their appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view there is no need for such in-depth investigations.  If the Department, or the Minister, insist on such a national blitz why is it that they do not devote their full attention to those who are defrauding the system and leave the underprivileged alone?  I hope the Minister conveys my sentiments about those investigations to the officials of his Department and that he will ensure that they do not recur.  The Minister should not tolerate that.  Dozens of recipients of disability and long term benefits are having their payments terminated weekly.  What type of investigation is being carried out into the means of people who because of their disability <Col N="2425" /> cannot do a day's work?  It is important to remember that many of the investigating officials do not have a medical qualification and I wonder how they can declare a person fit for work.  Those officials are terminating the benefits of such people without any regard for the medical certificates issued by general practitioners and surgeons.  People are being deprived of any type of allowance for between six and nine months &mdash; in a number of cases for the remainder of their lives &mdash; although they can prove to the investigating officers that they are considered unfit for work by their local doctor.</P>
    <P>It should be sufficient for a person to produce a certificate from a local doctor to the effect that he or she is unfit for work.  It is wrong that they should be left without benefit until such time as a medical referee holds an oral hearing although, in many cases appeals are decided by senior officials in the Department. The Minister should instruct his officials to be more sympathetic to the weakest and most vulnerable section in our community.  He should ensure that they get fair play and accept medical certificates from their local doctor as evidence of their inability to work.  Such evidence should be sufficient proof to the Department to ensure a continuation of the payment of benefits to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>And no medical referee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a need for a medical referee but the medical referee should be instructed to take into consideration the contents of certificates issued by local doctors.  Many people have been victimised as a result of the Department's policy in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious anomalies exist in the procedure for determining a person's entitlement to a widow's pension.  When the children of a widow attain the age of 18 years the allowance paid in respect of them is terminated and the allowance paid to the widow is reduced by a further £6 per week.  That is a heartless regulation but it is not surprising when one considers the many heartless decisions taken by the <Col N="2426" /> Government.  How did that woman get means of £320 by virtue of the fact that her child had attained the age of 18?  Who is the Minister codding?  Is that the proper treatment to mete out to unfortunate people who suffer bereavement?  I am amazed the Minister has allowed his officials to concoct this phoney figure of £320.</P>
    <P>Last week a woman in my constituency presented such a case to me.  I took up the matter with the Department and was told that the case was dealt with in accordance with the relevant regulation. The sooner that regulation is erased the better.  Would the Minister like a reduction in salary of £320 if his child reached the age of 18?  I hope he will not stand over the anomaly and that he will take immediate action to correct it.</P>
    <P>Many non-contributory old age pensioners transfer their farms or businesses to members of their families on attaining the age of 66 because they are not able to carry on any longer and want to make provision for settling their affairs.  Why do they not automatically qualify for their pension?  If the son or daughter, nephew or niece to whom the farm is handed over has an off-farm occupation the rate of pension is drastically reduced.  What has that to do with the applicant for the old age pension when he is compelled by health reasons to hand over his enterprise? If the relative is not resident on the farm the applicant will get only a very small percentage of the old age pension. Is that justice?  Perhaps the relative could not exist on the small income provided by the farm.  He may have had a job for some years because his father could not support him on the proceeds of the small holding.  The investigating officer, the Department of Social Welfare and the Minister have no consideration for the plight of the applicant.  The big stick is wielded and he or she is automatically deprived of the maximum rate of old age pension.</P>
    <P>A further anomaly exists in regard to the social employment scheme.  Applicants for that scheme are required to be in receipt of unemployment assistance for a considerable period before they are <Col N="2427" /> eligible.  This means that people who are signing the live register but not drawing unemployment assistance do not qualify. Many people sign the live register who may not want to be a burden on the State by claiming unemployment assistance. Both categories are available for work but when the person who is not in receipt of unemployment assistance applies for a place on this special scheme he is told he cannot be considered.  Surely this is completely wrong?  We are actually inviting that person to be a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>Unemployed people who are accepted for the scheme are compelled after 12 months to revert to unemployment assistance. Surely the Minister appreciates that this is very degrading for such people.  It should be the Minister's aim to allow them to continue on the scheme as long as it lasts or to transfer them to a subsequent scheme where the promotors find it impossible to get a new set of workers.  I can see no reason why the Minister would not correct that anomaly.  People who are interested in continuing employment under the scheme should be given the opportunity to make their contribution instead of being a liability to the State.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of farmers on holdings.  I am speaking about the small farmers along the western seaboard whose interests I try to represent in this House.  Will such a person receive an 11 per cent increase in his unemployment assistance?  He is on long-term unemployment assistance to supplement his income from his farm holding and I would like the Minister to tell us whether he will be granted the 11 per cent increase which has been granted to the other recipients of long-term unemployment assistance.  If they are not going to receive this increase I demand that the Minister grant it to them under this Bill.  It would be a Christian thing for him to do to ensure that all those who are not able to eke out a living from their meagre holdings receive the same benefits as the man who can sleep in his bed for 24 hours if he wishes to do so.  I insist that the <Col N="2428" /> increase of 11 per cent be given to small farmers who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>When social welfare officers investigate claims from small farmers headage grants should be disregarded.  Headage grants are provided by the EC to enable small farmers rear animals on uneconomic holdings.  If they did not receive these grants they would not be in a position to rear these animals.  The social welfare officer takes into account the income received from the sale of those animals, therefore how can the Minister comprehend the same social welfare officer also including the headage grants as income?  It must be remembered he would not have been able to rear those cattle were it not for the headage grants he received.  If there is any sincerity left in the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he will take heed of what I am saying here today and correct that anomaly because without a shadow of doubt many of those small farmers along the western seaboard would not be able to survive if they did not qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>We are not fortunate enough to have major industries where our sons and daughters could obtain employment.  Our position is different from that in the cities of Dublin, Cork and Galway.  I am talking about the man living on isolated peninsulas from Mizen Head to Malin Head. These could be described as the people the Department of Social Welfare have forgotten.  They are not being given a fair crack of the whip.  They are underprivileged and are not being given their basic rights in regard to the assessment of income from their small holdings.  I urge the Minister to take immediate steps to rectify that anomaly and to make sure that it will be corrected before this Bill passes into law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tells us that for a family where there are three children, the increase in unemployment benefit will be £3.10 per week, giving them a new rate of £102.30 per week, that a retired couple <Col N="2429" /> receiving old age pension will receive an increase of £3 per week, giving them a new rate of £99.20 per week and that a widow with three children in receipt of a contributory pension will receive an increase of £2.80 per week, giving her a new rate of £93.30 per week.  Social welfare recipients living in local authority houses have already had that increase absorbed as a result of the notices which have been sent out by the local authorities during the past week stating that their rents are going to be increased by between £3 and £5 per week.  Where, then, is the benefit to accrue from so far as these so-called increases spelled out by the Minister are concerned?  I think the Minister should have a word with his friend, the Minister for the Environment, so as to ensure that he does not gobble up any increases which have been given to those unfortunate people by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is like tweedledum and tweedledee.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an extension of social insurance to the self employed. The Minister stated that this was a historic development in the social welfare system but I have yet to be convinced that it is a historic development.  It is a well known fact the the basis of social insurance is the provision of a basic level of protection as of right without a means test.  I agree when the Minister says that the payment of compulsory social insurance will ensure that every person with an independent social income will contribute part of that income to financing the basic pension cover on a non-tested basis.</P>
    <P>A person who will enter into insurance for the first time on 6 April and who will attain the age of 56 on that date will qualify for a contributory old age pension ten years later but the person who will attain the age of 56 on the following day or thereafter will not qualify for a contributory old age pension when he or she attains the age of 66.  Surely, that is an anomaly which the Minister will have to correct.  Not only is it totally unfair and unjust, it is probably also unconstitutional. The Constitution legally binds us to looking after each and every citizen <Col N="2430" /> without creating any distinctions between them.  For that reason, I urge the Minister to make sure that the person who will attain the age of 56 on 7 April 1988 or thereafter will be exempt from paying PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>They will not gain one iota from their contributions.</P>
    <P>There is no legal or moral obligation in the Bill to ensure that a person must give up his farm or business in order to get a pension at the age of 66 having made contributions for ten years.</P>

If this is a Christian, caring Government &mdash; and I have yet to be convinced they are &mdash; the Minister will take steps to rectify the anomalies and make sure that the person who will be 56 on 7 April 1988 will be exempt from paying contributions.  It is sad that a man of 56 years of age on 6 April will get all the benefits whereas the man who is 56 on 7 April will be penalised in that he will have to undergo a means test to get a pension if he has one day short in the ten year contributions term when he reaches the age of 66.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some trepidation that I address the House after the eloquence of my colleague from Cork south-west.  The people are obviously very well represented by Deputy Sheehan.  I listened with mounting admiration to his discourse on the social welfare scheme and its anomalies and the hardships under which his people in Cork labour.  I represent what could be called the urban equivalent to what the Deputy described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would join with Deputy Sheehan in many of the points he made but I must take issue with him on his first point accusing the Minister of sitting back and relaxing.  The Minister cannot be accused <Col N="2431" /> of that.  The record speaks for itself.  In the middle of an economic gale not alone did the Minister manage to maintain social welfare services but he increased their financial value.  We must acknowledge that but not by minimising the defects that occur from time to time and of which the Minister is well aware.  I know the Minister tries very hard within his budget to look after the disadvantaged people.</P>
    <P>One would need to have spent at least 15 years practising law to understand the ramifications of the Social Welfare Acts. We should approach the working of social welfare from a different angle.  A financial floor should be placed under people and the amount of money they receive should not depend on contributions, age, where they live, whether it is urban or rural living, but on their need.  We should work towards such a system because peoples needs differ at different times.</P>
    <P>I appeal here on behalf of old age pensioners. These people should be entitled to a pension whatever their financial situation and whether they have made contributions over the years.  A person who has survived to the age of 65 is entitled to every consideration the State can give. At that age one's resources, financial, physical and intellectual, are running down and one cannot keep up with younger people.  This is a generalisation and I realise that one can cite the particular, but those who have reached pensionable age are worthy of special consideration. Incidentally, I can never understand why one must be 66 before one is entitled to free travel.  Perhaps the Minister in his reply will elaborate a little on the difference between the red bus card and the yellow bus card.  It was brought to my notice recently by some of my constituents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan referred to non-contributory pensions and made quite an eloquent case.  He insinuated that people were being belittled by having to make a contribution prior to receiving the pension and that non-contributory pensions would over the next few years be phased out.  Non-contributory pensions were <Col N="2432" /> introduced many years ago to deal with people in need.  The taxpayer this year is burdened to the tune of £300 million to finance non-contributory pensions.  Many people getting the benefit of non-contributory pensions do not really need them.  Deputy Sheehan cited the case of people having to sign over their farms or businesses to their children in order to avail of a full non-contributory pension. People who were in possession of large farms and substantial businesses signed over their businesses in order to dip into the taxpayers' pocket.  We are not an extremely wealthy country and this was an abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with pensions for self-employed people over 56 years.  Over the years people have come in and out of the social welfare system and have not the benefit of a contributory pension.  In our constituencies we have all met such people who had to work on because they had no means or businesses and were not eligible for a contributory pension.  Many of them have made the point to me, rightly, that they have worked in and for the State and raised their families and when they came to 55 or 56 years of age they were not entitled to a pension although they had at different times in their working lives paid into a contributory pension scheme.  I find that a person must have paid into the scheme for ten years.  The Minister said in regard to self-employed persons over 56 that they must have paid for ten years into the scheme before they are entitled to a contributory pension.  I ask him to look at that again.  He makes the point that in year 11 the cost to fund the scheme would be £40 million.  However, he has a way out if he brings in <i>pro rata</i> pensions, as he has said.  I ask him to re-examine this because not alone are we speaking about finance but about the dignity of the individual. Many of the older generation feel that the State in which they have worked for years has let them down or been negligent of their needs.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, Deputy Woods, when he goes back to the Department of Social Welfare to look at this again.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the extension of <Col N="2433" /> social welfare to the self-employed over 56 years of age.  This is a very laudable idea.  I praise the Minister also for the introduction of a pre-retirement scheme for many people who for one reason or another have been unable to engage in full employment, to work a 40 hour week or more.  We all know in this day and age the demands on people working in businesses, factories and on farms.  The competitive edge puts many of them out of court.  They are just not able to endure the stresses of modern demands.  The financial bottom line is the be-all and end-all of our lives.  The Department of Social Welfare are one of the few Departments who can ameliorate this situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal in passing with the medical referees department.  Some of the decisions emanating from there are, on grounds of common sense and logic, indefensible, not too often but occasionally.  People who are obviously unemployable and unwell are passed as fit for work and those who are obviously fit and well are passed as unfit for work. I do not know what can be done about it, but maybe it can be examined again and tightened up.  Persons whose certificates are terminated end up, as in many cases in the Dublin area, with no income.  They have to have recourse to the local health board clinic &mdash; in Dublin the Eastern Health Board &mdash; where the community welfare officer will deal with the problem, but he is acting under fairly severe financial constraints.  There is a gap between being disbarred from social welfare allowances, one's appeal being heard and if the appeal is successful one being put back on social welfare.  I realise arrears are made up, but the arrears sometimes do not compensate for the weeks of discomfort and misery.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of health boards working in tandem with the Department of Social Welfare, let me say that this area could be tightened up considerably to allow again for greater ease and communication between the two.  In the area I represent we are extremely lucky to have excellent staff in the health board and an excellent social welfare office at Phibsboro Tower.  Here I would like to <Col N="2434" /> praise the staff with whom I deal on almost a daily basis.  I have found them nothing if not courteous and considerate to both me and my constituents.</P>
    <P>All praise to the Minister for extending the dental benefit scheme last year to the spouses of insured persons.  Note the arcane language: &ldquo;spouses of insured persons&rdquo;. Strangely enough, it is not used when talking about deserted husbands. Deserted wives receive benefit, deserted husbands do not.  Maybe if we dealt with &ldquo;deserted spouses&rdquo; we could come up with some scheme.  Husbands become deserted, are left with families on their hands, children have to be reared, and it can be extremely difficult for a deserted husband to raise a family and hold down a job.  This is not to denigrate for one moment the plight of deserted wives but to ask for even-handed treatment for both sexes.</P>
    <P>As I said, the dental benefit scheme was extended to spouses of workers in benefit.  Unfortunately, the Irish Dental Association saw fit to instruct their members not to operate the scheme. Being a practising dentist, I find that incomprehensible in a profession that purports to be one of the caring professions. As everybody knows, wives and mothers will put their children before themselves even to the extent of denying themselves dental treatment so that their children may have what they consider to be necessary for their future good.  I ask the Irish Dental Association to consider whether they can put this scheme into effect with the least possible delay.  Their basic argument &mdash; there are numerous arguments &mdash; is that it would reduce the scope for private practice in the dental area.  I say to them it may increase their practices because it will bring a pool of patients into the dental scheme who were hitherto outside it.  If we are anxious &mdash; the Irish Dental Association are, I know &mdash; about providing jobs for graduates, they should see that dental benefit is extended to everybody.  They should be pressing for this rather than denying people who are deserving and in need of dental treatment.</P>

The Minister must be aware there are 9,500 women over 25 years of age and 3,100 men over 25 years of age who are signing on for unemployment assistance but are not in receipt of money &mdash; that is, not counting those who are signing on for unemployment benefit. There is a clear discrimination against them on the basis that they are living at home or living with a spouse, and this is <Col N="2437" /> unfair.  There are clearly three times as many women denied access to the social employment scheme as a result of this ruling of the Department.  On that basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of issues involved.  Two cases are under investigation by the equality officer so I do not want to pre-empt the arguments. Sometime ago before there was equal access to the unemployment assistance scheme by single and married people, perhaps there were more arguments. Means tests are now applied and it is not as discriminatory as it was previously. There is a fundamental difficulty in that the social employment scheme and the other schemes are designed to aid long-term unemployed people.  If there is discrimination, particularly in relation to married women as Deputy De Rossa has outlined, it is not discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status but on the basis of economic disadvantage.  That is the position, because the purpose of the social employment scheme is to take people off the live register who, because of their conditions, are socially disadvantaged. Because of that I cannot accept the Deputy's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with the Minister.  I have no idea how many of the 9,500 women I am speaking about are married but I know that if they are married, even though they may be living with a partner, they are not treated in the same way for assessment of means <Col N="2438" /> for unemployment assistance.  The other point is, in the circumstances I am talking about the people involved fill all of the requirements other than they are receiving no money from the Department of Social Welfare.  So there is clear discrimination in that there are three times as many women excluded from the social employment scheme on this basis.  Also, people are being discriminated against in relation to the social employment scheme because they are living either with a spouse or with their mother and father.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The point still holds that there are more people available for the scheme than there are places on it.  I am not saying there is not an element of disadvantage in the cases the Deputy refers to.  The reason these two people were excluded from the scheme is that both were married and the income of their husbands was taken into account threby excluding them.

      <P>If a person is in receipt only of unemployment assistance and is not in receipt of any other income, he is entitled to take part in the scheme.  What the Deputy is arguing for is that combined incomes would not be taken into account for the social employment scheme.  That would mean that a high proportion of the present positions would be taken up by other people.  The resources being spent on this scheme are extremely high &mdash; about £46 million, and this is already going to the socially disadvantaged. There is discrimination on that basis only and not on any other basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>My Department are particularly concerned with the implications of the decisions of the European Council as they affect the European Social Fund.  The Department of Labour have been keeping in close touch with developments arising from the Council's decision, in close consultation with other Departments and agencies involved, including agencies under their own aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Community structural funds are concerned, the European Council decided that the contributions of those funds to the less developed Community regions should be doubled by 1992 and that a range of increased rates of fund assistance should be introduced for operations in those regions.  These decisions, together with others taken by the European Council, are now being incorporated into legislative form.  This process will take some time to complete as a radical restructuring of all the structural funds is involved and a whole range of technical issues will have to be resolved.  My Department are actively participating in the negotiations which are in progress.  Our objective will be to <Col N="2441" /> ensure that the terms of the implementing regulations are so formulated as to enable us to derive maximum benefit from the additional resources that will become available.</P>
    <P>At the same time, my Department and their agencies are preparing to make any necessary adjustments in their own policies and operations in line with the new requirements in relation to the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, when the reformed structural funds come into operation, Ireland will be in a position to secure substantially increased benefits not only from the European Social Fund but also from the other structural funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is now expected that Ireland will see its share of the Social Fund double in the coming years?  Is there any indication that there might be any change in priorities as between those under 25 and over 25 years, as between training and employment, in terms of the priority given to the long-term unemployed and so on; and if there are indications to that effect, to what extent do those indications accord with our national priorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of isues involved.  The decision was made that the funds should be doubled and the format has yet to be worked out.  The important conclusions of the Council meeting in the area of the structural funds are: first, that the contribution to the funds to less-developed regions, including Ireland &mdash; the objective 1 regions &mdash; would be doubled by 1992.  That was a very clear commitment.  Secondly, by 1992 two-thirds of all the structural funds would be concentrated on those regions and, thirdly, the new increased rates of assistance ranging from 50 per cent minimum, which was the old figure, to 75 per cent maximum would be introduced for the objective I regions.  If that is followed through it would work out to the benefit of this country.  There are a number of points that have to be further negotiated. First, the framework regulations which will determine the basic objectives and <Col N="2442" /> task of the funds will have to be worked out and, secondly, the implementing regulations which will set out how the funds will operate have yet to be decided. A meeting will be held this coming week at which they will be decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate if the framework legislation will substantially change the way Ireland has obtained funding through the European Social Fund?  Will our take from the European Social Fund be doubled or have we been able to maximise our portion of it to date to the extent that we will not be in a position to double it by 1992?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework regulations have not been worked out yet.  It has yet to be negotiated as to whether there will be a doubling of the overall structural funds as a whole or whether there will be a doubling of each fund as it stood before the Delors package. Naturally, in any discussions that take place I will be putting the case for the needs of this country under the European Social Fund, particularly in the area of the long-term unemployed and the vocational training preparation courses. I hope we have not maximised our resources but that has yet to be worked out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Labour are the co-ordinating body but there is a number of agencies involved, particularly in the areas of the handicapped. I do not believe that fundamental changes will take place.  As I stated during a previous Question Time, schemes such as the social employment scheme are considered for a far smaller percentage take than are training <Col N="2443" /> schemes.  I have already put down my arguments at the December Council meeting as to why they should receive a far higher take under the new scheme. At present they receive only £14.50 per week whereas a training scheme would probably receive double that figure.  Perhaps the principles or the fundamental matters will not be changed but the rates should certainly be very different.</P>

      <P>The provision of sheltered employment or separate arrangements for the training and placement of disabled persons including those with a mild handicap is a matter for the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>FÁS programmes, including training, are open to disabled persons capable of participating in such programmes and this policy will continue.  FÁS would seek the advice of the National Rehabilitation Board where they would have doubts about a disabled person being capable of undertaking the programme or job applied for.</P>

I do not want to say it is a matter for the Department of Health and the National Rehabilitation Board.  As far as FÁS are concerned persons opting for manpower programmes must be capable of participating in open employment schemes while they, FÁS, give any help and assistance they can to such people.  But in <Col N="2445" /> some cases people require expert advice, guidance and assistance.

But the difficulty that has arisen &mdash; and to which Deputy Colley is referring &mdash; is the fact that on the National Rehabilitation Board's placement lists there are not now the same opportunities for them in open employment.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in a report of the National Association for Mentally Handicapped of Ireland in 1986 the association asked that the Departments of Health and Labour would co-ordinate the services available, would review how they were being implemented and being made available to those in need of them?  Has that happened or is there a method by which it might happen?  Obviously, if there are scarce and scant resources they should be maximised and not duplicated.</P>

      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy's sentiments.  I am not sure whether it was in response ot the report to which the Deputy referred, but I should say there was a review carried out last year, in the context of the formation of the estimates for both the National Rehabilitation Board and FÁS for 1988 to ensure there would be no duplication and that any resources to be had within FÁS would be used for the benefit of <Col N="2446" /> handicapped people.  In the course of that review there was found to be a difficulty in dealing with even mildly handicapped people, or handicapped people, because the conditions and equipment available to FÁS are not necessarily suitable to as many handicapped people as need them. But I know that every effort is made by FÁS to facilitate such people and they are very conscious of their commitment to assisting the handicapped.</P>

Furthermore, would he agree that, in view of the increases granted in social welfare, the gap has been closed somewhat between what is being paid under the Teamwork and social employment schemes and the amount one would receive on unemployment benefit or assistance?  Would he agree that, for that reason alone, it would be worthwhile to carry out a review of what is being paid and have an increase applied?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy says, there was a substantial increase granted in the long-term unemployment allowance. The position is that unemployment assistance, from this summer onwards, will amount to £42 and the amount payable under the social employment scheme will remain £60.  However, the difficulty arises in that there are still a large number of applicants which means that, if one increases the amount payable, then the number of beneficiaries will decrease correspondingly.  At a recent meeting with the trade union movement when there were discussions on a number of issues in regard to the social employment scheme, I undertook &mdash; in the context of the Estimates for this year &mdash; to review the level of payments under the schemes.  The point at issue here is that probably it would be better were these schemes linked in some way.  I have given an undertaking to investigate the budgetary system overall rather than considering them individually.  In the course of any one year it is impossible to bring them back into line or maintain the same differential between what might have been granted in a budget in, say, January and what I might have forecast in the course of a budgetary exercise in, say, June or July last.  It is not possible to do that.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in relation to the gap between the £42 received by people on unemployment assistance and the £60 payable to people who participate in the Teamwork scheme or social employment scheme.  Would the Minister accept that, when PRSI contributions and daily travelling expenses are deducted from the £60 there is then very little difference between what one might receive on unemployment assistance and one's earnings by way of participation in one of these schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that with the very large increase granted in the budget to unemployment assistance the differential has narrowed.  However, it must be remembered also that, under the provisions of the social employment scheme, an individual can work the remaining two and a half days, or can be involved for the remaining two and a half days, which would not affect their earnings under the scheme.  I might add that a large number do so in one form or another.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>An employment agreement relating to pensions assurance and sick pay in the construction industry has been registered by the Labour Court at the request of the Registered National Joint Industrial Council for the Construction Industry. The agreement provides for pension, mortality and sick pay benefits.  The agreement applies to the categories of workers specified in the agreement who are employed by building or civil engineering firms as defined in the agreement. One of the main provisions of the agreement in question is that each worker affected must receive from his employer the benefits of a pension scheme and a sick pay scheme which are no less favourable than those set out in the agreement. Every employer in the construction industry is, therefore, obliged to provide these benefits either under the construction federation operatives pension scheme or under some other scheme.  The effect of the registration of the agreement by the Labour Court is to make these arrangements legally enforceable.</P>
      <P>However, the Labour Court can only act on the basis of complaint that the terms of the registered agreement have not been complied with.  The Construction Industry Federation &mdash; which administers the construction federation operatives pension scheme &mdash; employs a team of inspectors to ensure that construction firms are complying with the agreement.  Employees in the industry are advised by the trade unions and the pension scheme management to check regularly that their pension contribution deductions are being passed on.  If an employee discovers at any time that his contributions have not been paid over and the employer is still in business it is possible to compel the employer to pay over any arrears of contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, protects both employers' and employees' <Col N="2450" /> outstanding contributions to an occupational pension scheme for a period up to a year prior to the date of insolvency of an employer.  This applies to employer insolvencies occurring on or after 22 October, 1983.  Therefore, in any instance where employers, who are covered by the construction federation operatives pension scheme, have become insolvent, the trustees of the scheme should apply to my Department for the payment of any outstanding contributions allowed under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is very important that he, as Minister for Labour takes positive action against &mdash; the best term I can think of is &mdash; cowboy builders, who deduct pension contributions from their employees but do not pay those contributions into the construction federation operatives pension scheme, thus depriving such unfortunate employees, who will have given lifelong service to their employers, of pensions?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that such builders usually go into voluntary liquidation and, after a short period, go back into business continuing the same practice?  What positive action can be taken to eliminate this type of practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment agreement relating to pensions, insurance and sick pay in the construction industry is precisely what has been concluded and lodged with the Labour Court so as to overcome that difficulty.  In so far as I have any say, the agreement will be enforced.  There is a difficulty and it has to be highlighted that people have to police their own scheme.  The construction industry have employed inspectors who will visit the firms to ensure they are complying with the agreement.  They have computerised their entire register of about 100,000 members in their efforts to make this scheme work.  It is a new scheme and there is an amount of information on it which I should be glad to give to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the agreement which the Minister has announced. What happens to builders who are outside the CIF scheme?  How will they be policed?  There is the danger if an employee goes to an employer and asks him for a record of contributions he will get short shrift and not be well received.  The employee could put his future on the line and be asked very awkward questions by the employer as to whether or not he trusts him.  I fully endorse the question put down by Deputy Wyse because I have met many people who have worked in the construction industry all their lives who, when they tried to draw their pensions, found that there were gaps in their contributions.  One builder may pay in an employee's contribution but another may not.  It is not always the big builder who keeps such contributions up to date.  In some cases the small builder may do so. If there is a gap in the contributions a case will have to be made on compassionate grounds to the CIF in order to get a pension for the former employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue.  The CIF and the trade unions concerned are to be congratulated on their efforts in this scheme.  I cannot claim any great role in it other than that the Labour Court will assist in the scheme.  If an individual is not registered with the CIF he will not be in the scheme and, therefore, no deductions will be made for him. It still remains a problem for those people.  The CIF have built a register of all their members and, in particular, of those companies who have been involved in difficulties in the past and the inspectors they have now employed will follow those companies to ensure they comply with the agreement.</P>

The new rate was applicable to new participants recruited on or after 1 April 1987 on both new and current projects.

During this period Dublin Corporation refused planning permission to the crèche in its current premises.</P>
      <P>The board of FÁS has decided that the crèche will have to operate on a private commercial basis after 31 March 1988.  I have asked FÁS to provide whatever non-financial assistance they can towards the establishment of the crèche on a private basis within these constraints.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether he would be in favour of pressing his colleagues in the European Community to further legislation in this area?  After all, it is one which can increase productivity and encourage better working on the shop floor.  Many of the countries in the Community have already structures which enable worker participation in private enterprise. Would he not consider pressing the matter at Community level?</P>

      <P>We shall shortly have in the House the Bill on worker participation in the public sector.  Any company in the private sector can go ahead with their own arrangements.  The Fifth, the Vredeling Directive, is at draft stage and I would support that.  The reason why I do not think at this stage one should go ahead is that the advisory report on worker participation is divided on what <Col N="2457" /> should happen.  Until there is more awareness and more people are in support of the idea of worker participation in the private area, we shall not make much progress.  There are some very successful schemes at present in operation in some of the larger companies in the private sector, so the idea is growing.  At this stage I do not think that we should legislate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true to say that the group divided, not so much on whether there should be legislation as on whether there should be bodies or organisations set up to aid the move towards worker participation?  There is nothing to prevent the Minister from producing legislation which shows the way forward in this area. As an adjunct to this, I believe that the Irish Management Institute is a proper vehicle to introduce the idea into management. That is where it must emanate from.  In private industry it cannot come from the workers.  It will have to come from management.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ruling out the idea of being involved in this.  At present the Irish Productivity Council are the organisation taking the lead in participation, particularly in the public sector.  If we are to get participation in the private sector, the last way to get it is by legislation.  There is a programme. The Department of Labour for a number of years have been actively involved in promoting worker participation in the public and private sectors.  I am taking the lead, as Minister for Labour, by bringing this into about 40 State organisations.  It is hoped that that will set the example for further companies.  I do not want to say no to the private sector companies to follow.</P>

      <P>I have to say that I do not consider the question of increasing the number of public holidays to be a priority concern at this stage.  I am aware that most member states of the European Community have more public holidays than this country but I do not regard this as a valid reason for contemplating an increase here at a time of economic difficulty and high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, the concentration of our efforts for the foreseeable future should be on safeguarding existing jobs and on creating the environment in which more employment can be generated.  The concession of additional paid leisure time for people who are at work would, if <Col N="2460" /> anything, serve as a disincentive to employment creation.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>FÁS already operate <Col N="2461" /> a number of programmes under which projects may be sponsored by local or voluntary groups which are of significant benefit to the local community. However, participants receive a training or other allowance rather than retaining their existing social welfare entitlements. I do not propose any change to that situation.</P>

Will the Minister agree that FÁS would be the ideal body to co-ordinate such schemes, undertaken perhaps by voluntary organisations, so that unemployed people know they are available?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he intends to expand the level of support for those <Col N="2462" /> engaged in the provision of welfare support services for Irish emigrants particularly in Britain and the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Grants for the provision of welfare services for Irish emigrants are paid by my Department on the basis of recommendations made by DION, the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad. DION are an independent voluntary committee whose membership is drawn mainly from Irish organisations operating in Britain.</P>
      <P>In 1988, the allocation for DION will be maintained at £250,000.  Given the current Exchequer situation necessitating cuts in many areas of public expenditure, the Government regret that it is not possible to increase the allocation. In the case of the 1987 allocation, the bulk of the State grants was directed towards the improvement and development of reception and welfare services in Britain for newly arrived emigrants.</P>
      <P>As regards assistance for Irish emigrants in the United States, the Government approach to this question was fully outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement during the debate on a private member's motion in the House on 8 December 1987.  In the absence of a strong presence of Irish centres and other voluntary support organisations, as in Britain, the Minister's view was that the most practical help would be provided through an officer at the Consulate in New York.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant-aid to bodies providing welfare services abroad is only part of the Government's overall approach to alleviating problems associated with emigration. A major element of the Government's strategy is to discourage precipitate and ill planned emigration. To this end, FÁS endeavour to dissuade from emigrating those who do not have the skills, education, information and resources to give them a reasonable chance of success.  FÁS are also operating a comprehensive information and counselling service for people contemplating <Col N="2463" /> employment abroad.  This service, initiated in the National Manpower Service, includes a pre-departure information pack called &ldquo;Working Abroad&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether DION are effectively confined to Britain and that they have no role in relation to the Irish in America? Will he accept that in recent times a number of very active voluntary organisations have developed within the Irish community in America and that they are engaged in providing support for young Irish emigrants?  Some of those organisations deserve recognition.  In regard to the position of individual emigrants, has the Minister seen the reported views of the institute of Guidance Councillors that more could be done within the school system to ensure that people who are ill prepared do not emigrate?  Is he in a position to add anything to his remarks on an Adjournment debate on the views of Archbishop Clifford who has made suggestions in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">

The Minister for Foreign Affairs is working through the Consulate with the committee and he informed me it is operating satisfactorily.  In relation to my views expressed on an Adjournment debate last week, FÁS will examine some and the Department of Social Welfare <Col N="2464" /> will examine the others.  I have been primarily involved with DION who work with mostly Irish people living and working in Britain.  The organisation are working extremely effectively and will try to help people who are ill prepared for emigration.

      <P>Following the establishment of FÁS, I asked the new organisation to advise me within the next six months on how to rationalise the existing programmes and also how to improve the content and cost effectiveness of programmes.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that projects which have some type of commercial potential should be excluded from the regulations?  Will the Minister also agree that every effort should be made to find commercially viable jobs for people, no matter where these jobs are? It is not simply a matter of having off job creation to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  If a job happens to come <Col N="2465" /> along under a scheme which the Minister operates, he should welcome it.</P>

      <P>The present Teamwork scheme offers full time work for 12 months on community projects for those under 25 years of age.  If sponsors apply for approval, the project can be extended for a further year, if necessary.  However, it is written into the scheme that it must be non-commercial.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's remarks and, in the rationalisation of the new enterprise schemes, I am hopeful that we will have a scheme which will be far broader than the present one.  Discussions will be held with FÁS this week and, within about a month, we hope to have the schemes rationalised.  Indeed, they could be far more imaginative than some of the present schemes but I will have to wait to see the cost factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why do the regulations demand that the Teamwork scheme is non-profit making?  Sometimes schemes which appear to be non-profit making when they start can suddenly become commercially viable.  However, one cannot allow for that in the beginning and indeed in the enterprise scheme, one must be almost guaranteed commercial viability.  There is a grey area which should be exploited and we should not be hidebound by rules and regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some confusion.  Will the Minister not accept that the original restriction was to prevent commercial undertakings availing of State paid for labour and that there was never any restriction on a community group undertaking an activity in the hope or expectation that, later on, such activity might be commercially viable?  There have been a whole series of projects in <Col N="2466" /> different parts of the country which started as Teamwork programmes and then realised their full potential with the result that they are now on a commercial basis, to which there can be no possible objection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present 66 trade unions of workers operating here which hold negotiation licences granted by the Minister for Labour.  While the average membership of these unions is approximately 7,000 there are significant variations in the size of unions.  Of the 66 licensed unions, three have in excess of 20,000 members, eight have between 10,000 and 20,000 members, seven have between 5,000 and 10,000 members, 19 have between 2,000 and 5,000 members, ten have between 1,000 and 2,000 members and 19 have under 1,000 members.  There are a further nine worker trade unions operating here which are excepted bodies within the meaning of the Trade Union <Col N="2467" /> Acts and are so exempt from holding a negotiation licence.  The average membership of these unions is approximately 1,800.  The average membership of all worker trade unions is approximately 6,500.</P>
    <P>The number of trade unions, including excepted bodies, has declined slowly over the years.  Between 1970 and the present the number of such unions dropped from 95 to 75.  The Trade Union Act, 1975, facilitates amalgamations and transfers of engagements between unions by simplifying procedures and making grants available towards the costs involved.  Since the enactment of the legislation, grants amounting to £157,000 have been paid by my Department in respect of eight amalgamations or transfers of engagements.  I am disappointed that more trade unions have not availed of these grants.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> I am at present holding discussions with the social partners about industrial relations reform.  The object of this reform is to provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and so help to create conditions which will be conducive to employment generating investment.  I believe that trade union rationalisation can make an important contribution towards improvements in our system of industrial relations at both plant and national level.  In these discussions I have, therefore, put forward proposals to amend the Trade Union Act, 1971, in relation to the minimum requirements to be met for the granting of a negotiation licence.  I also appreciate that considerable costs can be incurred by trade unions in contemplation of amalgamations which may not occur.  This is especially true of larger unions.  Therefore, I have addressed this issue in the context of industrial relations reform discussions by proposing to extend the provisions for grant payments contained in the Trade Union Act, 1975, including allowing financial assistance for expenses <Col N="2468" /> incurred in a bona fide attempt at amalgamation, regardless of whether the amalgamation takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will make a statement on the Government's wishes in regard to the manner of the payment of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner of payment of wages is at present governed by the Payment of Wages Act, 1979 which amended the Truck Acts, 1831 to 1896, so as to enable employees engaged in manual labour who are covered by those Acts to be paid their wages, otherwise than in cash, where both those employees and their employers agree.</P>
      <P>It was considered at the time that the 1979 Act would facilitate a general move away from paying employees in cash and towards paying them by cashless means &mdash; cheque or credit transfer.</P>
      <P>This expectation, however, has not been realised to any great extent due to a number of factors.  The negotiation of new arrangements including provisions for time-off and other facilities for the cashing of cheques has proved difficult. apart from that there exists the facility to rescind a contract or agreement on payment of wages by non-cash means which gives employers who make a change in payment methods no security for the continuance of that method of payment.</P>
      <P>An additional factor to be taken into account has been the widespread concern in recent years at the incidence of armed robberies of payroll and social welfare cash and the desirability, accordingly, of securing a reduction in the amount of cash in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2469" /> A review of the 1979 Act was undertaken recently by my Department.  Arising from the review a number of proposals have emerged which I included in the discussion document published at the end of November last.  I am awaiting the views of interested parties, particularly the FUE and ICTU, on the various options outlined in the document.  When I have concluded my examination of these views I will consider what new measures might be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that, as a fair summary of what he has said, it has been the consistent policy of successive Governments to encourage the payment of wages other than by cash and that that was endorsed by the discussion document he published just a few weeks ago?  Will the Minister accept that that policy of encouraging payment of wages other than by cash has been dealt a body blow by the proposal in the budget for a £10 charge for banklink cards, pass cards and other cards?  Will the Minister accept that there is a total inconsistency between the documents he is publishing urging the payment of wages other than by cash and that of the Minister for Finance who taxes people who were trying to do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, having regard to the recent experience of the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee, he has satisfied himself that the standards and criteria employed by FÁS in regard to assessing tenders for courses run by FÁS external training division are entirely fair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My policy in relation to FÁS external contracts is that the educational system, including the VECs, should have a first option in relation to such contracts.  This policy was stated in the guidelines which my Department issued to FÁS earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The basis of FÁS sub-contracting to the educational system for 1987-88 was agreed by the Departments of Education and Labour and their agencies in November, 1987.  The main elements in the arrangements are:</P>
      <P>(i) measures to ensure educational authorities have the opportunity to tender for courses in which they are interested;</P>
      <P>(ii) special simplified provisions regarding the type of tender to be submitted by educational bodies</P>
      <P>(iii) automatic acceptance of a tender provided it meets FÁS requirements on quality, placement rates, cost effectiveness, including prices and delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements also provide for a mechanism for the resolution of any disagreements on its operation.  As regards the specific case of the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee, the contract was entered into by FÁS as part <Col N="2471" /> of their day-to-day activities.  I am sure that FÁS would be prepared to discuss the case with the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The policies and the conditions for FÁS sub-contracting to the educational system during 1988-89 will be reviewed later this year.  Any suggestions by the Deputy would be taken into account in that review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement to the effect that FÁS are now prepared to discuss this matter with me.  Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern in Cork, even among members of his own party, at the way those contracts were awarded?  Is the Minister aware that in a recent case the tenders submitted by the City of Cork VEC for external training courses were rejected on very dubious grounds?  Is the Minister aware that although the City of Cork VEC and I requested information about this we have failed to get any details to enable us to make a comparison or learn why the contracts were awarded to outside bodies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of the difficulties which the Cork VEC find themselves in.  There have been difficulties in that area for a number of years.  A former Minister of State arranged for co-operation and co-ordination between Education and the awarding of contracts by FÁS.  Those arrangements were changed last autumn. I suggest that if Cork VEC are not satisfied with the way those arrangements are working they should enter into discussions with FÁS.  The intention is that all training elements of contracts be given in the first instance to VECs and other State agencies for examination first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that in all cases public bodies who are responsible for education and training should be given priority in the allocation of those extra training courses?  Is the Minister aware that some of those who won the contracts against the City of Cork VEC approached the vocational <Col N="2472" /> educational committee for accommodation to hold the courses?  Is the Minister aware that a number of private individuals have made large sums of money from the FÁS external training courses while at the same time the VEC, another State agency whose primary role is education and training, are crippled by a lack of finance?  We heard about that last night.  We are talking about a substantial sum of money because some of those courses cost up to £250,000.  That is a lot of money to be taking out of the coffers of any education authority.  It could be put to good use locally.  VECs have the facilities and the expertise to run such courses.  Will the Minister undertake to make public the criteria employed by FÁS in assessing tenders and, secondly, ensure that the City of Cork VEC are given reasonable information, as they have sought, in relation to these cases?  I do not think they are asking for too much.</P>

The objective of granting first option to the education authorities is to get the maximum use of resources within the education and training systems, while at the same time meeting the requirements with regard to quality, cost effectiveness and delivery times.  If what the Deputy is saying is correct, the matter should be cleared up and he should talk to the senior people in FÁS.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the fact that each individual application for CERT training must now be accompanied by a fee of £10 per course <Col N="2474" /> that many CERT applicants are from low income families and will be deprived of training opportunities because they cannot afford to pay a £10 application fee for each and every course; that other third level applications bureaux, such as CAO and DIT, allow applicants a choice of courses; and if he will take steps to ensure that a more equitable system of applications is devised for CERT training.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 38 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>My policy in relation to CERT funding is that a greater proportion should be generated from non-Exchequer sources and CERT do not require my approval for introducing such charges nor did they at any stage inform me of their latest decisions.</P>
      <P>The £10 application fee has been introduced by CERT because of the high cost of its recruitment programme.  This will enable the recruitment programme to continue to be operated on a nation-wide basis with interviews being held in local centres throughout the country.  The one £10 payment entitles an applicant to be considered for a number of CERT's mainline programmes other than that for chef training, for which a separate fee of £10 must be paid.  There is no fee payable in respect of the programmes directed specifically at the unemployed.</P>
      <P>It is not CERT's intention that the fee should be a barrier to those who are genuinely interested but cannot afford to pay the fee.  The fee can be waived in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that we have discussed on several occasions the question of where funding for CERT might come from?  On each of those occasions a greater contribution from the hotel sector or the catering industry has been mentioned but there has never been a suggestion that the applicant for training should be expected to pay.  While the Minister has clarified the circumstances in which multiple payments can arise, it seems quite inequitous <Col N="2475" /> that anyone should have to pay more than one application fee to the same agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>CERT management in their wisdom saw the necessity.  They have a number of difficulties.  CERT have 7,000 applications annually for 1,200 vacancies.  There is an 11 per cent &ldquo;no show&rdquo; rate at interview and a 52 per cent non-acceptance rate at offer stage.  Apart from financial considerations, it is hoped that the application fee will improve the rate of serious applications for places. They are not charging this fee for courses for the unemployed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of the social employment and Teamwork schemes provide that initial approval for projects is given for a period of up to 52 weeks but sponsors may seek to renew a project for a <Col N="2476" /> further year.  Should the project still not be concluded sponsors may apply for an extension for a further year.  However projects of a continuing nature with no finite termination are not eligible under the schemes.</P>
    <P>No individual worker should be employed on either scheme for a period in excess of 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand what the Minister is saying about the period being initially 52 weeks with a possibility of renewal, I have in mind community-based projects which cannot be developed to the extent the scheme allows for within a period of one year. The Minister is saying that no individual can work beyond a 12-month period.  I would ask him seriously to consider making a differentiation between some social employment schemes which do not operate on a community development basis and those which do.  Could he clarify the aims of the social employment scheme?  In the case of community development projects the aim is not for the individuals on the scheme to be given a chance to go back into the workforce but rather to develop the community in which they are working.  There is a grey area here.  These workers begin to see that the real purpose of their work is to develop the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if I totally understand the Deputy.  Perhaps she is saying that when an application is being formulated the scheme should be geared towards a long-term community project rather than a 12-month project.

    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. D. Fitzpatrick Dr. D. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. D. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking earlier about the dental benefit scheme provided by the Department of Social Welfare for dependent spouses.  I noted that the Irish Dental Association have advised their members not to participate in the scheme.  I have been a practising dentist for 25 years and I know that mothers of families would deny themselves anything, including dental treatment, in order to provide for their own children.  The Minister extended the scheme to cover the dependent spouses of people in benefit.  Basically what he was doing was providing dental benefit for the wives of workers.  This was long overdue and it is a shame that the Irish Dental Association will not work the scheme.  The reason they have given for not doing so is that it would reduce their income from private practice, yet no figures have been produced to support this. Suppositions have been made but no hard facts have been produced to back it up. In fact you could argue that the opposite is the case in that it will increase the income from their practice because those who were outside the net will now be given for the first time a chance of availing of dental benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always regarded myself as being a member, as I hope my colleagues would also, of a caring profession.  We have a duty, and I do not want to sound too pompous about this, towards those people who will enter the scheme.  Dental education is probably the most expensive in this country and the money for this education comes from the taxpayer and out of the wages of many of those who will never see the inside of or who could never afford to send their children to a third level institution.  The least we can do as a profession is to return some of <Col N="2507" /> that largesse in kind to the wives and mothers of these people.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Irish Dental Association to expedite their negotiations with the Minister for Social Welfare with a view to providing the benefits of this scheme to the people concerned.  They will find the Minister's door open.  There may be some objections and some difficulties but in practice I have found these to be very few.  I will reiterate what I have said.  I urge the Irish Dental Association to continue their discussions with the Minister for Social Welfare and to make every effort to reach an amicable solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Until last year wives of insured workers could receive no dental benefit by way of their husbands' contributions but they were not the only ones to suffer.  I hope that over the next 12 months or, perhaps, in the next budget, the Minister will extend the scheme to include the children of insured workers.  This area has been badly neglected.  Children who leave primary school between the ages of 11 and 14 cease to be eligible for benefit unless their parents are medical card holders. The dental benefit scheme should cover children until the age of 18 or until they take up insured employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of much welcomed developments, and indeed not a few innovations, in this Bill for which I strongly commend the Minister. I can appreciate the extreme problems which faced the Minister in endeavouring to continue the policy of giving increases over and above the average to those on long term unemployment assistance.  When in Government I initiated this development and I am very pleased that the Minister has succeeded in continuing the substantial differential in favour of those on unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the single urban unemployment assistance rate of £4.20 per week, which is an increase of 11.11 per cent.  That is a substantial increase.  However, the new rate of £42 per week is by no manner or means a <Col N="2508" /> princely sum.  The current climate in society in very anti those in receipt of unemployment assistance and those on social welfare.  There has been a very major change in the climate in society, a very regressive, very selfish and very vicious change, but despite this there has been quite an exceptional increase this year for those on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The increase for a married couple on urban unemployment assistance at £5 per week is not as great.  It amounts to an increase of 7.69 per cent.  The old rate was £65 per week, the new rate will be £70.  Again, that increase is welcome as it is well over double the rate of inflation. I congratulate the Minister in what must have been a very difficult battle in Cabinet for securing an increase of that magnitude. The rural unemployment assistance rate has also been increased, by 11.2 per cent in the single rate and by 7.75 per cent in the rate for a married couple.  I was not successful in having those rates integrated because every time they were going to be integrated the Department of Finance naturally wanted to integrate them downwards whereas we wanted them to be integrated upwards or at least on a no-loss basis.  They should be integrated because the anomalies in the greater Dublin area are unacceptable and should be corrected.</P>
    <P>Our only disappointment in regard to this Bill, which has led us to the view that we should not support it, is that for the second year running there have been no increases in the child benefit scheme.  The real value of this scheme will now decline further.  There has been no change since 1986, the year I brought in this scheme under the relevant Social Welfare Act.  It is very significant that there has been no increase in child benefit.  A concerted effort is being made to take child benefit away from those on higher incomes. There are also repeated efforts to take away child benefit from the first child.  I am totally opposed to that suggestion.  As Deputies know, in this country we are quite exceptional in making payments for the first child.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is in favour of <Col N="2509" /> the general principle of the child benefit scheme but the failure to raise child benefit for the second year running is disappointing because it is a significant payment particularly for those on middle and lower incomes.  Another profoundly important point is that it is very often the only cash transfer to women.  The only income available to many women of upper and middle income groups is the child benefit. There are many selfish husbands who will not provide their spouses or their children with the needed income. These husbands come from all income groups and frequently they are persons of substantial means.  I well remember going into the office the Minister now occupies and meeting my colleague Deputy Frank Cluskey in 1974 in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada and he was adamant about the change that operates now. However, there are Right-wing monetarist individuals in society who once they go down the macho-cutting road just cannot stop and do not know where to stop.  They get into a frame of mind where they want to cut out child benefit for the first child and for those earning over £15,000 a year.  They appreciate there will be casualties but are unconcerned so long as they are saving money.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in discussions at Cabinet in relation to child benefit during the next 12 months to be adamant that we cannot have a third year, 1989, without child benefit being increased.  Had child benefit been increased, the rate of £15.05 which I brought in in 1986 would be £16.02 today on the basis of inflation at about 6.5 per cent.  Indeed, the rate for the sixth child would go up and should have gone up in this budget from £21.75 to £23.16.  The fact that it did not increase is a setback in terms of social transfers in our community.  There are 150,000 recipients of child benefit, mostly mothers who did not get the benefit of an increase.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to take a radical, hard look at the FIS scheme.  It is an excellent scheme and the only thing wrong with it is that it is being starved of resources in a stupid way.  Time and again I pointed out to the Government and <Col N="2510" /> to the Department of Finance officials concerned that one cannot operate an FIS scheme on the basis of an upper family income limit of £108 for family size one and £131 for family size two with a maximum weekly supplement payment of £16 and £23 respectively.  Those income limits should be rejigged.  It is ridiculous that only 5,500 families have effectively been eligible for the FIS.  If the scheme was rejigged with a reasonable income limit &mdash; an extra £4 million would make a big difference &mdash; and if it was effectively publicised, the take-up would be substantially more and it would be of great benefit to families where the spouses are at work but on low incomes.</P>
    <P>We should not congratulate ourselves because we have on the social welfare side given an increase of 11 per cent for the single person.  We must remember that for a married couple on unemployment assistance it is 7.69 per cent and not 11 per cent.  There is a fashionable statement that it is an 11 per cent increase for long term unemployed.  That is not true.  For a married couple it is 7.69 per cent in the urban area and 7.75 per cent in the rural area and for the single person it is 11 per cent.  If one were to take a husband and wife and five children currently receiving unemployment assistance, they get £107.09 per week.  If we add on the increase of 11 per cent for the husband, 3 per cent for the wife and 6 per cent for five child dependants, we get a total of £7.70 bringing the income up to £115.60 a week.  We must appreciate that with that increase the differential rent in that house is also changed.  Local authorities rigorously re-assess on the basis of increases and very often half of that 11 per cent increase is swallowed up in a revised differential rent.  The real increase is frequently not as much as might be thought at first.</P>
    <P>In relation to social insurance for the self-employed, we have an unsatisfactory situation.  The Department of Social Welfare wanted to follow a particular line and a particular scheme.  It is not unreasonable to say that the Minister's views did not necessarily prevail.  The National Pensions Board wanted to <Col N="2511" /> follow a particular line and it is also acknowledged that the views of the National Pensions Board did not prevail. The Taoiseach decided on the day of the signing of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to follow a particular line and a fudge prevailed whereby the IFA got agreement from the Taoiseach that the assessable income would be net income and then the mess started between Revenue, the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Social Welfare and the overall assessments.  One of the things which emerged from the mess was the statement by the Minister for Finance who could not make up his mind as to whether he would go full blooded for it or half blooded for it.  He eventually said he would get in £15 million out of 3 per cent in the Budget Statement and that became an accepted figure.  Now it appears on close examination that the yield will be substantially more and meanwhile we are left up in the air as to how the revenue calculations were made. I must ask the Minister about that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up my half hour because I have agreed to share with my colleague, Deputy Barnes, who wishes to contribute.  We have agreed to split the half hour between us.  Our Wexford colleague will be in as well.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister how many assisting relatives are out of this scheme.  How many of them are not in?  How many persons in receipt of unemployment assistance are not in?  We know 15,500 smallholders are not in.  How many others are not in?  Persons with incomes below a minimum amount to be prescribed, which the Minister is taking as £2,500 a year, do not have to pay this 3 per cent. How many of them are there?  We need that information for an assessment of what is happening.  Employees or persons in receipt of an occupational pension whose only income under Schedule D of income tax is unearned income are excluded, exempted from the new PRSI scheme.  How many of them are there? How many employed contributors who are insured at modified rates are there now?  In Government we had various <Col N="2512" /> figures but they have been declared redundant and messed around with so much that we need that information as well.</P>
    <P>How many of the 240,000 people who are being brought in under PRSI are going to be paid?  For the sake of argument, if one divides £15 million between 240,000 people it works out at something like £1 a week, but that is not a correct calculation.  Therefore, let us have the full breakdown from the Minister as to how the Revenue Commissioners came up with those calculations.  Only then can we have some real information about this PRSI scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is going to spend £6 million in the fifth year.  Getting in all this money now, he will spend £6 million in year five, £21 million in year ten, £73 million in year 20, £99 million in year 30 and £89 million in year 50.  I ask the Minister to give us a breakdown of that £6 million in year five.  Who is going to get it?  Is that survivor benefits in year five?  Presumably there are no pensions because he is not going to start paying pensions until year ten.  We are entitled to know.  How many people will be getting that £6 million in five years time? What will the average payment be?  How was the actuarial assessment made?</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that it is no secret why our party were hostile to all this.  We might well have voted for the Bill but we did not know what the Fianna Fáil Party were up to and Deputy Michael Bell was in a particularly difficult situation as our spokesperson in recent weeks trying to find out what exactly was going on, because the Minister disclosed that data only yesterday.  Our party were gravely concerned that the overall PRSI situation for the self-employed was being badly fudged by the Taoiseach trying to placate the IFA and the Minister for Finance pretending that really he was not going to hit them too hard; now it appears he is going to take a great deal of money from them.  Therefore, we should know from the Minister what is in mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I want to make on the social welfare scheme.  I <Col N="2513" /> would like to see an urgent revision of the FIS into a real scheme and a very urgent decision on the part of the Government that next year there will be no messing around with child benefit.  It would be disgraceful if the scheme was effectively let fade out of existence.  Also the Minister needs to make a policy statement in the near future on disability benefit. There has been a great deal of uncertainty about the future of disability benefit.  The employers were due to take over the first 13 weeks of an employee's input and then the Government presumably would refund the employers the appropriate amount.  That now seems to be discarded.  I am not quite certain what kind of departmental or interdepartmental inter-Revenue, FUE, ICTU&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a great need to indicate to the House what exactly is the intention of the Government in relation to the payment of disability benefit and the transferring of that responsibility to employers.  We need to know that and anyway I presume nothing will happen until the 1989 Social Welfare Bill is introduced because all the indications are that it is, so to speak, on the back burner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the National Pensions Board &mdash; which I was very pleased to set up &mdash; for the work they have done in this area.  It has been very difficult work.  I commend them for the reports they have published in the past 12 months.  I commend the officers, staff, secretary and accounting officer of the Department of <Col N="2514" /> Social Welfare for the manner in which they have delivered the social welfare services in the past 12 months.  Their work is very onerous and difficult and there are a great many stupid misconceptions within the body politic about that work. We have allegations of fraud when the extent of fraud is marginal within the system.  We have politicians who are prepared to climb on any band wagon for cheap publicity, to climb on the backs of unemployed people, people who are in receipt of unmarried mother's allowance, those who are out sick and in need of basic social welfare income, to get their names in the paper and a bit of cheap publicity.  We must control that in this House.  I commend the staff of the Department of Social Welfare who frequently work in appallingly difficult conditions, particularly in many of the social welfare offices outside Dublin and in many parts of Dublin where the prospect of having even a basic interview with a member of the public about unemployment is almost nonexistent because of the cramped conditions.  I urge the Deputies who are so preoccupied with social expenditure to go round the employment exchanges for a morning and see the conditions in which the staff have to work there.</P>
    <P>Finally, I commend the Minister himself. He had one great virtue and one great advantage coming into the Department of Social Welfare: he was there previously so he knew what to expect. I commend him for having fought off successfully some of the more vicious cuts proposed during the year.  I do not agree with him increasing basic income contributions of people who have paid their contributions, but he fought quite an effective battle in regard to that.  I hope that in the next 12 months &mdash; the odds are that he will be there for the next 12 months despite all the uncertainty &mdash; he will succeed in preserving social welfare and the benefits.</P>
    <P>I give the balance of my time to my colleague, Deputy Monica Barnes, by agreement.</P>

      <P>I will co-operate.  Since I am of a generous nature I will be prepared to give Deputy Barnes some of my time, because if we go on arguing neither of us will get to speak.</P>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill as being the most comprehensive social welfare legislation brought before the Dáil for many years.  It contains a number of significant developmental measures which will put in place many of the aspects of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I would like to compliment the Minister for his courage in achieving this.  Times are difficult and money is short, but the Minister has looked after the most vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the provision of a special 11 per cent increase in the personal rate of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance and the 6 per cent increase in the rates for dependent children.  These increases represent a major move towards raising these payments to a more realistic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be recognised that old age pensioners are very vulnerable, particularly those who live alone in remote rural areas and who for many weeks at a time, since the postman is now gone, do not see any human being.  Even in the supposedly prosperous county of Wexford there are <Col N="2516" /> some instance of old age pensioners living alone with no electricity, running water or services in this day and age.  We should be very conscious of that fact.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of farmers making over their property to sons, it has been implied here on many occasions that this is done for the purpose of defrauding the State.  In many instances farmers make over their property to their sons, but it is not to defraud the State or make themselves better off.  There is an advantage in farmers making over their property because they are probably too old and if the land is in the hands of younger people we will have a better nation and more income.  Let us move in that direction and have less of this farmer bashing.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned about the attitude of some people.  There is a level of ignorance on each side as regards the other community.  There is farmer bashing on the one side and PAYE bashing on the other.  Somebody somewhere has to do a small bit of educating of both sides.</P>
    <P>I would like to particularly welcome the courage of the Minister in his efforts to combat social welfare fraud.  This is rampant in rural Ireland, and all of us know it.  The gardaí at the stations where these people sign on are well aware of it and the gardaí, believe it or not, spend some 2,000 hours per week on this work. These people are professionally trained to maintain law and order, yet they are engaged in sitting down with these people while almost anybody could do this work. It is sad that people who are needed on the beat, who are needed for the job for which they were trained, are not doing it.</P>
    <P>To get back to social welfare fraud, people who are working and drawing social welfare benefits of one kind or another are far better off than people who are working legitimately.  In almost 100 per cent of instances those working and drawing benefit have medical cards, cheap housing, pay no income tax, do nixers which bring in substantial amounts of money, get educational grants, free books and free fuel.  Many have so much work they have to refuse jobs.  If we are <Col N="2517" /> serious we will tackle this problem.  The person working legitimately has to pay tax, more rent; he has no medical card, no drugs card, gets no educational grants, no free books or free fuel.  There is a definite disincentive for people to work legitimately.  Somebody said to me that he watched his neighbour work and draw benefit for years and that one frosty morning when he was about to get up for work he felt like lying on.  If our system is creating that kind of climate, shame on us.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on having the courage to tackle this terrible activity in our community.  I ask him to carry on and try to root out this terrible evil.  Lest anyone think I am trying to get publicity on the backs of unfortunate people, let me tell the House I know that people who are abusing the system are bringing home twice as much as those who are working legitimately.</P>
    <P>I promised Deputy Barnes I would allow her in and I intend to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hugh Byrne for giving me these five minutes and Deputy Barry Desmond for sharing part of his time with me.  I will use the few minutes left to me to give the Minister an agenda of work for the year.</P>
      <P>Before I do I would like to welcome the initiative of the Minister in increasing the scope of the educational opportunities scheme and making more flexible the whole area of social welfare with regard to the long term unemployed.  I would like to see this extended so that there will be no penalty whatsoever on people who are unemployed and want to extend their education or their voluntary contribution in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that older long term unemployed people will be given a choice and will not have to continually sign on the live register.  Also to be welcomed are the measures taken to get rid of the anomalies whereby people found themselves paying more because they were in the wrong time zone and found themselves ineligible for a pension.  I am glad to see that the Minister will be making sure that people who have paid <Col N="2518" /> more over a longer period and have a greater number of contributions as a result of that will qualify for such pension.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to what I would like the Minister and his Department to address themselves to.  First, following on Deputy Desmond's treatment of the importance of child benefit and the children's allowance, the psychological benefit and small economic independence it gives to spouses in the home cannot be emphasised enough.  I heard an interview the other morning with a husband who has taken on the parenting role in the home who expressed his satisfaction and pleasure at being able to go down to the post office at the end of the month and get into his hand the only real cash acknowledgement for this work.  He absolutely identified with all the mothers throughout Ireland who felt that this was one of the most important payments, not great in financial value but certainly in psychological value, for that kind of work.  The more experience men get of women's experience, the greater and more integrated and human our programme will be.</P>
    <P>I must, in the minute or two that is left to me, express my huge disappointment that from January 1988 new claimants to disability benefit who are receiving a widow's pension, deserted wife's payment, unmarried mother's allowance or prisoner's wife's allowance will not be entitled to receive half-rate disability benefit.  I know the Minister will appreciate that these people are among the most vulnerable in society and are probably parenting in most exceptional circumstances without the support of a partner or a bread winner.  If that money is going to be denied them, some other support will have to be given to them. Once again, I reiterate the strong request that a deserted husband who chooses to stay at home and look after his children in the home should be eligible, as is a woman, for deserted spouse's allowance. This is an area of discrimination which cannot be allowed continue in terms of the importance we give to the value of a parent in the home.  The illumination of such discrimination would encourage <Col N="2519" /> husbands who find themselves in this position to take on such a role.  The other area I would like the Minister to respond to is on the progress we are making with regard to giving paid paternity leave to a husband who wishes to help out with the family.  This is accepted in other countries and it is scandalous that it has not been introduced in this country yet.</P>
    <P>Every time I speak on social welfare I end by saying that our whole aim and objective within the reforming of the system must be to work towards a minimum basic wage for everybody.  That would take away the stigma of being unemployed and of the other labels we have put on people and would enable us to allow everybody to contribute, both in a voluntary and a paid capacity, with pride and independence.  It would also eliminate the wasteful administration that exists at present.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies on both sides of the House who have contributed enormously to this debate.  Social welfare debates, particularly in recent times, have been very full debates with a great amount of analysis and questioning and many new ideas have been put forward. In that sense the people are being very well served by both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major change in the Bill is the introduction of social security arrangements for the self-employed.  It has been suggested that this measure is being rushed in or that we should withdraw the proposals and think more about them or, as Deputy MacDowell suggested, that we should have a Green Paper or a White Paper.  I would remind Deputies that in 1976 we had a Green Paper dealing with a national income-related pension scheme, that in 1978 we had a Green Paper entitled, Social Insurance for the Self-Employed, and that in 1982 I prepared a draft White Paper entitled, The National Pension Scheme, which I left on the desk when we left office in 1982.  A great amount of the detailed work for that <Col N="2520" /> paper was carried out by consultants and by the Department.  I accept that more consideration and more work was to be done on that matter.</P>
    <P>When we returned to office in 1987 we set about following up on the work we had been doing in this area.  The Government decided in July to go ahead with social insurance for the self employed.  In January 1988 we had a detailed report from the National Pensions Board, a very detailed and exacting study carried out by the best experts and actuaries in this country.  That is acknowledged by all sides and it is important that Members in the House recognise that fact.  We accept the legitimacy and the authenticity of the National Pensions Board report and of the actuarial studies in that report.  It is very valuable to us in our work at present.</P>
    <P>In January the Government made a final decision to introduce the measure and we are now bringing it before the Dáil and Seanad so that it can come into effect in April.  Obviously, even with its coming into effect in April, there is a time lag in its implementation.  As Deputies will know, with any new scheme or any budget you have to remember what the full year effect will be as distinct from the effect in the initial year from the time the measure comes into being.  There has been nothing precipitate about this whole process.  It has involved an enormous amount of consideration.  There is no basis for withdrawing it to consider it further.  What is now required is the political will to do something about it.  We can go on cogitating endlessly, and there may be those who would prefer that we did cogitate endlessly and did not take action, but we have decided to take action.  We are quite happy about the factual position and that is why we are now going ahead with this measure.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board calculated the additional cost on an actuarial basis, over a 50-year period, of providing contributory old age and widows' pensions to the self-employed, over and above the cost of continuing the present arrangements.  The cost implications are the principal implications.  There is no doubt about the actuaries' figures.  These <Col N="2521" /> are accepted and not queried.  Even the economists outside who talk about this whole area take those figures as being factual and any cross checking they have done has shown them to be correct.  It is on the income side that we have questions and arguments.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about the costs.  Deputy Desmond raised a question about figures. If Deputy Desmond wants me to explain the actuarial basis to him here I will certainly do what I can to explain it on Committee Stage.  As the Deputy knows, the people dealing with this matter are very specialised people and an enormous amount of consideration is given to these figures.  I accept the actuarial studies done by the people who are expert in that area.  Deputy Desmond mentioned that in year five it would be principally survivors' benefits that would be involved and of course that is true but there could be a small number of pensions involved, for example, if someone had stamps previously those would also be taken into consideration.  At year five the cost would be £6 million; at year ten, £21 million; year 15, £54 million; at year 20, £73 million; at year 20, £73 million; at year 40, £99 million and at year 50, £89 million. These are the costs over and above the present arrangements.  They are as factual as they can be and nobody will be able to improve on them.</P>
    <P>The question therfore arises on the income side.  We can have much discussion on what the income might be. The estimates of income have had to be revised to take account of the broader definition of income proposed by the Government.  Deputy Desmond seems to have missed that point, that the definition of income which the Government are using is a broader definition of income than any of the definitions used previously and broader than the definition used by the National Pensions Board.  It includes unearned income.  I might add that this was following consultation with the Revenue Commissioners because a lot of work had to be done between the publication of this report and the preparation of the figures for this year's budget and this Bill. <Col N="2522" /> It will be seen that we are no longer talking aobut theoretical incomes.  We are talking about income as assessed by the Revenue Commissioners who have all that information at their fingertips.  I want to make it clear that we are using a broader definition.  That is being done in part at least to take account of the fact that a collection rate of 100 per cent would be unrealistic.  We know and I think everybody accepts that but, for the purpose of their exercise, the National Pensions Board used a 100 per cent collection rate.  It is up to those who want to make assumptions to make appropriate assumptions.  Of course another factor enters in, in that the ceiling is now higher than that they were using.  They were using a ceiling of £15,500 which is now £16,000 and which would affect the overall picture to a lesser extent than unearned income.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have estimated that, on a conservative basis, the actual yield from a 5 per cent contribution on the broader income base would amount to £45 million annually.  In addition, the yield from the £2 minimum contribution has been estimated at £5 million in a full year.  That is what gives us the total of £50 million.  I should repeat that the yield will be £45 million on the straight 5 per cent basis and then the flat rate of £2 when fully operational will yield the other £5 million.</P>
    <P>That was one aspect missed by some of the economic commentators when they were calculating on the basis of this year's figures.  I should add that the budget figure this year does not include any of the £2 flat rate contributions.  We will be proceeding to collect some of those but they were not taken into the calculations this year.  The scheme has to be established and all of its participants registered which will take some little time.  We can talk about that at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>

We are not talking any longer about the National Pensions Board.  We are now talking about the Revenue Commissioners, the people who do the work, who know what they are talking about. They are not talking about percentages here, they are saying what will actually be collected, and they are conservative estimates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way, that is an important question because even those collection rates would be improved by the new method of collecting tax.  I shall come to collection in a moment.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the question of review of the scheme.  It is accepted that in the longer term it may be necessary to increase the rate of contribution under the provisions of the scheme.  The provisions of the Bill specifically provide for a review of the scheme's financing to be carried out before the end of the third year of its operations.  What the Government have done is entirely reasonable. We have arranged for a phased contribution, rising to a figure of 5 per cent which appears reasonable and the provisions of the Bill allow for a review of the whole question at the end of the three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the most practical way to go about it.  There is reasonable evidence to suggest that the income base may actually be larger than is conservatively estimated. If that proves to be the case, then there will be no need for any increase in the contribution rate.  However, I reiterate that the whole question must be reviewed at the end of the third year.  The Government are confident, however, that with the major improvements in the <Col N="2524" /> income tax collection system being introduced in practice the actual contribution yield will be higher than forecast.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have referred to the figure of £14 million quoted in the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance as the yield in 1988 from a 3 per cent contribution.  This would be the yield up to 31 December 1988 which would, in practice, represent slightly over 50 per cent of income for the full year.  Therefore, the figure of £14 million should be grossed up to £27 million on a full year basis.  One commentator recently, who has been widely publicised, grossed the figure up to £18.7 million and concluded, wrongly, on that basis that there would be a significant loss to the Exchequer from the operations of the scheme, sending everybody off on this false trail.  On that basis &mdash; and he has published this information &mdash; he assumed that the income from a 5 per cent contribution would be £31 million, calculating from that initial error.  If anybody likes to sit down with me I will explain it to them any time, and the commentator in question, when I will show him just exactly where he went wrong.  That figure should be £50 million and that is where the error arises.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell came back and quoted that former figure today.  I should have thought he would have checked it because I know he is somebody who checks his brief fairly well and I would have assumed that he might have done so in this case also.  Perhaps after this explanation he may understand the position somewhat better.  Therefore, on the effective actual income base the Revenue Commissioners are using, the 5 per cent contribution, plus the flat-rate of £2, will yield £50 million.  The Government are quite confident that the actual yield will be greater because of a variety of factors I have mentioned already.</P>
    <P>The system of collection of tax, PRSI, health charges and the levy is being revolutionised. This is being done by combining tax and PRSI collection and by the introduction of self-assessment.  It will be seen that we are facing a totally new tax collection system.  This is one of the most important things being done at present <Col N="2525" /> because the health and PRSI charges were always left behind when the collection of the main bulk of taxation was being preceded with.  Self-assessment and the combination of tax and PRSI collection will improve the collection process enormously.  I fear members are missing the impact of this change. Accountants tell me again and again it breaks their hearts to have to go into court for the big sum, knowing the other remains outstanding but, because it may amount to £5,000 or thereabouts, it may never be collected; they are not collected together.  The two processes are separate and, consequently, the remainder is never pursued.  It will be pursued now which will make a big difference to the collection.</P>
    <P>The collection of health contributions and the employment and training levy have always been regarded as deficient by the Revenue Commissioners.  The principal reason for this has been the Revenue Commissioners' practice of deploying resources towards collection and enforcement of the various taxes in a way which reflects the scale of the arrears in the context of all arrears.  As a consequence, the present collection rate is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In order to avoid similar problems in the collection of social insurance from the self-employed and to improve collection generally, the Revenue Commissioners have decided to introduce an integrated collection system combining tax, social insurance, health contributions and the employment and training levy for collection purposes.  The necessary distinction as between the charges for tax and contributions/levy will be provided for within the assessment process but no distinction will be drawn within the collection and enforcement documents and procedures.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed new arrangements for tax returns and assessments, an inspector of taxes will issue an estimate of liability in the period July-August.  The single sum specified in this Estimate will include tax, social insurance, health contributions and employment and training levy.  It will not be open to the taxpayer <Col N="2526" /> to appeal this estimate as he may displace the estimate at any time by making his own estimate and paying his liability on that basis.</P>
    <P>If the taxpayer does not make his own estimate, the inspector's estimate will be referred for collection and where this is not paid by 1 November, interest will be charged at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month.  Where the taxpayer does make and pay his own estimate, the amount paid must be not less than 90 per cent of the liability ultimately found to be due; otherwise interest will be charged on the shortfall, again at the rate of 1.25 per cent per month.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers, in accordance with existing requirment, must make a return of income not later than 31 December. Where this is not done, the taxpayer will be liable for a surcharge equal to 10 per cent of his annual liability.</P>
    <P>The current collection rate for health contributions and employment and training levy is of no relevance in the context of collection of social insurance in view of the commissioners' plans to integrate collection of social insurance, and the health contribution and employment and training levy, with the Schedule D tax. Apart from achieving a more realistic collection rate for social insurance, these proposals will result in very considerable improvements in the collection rate for the health contribution and employment levy.  Furthermore, the Government's plans for the move to self-assessment will improve collection of the Schedule D tax which will henceforth include the various contributions and levy.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the new scheme will be abused by persons who will evade payment of social insurance contrbutions and seek to qualify for contributory pensions on the basis of contributions paid over the minimum period of ten years in the latter part of their working lives.  This will not happen.  In order to qualify for contributory pension, the claimant is required to have a minimum yearly average number of contributions calculated from the date on which he first entered insurance.</P>
    <P>In the case of a self-employed person <Col N="2527" /> that is the beginning of the first contribution year in which he has reckonable income or reckonable emoluments regardless of whether the contributions payable have in fact been paid.  This is provided for in subsection 17A of section 11 of the Bill.  This means that the yearly average number of contributions required for entitlement to pension in the case of a person who succeeds in evading payment will be diluted by the period in respect of which those contributions were not paid.  Furthermore, the defaulter would still be liable for all arrears, together with interest on late payment and the surcharge on the late submission of returns of income.  It will be in the interests of all self-employed persons, therefore, to ensure that they do not remain outside the system and that their tax affairs are kept up to date.  Various Deputies suggested that the collection system is not adequate.  That is recognised and is being very dramatically improved.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies questioned the fact that persons who would not be entitled to a non-contributory pension will now become entitled to a contributory pension. The suggestion is that persons with other income or means should not get a pension, even a contributory one.  Under the present arrangements for pensions for employees, a similar situation can arise.  Persons with occupational pensions can receive contributory pensions and their occupational pension does not in any way affect their social welfare pension. It would clearly be inequitable to have one rule for the self-employed and a different one for the employed population.</P>
    <P>The basis of the proposals is the integration of social insurance for the self-employed with the existing system.  To move to a situation where all pensions would be means tested or limited in some way because of other income would be a major departure from the present system and a retrograde step in the development of the social welfare system and in removing the stigma that is often associated with means tested schemes.  The proposal <Col N="2528" /> for pensions based on contributions implies a basic level of protection as a right and without a means test.  We are probably the only country in Europe which does not have a basic pension without means test for self-employed people, so at the end of the day what we are doing is not that extraordinary.  We are really only doing something now which most other self-employed members of the Community who have introduced a basic level of cover for themselves have already done.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of a disincentive to transfer farms by reason of the fact that entitlement to pension will not depend on the farm being transferred.  The National Pensions Board had considerable discussion on a retirement condition for the self-employed. It is clear that there was disagreement on this issue within the board. Interestingly enough, the minority report of one of the farming organisations represented on the board, that is the ICMSA, come out very strongly against the idea of a requirement on farmers under the scheme to transfer their farms. The board did not come to a final conclusion on this question and recommended that for the present the extension of pensions to the self-employed should be on the same basis as employees, that is a pension without a means test from age 66.  However, the board will be examining the question of a retirement condition for employees and the self-employed and will be reporting on this matter.</P>
    <P>However, this question should not delay the introduction of the new scheme.  Pensions will not generally be paid under the scheme for ten years and any proposals which may be devised by the pensions board in relation to the question of a retirement condition can be implemented if considered necessary or desirable within that time scale.  Therefore, it is not a question of the Government having decided not to have a retirement condition but rather leaving the question and precise form of any retirement condition that might be proposed to be determined in the light of the <Col N="2529" /> forthcoming report of the board and to be determined in relation to both employees and the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell raised the question of the powers given to the Minister by way of regulations.  The regulatory powers contained in the Bill can be divided into two broad categories; those which empower the Minister to vary certain provisions contained in the Bill and those dealing with certain administrative matters.  The first category includes the power to vary the earning ceiling up to which contributions will be payable, to vary the rate of contributions, to add to the list of accepted self-employed contributors and to include among self-employed contributors any of the classes of persons so excepted.</P>
    <P>However, in all instances the Bill provides that these regulations will require a motion of approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Furthermore, similar powers already exist in relation to persons insurable as employees.  The remaining regulatory powers contained in the Bill deal with administrative matters such as the time and manner of payment of <Col N="2530" /> self-employment contributions and other related matters, the time and manner of payment of voluntary contributions by persons who cease to be self-employed contributors and the determination of contributions payable by persons who are both employed and self-employed in a particular year.  These regulations will deal with technical and, in some instances, very complex administrative matters and it would be inappropriate to include provisions of this nature in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many other aspects were raised.  There was very genuine support on all sides of the House for the provisions in the Bill. I would like to thank Deputies for their warm welcome and support for these measures.  In relation to the major change taking place in the Bill, I hope that I have helped Deputies to understand that this scheme is a very valuable and well thought out one.  There will never be a time when it will be thought out better. This is the opportunity to go ahead with the new PRSI scheme for the self-employed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Barrett gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment problems appertaining at St. Brigid's school, Cornelscourt. The Deputies have nine minutes and the Minister has five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me time on the Adjournment to raise this matter.  I am doing so on behalf of the five Deputies in the constituency and it is my intention to share my time with them.</P>
      <P>I have grave concern regarding St. Brigid's school and the totally unacceptable accommodation available at present for boys and girls.  Admittedly, the girls will be transferred to a new 12-class room be transferred to a new 12-class room building at Cabinteely Park next September but the boys will be left with six classrooms in the permanent building which was built in 1914.  Eight classrooms have to be accommodated in prefabricated buildings, dating back to the late sixties and early seventies.  Because of their age, these buildings are now in a deplorable and dangerous condition and are totally unsuitable for the purposes for which they are used.  On Tuesday, 9 February, the wall of one of the classrooms collapsed and another had to be propped up as it, too, was about to collapse into a classroom.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there will be 460 boys in the school next September and it is totally improper, particularly from a safety point of view, to expect them to be taught in the conditions that currently exist.  We are very fortunate to have a dedicated group of teachers in St. Brigid's because no other group of employees would tolerate the conditions under which they have to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2533" /> I ask the Minister to give me and my fellow Deputies from the constituency of Dún Laoghaire an assurance that he will give an immediate go-ahead for the construction of phase 2 of the school at Cabinteely Park and that work should commence immediately.  I hope that phase 2 will consist of at least 12 classrooms.  Pending the completion of phase 2, immediate negotiations should commence with the board of management in regard to replacing the dangerous prefabricated buildings which should be replaced by others in good repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Barrett for allowing me a few minutes in which to speak.  I support what Deputy Barrett said and I ask the Minister for Education to meet the headmaster, Mr. Donald O'Meara and the parents and teachers as we have been seeking such a meeting for some time.  I know the response will be positive.</P>
      <P>In relation to the school, there was a meeting with the public representatives and I also had a meeting with Mr. O'Meara and one of the parents.  To say the very least, the school is literally rotting. As Deputy Barrett said, a number of walls have fallen in.  If the big storm of the night of 9 February had occurred during the daytime, we would be talking about something else today.</P>
      <P>The school is in a very dangerous condition and we, as public representatives in the area, are asking that it be replaced as a matter of some urgency.  Some 460 boys are supposed to be educated in the school from next September and, in those circumstances, one can appreciate the urgency.  Like other Deputies, I have had the pleasure of knowing the teachers in the school over the years and they are first class.  I should like to pay a tribute to them and to the parents for their forbearance and patience in regard to the conditions in which their young children are educated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish strongly to be associated with my colleagues in regard to this issue.  I visited the school and, with my colleagues, met the parents and teachers.  We await with great anxiety <Col N="2534" /> and interest the reply from the Minister of State on this question.  It is of the utmost urgency that progress should be made in regard to the defects in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues in the appeal to the Minister about this school.  All Deputies from the constituency are concerned about the damage caused to it.  We attended a meeting of the teachers and were also present at a packed meeting of parents.  Many of those parents, because of the condition of the school, are concerned about the safety of their children when in the building. I am sure the Minister agrees that that is not the way we would wish our primary education system to be viewed. The teachers emphasise that the young population in that area is rising, unlike in other parts of the constituency, and that the catchment area for the school is very large.  There will continue to be a need for a big school there.  I hope the Minister can respond positively and urgently to our request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department on 12 February received notification from the chairman of St. Brigid's boys' national school, Foxrock, Dublin 18 to the effect that there had been a collapse of the panels of a number of prefabricated classrooms in use by the school.  The chairman stated that an examination of the classrooms revealed serious decay, which rendered the structures completely unstable and consequently unsafe for occupation.  The school authorities decided to close four classrooms indefinitely and requested an immediate meeting with senior officials of my Department to consider the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two schools in Foxrock serving the community in question, a boys' school with 13 teachers, not including the principal, and a girls' school with 11 teachers, not including the principal. There are also two remedial teachers. There are eight classrooms of traditional construction in the complex, and the balance of the classrooms are of prefabricated construction.  The Deputies <Col N="2535" /> may be aware that at present, with grant-aid from my Department, a new 12-class-room permanent building is under construction, and this will replace the prefabricated classrooms.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will also be aware that a severe storm took place on the day of the reported collapse of the prefab panels.  It would be a matter in the first instance for the school authorities to take action in securing the safety of the pupils attending the schools, and to attend to the necessary repairs.  While this aspect of the matter was not mentioned by the chairman in the course of his written notification to my Department, it would be usual for the school authorities where storm-damage is concerned to consult with their insurers about the recovery of the cost of repairing storm-damage.</P>
    <P>My Department have responded to the chairman's notification by asking their local professional architecural advisers to inspect the damage and to make recommendations as to what work should be undertaken in order to put the prefabricated classrooms in serviceable condition. I understand that a building inspector recently visited the site and that his report will shortly be submitted.  This report will contain an estimate of the cost of necessary work, and following its receipt there will be consultations with the chairman as to the procedures necessary to restore the normal functioning of the school.  I am asking that a senior official of my Department's primary buildings branch will attend to this matter at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned earlier, a new 12-classroom school building is under construction and this is expected to be ready about September next.  It will replace the prefabricated classrooms which can then be phased out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has read out is not exactly accurate.  I understand that 160 pupils will remain in the old school, a six-classroom building.  It is not possible to accommodate 460 boys in six or eight classrooms.  Will the Minister accept it is not possible to repair prefabs if the walls are falling?  As Deputy Andrews said, those walls are rotten.  Prefab buildings <Col N="2536" /> have a lifespan of 12 or 14 years and the prefab buildings at Cornelscourt are almost 27 years old.  To tell us that it will be possible to carry out repairs, or get an insurance company to cover the buildings against storm damage, is wishing too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal concern in discussions within the council has been the promotion of measures to create employment and reduce unemployment.  I have pressed for priority to be given by the council to such measures and, in particular, to the adoption of an action programme providing for more Community resources to tackle long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>My other main concern has been to press for enlargement in the resources of the European Social Fund and for improvements in the benefits of the fund to the less developed Community regions, including Ireland.  The negotiations on this issue have, however, taken place as part of the negotiations in relation to the reform of the Structural Funds in the General Affairs Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the other matters decided by the Social Affairs Council during my term as Minister for Labour have been a decision concerning an action programme for the vocational training of young people and their preparation for adult and working life, a resolution on safety, hygiene and health at work and, finally, agreement on a common position on an <Col N="2478" /> amended proposal for a directive on the protection of workers through the barring of certain specified agents and/or work activities.  In discussions on these matters, I have ensured that Ireland's interests were made known and taken into account in the decisions reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of industrial relations was raised in the course of the discussions on the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Because of the complex and sensitive nature of industrial relations reform it was agreed that this matter should be dealt with in direct discussions between my Department, the FUE and the ICTU, and an appropriate paragraph covering this arrangement was included in the programme. No commitments were given to either side on any issue.  The relevant paragraph of the programme states:</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour will hold discussions with the Social Partners about changes in industrial relations which would provide a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement and help to create conditions for employment-generating investment.  It will be the aim of the parties to the Programme to conclude these discussions as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I have met both the FUE and the ICTU and outlined what seems to me to be the most practical approach to the whole area of industrial relations and trade dispute law reform, including the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.</P>

    <P>Discussions are continuing at official level.  I have asked that these discussions be completed by the end of April.  At that <Col N="2479" /> stage, in the light of the views expressed, I will prepare a package of proposals for Government approval and I would hope to introduce legislation in the autumn.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour in relation to emigration and DÍON, the present composition of DÍON; its terms of reference, the date of its establishment; the number of location of meetings held since 1 January 1987; whether it produces reports; if so, whether such reports are published and available to Members of the Oireachtas; the amount of funds granted to and expended by DÍON each year since its establishment; and the recipient of each grant over £10,000 since 1 January 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 34 together and to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the particulars requested in Question No. 34 on the establishment, terms of reference, composition, number and location of DÍON meetings and grants for emigrant services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach to emigration is twofold.  Firstly we are endeavouring to provide, on a national basis, a proper pre-departure advisory service for persons contemplating seeking work abroad.  This service is aimed at helping such persons make an informed decision and to counter and discourage precipitate and ill-planned emigration.  Secondly, we are providing financial assistance to voluntary organisations which offer reception facilities for newly-arrived <Col N="2480" /> emigrants, particularly those who experience difficulty in coping with their new surroundings.</P>
    <P>At home, the National Manpower Service, which is now part of FÁS, has developed an extensive information and counselling service for intending emigrants. The service includes a very useful pre-departure information pack entitled &ldquo;Working Abroad&rdquo; giving information on conditions in other countries.  FÁS are best equipped, through their national network of offices, to advise on job opportunities, training and employment schemes available at home as well as job opportunities arising in the European Community through their contacts with the employment services of other member states.  I would strongly encourage intending emigrants to avail of this service.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of FÁS at discouraging from travelling those who are obviously inadequately prepared for conditions abroad, some people will still exercise their right to emigrate and a proportion will get into difficulties.</P>
    <P>The bulk of State grants for welfare services for emigrants, amounting to £250,000 in 1987, are paid on the recommendation of DÍON, and are mainly directed towards improving and developing reception services in Britain for newly arrived emigrants.  DÍON is an independent voluntary committee based in Britain which makes recommendations on the allocation of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problem of Irish workers.</P>
    <P>DÍON reports to me annually in conjunction with its recommendations on the payment of grants.  The reports contain information on developments in emigration generally and DÍON's comments and assessments of the performance of individual grant-aided welfare centres. Some of the material in the reports would be of a confidential nature and would not be appropriate for publication.  I am considering how to publicise better general developments in relation to emigration.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if more intending <Col N="2481" /> emigrants sought information and advice and were better prepared before leaving Ireland, there would be fewer problem cases turning up in Britain and elsewhere. There are still too many people leaving the country who do not make contact with any sources of advice beforehand.  I want this situation to improve significantly under the more integrated FÁS structure which is being developed nationwide.</P>
    <P>Given this background, I believe that Government aid to voluntary bodies should be directed mainly towards organisations in Britain which are at the receiving end of crisis situations and which have to provide emergency services.  At home our efforts should still be directed towards developing the information and counselling services provided by FÁS and ensuring that all intending emigrants use these services.</P>
    <P>I recognise the good work being done by various voluntary organisations throughout the country in trying to help intending emigrants.  I hope that these organisations can work in close co-operation with FÁS in tackling the problem of lack of preparation and planning at its source.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATEMENT</P>
    <P>DÍON &mdash; COMMITTEE ON WELFARE SERVICES ABROAD</P>
    <P>1.  DÍON was set up in June 1984, replacing the larger Irish-based Committee on Welfare Services Abroad (COWSA), which operated from 1979, <Col N="2482" /> which in turn replaced the Advisory Committee on Emigrant Services, established in 1969.</P>
    <P>2.  DÍON reports to the Minister for Labour.  Its terms of reference are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to advise and report on emigrant welfare services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to make recommendations on the provision of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problems of Irish workers;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to consider and make recommendations on specific aspects of emigrant welfare at the request of the Minister.</P>
    <P>3.  DÍON is chaired by Mr. Seán Healy, Labour Attaché at the Irish Embassy in London.  The other members are:</P>
    <P>Mr. Seamus McGarry (Chairman Federation of Irish Societies), Mr. Gearóid Ó Meachair (Member of the Federation of Irish Societies), Mr. Seán Redmond (General Secretary, Irish Municipal Employees Trade Union), Mr. Breifne O'Reilly (Third Secretary, Irish Embassy, London).</P>
    <P>4.  Since 1 January 1987 the DÍON Committee have met 13 times, 11 times in London, once in Dublin and once in Liverpool.</P>
    <P>5.  Details of the grants issued since 1984 are attached, as Appendix I.</P>

    <P>In general, my view is that the tribunal has worked extremely well.  However, I would add that, in the context of the substantial increase in its workload in recent years, a number of issues have been raised in regard to the composition and operation of the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>These issues have been dealt with in the recently published discussion document on the review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 32 in page 20 of that document.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting the views of the interested parties, particularly the FUE and ICTU, on the various options for change in this and other areas.  When I have concluded my examination of these views, I will consider what new measures, if any, I should take.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour his Department's forecast as to the likely number of people unemployed in 1990 and the year 2000; and the plans he has to give every assistance <Col N="2487" /> possible from the Government to assist in creating employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The future level of unemployment will be determined largely by economic, productivity, employment and demographic trends both in Ireland and elsewhere. Attempts to predict trends in these variables, even for the short-term, is a hazardous exercise.  Any unforeseen departure from or inaccuracy in any one of the underlying assumptions would automatically render the resulting unemployment estimates unreliable.</P>
      <P>My Department do not produce economic or employment forecasts.  They rely instead, on the projections prepared regularly by reputable institutions in Ireland and abroad such as the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Central Bank, the Commission for the European Communities and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</P>
      <P>The most recent economic and labour force projections do not foresee any significant decline in unemployment levels before 1989.  I would broadly accept this scenario.</P>
      <P>During the nineties I hope to see the level of unemployment decrease as the difficult decisions taken by the Government to rectify the position of the public finances lead to increased employment.</P>
      <P>As already intimated in my reply to a question by the Deputy on 26 November 1987 I intend to use all the services at my disposal to contribute to a climate conducive to economic and employment growth.  These services centre on the industrial relations area and implementing a range of employment and training programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As of 31 December 1987, a total of £19.5 million was outstanding in payments due to Ireland by the United Nations in respect of costs arising from peacekeeping operations.  Of this amount £18.9 million relates to our involvement with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) since May 1978.  It should, however, be noted that for the period from the establishment of the force in 1978 to December 1987 the net extra cost (that is excluding normal pay and allowances) of maintaining our contingent with UNIFIL has not exceeded the total reimbursements received from the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The remaining amount, £0.6 million arises out of our participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).</P>
      <P>The shortfall in payments by the United Nations in respect of our participation in UNIFIL arises because certain UN member states have not paid their full assessed contributions to the UNIFIL account.  The Government's concern at this situation has been made known on all appropriate occasions to the Secretary General, as well as to the States directly concerned.  Our delegation at the General Assembly has been active in highlighting this issue and has co-operated with the representatives of other troop contributing countries in pressing for its early resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards UNFICYP, the position is that the force is financed by voluntary contributions from member states, and these fall considerably short of the costs incurred.  The size of the resulting deficit, which stood at approximately $166 million at 31 January 1987, makes it unlikely that early progress can be made with regard to reimbursement of the sums outstanding.  With a view to securing some improvement in the overall situation, the Secretary General in his report on the United Nations Operation <Col N="2489" /> in Cyprus for the period 1 June-30 November 1987 and with the full support of troop contributors, including Ireland, raised again for consideration by the members of the Security Council the question of a change in the method of financing the force from a voluntary to an assessed basis.  Regrettably the necessary measure of agreement was not forthcoming. The Government will continue to lend support to measures which offer the prospect of increasing the funds available to the force and of reducing the amounts due to troop-contributors.</P>

      <P>My Department have no record of any claim for a redundancy payment in respect of the person concerned.  Consequently, it has no information about his employment record on which his possible entitlements could be assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2502" /> I should explain that under the Redundancy Payments Acts the responsibility for payment of a lump sum payment is a matter in the first instance for the employer concerned.  If the employer refuses or fails to make the payment within a reasonable time, an employee can apply to my Department for direct payment from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  Such application must be supported by evidence of entitlement to a redundancy lump sum either in the form of a redundancy certificate (RP2) issued by the employer or, where entitlement is contested by the employer, a decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the employee's favour.</P>
    <P>The person concerned in the question should, therefore, approach his former employer in the first instance &mdash; or in the case of a company which is in liquidation, the liquidator &mdash; about payment of any redundancy lump sum to which he considers he is entitled.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to payment in lieu of notice, certain arrears of wages, holiday pay etc., is that, if the employer company of the person concerned has gone into liquidation or receivership, the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 may apply.  The person concerned would first have to establish any entitlement he may have to payment in lieu of notice by appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, through the completion of Form RP5 1A.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned considers that he is owed outstanding wages or holiday pay he should complete Form IP1 and forward it to the liquidator/receiver who should then apply to my Department for funds to pay him his outstanding entitlements from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.</P>

      <P>Pupils who have sat the leaving certificate examination may be enrolled as recognised pupils to repeat the final year of the leaving certificate course in 1987-88 subject to the payment of a repeat course fee of £100 per pupil <Col N="2504" /> and a repeat examination fee of £100. Pupils whose parents or guardians are the holders of a current medical card are exempted from the payment of the course fee and are required to pay only the standard examination fee of £33.  This provision has enabled an exemption to be given to approximatley 1,400 pupils.</P>
      <P>Applications for exemption from the &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; fees were received in the case of pupils in a total of 70 schools.  Replies have now issued in the vast majority of these cases explaining that in the present financial circumstances no further concessions can be made.  There are 12 school cases still on hands involving some 50 pupils and I shall convey my decision on these to the school authorities shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67, 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have not received any formal applications from any of the projects named, (i) Lismore GAA club, (ii) Sliabh gCua community centre, (iii) Portlaw soccer club or (iv) Ballyduff soccer club.</P>
      <P>Before the availability of a grant for the projects in question can be considered, it will be necessary for the organisations to apply formally for grant-aid under the Department's capital grant scheme for the construction of recreational facilities. Copies of the application forms and conditions have been sent to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I must stress, however, that the keen demand for the relatively limited funds available means that financial assistance cannot be presumed in respect of an application which may be submitted by any group.</P>
