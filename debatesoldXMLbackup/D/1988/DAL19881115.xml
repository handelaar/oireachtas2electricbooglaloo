      <P>Under the terms of the will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty, the primary responsibility for the administration and promotion of the Chester Beatty Library and Gallery rests with its Trustees.  It receives an annual grant from my Department, amounting this year to £200,000 or approximately 80 per cent of its expenditure.  The maintenance, repair, upkeep, renovation and improvement of the buildings are the responsibility of the Office of Public Works under the Chester Beatty Library Act, 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trustees of the Chester Beatty Library <Col N="222" /> and Gallery are appointed in accordance with the terms of the will of the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  It specified that five named persons and the Director of the National Library (ex-officio), together with one nominee each of the President and the Taoiseach should be Trustees.  Sir Alfred's will also vests the power of appointment of a new trustee or trustees in the surviving or continuing trustees.  It stipulates that not more than 12 trustees may be appointed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ex-officio appointment, the other appointments have been made without an expiry date.</P>
    <P>I am circulating, in the Official Report, a tabular statement giving the names of trustees and the dates of their respective appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the gift was primarily a gift to the State, to the people of this country, and in view of the extended amount of moneys afforded to the library on a yearly basis, is it not now time for the Government to seek the appointment of a board of trustees who are accountable in some way or other to the appropriate Department and to this House?  Particularly, has any effort been made to seek an annual report or a report on an on-going basis from the board of trustees as to the affairs of the library?  Has the Taoiseach given thought <Col N="223" /> to the appointment of additional trustees to the board of trustees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the trustees receive substantial private funds.  The library in particular has access to private funds and it is on ths basis of balance between private and public input into it that the State has available to it quite one of the most magnificent libraries in the world.  It is one that has to be approached, for that reason, with a certain amount of caution.  Talks are proceeding at the moment with the trustees on how progress can be assured.  I would not advocate anything in the way of drastic attention by the Government.  It is a matter of co-operation between the trustees and the Government and I am trying to keep it on that level.</P>
      <P>There was a very alarmist report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> which has no foundation whatever.  Indeed the chairman of the Friends of the Chester Beatty Library wrote to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> taking issue with the paper in regard to the allegations made.  The matter is not out of control.  It is simply a matter of co-ordination and co-operation between the Department of the Taoiseach and the trustees, bearing in mind that there is a tremendous worldwide recognition of the Chester Beatty Library.  Because of its continuing status under trusteeship it can be the recipient of very substantial private funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I concur fully with the Tánaiste in everything he has said with regard to the importance and significance of the library and its collection, I would ask him whether the Government would be satisfied that at the moment the director of the library, whose position is being totally undermined, is now forced to seek to resolve his difficulties in a tribunal in the Department of Labour?  Is this not an indication that there is some substance to the concern that all is not well at the library and that in fact because of its significance it does need closer attention from the Taoiseach's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the closer attention the Tánaiste intends to give the matter, could he ensure that some of the money provided by the State would be expended on a promotion programme to encourage the ordinary citizens of Dublin to visit this library?  Would the Tánaiste agree that this library is extremely valuable but seems in practice to be more visited by people from overseas than it is by people living in this country and that that is something that should be altered in the interests of the general promotion of a knowledge of Ireland as a centre of world learning in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Bruton has said.  One of the matters that I intend to bring to their attention is the idea of opening their doors and popularising the library and making it more available so that people will know what is there, and what is there is of enormous value.  Yet there appears to be very little organisation directed towards that objective of bringing people in to view it and making that in itself a commercial and revenue earning exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Sick leave is granted to prison officers on the conditions that apply throughout the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In gerneral, during properly certified sick absence, and provided there is no <Col N="227" /> evidence of permanent disability for service, full pay may be allowed for up to a maximum of six months in one year, and half-pay may be allowed thereafter, subject to a maximum of 12 months sick leave in any period of four years or less. Where these sick leave provisions have been exhausted, an officer whose service could render him eligible for pension may, on certain conditions, be granted further sick leave with pay, at pension rate.  Sick leave without pay may be allowed under certain conditions to officers whose service does not qualify them for sick pay at pension rate and who have exhausted all the sick leave with pay that is allowable.</P>
    <P>When an officer is compelled to absent himself from duty because of sickness, he is required to get notice to his immediate supervisor as early as possible on the first day of absence and, in all cases of continuing absence, a medical certificate must be furnished on the third day at the latest.  Sick leave for single or two day absences may be granted without a medical certificate provided that they do not exceed seven days in any period of 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the same scheme apply to the Garda Síochána?  Am I correct in saying that there is no guarantee that an officer will be paid for sick leave even with a scheme in place?  In relation to uncertified sick leave, the Minister mentioned that seven days are allowed in any one year but is he aware that in some instances a report on prison officers who have been sick for one day, two days or three days in one year is sent by the governor of the prison to the Department? Will the Minister agree that there is inconsistency between governors as to what is allowable?  I heard of a case recently of a prison officer who had three days uncertified sick leave receiving a letter from the Department of Justice threatening him that if this continued his employment would be reviewed.  Surely that is not right and proper?  A prison officer should know where he or she stands and if that officer is entitled to <Col N="228" /> seven days uncertified sick leave that should be sufficient unless there is a reason to suspect that an officer is acting in an improper manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions that apply in regard to sick leave for prison officers apply throughout the Civil Service.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the position is that where an officer absents himself or herself the head of the department has discretion as to whether sick leave should be allowed and whether the sick leave should be with or without pay. In determining whether payment should be made, regard would be had to advice from the chief medical officer, warnings previously given to the officer and the officer's record of absences.  Notwithstanding the fact that the vast majority of prison officers have good sick leave records, abuses do take place and such abuses have significant implications in terms of State expenditure.  It is incumbent on me, therefore, to ensure that the abuses are dealt with effectively.  That is particularly important when sick leave is on the increase.  The detection of abuses involves the careful scrutiny of all sick absences.  I should like to point out that sick leave regulations require that unacceptable patterns of sick absences be eradicated.  The relevant paragraph in the regulations states that officers should also be aware that Departments are under instructions to keep a check on the sick absences of staff, particularly those in the early years of service, with a view to identifying tendencies towards unacceptable patterns and taking steps to eradicate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister regard four days uncertified sick leave in one year as being unsatisfactory?  Would the Minister agree that there is a need for consistency among governors before cases are reported to the Department? He will appreciate cases can arise where a governor may not like a prison officer and different treatment can be applied to different prison officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the particular problem the Deputy has asked me to comment on, I suggest that if the Deputy lets me have the details of the case, I will be glad to deal with it.  I must say for the benefit of the House that sick leave in the prison service has been a serious problem for many years.  The problem is getting worse.  What makes the problem so serious is the cost associated with sick leave, because when officers take sick leave they are, as the Deputy knows, in most cases replaced by recalling other officers from their rest days to perform duty on overtime. Records are maintained to show how sick leave taken in a particular month compares with sick leave taken in the equivalent month for the previous year.  The increases have been very high for the recent three month period.  I will illustrate this by way of example: when we compare the figures for June 1988 with June 1987, there was an increase in sick leave of 67.5 per cent; the figures for July 1988 over July 1987 show an increase in sick leave of 40.4 per cent, and the figures for August 1988 over August 1987 show an increase of 46.6 per cent.  It ought to be mentioned that the number of serving staff in 1988 is 10 per cent higher than in 1987, but even allowing for this, the increases in sick leave are very high indeed.  Even though there are a number of prison officers with very good sick absence records, the average number of sick leave days per prison officer per annum is about 20, whereas the average number for the Civil Service as a whole is slightly over three.</P>

      <P>The intention is that approximately 300 garda trainees will be appointed during 1989, on the basis that the first intake of approximately 75 successful candidates should commence training in Templemore Training Centre in April 1989 and that there should be a further intake of around the same number every three months thereafter.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply states that no new recruits were taken on in the current year but before the new recruits are trained, a period of almost two years will have elapsed before the vacancies in the force due to retirements and deaths are replaced.  The 300 new gardaí who will replace those who have retired will hardly make up the loss of numbers in the force.  Surely, the Minister is aware of the very serious situation where crime is on the increase, not just in this city but in every town and village, and in rural areas in the country?  Further, is the Minister aware that in County <Col N="231" /> Wicklow the Garda strength in the barracks, which has been reduced considerably over the years, is totally inadequate for the level of crime in the county?  We not only have our own quota of wrong-doers but we have to meet the problems caused by unsavoury visitors from the city.  Over the years hundreds of thousands of decent people have visited Wicklow from the city but, unfortunately because it is near a very large population area a number of unsavoury characters are coming down and causing depredation. This problem not only applies to my own county, but to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, but I am trying to make the point that it seems a little tardy of the Minister to replace the numbers only now, and that not only is the total number of 1,000 appointments inadequate but the figure of 300 garda trainees to be appointed during 1989 is also totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>Most of the points made by Deputy Kavanagh were taken into consideration at the time the Government decided to go ahead with the recruitment campaign which is at present underway.

      <P>The Minister in his reply referred to the recruitment of 1,000 new gardaí but there was a short list of 12 people from the previous scheme who had been disallowed on medical grounds &mdash; they were athletes who had met with accidents.  Has the Minister discounted those 12 people from the new training programme?</P>

      <P>I am a bit slow to respond to the Deputy on that point without prior <Col N="232" /> notice but I can say, and this is subject to verification at a later stage over the next number of days, that it is the intention that those who were due to be called for training at the end of the last competition will be facilitated in the new competition. I understand, and I will let the Deputy have something more definite, that the Commissioner has written to them to that effect some time ago.  I will check the matter out for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As I have informed the House on a number of occasions, I could not undertake to indicate in response to a parliamentary question what specific legislative proposals, if any, I might have in particular areas.  Planned legislative changes are announced in the ordinary way after Government approval.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I might add that the proposals contained in the draft Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order, 1988, are quite distinct in content from section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The proposals in the draft Order are concerned with inference which may be drawn by a court from a person's silence in certain circumstances, whereas section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 places a requirement on a person arrested under section 30 to answer certain specified questions in certain circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, is a very drastic encroachment on the right to silence of somebody who has been arrested under section 30 and may face six months in prison if he does not explain his activities or movements?  Would he accept that it is, therefore, somewhat hypocritical of this Government to express concern about the new draft orders in Britain, and Northern Ireland particularly, while at the same time leaving such a provision on our Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there is already a provision similar to section 52 in the Northern Ireland law.  It is contained in section 18 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1978, and the new proposals are clearly quite a separate matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister, in view of the information which he has now given to the House which relates to further legislation in Northern Ireland, that it is even more hypocritical of the Government to express the concern which they have done <Col N="235" /> about similar situations which we have in our own legislation relating to the explaining of one's movements under pain of six months' imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1978, as amended empowers a member of the British Army or the RUC to stop and question a person for the purposes of ascertaining (a) that person's identity and movements, and (b) what he knows concerning any recent explosion or any other recent incident endangering life or concerning any person killed or injured in any such explosion or incident.  Failure to comply with such a request or failure to answer to the best of a person's knowledge or ability is an offence carrying a fine on summary conviction.  The Government are concerned with the implications of the draft Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order and some of the provisions which appear to have far-reaching consequences for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland and the Government's views on the matters have been made known to the British Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Give me a chance to answer the question.  Briefly, the circumstances are, where a person fails to account for objects, substances or marks on his person or clothing or in the place where the accused is found, where a person fails to account for his presence in a particular place and where a person raises in his defence, in court, a matter which he did not mention while being questioned by the police or on being charged which he might reasonably have been expected to mention, and a person's refusal when called on, in court, to give evidence.  The first two circumstances reflect provisions in our own Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The Government are concerned, in particular, by the radical nature of the two other provisions I have mentioned.  The Government consider that this legislation, as a whole, could have far-reaching consequences in a divided society, such as Northern Ireland, where there continues to be a lack of confidence in the administration of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has satisfied himself that the scale of charges operated by the Land Registry is appropriate, given the recent increase in property values, and given that a transaction involving a value of £40,000 will be charged for at the same rate as a transaction to the value of £4 million; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to fees for transactions involving conveyances of registered land.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Land Registry is required by law to be self-supporting. In deciding on the level of fees required to provide for this, regard is had to the work involved in each particular category of transaction and also to the number of transactions in each category.</P>
      <P>There are 18 different categories of fees, 17 of which are fixed rates, ranging from 30 pence to £30, relating to specific transactions.  One fee depends on the value of the transaction and can range from £50 to £200, which is the maximum fee payable in any one transaction.</P>
      <P>The maximum fee was deliberately set at £200 so that a fee which would be out of proportion to the registration work involved would not be charged for any transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of fees in the Land Registry has been generally satisfactory in achieving as reasonable a relationship as possible with the work involved in each category of case as well as conformity with the statutory need to <Col N="238" /> be self-sufficient.  I should add that the current fees are substantially lower in real terms than they were 20 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider redrawing the scale of charges or allowing the Land Registry to do so in the light of the fact that there is a compensation fund which is attached to the Land Registry transactions and which, obviously, is related to the risk involved in each transaction?  A sum of £200 is the highest fee that can be charged and that allows for the fact that a transaction involving a figure of £40,000 does not hold the same risk as one involving say, £4 million.  Surely the charges should reflect the risk involved to the compensation fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as the Minister says, the Land Registry is self-sufficient so that the fees intake covers the cost of administration why is it that additional staff are not taken on in the Land Registry so that transactions can be dealt with and completed within a reasonable time instead of members of the public having to put up with very long delays for many months before transactions are completed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister when he is replying to Deputy Taylor if he would agree that the Land Registry is being run at a very substantial profit at a time when the delays are unacceptable because of insufficient staff?  Will he apply some of the profit made in the Land Registry in the employment of further staff so that the ordinary man dealing with the Land Registry may get a proper service?</P>

      <P>In the light of the Minister's reply that he is not prepared at this stage to review the operation of fees in the Land Registry, what action is he going to take in view of the crisis that exists at present?  Does the Minister realise that it is now taking a period of ten weeks to photocopy a map for the registered owner, being a consumer and a member of the public?  Is the Minister not further aware that it is taking up to three years to complete an application for a first registration and that a simple transfer of a site in an area where the land had been registered some years ago is taking up to 18 months?  Is the Minister prepared to accept that there is a crisis in the Land Registry and having regard to the self-supporting nature of the scheme what is he going to do about it?</P>

I am at present considering the introduction of a new fees order early in 1989 to cover the cost of additional staffing which is due to be assigned to the Land Registry by way of redeployment and increasing costs.  Should the Deputy have in mind the appropriateness of the fee for any specific type of transaction I am prepared to have it examined in the context of that exercise.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will make a statement indicating the moneys provided for the probation and welfare service for each of the years 1984 to 1987 inclusive, in 1988 to date and the amount estimated for 1989, indicating the number of personnel employed in the probation and welfare service for each of the same years; if he will make a statement on the trend indicated and the level of service being provided during the current year by this service; an assessment on the resources of the service for 1989; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Expenditure incurred in respect of services provided by the Probation and Welfare Service in the period 1984 to 1987 was as follows: £3.928 million in 1984; £4.5 million in 1985; £5.37 million in 1986 and £5.436 million in 1987. £5.749 million has been provided for 1988 and expenditure up to the end of October amounted to £4.719 million.  The estimate provision for 1989 is £5.903 million.</P>
      <P>The number of persons serving in all grades in the probation and welfare service during the period 1984 to 1987 was as follows: 205 in 1984; 211 in 1985; 207 in 1986 and 208 in 1987.  The number of serving staff at present is 192.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that staffing levels in 1989 will fall significantly below their present numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the reduction in <Col N="243" /> staffing levels in the current year the probation and welfare service continue to meet the demands being placed upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is a cause of concern that their excellent work &mdash; and I want to pay a tribute to the work being done by the Probation and Welfare Service &mdash; showing an appreciable reduction in numbers, from 208 down to 192, and likely to remain the same in 1989, represents a very serious lack in a most valuable and essential service?  Is the Minister not concerned that the level of service needed so much, of probation and welfare officers, must be affected in the level of service being offered those people who need it? Is it not a fact that the Estimates for 1989 show a reduction of 2 per cent in the provision being made available for the Probation and Welfare Service?  Would the Minister not agree that it is really outrageous that such an essential social service should be adversely affected in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Probation and Welfare Service, like so many other services, are subject to Government policy on staffing and recruitment.  The bulk of reduction in staff numbers since the beginning of 1988 is attributable to staff &mdash; 12 of them &mdash; taking career breaks for which there is no automatic replacement.  Staff retiring or resigning from the service may be replaced by staff returning from career breaks or by the redeployment of staff from other areas of the public service.  So far no replacements suitable for redeployment on probation and welfare service work have been assigned to the Probation and Welfare Service.  The number of career breaks staff, two, who have returned to the service during the year have been minimal.  Should staffing levels reduce further and the workload from the courts continue at its present level or show an increase, consideration may have to be given to a redeployment <Col N="244" /> of resources within the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that that constitutes a very unwise policy decision particularly at a time when it is costing between £20,000 and £30,000 to maintain a prisoner in prison, when one sees in the Estimates a reduction of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent for community services orders and 2 per cent for the Probation and Welfare Service, one area in which there should be an increase in revenue rather than a reduction in order to save on the other side?  Furthermore would the Minister not agree that this is an area in which the Fianna Fáil Government have failed miserably to produce any proposals in regard to alternatives to custody?  Furthermore, would he not agree that the staff in the Probation and Welfare Service &mdash; whose dedication has to be admired, as Deputy Taylor said earlier &mdash; despite the hazards under which they work continuously deserve much more support and resources in order to save taxpayers by there being fewer people locked up in prisons and more community service orders being used under the auspices of the Probation and Welfare Service?</P>

      <P>With regard to that part of Deputy Barrett's supplementary question which deals with alternatives to custoday, I have already indicated to the House some couple of months ago that the operation of the community service orders scheme is being monitored by my Department.  As yet it is too soon to say whether the scope of the legislation ought to be extended in order to provide for the greater use of community service orders.  I want to assure the Deputy and the House that the matter is being considered.</P>

We just cannot get people to replace them.  I wish they did not go and that I could stop them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if the review of the operation of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, to be undertaken before the end of the current year by the Government, has been initiated; if it has been completed; and when the report will be available to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is provided for in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, is an annual report by the Government to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation, in the preceding year, of Part III of the Extradition Act 1965 to be made as soon as may be after 1 January. The review proper will commence immediately after the end of the year but the necessary monitoring of the operation of Part III has been in progress throughout this year.</P>
      <P>The report to each House of the Oireachtas will be made as soon as possible in the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slightly puzzled because in a speech which the Minister made in this House on a Fine Gael Private Members' motion on 28 June of this year he stated that the review in question must be undertaken before the end of the current year in order to enable the Government to fulfil their statutory obligation to submit the report as soon as may be after 1 January 1989.  The Minister now seems to be indicating that this review will not commence until the beginning of next year.  My understanding of the statutory obligation is that the report must be produced as soon as may be after 1 January. Can the Minister tell us if this is not the case?  Secondly, can the Minister tell us if the review of the entire extradition <Col N="246" /> arrangements between Ireland and Britain is being carried out by his Government acting on their own or are they doing so in conjunction with the Government of the UK?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must understand that responsibility for legislation in the Oireachtas rests with the Government and not with any other government. Secondly, in regard to the Deputy's question on the annual report, as I said, the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 provides for an annual report by the Government to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, to be made as soon as may be after 1 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to repeat what I have already said, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister gave a different undertaking in June of this year.  Can the Minister tell us if he has made an order extending the rule of specialty to Part III of the 1965 Act, the part which prevents extradition other than for the charges mentioned on the extradition order, as was provided for in the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 and, if not, why?

      <P>With regard to the question on the safeguards contained in the 1987 Extradition (Amendment) Act and whether or not they will be reviewed, that is a separate matter.  I would refer the Deputy to an answer which I will <Col N="247" /> be giving later on in the afternoon to a question tabled by Deputy Kennedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of us on this side of the House are confused because my understanding is that the Extradition (Amendment) Act lasts only for a period of one year unless renewed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, as a result of an amendment I tabled on behalf of my party when bringing this Act into being last December.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Minister to come before this House before the end of the year to renew this Act or has a decision been taken by the Government that the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 will not be renewed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement that an annual report be provided is outlined in section 6 and because of the confusion which appears to exist let me outline what it provides for.  Section 6 provides that the Government shall as soon as may be after the first day of January in each year, beginning with the year 1989, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation, in the preceding year, of Part III of the Principal Act.  The Principal Act is the Extradition Act, 1965 and Part III provides for the simplified backing of warrant arrangements which we operate with Britain and Northern Ireland.  That report or review, or whatever one may wish to call it will, therefore, cover the extradition arrangements we operate with Britain and Northern Ireland in their entirety.  It will include the new safeguards contained in the 1987 Act such as the new sections empowering the Attorney General to direct that a warrant will not be endorsed unless he is satisfied of certain matters because they were effected by amendments to Part III of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 84 together.  I am aware that there are a number of cases awaiting a decision by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in respect of which initial applications for compensation were lodged as far back as 1983.  These include cases where an initial award made by the tribunal has been rejected and an appeal is pending and cases where the tribunal is awaiting further documentation from the applicants to enable it to make a decision in the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there are the cases where awards have been made but payment is pending.  As of 1 November 1988 there <Col N="251" /> were 771 such cases totalling £3,812,000. Thirty-five of these awards refer to cases where the initial application was lodged prior to 31 December 1983.  It is not practicable to give a value in respect of claims where awards have not been made and, indeed, may not be made.  They number approximately 3,000.</P>
    <P>I will today be asking the House to approve a Supplementary Estimate of £4 million on Subhead G.1 of Vote 20 &mdash; Office of the Minister for Justice &mdash; which will enable all awards made to date to be paid before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Am I to take it that the amount totalling £3,812,000 covering 771 cases will be paid by the end of this year as a result of approval of the Supplementary Estimate?  Secondly, can the Minister tell me if the remaining cases are heard this year, when will the awards be paid and are we now once and for all going to get rid of the five year waiting list?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he has made an order bringing that section into being?  Arising from his reply, I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a technical difficulty in the section, which I think was introduced on Report Stage, in so far as off-licences may sell cigarettes and tobacco across a counter but that this is not the case in a supermarket where there is a separate liquor counter.  One cannot sell cigarettes or tobacco over that counter.  This is causing difficulties and is impracticable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity of the point raised by Deputy Seán Barrett in his supplementary question.  There are various implications for the tobacco industry in particular and I thank the Deputy for being gracious enough to point this out to me by way of a letter which I received recently.  An order has not been made under section 47 and I have already had discussions with representatives of the trade with regard to practical difficulties.  I believe these practical difficulties can be overcome and I would like them to be overcome so that the full effect of the legislation might be enforced, bearing in mind that this section had the unanimous approval of the House during the course of the debate.  I will report to the House in due course.  I want to say further that it is not my intention to make an order before Christmas bearing in mind the effect it might have on the Christmas trade and the difficulties it would cause for both sides, the customers on one hand and owners of shops and supermarkets on the other hand.  The matter is presently being discussed between officials of my Department and people from the trade with a view to overcoming these difficulties; which I believe we can overcome.</P>

      <P>The annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention for 1987 is being printed in Arbour Hill Prison at present.  Copies of the report are expected to be available this week for presentation to Government prior to publication.  A copy of the report will be circulated to all Deputies immediately thereafter.  Work on the preparation of the report commenced on 19 October 1987 when I issued instructions that all material for inclusion in the 1987 report be submitted to my Department by the end of January this year.  The statistical element of the report consists of approximately 11,500 items of raw material, if I might use that phrase, which must be input to a computer prior to being assembled in tabular form.  Some of the statistical material received was incomplete and other items required to be clarified. The intervention of the prison officers industrial dispute contributed to the delay in so far as some returns remained outstanding and could not be furnished.  Finalisation of the statistical section of the report continued during the summer months.  The material was then submitted to the printing unit in Arbour Hill Prison for typesetting and the proofs were returned to my Department for proof reading and for amendments to be made to correct mistakes which occurred in the typesetting.  The final proofs of the text and the statistical section of the report were furnished to the printing unit in Arbour Hill Prison on 19 October and the printing unit have indicated that the earliest date by which copies would be available would be during the week commencing 14 November.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to say the following in the interest of explaining the position to all Members of the House. Since I took office there has been a substantial improvement in the time scale by which reports are now published.  For instance, four reports &mdash; two on the prisons and places of detention and two on the probation and welfare services &mdash; were published between July and December 1987.  As a backbench Deputy of the Government at the time, the Deputy should know there were no reports issued then for 1985-86.  Despite the breakthrough I made last year, I will have a better record this year by having the report published three weeks earlier than the report published last year.  The Deputy should be highly complimentary and appreciative of what I am doing.</P>

My information is that the non-filling of these vacancies and low morale in the force are <Col N="259" /> affecting the level of attendance at in-service training courses.

      <P>Is the Minister aware from various articles published recently that drug pushers have targeted Ireland, Britain and Europe as potential growth markets for the sale of cocaine, particularly in view of the drop in price on the world market?  Would he not agree that there is need for greater co-operation, particularly between ourselves and the police authorities in Britain?  What proposals does he have to deal with the problem facing the Garda Síochána with the removal of barriers in 1992?  Is this not the time to prepare ourselves for these dramatic changes?  Has he any proposal to introduce legislation to deal with the confiscation of assets of these drug pushers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the latter part of the Deputy's question is yes.  With regard to co-operation with the British and other authorities to combat the possibility of an increase in trafficking in the drug cocaine, the Garda authorities have assured me that part of their strategy to deal with this problem is to liaise very closely with other European police forces, and with Interpol, and this includes a very high level of co-operation with the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda keep a very close watch on this area bearing in mind the consequences for our community of any laxity <Col N="261" /> that might exist.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £4,300,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1988, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>There are a number of items covered in the net £4.3 million being sought in this Supplementary Estimate.  By far the most significant element is an additional sum of £4 million for the payment of awards by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  I am glad to be seeking this extra funding because, if granted, it will clear the huge backlog of awards accepted during the past year and which are awaiting payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original provision for 1988 under subhead G.I. for the payment of claims under the scheme was £1.975 million and, <Col N="398" /> as I have said, the additional amount required is £4 million.</P>
    <P>At present there is a delay of approximately one year between the date on which an applicant agrees to accept an award and the date on which he receives payment.  This delay period will get much longer if the extra amount I am seeking is not granted by the House.</P>
    <P>The reason for the current delay in making payments after the applicant has agreed the amount of the award, is that in recent years the provision for awards made in the Estimates has not been sufficient to enable payment to be made of all awards.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful if I gave some background information on the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  The scheme, and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal who administer it, was established in 1974.  It is a non-statutory scheme. Copies of the scheme were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in February 1974.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme the tribunal pay <i>ex gratia</i> compensation in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence or to circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting or attempting to assist the prevention of crime or the saving of human life.</P>
    <P>Due to its escalating cost to the Exchequer, the previous Government revised the scheme with effect from 1 April 1986.  Prior to the amendment of the scheme, the number of applications had been steadily increasing year by year and gradually the cumulative amount of the awards being made by the tribunal outstripped the annual provision in the Estimates.  As a result a time lag developed between the date of acceptance of an award by an applicant and the date by which he received payment.  As I have said already, this delay has now stretched to approximately one year.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this month the tribunal had on hands 771 awards, totalling £3,812,000, which have been accepted and are awaiting payment.  If <Col N="399" /> the House agrees to the passing of this Supplementary Estimate, payment can be made in respect of all these awards thereby eliminating the present accumulation of arrears by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>In the longer term, the situation will be eased following on from the effects of the amended scheme.  Under the revised scheme, compensation may not be paid in respect of pain and suffering attributable to injuries sustained on or after 1 April 1986.</P>
    <P>The effects of the revised scheme can already be seen in the reduction of the numbers of claims submitted to the tribunal during the past two years.  In 1985, a total of 1,975 claims was submitted to the tribunal while provisional figures indicate that the figure for 1987 was 243. This reduction in the number of claims will reduce the cost of the scheme as it operated up to 1 April 1986, a cost which prompted the then Government to introduce the amended scheme.</P>
    <P>I turn now to subhead F.1. of the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice. The original division under subhead F.1. for criminal legal aid was £2.2 million and the additional amount now estimated to be required is £400,000.</P>
    <P>My Department have no effective control over the two main determinants of expenditure on criminal legal aid which are, first, the decision by the courts to grant such aid and, secondly, the cost arising from the grant of it in any particular case.  The courts alone have discretion to grant criminal legal aid and it would simply not be feasible to limit the discretion without changing the statutory &mdash; perhaps even the constitutional &mdash; position.  Deputies will probably be aware that there is a Supreme Court ruling to the effect that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of factors has contributed to the high rate of expenditure this year. These include increased recourse generally to legal aid by the courts in disposing of criminal businesss coming before them in recent years and, overall, the speedier processing of claims submitted <Col N="400" /> by solicitors and counsel under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The estimate of £2.2 million for criminal legal aid for this year was prepared in mid 1987, before it was clear that expenditure for 1987 would reach £2.4 million, which was considerably higher than any previous year.  The high expenditure in 1987 was due to increased recourse to the scheme generally and this increase has been sustained in 1988.  Therefore, expenditure for this year is up £200,000 only on expenditure in 1987.</P>
    <P>I might also add that the revised allocation of £2.6 million for 1988 includes the value added tax on legal fees, which is ultimately recouped to the Exchequer, and the retention tax which is deducted from fees due, and paid directly to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The final item of increased expenditure provided for in the Supplementary Estimate is the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The Data Protection Act, 1988, which was passed by this House earlier this year, represents a very positive initiative in dealing with the implications of computer technology for personal privacy.  The Act aims at protecting the privacy of individuals about whom automated data are kept by imposing certain obligations on the persons who keep or process such data and it also confers various rights on individuals, such as the right of access to automated data relating to them.</P>
    <P>The Act will be brought into force when the registration machinery which it provides for is in full operation and data controllers and data processors have had time to adjust their data processing procedures to the requirements of the legislation. The operative date is expected to be not later than next April.  Responsibility for implementing and enforcing the Act is in the hands of the Data Protection Commissioner appointed by the Government. The provision of a figure of £50,000 in the Supplementary Estimates relates to the expenditure on the commissioner's office for this year.</P>
    <P>In line with Government policy the staff of the commissioner's office, some of whom have already been appointed, <Col N="401" /> are being provided from existing resources by redeployment while the amount of fees generated by registration will contribute significantly to defraying the other expenses of the office.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also takes account of a shortfall in income this year.  Under subhead J. of the Vote a provision was made for Appropriations-in-aid of £620,000.  The amount expected to be realised under this subhead is now estimated at £100,000 less than that figure.</P>
    <P>Three different types of receipts are included in the Appropriations-in-aid. They are: film censorship fees; recoupment of salaries, etc. of officers on secondment, and miscellaneous.</P>
    <P>The main variation compared with the original Estimate will arise under film censorship fees.  There was a provision for £250,000 here whereas the amount that will actually be realised this year is £100,000.  The provision under film censorship fees was in itself made up of two elements &mdash; first, fees in respect of cinema films and, second, fees in respect of video films.  It was estimated that £100,000 would be received in respect of cinema films and £150,000 in respect of video films.</P>
    <P>The estimated £100,000 from cinema films will be realised.  In this context I should mention that fees in respect of cinema films submitted to the official censor of films were increased by 100 per cent with effect from 1 January of this year.  An increase of this magnitude was necessary because the income from the fees in operation up to then was not sufficient to meet the running expenses of the Film Censor's office.  There is a requirement in section 11 of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, that fees to be charged should be arranged so as to produce as nearly as may be an annual sum sufficient to discharge the salaries and other expenses incidental to the working of the 1923 Act.  The fees in operation since the beginning of this year will meet the expenses of the Film Censor's office and they also contain an element to offset previous losses in that office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> There was also a provision for £150,000 to be obtained from fees in relation to video films.  These fees are being provided for under the Video Recordings Bill, 1987.  However, as Deputies are aware, this Bill has not been passed yet and, accordingly, no fees from this source have accrued this year and it is now clear that no fees will accrue even if the Act is passed before the end of the year. Accordingly, these fees will not arise until 1989.  Incidentally, I should mention that the video fees will come from three sources and that, as in the case of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, the fees will be set at a level sufficient to meet all of the expenses of the expanded Film Censor's office.  The three sources from which the fees will be obtained are as follows: fees in respect of licences for retail and wholesale video film outlets; fees in respect of the examination of video films by the Film Censor, and fees in respect of labels which will have to be attached to each cassette containing a video work in respect of which the censor has issued a certificate authorising its supply.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to subhead J., I should mention that the shortfall of £150,000 in respect of film censorship fees is offset to the tune of £50,000 additional income which will be realised from the recoupment of salaries, etc., of officers of my Department on secondment.</P>
    <P>While the total extra sum required on the items I have mentioned amounts to £4.55 million, savings of £250,000 are expected on pay due to staff wastage being greater than anticipated.  These savings serve to reduce the amount of the Supplementary Estimate to £4,300,000.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on the Supplementary Estimate. I will take note of any points they raise and, in so far as it is possible, reply to them later this evening.</P>

      <P>In dealing with this Supplementary Estimate I would like if the Minister, when replying, could avail of the opportunity of giving us some information in relation to the bomb <Col N="403" /> hoaxes in the city centre today.  The information that is coming through is very misleading.  I have heard various reports that the Garda Síochána took it upon themselves to decide that there was no danger involved and that the objects that were planted around the premises in question did not need the attention of the Garda or of the Army bomb disposal unit.  It is important that this matter be cleared up today because there will probably be newspaper reports of all descriptions.</P>
      <P>The Minister should assure the House that there are in place procedures to be followed in the event of somebody discovering an object or an item that could be suspected of being some sort of bomb. I would like to hear the Minister assure this House that there is in place a procedure which presumably involves the Army bomb disposal unit and also the fire brigade and other authorities necessary to clear the streets because the question of criminal compensation will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information today is that people were left standing at bus stops when there were supposed to be four suspected items around the city.  I want the Minister to clarify this matter.  As he said, he does not deal in the area of gossip, but I want him to put on the record of this House what exactly took place, what procedures are there in the event of this happening again &mdash; which I hope it does not &mdash; and an assurance that there is a plan of action that is followed in all cases in the event of persons finding suspicious objects on their premises, particularly when information comes from the North of Ireland that these bombs possibly are somewhere throughout our city.  It is always better to be wise before the event than after it, therefore I want to avail of this opportunity of raising this matter because I think it is extremely serious.  I do so in all sincerity without wishing to create any scare or to try to play politics with this. It is important for the commerce of this city, for people's lives and safety, so that they can go to shop and feel secure, that if there is any possibility of these bombs <Col N="404" /> being placed in premises the area is cleared immediately and we know there is a plan in place.  Will the Minister kindly state on the record of this House what procedures are followed when such events happen and that a plan of action is in place that is applied in all cases.</P>
    <P>I will not be opposing this Supplementary Estimate before us.  In fact, I welcome the additional resources being made available here to deal with the backlog of cases and awards made under the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  However, the one question I ask is why we had to await until the month of November for a Supplementary Estimate. Surely we were aware that these cases were there &mdash; I am sure there are far more cases that should be dealt with &mdash; and that a sum of money was not provided originally when the Estimates were published early in 1988.  Perhaps the Minister can explain to us why he was able to get £4 million at the end of the year and not before it.  I have my suspicions, but we will leave it to him to tell us.  I will not speculate.  I am sure he has good reason.  Anyhow it is nice to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always there backing the Minister up in trying to get extra resources to keep some sanity on these islands.  Also I cannot understand why we have not been dragged into a court over this whole scheme and why somebody has not taken us to the European Court. I know the Minister is going to tell me that I was a member of a Government who abolished the main part of this scheme, namely, pain and suffering, but as he always said when he was in Opposition, he should not always be harking back to when we were in Government. He is now in Government so I am going to say precisely the same thing to him.  I recall very vividly that when the last Government decided to abolish the pain and suffering aspect of this scheme there were howls of protest from Deputy Michael Woods on this side of the House <Col N="405" /> complaing bitterly about what this horrible Coalition Government were doing at the time, wrecking this scheme.  My understanding also was that during the election campaign Fianna Fáil stated that if returned to Government they would reintroduce the pain and suffering aspect of this scheme.  What has happened in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms since that happened?  We have no proposals here to revert to the original scheme and to include pain and suffering.  Maybe the Minister can tell us if he has something up his sleeve that maybe he is keeping for another day to announce the good news, or has he forgotten about the commitment given to the electorate during the last election campaign and prior to that back in April 1986 when this scheme was amended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a couple of suggestions to make. Having examined this scheme and recognising that, unfortunately, there is a shortage of available finance for all aspects of the public service at present, I think we should seriously have another look at this scheme.  I feel somewhat concerned that, in particular, persons going to the aid and assistance of a member of the Garda Síochána who is trying to perform his or her duty and becoming injured as a result of it, seriously injured in some cases, will have no compensation payable from the State to them.  In that I include prison officers and other important people in our community who are there to serve and protect us.  I am afraid people will stand back and say, &ldquo;That is none of my business; that garda can look after himself because if I go in there and then am seriously injured I have a wife and two kids at home and nobody is going to look after me&rdquo;.  In any democracy if that starts creeping in it is dangerous.  We need support for our police force at all times.  We need to encourage people to report incidents to the Garda Síochána where they have suspicions, to come to the aid of members of the Garda Síochána who are trying to protect us as a society, and if something goes wrong in the process we should be generous enough to compensate somebody who would be seriously injured perhaps in <Col N="406" /> coming to the aid of the Garda Síochána. Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider the scheme.  I know you have to cut your cloth and I realise there are over 2,000 applications per annum for compensation, that the bills we were facing were mounting, resources are scarce and we can do only so much, but there are certain things we have to do.  One is that we protect victims who perhaps take it upon themselves to perform their civic duty and go to the aid of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I understand that many of the cases that came before the tribunal were the result of rows &mdash; or whatever you call them &mdash; in public houses and hotels arising from drink.  One fellow decides to smash a glass and stick it into somebody else's face and the person who is injured appeals to the tribunal for compensation. I have a suggestion to make to the Minister here.  If somebody is prepared to serve alcohol to someone who is clearly under the influence and as a result that person causes an injury to another person, the person who serves the alcohol should be held somewhat responsible, and instead of the State and the taxpayer having to fork our some money, perhaps there should be an onus on the owner of the premises in question to see to it that people on their premises to whom they are serving alcohol should behave themselves and should not be sold more alcohold than is good for them.  Therefore, in reintroducing a more comprehensive scheme we could look at that aspect and make people more responsible for those they allow on to and keep on their premises and to whom they serve alcohol.</P>
    <P>I understand that that scheme is in operation in the US and that, in fact, it has gone beyond that.  People are now claiming compensation if somebody gets into a car after being served drink on a premises and injuries a third party.  The person injured can refer back to the publican who sold the drink to the person who injured him or her in the motor vehicle.  I do not think we should go that far, but if a row develops on a premises and somebody is responsible for sticking a glass into somebody else's face and is <Col N="407" /> clearly under the influence of alcohol, somebody who sold that person an oversupply of alcohol should be responsible for that person's actions, and the taxpayer should not be the one to put his hand in his pocket to pay out compensation. Equally, the victim of such a horrible incident should receive some compensation.  At the moment he or she will not because it is very difficult to prove liability against the owner of the premises. Therefore, we should have a look at that in reviewing this scheme.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion I would like to make is that the Minister might consider imposing fixed limits on the amounts payable in certain instances such as will happen, I am sure, under insurance claims where a maximum amount is payable for the loss of an arm or an eye or under a personal accident policy in private insurance schemes at present.  We should impose fixed limits and reduce the costs.</P>
    <P>The fourth suggestion I would make is that somebody who performs an act and damages or causes injury to another person may not have the resources to meet the damages thereby incurred, but before the State is asked to step in, every possible step should be taken to see that the person who caused the injury pays up.  If they have not got the resources at the time there should be powers of attachment to future earnings or income &mdash; if, perhaps, they won £400,000 in the lottery, they should have to pay the State any moneys that were paid out as a result of, maybe, a violent act against a person. We should look at the possibility of making certain that before somebody comes to the tribunal looking for compensation they have exhausted every possible avenue of recovering damages from the person who caused the injury in the first place.  Even if, after exhausting every avenue, it is found that the only people who can pay out is the State there should be an attachment of earnings of the individual responsible for the damage or of their estate should they accumulate resources in the future.</P>
    <P>These are some of the ways whereby <Col N="408" /> we could introduce a somewhat more comprehensive scheme than we have at present.  I take the point that there are long delays not because the members of the tribunal are not dealing with the cases before them but because, since the introduction of this scheme every Minister for Justice has had considerable difficulty in getting sufficient funds under this subhead to meet outstanding claims.  Every Minister for Justice would like to get £10 million to clear off every possible claim. That is the reality since this scheme was introduced.  Therefore one cannot oppose this Supplementary Estimate. One has to welcome it because it goes some of the way, but there are still many cases outstanding where awards have not been made yet.  I have details here before me that a colleague of mine on the back benches sent me about a situation in Cork where somebody sent him a copy of a letter from the tribunal saying that although they had told the person concerned that his case would be dealt with approximately at the end of April 1988, unfortunately it would now be another 12 months before it would be dealt with. That letter was dated 1 November 1988; the case is now nearly two years old so it is going to be three years before somebody receives the small amount of money they are entitled to get if the tribunal so decides.  We just do not have the resources available at present to deal with the very limited scheme we have.  There is no point in fooling ourselves.  If I am asking the Minister to reintroduce the old scheme, I know what answer I am going to get: despite all the politics that were played by his party when the scheme was being introduced the last time and when the election campaign was in progress. That would not be the only promise broken by the Government since 1987.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that we could have a more comprehensive scheme if the Minister were to take on board some of the suggestions I have made.  If there is anything wrong with any of the things I have suggested I would be delighted to hear from the Minister.  We could be seen then to deal with each case more quickly and avoid a situation where some day <Col N="409" /> somebody is going to drag us into court, perhaps the European Court, and we will have egg all over our faces, again being forced to do things for which we have not the resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to other aspects of this Supplementary Estimate I want to ask the Minister about the loss of revenue resulting from the non-passing of the Video Recordings Bill.  The Minister says he anticipated £150,000 in fees if that Bill had gone through but that there is a subsequent saving of £50,000 on salaries. I was shocked to hear that because I understood that this Video Recordings Bill was going to be self-financing. According to those figures it would cost the taxpayer £100,000.  Is that right?  Or is it the other way around?  The Minister is saying that we will lose £150,000 but there is a subsequent saving of £50,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I see; it is the other way around.  It will be self-financing.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say.  I do not want to delay the House much longer.  I would ask the Minister to comment on the few points I have made in relation to a more comprehensive scheme.  I would urge him also to use this opportunity to put our minds at rest in regard to the incidents that occurred in the centre city earlier today, particularly as we are coming up to the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope we can do something to bring along a number of the outstanding cases that are with the tribunal in which no awards have been made at this stage, because three years is far too long to leave people waiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this party will not be opposing the allocation of these sums to the Department of Justice.  I and my party feel that some movement on the criminal injuries compensation fund is long overdue.  On the Supplementary Estimate that was introduced here last week from the Department of Finance relating to the offices of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney <Col N="410" /> General I made the point very strongly that I believed it was absolutely wrong that persons who had been injured in the course of the commission of crimes should have to wait a number of years to be compensated.  There is a great backlog that has built up.  It is simply not fair to those who have been victims, through their innocent involvement in crimes, to have to take this delay.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund, the Minister mentions that there are delays of approximately a year.  Deputy Barrett referred to that.  My experience is that the delays are of far more than a year.  In fact in a reply the Minister gave us before this debate at Question Time he indicated that there is a number of cases going back as far as 1983.  That itself points to the inherent delays in the system.  I know that the provisions of the scheme changed in 1986, but it is simply appalling that there are hundreds of people who have had to wait so long for the settlement of their cases.</P>
      <P>This points one more time to the issue of where stands the victim of crime in our society.  Last week I quoted the Director of Public Prosecutions when he made his case and I agree with him totally.  The victim of crime has become lost in the system.  We have to remember that the victim is the most important person in the process of redressing what has been an act against society, because without that victim coming forward and acting as witness and pressing charges we will not have an effective criminal justice system, and I believe that the structures within that criminal justice system, whether it be in the prosecution of cases, the type of penalties that are handed out or compensation for being injured in the course of crimes being committed, should reflect the fact that society feels very strongly that crimes are to be outlawed by that society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me also take the chance to mention, while the Minister for Justice is here, that the point that was particularly made by the Director of Public Prosecutions was that without much alteration to the structures it would be <Col N="411" /> possible to involve the victim or the witness in the procedures leading up to the trial, to take part in the process, even in cases that are not in fact continued with so that he can understand why that happens, thereby allowing him to see that justice is being done.  When deciding important issues we should not ignore the central role that the victim has played, and can play.  It is a mark of a good society, one which cares for its people, if it is seen to protect such a victim in its structures.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has said that the level of claims has dropped drastically since the new scheme was introduced. That may be so but, unfortunately, it does not reflect a drop in the number of offences committed, particularly offences against the person.  The latest report on crime showed a sharp increase in the number of offences against the person.  It would be foolish to take heart from the fact that the number of claims against the fund is reducing.  In my view that indicates that the victim is lost in the criminal justice scheme because, effectively, it rules out claims from the vast majority of those who could quite reasonably be regarded as victims of crime.  I do not think that is warranted and it should be addressed and changed without delay.</P>
    <P>I also note that the Supplementary Estimate relates to the criminal injury compensation fund of £4 million but in next year's Estimate there is a provision of £2 million for the fund.  The estimate for this year was £1.9 million while for 1987 it was £3.2 million.  We are building in further delays to the scheme by allocating a figure of £2 million to the fund for 1989.  What is the reason for that when we are being asked to agree to a Supplementary Estimate today for £4 million which will be added to the estimate of £1.9 million?  The Minister has said that all claims on which decisions have been reached will be paid after the Supplementary Estimate is passed but there are many cases on appeal, awaiting further documentation or at other levels of investigation.  There are so many cases involved that the allocation of £2 million <Col N="412" /> for next year will be seriously short of the target.  Therefore, we will be asked once more to pass a Supplementary Estimate during the year.</P>
    <P>In January 1986 the present leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, when he was Minister for Finance removed general damages from the scheme thereby reducing the number of claims and the amount of money which could be claimed.  I was not a Member of the House at the time but I understand that Fianna Fáil vigorously opposed those changes.  For that reason I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is not introducing an amendment to the scheme, in conjunction with the Supplementary Estimate, reinstating general damages.  I urge the Minister to do so as soon as possible. It is difficult to understand how Deputy Barrett can somehow try to pretend that he is looking for changes in the scheme when he is not redressing what Deputy Dukes did in 1986.  He is not going back on what Fine Gael did in Government but he has told us that there should be changes.</P>
    <P>Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael have said they believe that a caring society should compensate its victims of crime. There should be a proper system of compensation and it should not be allowed to run riot with finance.  I am suggesting that the scheme should recognise those who are genuinely affected by crimes.  I do not see any reason that the rules of the scheme should have been changed or why they should not be altered now.  I differ from Deputy Barrett's comments about people being reluctant to go to the aid of gardaí because there is no compensation for injuries.  To be fair to the public at large the issue of compensation is not one that enters their minds if they see a garda in difficulties.  If they are going to help they will do so without giving any thought to the issue of compensation.  I do not think an offer of compensation will induce people to help gardaí.</P>
    <P>In general the vast majority of people have a good attitude towards the Garda and that should be fostered.  However, we should acknowledge that the role of the citizen is such that if he or she is <Col N="413" /> injured in the course of preventing a crime or aiding a garda proper compensation should be paid.  There should be a similar provision in regard to prison officers.  Some time ago the Prisons Officers' Association suggested that either the scheme be amended in relation to them or a new scheme, along the lines of that which applied to the gardaí, introduced. I do not understand why the scheme has not been changed because they are involved, like the Garda, in the administration of justice.  I do not see why prison officers should get the rough end of the compensation stick.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the reasons for the increase in criminal legal aid include, to a large extent, the high levels of unemployment. If we did not have such high levels of unemployment we would not have so many people qualifying for crimminal legal aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not have so much crime either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another indication that the Government have failed abysmally to address the problem of unemployment. The real economy which needs jobs and economic activity has not felt the winds of change that the Government are proclaiming are being felt by the financial sector.  We should bear that in mind.  When allocating funds for next year we should acknowledge that many of our unemployed will be eligible for criminal legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told the House that there was a 100 per cent increase in fees for submission of films to the Film Censor and that the fee now contains an element to offset previous losses in that office. While I agree with the Minister that one should make the office self-sufficient &mdash; I think that is a very fair basis on which to operate &mdash; the film distributors are getting a service which albeit is required by the legislation but they should still pay for it, but I would query slightly whether it is covered by the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, that the annual sum can in fact cover a sum over and above that which is sufficient to cover the running costs for <Col N="414" /> a year?  The Minister seems to indicate that that is now the case because of the extra element which is to offset the previous losses.  It may be a technical point but I think it is worth examining.</P>
    <P>Finally, we agree with the Supplementary Estimate.  It is about time that something was done on the criminal injuries scheme, and I urge the Minister to continue this effort and to address his mind to it when considering next year's Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also will be supporting the Supplementary Estimate which is put forward here today by the Minister for Justice.  On the question of compensation for criminal injuries, we have allowed a situation to develop by which awards which were made a year ago or more by the tribunal have still not been paid.  The purpose of the Supplementary Estimate in part at least is to remedy that situation.  In general, it is entirely wrong and unacceptable that when a tribunal eventually gets around to making an award that anything should happen other than that the amount of the award should be immediately paid.  It is incredible that we have tolerated a situation until now where a duly appointed board examine a situation and give an order directing that £X be paid to that person, and that, notwithstanding that, the person still has to wait for a year or two or three years in some cases for the award.  In no area of Government should that be allowed to happen.  Whatever schemes operate and at whatever level they operate, once in place they should be funded so that an award is made, the person gets his money when the decree is given.  The members of the public are entitled to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much comment has been made this afternoon on the history of the criminal injuries compensation scheme and how the previous Government dissipated it, which regrettably they did in 1986 to the howls of anguish and so on from Fianna Fáil.  It was not just howls of anguish that emanated from Fianna Fáil, but as can be seen from the record of this House, the present Minister for Social Welfare, <Col N="415" /> Deputy Michael Woods gave a commitment, that if Fianna Fáil was returned to office the scheme would be reinstated. I have raised questions about that since but it is obviously quite clear that there is no intention of doing that.  Of course, I have to concede that I was part of that Government but nonetheless I think the scheme was good but costly.  However, we have gone to the other extreme and it is possibly a misnomer to say that the scheme has been scaled down.  For practical purposes the scheme is gone and we are merely dealing with the arrears.  The number of cases dealt with as the scheme stands in its emasculated state is virtually negligible, and the awards to be given under it are negligible.  Most people who might conceivably have small claims under the scheme are unlikely to bring them because the legal costs are not paid in addition to the amount of the award. The scheme is virtually at a dead letter because we have gone to the other extreme.  I wonder if either solution is correct &mdash; either the position at present where the whole scheme is virtually gone or having the full scheme as was the position in 1986?  I posit the proposition for the Minister's consideration next year that perhaps the correct thing to do would be to have an arrangement somewhere between the two.  There should be some scheme, not as miserable and virtually non-existent as we have at present and perhaps not as generous as that which existed at considerable expense up until 1986.  In between those two positions there are a multitude of options that could be examined.  There are some very hard cases resulting from the dissipation of the scheme.  In certain cases people lose their livelihood or parents may be injured to such an extent that they cannot look after their children or perform their work and they are left virtually high and dry.</P>
    <P>It ought to be possible for us in this House to organise the finances, and I am sure all parties would support the view that within broad discretionary limits the criminal injuries compensation board should have a discretion in cases of <Col N="416" /> serious injury where loss of limb or loss of earning capacity would be concerned. We at least should make some provision to ensure that families who are left in that position through no fault of their own would have at least some kind of life left for themselves and for their families. Broad justice requires that.  There is a responsibility on the Government, particularly having regard to the big fuss they made in 1986 and the major opposition they mounted to consider at least reinstating the scheme, even in a reduced form, to deal with the hard cases that are undoubtedly emanating now.  They should not just sit back and let the present situation roll on as it is now.  I do not seek to exonerate myself completely from responsibility for the present position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not seek to do that but by the same token neither may the Minister sit back as relaxed as I am happy to see him appear to be now &mdash; it is nice to see some of the Ministers in good health anyway &mdash; and accept the status quo which was brought about by the previous Government.  I suppose it is a bit analogous to the position of victims of hit-and-run accidents under the Motor Insurers' Bureau scheme.  We have had the scandalous situation over the years under which hit-and-run victims had no real recourse, except in very exceptional circumstances.  I understand that is to be changed very shortly, coming up to the New Year.  This change is long overdue and I am very glad to see it.  But by the same token upstanding citizens and innocent people who may find themselves very brutally attacked and seriously injured should have proper redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have responsibility to help out and to assist our fellow men and women who, through no fault of their own but as a result of our own failure as a society in some cases, find themselves in that position.  Very many of these attacks on citizens result from our own failures in society in providing employment and social conditions for young <Col N="417" /> people, many of whom commit these attacks.  I do not say that all of them are due to that but certainly some of them are and in providing an adequate and sufficient Garda force to protect the people which we do not provide and which the Government do not provide, we have a responsibility to look after those of our citizens who are unfortunate enough to find themselves maimed and injured in criminal attacks.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about the estimate for criminal legal aid.  It is essential that people who cannot afford to be criminally represented should have legal aid provided for them and I am sure all of us support that proposition.  At the same time the way the criminal legal aid scheme was operated raises at least some questions for examination by the House. I wonder whether the scheme could be re-examined or if a different scheme could be devised that would meet the situation equally well.  I do not know whether any examination or any consideration at any time ever on the criminal legal aid side was given to deal with the situation by means of law centres. Perhaps, that was looked at and discarded at some stage, I do not know, but whether it was or not I want to at least throw out the suggestion that legal aid on the criminal side could be provided by setting up full-time State employed lawyers, both solicitors and barristers, who would operate through law centres and be available to give legal defence services to those who would be entitled to them under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether a study was ever carried out along those lines.  That kind of arrangement would have a lot of merit.  The lawyers would be full-time State employees and would have an expertise in all branches of the law.  I do not know what the relative costings of operating a scheme in that way would be <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present scheme which is operated in &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; a private enterprise type situation and under which many solicitors and barristers seem to earn very substantial sums.  I suggest to the Minister that perhaps some study could be carried out of <Col N="418" /> the possibility of organising law centres throughout the country under which full-time employees, solicitors and barristers could operate the scheme.  A better service might be made available to members of the public by that method also.</P>
    <P>Much of the cost involved in administering the scheme results from the failure to carry out any major improvements or modernisation in the whole of the criminal law administration system.  In many respects it is antiquated and no major overhaul has taken place for a very long time.  If it was overhauled and updated, and some of the old systems dispensed with, there would be improvements in the costings both of prosecution and of defence at no loss of the rights of any person who would find themselves charged before the criminal courts.  The deposition system is still there for the serious crime.  It is not as delayed as it used to be when I started practising and when these things had to be taken down in manuscript.  Nonetheless, I wonder if the whole preliminary inquiry deposition system is really necessary.  Again, it goes to the question of treating the question of prosecution as a judicial matter.  I believe it should more appropriately be an administrative decision on whether prosecutions should be brought or not.</P>
    <P>We tie ourselves up in knots in the legal systems here.  The Senezio case and all that flowed from that cost the State, in one form or another, enormous sums of money, and the issue is not yet finished. I happened to be down in the District Court this morning when District Justice Ruane was merrily striking out prosecution after prosecution by the Minister for Social Welfare involving cases of social welfare fraud amounting to a couple of hundred thousand pounds. He struck out the entire list because of a fall-out still in existence from the prosecution procedures.  I do not know why we find it so difficult to devise more simplified prosecution procedures.</P>
    <P>Those are the few points I wanted to make.  I do not now whether it would be helpful to look at the question of increasing the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court at this stage.  I suggest that <Col N="419" /> that be looked at and if it is possible to do that that is should be done.  I know there are constraints there under the Constitution under which the District Court is restricted to hearing cases of what are described as a minor nature. That definition may have some fluidity in it.  District justices by and large are skilled in the administration of criminal justice and if there is scope for increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court on the criminal side I suggest that that be seriously examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I would like to make a number of comments on the general area covered by the proposed amended Estimates presented by the Minister today. As indicated by the previous speakers, we would, in principle, be supporting the Estimates but, nonetheless have some points to make with regard to the various issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the Estimate for criminal injuries compensation is welcome.  In the debate on the Estimates in this House on 17 June last I took the opportunity in addressing the House to draw attention to the appalling situation regarding the delays then occurring in the payment of the awards made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  I then instanced a case that had come to my attention that very morning of an application arising out of a case involving an assault, on 25 September 1985 where in July 1987 the tribunal having been approached indicated that a decision might be made in or about October of that year but subsequently indicated that the decision would be delayed further.  Because adequate money was not made available to the tribunal they were not sitting to reach decisions on applications because there was no point.  In the Official Report, Volume 382, column 889, I said that money must be made available to enable that tribunal discharge all outstanding claims without delay.  Clearly I am happy with what is happening here today regarding the allocation of £4 million and the assurance which I understand <Col N="420" /> the Minister has given that by the end of this year the awards that have been decided in those 770-odd cases will be paid.  It is a welcome gesture for the time of year and no doubt the Minister will make as much hay of it as he can, and I suppose he is welcome to do so.</P>
    <P>However, that does not leave the matter well resolved.  There are as many issues now arising in this whole area as were ever there and will be after those 770 have been dealt with, the first is the remaining cases that are on the list.  The Minister must ensure that the tribunal begins to sit again at a good pace and at a pace for which they were highly regarded in the early years of this tribunal. In my early years as a practitioner I remember speaking with the secretary of the tribunal and he asked me to remind practitioners in the field that they existed and that there was recourse to compensation. It was a tribunal which was originally set up to compensate the unfortunate victims of the Dublin bombings in the early seventies and then went on to help all other victims of crime who suffered personal injury.</P>
    <P>This is a point of principle that has to be underscored.  The existence of the tribunal underlies and recognises the fact that the victims of crime are a product of our society, that we as a community are in some way, if not to a great extent, responsible for creating the conditions that produce crime and in turn we must recognise that and seek to help those that fall innocently victim of crimes perpetrated. The fact that the previous Government virtually wiped out the workings of the tribunal was something that was condemned on the day.  Even on the basis that Fianna Fáil then were so vociferous the Minister has a responsibility to redefine the terms of reference of that tribunal or, alternatively, take some action with regard to compensation for the victims of crime.  There have been a number of suggestions put to him in the House today.  In a later debate I hope he will be afforded an opportunity to respond to some of those suggestions.</P>
    <P>Nobody has advocated, nor do I, that <Col N="421" /> the scheme should be reinstated in its entirety.  But some fund must be established, on a statutory or discretionary basis, to ensure that the innocent victims of crime, placed at a monetary disadvantage, are assisted.  Whether it be a fund established within the Department or one operated by the tribunal, some fund must be established.  There are many hardship cases, people who have been disabled, who have been put out of work either temporarily or permanently, people gravely disadvanteged by injuries inflicted on them.  I would beseech the Minister not to ignore them, not to pass on from this debate in any sense of gratification at the backlog having been eliminated but rather to look to future needs in this respect.  In the context of what was suggested as a good package for the insurance industry an argument must be advanced for the introduction of some scheme similar to that operated by the Motor Insurers' Bureau, whereby insurance companies would contribute, along with Government, to a fund to compensate the innocent victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I raised in the House earlier today the plight of those victims of what is considered to be one of the most heinous crimes perpetrated today, that is the crime of rape and of serious sexual assault.  Bearing in mind that the Rape Crisis Centre is facing imminent closure, would the Minister not consider allocating, say, £200,000 out of the £400 million available to him within this Estimate to the Rape Crisis Centre as a gesture to the victims of one of the most heinous crimes committed within our society? Would it not be more meaningful to render the functions of that centre viable throughout the country for the foreseeable future and, within the Minister's Estimates for the ensuing year, make up the shortfall of the tribunal to enable them deal with their ongoing costs? The Minister has kept some of these people waiting so long &mdash; as I cited, in a case in June last &mdash; sometimes upwards of five years, a couple of months extra will not make a great deal of difference to the few, if any, who would be affected.  It <Col N="422" /> should be remembered that the awards have been made in respect of the 770 cases which will be paid and it will take the tribunal a couple of months to be fully operational and deal with the remainder.</P>
    <P>The Irish Association of Victim Support is another body who cannot go unmentioned here today.  I was amazed that no previous contributor to the debate took up their cause.  They are a nationwide support group for the victims of crime.  They counsel, assist, befriend and help victims in every way possible and have been able to survive with an allocation of as little as £10,000 per annum from the Government.  I understand that they do not now know from where any future financial help will emanate.  That is a scandalous state of affairs <i>vis-à-vis</i> an organisation who enjoy the patronage of the Presidency.  Surely they deserve better than to be completely ignored or spurned by Government?</P>
    <P>Because so little has been said by previous contributors and because I spent the substantial portion of my days in practice working as a criminal defence lawyer I should like to say something more with regard to criminal legal aid.  Despite the dramatic headlines carried in the media about individual legal earnings I must reiterate that the criminal legal aid scheme is an excellent one in terms of the service it provides and is extremely cheap for Government.  The fact that the State is required to pay £2.4 million only is remarkable when one examines the cost of providing a nationwide scheme ensuring that criminal defence is available for the thousands of cases assigned to its provisions in all courts &mdash; from the Special to the Central, to the Circuit and District courts &mdash; deploying solicitors and barristers.  When one examines the real cost the picture is even more astounding. After the deduction of VAT, automatically retained at 25 per cent, and a retention charge of 35 per cent, my estimation is that the scheme costs the State approximately £1.2 million per annum.  When one compares that amount with the position obtaining on the civil side &mdash; in the terms of law centres &mdash; one begins to appreciate the good value <Col N="423" /> provided by the solicitors and barristers who operate the criminal legal aid scheme.  Indeed I pay tribute to the very many young qualified, idealistically-driven people, who go into the district court to defend people at a very small rate of pay.  It is often forgotten that the majority of solicitors and barristers who operate the provisions of that scheme do so at a very low rate of remuneration. That must be put on the record here today.</P>
    <P>I want to take up an issue raised by Deputy Taylor, that is the fact that a public defender scheme of any type has not been introduced, though fully examined by Tormey in his report in 1976, simply because the current scheme is much more cost-effective and more capable of being controlled by the Department than any other.  That affords me an opportunity to refer to the Tormey Report of 1976 which has been ignored by every Government since its publication. Neither has any of its recommendations been addressed or dealt with.  I want to deal with one, that is the issue of extradition, today.  We had the spectacle in our courts in Portlaoise recently when lawyers who had been requested to deal with a case that would have lasted several days, involving considerable complexity, were expected to sit in court and deal with its implications for the princely sum of £75.  That is a joke.  There is no question that the extension of the criminal legal aid scheme &mdash; suggested by Tormey &mdash; to cover extradition will put money in the way of the Provisionals or anybody else like that.  Happily we lock away the Provisionals, the INLA or any other para-militaries who find their way to the Special Criminal Court, effectively using the provisions of the criminal legal aid scheme, and without grudge.  Equally if we are to extend its provisions and deal seriously with the question of extraditing these people to face trial in Northern Ireland or Britain, we should do so on a proper basis, that is that criminal legal aid be made available to fund their defence if such is to be raised.  The haphazard approach to the payment of lawyers' fees <Col N="424" /> in the District Court or elsewhere &mdash; requiring such to be raised case by case, on occasion involving the walk-out of lawyers in an endeavour to make the point &mdash; does not constitute a desirable way of dealing with the matter.  That question must be resolved once and for all.</P>
    <P>Allied to all of this and the operations of the criminal legal aid scheme is the overall dignity of the courts, particularly at district level.  The criminal legal aid scheme does not operate well in the District Court, nor does the payment to lawyers. One matter the Minister must examine is the delay in payment of fees to lawyers, who can sometimes wait six months and longer in respect of individual cases.  I wonder why the computer section within the Department is not deployed for the payment of legal aid.  It is used in maintaining records within the Department but it is not used as a medium by which the courts can relate back to the Department the amount in fees to be paid out.  A large amount of paper work needs to be done by lawyers which in turn has to be certified by clerks, the DPP's office, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Department of Justice. If an error is found along the way it is sent back down along the line.  Surely, this process can be tidied up by making better use of the computer section.</P>
    <P>When we speak of the proper working of the legal system, particularly in the criminal area, we must mention the conditions under which people have to work in the district courts.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions in this House and central to this question is the need to ensure that the courts carry out their work effectively and earn the respect of the community as a result of carrying out their duties in proper surroundings. Anyone who walks into Kilmainham district court any day and sees the conditions which exist there would feel ashamed.  It is a disgrace that the law of this land is being administered in places like Kilmainham district court, Dún Laoghaire district court and the Bridewell courts in Chancery Street &mdash; they are out of another era.  They are scruffy, <Col N="425" /> dirty and do not benefit the administration of justice as laid down in the Constitution of this land.  It is under these conditions that people who are paid a pittance under the criminal legal aid scheme have to carry out their duties.  At the end of the day this will bring the administration of justice into disrepute and will only add and lend to a continuing disregard for the law and for those who seek to administer justice in our courts. These are matters which are clearly linked to the Supplementary Estimates and I hope the Minister will take some of them on board.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the allocation of £50,000 for the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  I welcome the Minister's offer of a firm start up date for this very important legislation.  I hope he will ensure that this legislation will be in place by April of next year.  I would like to say to the Minister, as the officer who directed and steered this important legislation through the Dáil, that there does not appear to be any awareness among the public or industry of the existence of this legislation or its implications and the fact that it will be in operation by next April.  I have taken every opportunity to ask people in industry if they are aware of this legislation and appreciate its implications but they do not seem to be aware of its existence and I ask the Minister to use some of the funds being allocated in promulgating the legislation so that people will be aware of their rights under this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in relation to the Film Censor's office.  I welcome the putting on release the controversial film, as it was believed, the &ldquo;Last Temptation of Christ&rdquo;, and I pay tribute to the cinema-going public who have behaved so well and sensibly.  When one considers the attitude of the Israeli public and government and given the fact that in France only two cinemas are showing the film because of the threat of bombings one has to pay tribute to the Irish public for the way in which they have responded so maturely and sensibly.  I must say that it was a pleasure to note <Col N="426" /> that the loony rights movement stayed at home on this occasion.</P>

      <P>Before making the points I wish to make on the Supplementary Estimate, like Deputy McCartan I would like also to pay tribute to the Irish Film Censor, for trusting the Irish public to make their own decisions and to act in a responsible way.  This is a sign that as a society we are growing up.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House for too long as many of the points I wish to make have already been made but I would like to endorse what has been said in regard to the allocation under subhead G.1. &mdash; compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  I welcome this allocation which will enable the arrears to be met.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to what has been put forward in that perhaps the original scheme was very costly and that there may have been some abuses but the total denial of this scheme will lead to the victimisation of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  Perhaps another model might be considered which would mark an improvement on what has happened up until now and which will enable those who have been victimised to receive some sort of compensation, particularly in cases where people's livelihoods have been affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those who said that we must remember that the law is not just about technicalities, that is also about <Col N="427" /> catering for those who have been victimised and who have to have recourse to it.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to providing moneys, perhaps under this Estimate or from elsewhere, to the Victim Support Group.  While of course financial support is of tremendous importance psychological support is also important.  The work which the Victim Support Group do is invaluable.  I know of people who have learned to live again without fear through the support of that group.  The cost of running this service pales into insignificance when compared with the tremendous support this group provide to those who may have locked themselves away and live in a state of terror and fear until they received that support.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider providing moneys for them.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this Supplementary Estimate deals only with criminal legal aid.  Deputy McCartan made the point that this was a very cost effective scheme but I am not so sure, as some of the figures quoted in respect of some of the practitioners would seem to indicate, that this scheme is incredibly profitable for some practitioners.  I would ask the Minister to consider what Deputy Taylor suggested, that we might look at the cost effectiveness of having law centres where a mixture of free criminal legal aid and free civil aid would be provided.  I would like once again to draw attention to the urgent need to provide free civil legal aid in law centres which would provide both. In the process waste on administration might be cut.  We have admitted in recent debates that it is a scandal and amounts to a denial of justice that we do not have a free civil legal aid scheme operating in this country in the way we would like it to operate.  I do not know whether any exploration in this area has been done by the Department of Justice but as professional skills become more and more costly to the Exchequer perhaps we should look at more effective and administratively efficient ways of running the free legal aid system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> I welcome the fact that the Supplementary Estimate has taken into consideration the funding of implementation of the Data Protection Act.  I think Deputy McCartan was right that people outside and particularly victims &mdash; and sometimes it is the ordinary public who can be the victims here &mdash; do not realise the extent to which data can be stored and used against people.  They seem to be powerless to get corrections made to the data and this can damage their lives to an incredible extent.  A recent programme on British television which expressed concern about this fact reckoned that 40 million people in Britain are already recorded on computers and data banks and that most of those people are unaware of the degree of information on them the extent of the personal invasion of their privacy.  I welcome the funding of the full implementation of the Data Protection Act.  It is very important that people know their rights in this area. Under the Act there will be a right of access to this automated data which relates to people.  It is a very welcome piece of legislation and it needs all the financial support it can get to make it effective.</P>
    <P>I know some savings on pay are expected due to staff wastage and the secondment of other staff.  The Minister in his speech mentioned savings of £250,000.  While I am sure some of the auditors and accountants in the Department would immediately tell that one cannot shift money around, I would like to think that some of the savings could be used to support the victims who were already alluded to by Deputy McCartan &mdash; the victims who are given counsel and helped back to leading a normal life through the work of the Rape Crisis Centre.  I know the Minister is well aware of the critical position of this centre and its fight for survival.  When we talk about compensation to victims, both psychological and financial, in all justice and fairness we have to take into consideration the network of support which the Rape Crisis Centre gives to people. This cannot be removed from the very people who need it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> There may be a saving with regard to some of the staff within the Department of Justice but I suggest to the Minister that one area where there is a need for an increase in staff within the Department is in the section dealing with the drafting of legislation.  There is a delay at present in the drafting of, say, the Bill dealing with property in a marriage.  This is urgently needed to legislate for the judgment already made by Justice Barr in relation to the sharing of property in a marriage and the judgment on mortages which, as I know the Minister is well aware, is a cause of injustice and vulnerability to women in the home and to families. Therefore, I should like to put forward two suggestions to the Minister.  With regard to the savings there would seem to be in some areas in the Department of Justice, these savings should go towards contracting draftspeople into the Department in an effort to ensure that that legislation is brought in before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Legislation on the reform of rape laws is urgently required but we have been told that a lack of draftspeople is causing an undue delay.  If staff are seconded or brought in on contract into the Department this would be an effective way of ensuring that the legislation is brought in and would not interfere with any embargoes on staffing.  With regard to the secondment of draftspeople to help in drafting reforming legislation which has been urgently needed for so long, perhaps consideration should be given to contracting women who would know and be aware of the experiences of women who desperately need this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation with regard to DNA fingerprinting to help in coping with crime and its detection is very welcome. I should like the Minister to ensure that when the legislation is being implemented &mdash; and I hope this will be in the near future &mdash; he will have adequate funding and resources so that it can be implemented in full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil <Col N="430" /> leis na Teachtaí a chuir fáilte roimh an Meastachán Forlíontach um thráthnóna agus a bhí páirteach san díospóireacht.</P>
      <P>I am thankful to the Deputies for the general welcome which they have given to this Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice.  A number of points were raised which I will try to deal with as best I can.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to refer to the point raised by Deputy Seán Barrett who had difficulty in understanding why we had not been dragged into court with regard to the delay in paying out some of the moneys due.  In fact, as far as the delay in paying awards is concerned I understand the tribunal has been dragged into court and the High Court decided that a person who has accepted an award is not entitled to be paid in advance of moneys being provided by the Oireachtas.  Deputy Barrett suggested that the scheme should be revised and one suggested revision is that the scheme as it operated up to 31 March 1986 should be restored.  This would mean that payment could again be made in respect of pain and suffering.  Another suggestion is that the pain and suffering element should be restored in certain cases.  A strong argument can be made, for instance, that pain and suffering should be an element in the case of victims of rape.  Similarly, a strong case can be made for a person who goes to the assistance of the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions that the scheme should be revised must be viewed in the context of the history of the scheme.  As I have said already, the scheme was introduced in 1974 and in the early years of the scheme the number of claims was at a fairly modest level.  However, in the early eighties the volume of claims began to escalate and, as a result of this, the then Government decided to review the scheme as it had got extremely expensive. When the scheme was being reviewed calculations were made as to what the real cost of the scheme would be in 1986 if it were not revised.  The estimate was that the real cost of the scheme would be £11.5 million in 1986.  In other words, the first cost of the claims that would be lodged in 1986 would cost £11.5 million. <Col N="431" /> Similarly, at the time of the review the real cost of claims lodged in 1985 was estimated at £9.2 million.  I think it is clear from these figures that the scheme was escalating at an alarming rate in the mid-eighties.  It was against that background that the Government decided to review the scheme and to significantly reduce its cost by eliminating compensation in respect of pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which has to be taken into account in considering whether or not the scheme should have been revised now.  If the House agrees with the Supplementary Estimate payment of the additional £4 million, the payment of that money will, of course, be made this year.  The £4 million, plus the amount in the original Estimate, means that the award to be paid will in actual fact be £6 million.  The number of claims covered by the total amount will be approximately 1,000.  There will remain, however, a backlog of claims totalling approximately 3,000.  Deputies will readily appreciate, therefore, that there is a significant debt still to be met arising from the scheme.  By far the greater proportion of these claims relate to the scheme as it obtained up to 31 March 1986.  I would regard these claims as a first charge on any moneys available and a charge that would have to be met before consideration could realistically be given to revising the scheme in a manner that would cost more.</P>
    <P>The net point is that the revised scheme was introduced by the previous Government in the light of the escalating cost of the scheme to the Exchequer at that time. As I have said in the House on previous occasions, in the light of available resources I see no real prospect of returning to a more favourable basis for compensation under the scheme.</P>
    <P>In the context of the idea of fixed limits of compensation raised by Deputy Barrett, I think it would be interesting to look at the position that obtains in other European countries in the context of revising the scheme.  Schemes of compensation operating in the United Kingdom and Denmark are basically on <Col N="432" /> the lines of the scheme that operated here up to 31 March 1986, that is to say, payment can be made in respect of pain and suffering and there is no limit on the amount of any individual award.  In the Netherlands there are limits on maximum payments under the scheme.  A maximum of £7,000 applies to awards for material damages and there is a maximum of £3,000 in respect of &ldquo;immaterial damage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In France a maximum of £26,000 approximately applies to any individual award.  To qualify for compensation however the injury must be so serious as to keep the victim from work for at least one month or must result in some permanent disablement.  Luxembourg has a scheme in which compensation is limited to physical injury and in which a maximum of £15,000 applies.  Italy has a scheme which is restricted to public servants who are killed or incapacitated in the course of their duties.  The scheme also covers citizens who, when legally requested, assist the police and those who are killed or injured as a result of terrorist activites.  To qualify under the scheme, which provides for awards up to a maximum of £50,000, the injury must have resulted in death or at least 80 per cent incapacitation.</P>
    <P>As will be seen from the example I have given, schemes vary from State to State and most of these schemes I have referred to were not as generous as the scheme which obtained here up to 1986. Under that scheme there was no limit on the amount of an individual award. Indeed, there were several awards down through the years that ran into hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should make a final point on this question of comparing schemes with those in operation in other countries by saying that there is a Council of Europe resolution which relates to the compensation of victims of crime.  This resolution recommended that the member states provide for State compensation of victims, or dependants of victims, of international violence where compensation could not be ensured by any other means.  As a result of the resolution <Col N="433" /> the Council drew up a Convention.  One of the articles of the Convention reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Compensation should cover, according to the case under consideration, at least the following items: loss of earnings, medical and hospitalisation expenses and funeral expenses, and, as regards dependants, loss of maintenance.</P>
    <P>The minimum criteria set out in the convention are met by the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made a number of suggestions about ways in which victims should be compensated.  I will give careful consideration to these suggestions and, accordingly, I will not reply to them in detail this evening.  I will make one point of clarification, that is, that victims who claim under the scheme are expected to get compensation from the person who injured them where that is possible. Indeed, paragraph 16 of the scheme provides that any compensation so obtained must be deducted from any award made by the tribunal</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett raised the case of an individual applicant under the scheme.  I think I ought to make it clear that I cannot comment on individual claims. That is a matter solely for the tribunal and indeed there is a provision in the scheme which says: &ldquo;The Tribunal will be entirely responsible for deciding in any particular case...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley questioned my statement that the delay in making payment after an award is one year.  That statement was correct and is perfectly in line with the statement I made earlier today. That is the position.  Of course, the time taken in making payment after receipt of a claim is a different matter.  I have already indicated that a number of matters may inhibit early payment, some of them completely apart from financial availability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley raised a legal point about section 11 of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923.  She wondered if it was correct legally when setting the fees to allow for losses in the Film Censor's office in earlier years.  I think that a reasonable <Col N="434" /> reading of the section is that it does allow for this.  Obviously a fee set in advance of any year will not meet exactly the expenditure in that year.  Therefore, this should be taken into account in deciding the level of the fees subsequently.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the &ldquo;meanness&rdquo; of the scheme.  I have stated publicly on a number of occasions that any question of reintroducing a more generous scheme must await an improvement in the financial situation.  I have no doubt that when that time comes, we can give consideration to the many suggestions made for improvements.  However, I must emphasise that it is the stark reality of the situation that underlies my stance, not any sense of being protected by the fact that the scheme was cut down, as it were, by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised a number of points, apparently arising from recent views expressed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, which had to do with criminal law procedure.  It is clear in the context of the present Supplementary Estimate that I could not appropriately comment on such suggestions.  I would say, however, that there is a time and a place when such matters can be considered and if the Deputy, the Director of Public Prosecutions, or anybody who might wish to see improvements in the substantive criminal law or the law of evidence, let me have their suggestions and I will be glad to have them considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy McCartan, have suggested that the present scheme is of such limited scope as to be practically useless.  That is not correct.  The deletion from it in 1986 of `pain and suffering' may have had a drastic effect in relation to minor injuries which were not disabling and which did not cause less of earnings.  However, in <Col N="435" /> the case of very serious injuries the present scheme is extremely valuable.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan and Deputy Barnes spoke about the Irish Association for Victim Support.  I want to repeat what I have said on very many occasions, that this association are a very valuable organisation who do excellent work in helping victims of crime.  The members of the association do their work on a totally voluntary basis, and indeed, as I mentioned already, at some out of pocket expense to themselves.  The association need extra funding to develop.  The State has been willing, and is willing, to help with grants each year.  In 1986 total grants from the State came to £12,000 and in 1987 to £11,000.  By comparison, the net receipts from fund raising and subscriptions were £5,884 in 1986 and £4,326 in 1987.</P>
    <P>As I said, the work of the association is very valuable in the community and accordingly I appeal to the private sector to come forward and make additional funds available to the association.  My office will make additional information about the association available to any company who wish to provide sponsorship, and I have no doubt that the association themselves would supply any information requested if they were contacted at their office at 2 Belvedere Place, Dublin 1, telephone 364388.  I can assure any company willing to help the association that they would be helping a most deserving organisation.</P>

      <P>I wish to return to a matter raised by Deputy Barrett earlier, namely, the series of hoax devices planted around Dublin today.  The position is that an anonymous caller telephoned Downtown Radio and claimed to represent a Loyalist paramilitary organisation called The Ulster Corps.  The caller announced that <Col N="436" /> four bombs had been planted in Dublin and that they would go off at 1 o'clock. The radio station contacted the RUC and the RUC in turn contacted the Garda Síochána.  The locations given were, first, the junction at Parnell Street and Parnell Square West, second, the public toilets in O'Connell Street; third, the grounds of the Mansion House and fourth, the Talbot Memorial Bridge.  Devices were found in all four locations but they were hoaxes.  The Army carried out two controlled explosions in the grounds of the Mansion House and the other devices were cleared by the gardaí.  This particular episode was over by lunchtime. However, a further spate of hoax calls followed, some of which originated locally, I suppose one would call them copy cat calls.  In addition, a further device was found at the Royal Irish Automobile Club, Dawson Street, and, up to a short time ago, was being dealt with by the Garda and the Army.  Needless to remark, these hoaxes, even though they were dealt with promptly by the Garda and the Army, caused a certain degree of disruption of normal business and routine; in particular city traffic was disrupted.</P>
      <P>I regard these hoax calls as totally reprehensible and I urge those responsible not to waste valuable Garda resources on such matters, resources which could otherwise be used to improve the quality of life of all of us.  I want to kill the notion that the Garda have no set plan to deal with hoaxes of this kind.  Specific plans have been drawn up to deal with incidents such as those which occurred today and also with explosive devices.  These plans are kept under constant review and are updated from time to time as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the public to co-operate with the Garda and the Army in the performance of their duty in relation to these hoaxes.  I know that it is not pleasant to have Dawson Street blocked off twice in the one day but, when devices are found, steps must be taken to deal with them on the basis that they might be the real thing.  That it later transpired they were hoax devices is neither here nor there.  Until they can be sure of what <Col N="437" /> they have on their hands, the Garda and the Army have to take all necessary precautions to ensure public safety.  I hope the citizens of Dublin will co-operate with them in their task.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as important and necessary legislation which faces up realistically to the fact that there are children in our society who are threatened, abused and deprived and who need special attention and support from the State at the medical, judicial and social level if they are not to be irreparably damaged.</P>
      <P>We know the problems facing us as legislators and a previous Bill on the subject foundered under the plethora of amendments piled on to it.  This Bill does not have all the answers as no law can provide for all eventualities but we must try, and this Bill is a good attempt.  After the passage of 80 years &mdash; since the 1908 Act &mdash; this Bill has much ground to make up.  As the Minister said, there have been many changes in society affecting the lives of our children and many developments in our knowledge and thinking about what is good and appropriate in the care of our young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the only professional social worker in the House, I am glad of this opportunity to express my views on the proposals before us.  While I welcome the Bill, there are a number of gaps in it. I will be seeking clarification from the Minister on several points and seeking assurances in relation to certain matters, some of which are dealt with in the Bill <Col N="438" /> and others, surprisingly, which are not included.</P>
    <P>The very important word in the title of the Bill is the word &ldquo;care&rdquo;.  The provisions outlined are an attempt to provide for children who are not receiving suitable care in their present circumstances.  In this context, I welcome the provisions in the Bill with regard to the statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  I also welcome the provision for investigation and supervision of the pre-school playgroups, nurseries and other services for pre-school children.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that a good home is the best place for children to be reared but, sadly, this is not always the case and cannot always be provided.  In framing the laws to cater for emergencies which inevitably arise, we must never lose sight of the fact that a home atmosphere is to be preferred and that a home with a child's natural parents is the ideal at which we must aim.  In this regard the Bill has some serious flaws.  In particular, I seek clarification from the Minister regarding the various types of orders proposed in the Bill with special reference to who will be involved in the making of recommendations on which such orders may be based.  What training will they have? What funds will be provided for such training and for the necessary extension of facilities and resources implied in the provisions of the Bill?</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear the Minister's views on the establishment of a family court, separate from the existing District Court system, to deal with the whole area of children and their relationship with the laws of the land.  The adversarial quality of the present court system is not the best environment in which the needs of the children are promoted.  In such an atmosphere, the child may be seen to be the object of the law rather than the subject of the rights which should be adequately protected and sensitively administered.</P>
    <P>There is a strong fund of professional opinon and empirical investigation, as well as my own personal experience in the field, which will substantiate and buttress <Col N="439" /> this point of view.  I can appreciate that the provision of such a family court would require extensive preparation and consultation. Perhaps the Minister has decided that such a complex addition to existing court structures would unduly delay the introduction of the Bill.  There is also, of course, the consideration of the cost of such a move, especially in the present climate of re-evaluation of State expenditure.  However, it is always economic to do what is right.  Whatever the considerations, the Minister should reveal his thinking in relation to the family court.  It might be possible for him to reassure the House that such a development is receiving consideration or that he would not be adverse to the introduction of a family court in future.</P>
    <P>The expansion of services for sexually abused children at Temple Street and Crumlin Children's hospitals is to be welcomed along with the provision of £450,000 by the Minister from the national lottery funds for the assessment and investigation by health boards outside Dublin of child sexual abuse.  Such moves, as the Minister is aware, are only tokens in the direction of the wholesale revision of services needed in the child care area.  In his introductory statement, the Minister touched on several areas in which services are to be provided or new services introduced to increase the level of child care and family support.  He did not say exactly how these improvements will be provided or funded or where the greatly increased resources and facilities that are necessary will be found.  I refer in particular to the announcement that health boards will have a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and that health boards will have expanded powers to provide child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there are important provisions in the Bill imposing a clear obligation on health boards to promote children's welfare.  He said he was confident that imaginative use of the power by health boards and professional staff <Col N="440" /> will result in the development and expansion of community based facilities for children and families.  This may include, he said, more intensive social work support for families at risk, new counselling and advice services, pre-school services, home help and homemaker services, child guidance, day fostering, family resource centres and special projects for groups at risk, such as the young, the homeless and others.  All these matters will require trained staff and plenty of them.  They will also require additional facilities and resources from health boards which are already under extreme pressure to curtail services, close down facilities, restrict the use of resources and even lay off staff.</P>
    <P>The aims enunciated by the Minister are praiseworthy and would undoubtedly result in improvements in child care and family support but without commitment to the provision of funds for personnel and resources the plans are no more than daydreams.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister, in his reply to the debate, the details of what additional support will be provided to the health boards to enable them to fulfil their laudable new role.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a new statutory duty on health boards to initiate care proceedings wherever these are necessary. It imposes a requirement on health boards to make regular visits to the homes of children who are the subject of supervision orders and to provide advice and assistance for their parents.  It enables health boards to provide aftercare support and assistance to those who were previously in care.  The Bill empowers health boards to provide pre-school services and to make available information about such services.  It also imposes additional responsibility on health boards in relation to the administration of existing residential centres for children.  These are excellent developments but they are costly and in most cases will require highly trained staff and additional back-up facilities in the health board system.  I look forward to the Minister's reply to such matters.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the necessary funding <Col N="441" /> can and will be provided, I welcome very much the thrust of the Bill.  The introduction of the emergency care orders is a move which faces up to the realities of child abuse and neglect of children.  The anticipatory element to be built into the care orders is a progressive step in the proposals before us.  To anticipate a problem can often minimise it or avoid it altogether.  I have no doubt that the use of these provisions by well-trained and caring personnel will prevent many children from becoming the victims of assault or neglect.  The introduction of the supervision orders will also act to prevent more serious harm coming to children while, at the same time, avoiding the trauma of separation from the family.  This is in line with most of the enlightened thinking and research in the area of child care and reveals the Minister's concern to maintain family integrity if at all possible while, at the same time, promoting the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of the Bill has been the extension of the legal definition of a child to cover all persons under the age of 18 years.  This is a very simple but a very long overdue solution to a major flaw in existing legislation.  The Minister has recognised the fact that many young people between the ages of 16 and 18 years have in the past found themselves in a very difficult, almost limbo-like, position, without accommodation, without a job and without any source of income and, therefore, totally vulnerable to many of the adverse influences in our society.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that he should consider the establishment of centres for people in the 16 to 18-year old age group, similar to those which I was professionally associated with in Scotland.  In those centres young people would receive advice and guidance from trained house parents, which would prepare them socially and practically to take their place in society.  Having worked with that teenage group, I think it is very important that they be given a good preparatory start to life.  They would learn from their house parents and, with some independence away from the care of such <Col N="442" /> people, would always be able to come back to the house parent to discuss any problems that might arise in relation to finding a job or the day-to-day problems of growing up.  I recommend that the Minister consider this matter in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and its aims and also the range of developments and extensions that are being proposed for the child care services.  The Minister has shown deep concern for the deprived and the endangered children in our society.  We have waited a long time &mdash; since 1908 &mdash; for this Bill.  When I started college we studied the 1908 Act and when I finished college we were still studying it.  Many people are looking forward to the passage of this Bill.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister the details of his excellent plans which have been brought before us.  I hope they can be brought to fruition.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not a new Bill in so far as the previous Government presented the Children (Care and Protection) Bill in 1985.  There was an extensive Second Stage debate on that Bill and the House is again debating this subject. Since then I have been appointed Fine Gael spokesman on health and I will be dealing with this Bill on all Stages, along with my colleague, Deputy Alan Shatter, who as a family lawyer is renowned for his expertise in this area.  Before I deal with the meat of the Bill I would like to compliment Deputy Mary Coughlan for her first-hand knowledge of this matter. She is right in criticising the lack of resources at health board level and the lack of planning by this Government in dealing with the child care problems that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael welcome this Child Care Bill in principle.  However, we will be seeking on Committee Stage to remedy a number of serious deficiencies and inadequacies in the Bill by way of amendments. Specifically throughout this debate we will be seeking to ensure that the following four objectives are adhered to: first, that this Bill sets out a clear set of rights for children, with their welfare as <Col N="443" /> the paramount concern; secondly, an updating of the law to allow the child care authorities to intervene effectively by way of proper back-up support to families in need, adequate supervision for children at risk or the provision of sufficient alternative care, be it foster care or residential care; thirdly, we will be seeking from the Government a commitment of resources to ensure a uniform, standard, minimum level of child care services across the country and, fourthly, as it is 80 years since the last child care legislation was introduced we will be proposing the establishment of an independent national children's council to monitor the legal framework and State services for children on a national basis. In order that this House will be asked to intervene more than once every 80 years, we will be putting forward an amendment, which I will deal with later in some detail, to establish a national children's council which will have an independent monitoring and review role in relation to child care services.</P>
    <P>Within these overall objectives we seek a number of specific changes which will set out a more comprehensive legal framework to meet the growing needs of our children.  Fine Gael fundamentally believe we have an obligation to speak up for those children whose voices cannot be heard.  We believe fundamentally that investment in children is a sound investment in the future.</P>
    <P>In terms of protecting the rights of children I am concerned first about the constitutional and legal position where there is a conflict between the rights of welfare of children and parental rights to custody.  Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution confer on parents &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; and similar rights with regard to the education of their children.  Article 42 also confers similar rights on children.  However, these latter rights seem less important and less qualified for constitutional protection than the rights of parents in the context of a married couple.  I am referring specifically to the Supreme Court <Col N="444" /> decision in March 1985 in the case of MC and MC and KC and AC <i>v</i> An Bord Uchtála.  The unanimous five judge verdict stated: &ldquo;The State cannot supplant the role of parents in providing for the infant the rights to be educated conferred on it by Article 42.....&rdquo;.  Effectively this Supreme Court judgment showed that the court could not constitutionally decide the issue of a custody contest solely on the basis of what course of action is in the best interests of the child's welfare.  If one interprets this judgment it seems that it is not constitutionally permissible, especially for legitimate children &mdash; that is children within wedlock &mdash; to regard the childrens' welfare as the paramount consideration, which in our view is the reasonable objective.</P>
    <P>In a further case of the Supreme Court on 22 June 1977, J. <i>v</i> D., it seems the rights of children are subservient to the inalienable and imprescriptible and paramount rights of the parents.  I understand there have been at least two cases of potential constitutional proceedings against the existing 1908 Children Act and that those cases were not heard for fear among the child care authorities of the Act being found to be unconstitutional or constitutionally infirm, with the cases subsequently being settled by agreement.  Therefore, we have this cloud of a constitutional question arising over this Bill, the 1908 Act and the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  This must be resolved.</P>
    <P>As a first step in clarifying and establishing unambiguous rights for children as to their welfare being the most important issue in any conflict, we should insert &mdash; as Fine Gael will seek in the course of this debate to insert &mdash; into the Bill a premable declaring the rights of children. I would propose that we insert a section which would set out these rights using the international criteria set out in the UN Charter for Children in 1979.  Unfortunately, in no law nor in any part of the Constitution is there any such declaration of children's rights to date.</P>
    <P>Not being a lawyer myself, I cannot state with certainty the constitutionality of this Bill.  However, to clear up any <Col N="445" /> doubts, I would favour this Bill being referred by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution to test its constitutionality. It is vital that this legal issue be clarified in view of the ineffectiveness and questions as to the effectiveness as regards section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 in the light of the Supreme Court cases I have referred to.  Personally I would not be opposed to a constitutional referendum and amendment which stated expressly that all children have equal rights under the Constitution and that in the context of the rights of children where a conflict arises with parental rights the paramount and first interest should be the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>In referring to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 I would also favour, in cases where there are disputes of custody between parents, the judge should be given power not only to award the child to one parent or another but should be allowed to put the child into care under the care proceedings of this Bill.  I also believe additional powers are required to be given to the court in such a case under the Act in monitoring the child's care and powers to make some parents co-operate where necessary.</P>
    <P>A serious aspect of concern I have in relation to the operations of this legislation relates to the role of the District Courts.  The last speaker, Deputy Coughlan, referred very articulately to this.  It is obvious that the District Courts is not suitable and is inadequate in a number of respects to deal with this legislation. These cases are by their nature very sensitive and complex.  District Court justices to be eligible have a background of a minimum requirement of ten year's practice as a solicitor.  With due respect to them, I feel they lack the relevant qualifications and specialist training for child hearings.  It is vital, perhaps on a pilot basis initially that a family or children's court hear the cases intended under this legislation.  Such a court should also include the right where necessary for the child's own legal representation to be attached to the court.  Other countries have clearly established what is called a <Col N="446" /> children's advocate whereby in difficult cases the child, as well as the parents and the health board, can be separately and individually represented.  Hearings in such a family or children's court should be as informal as possible with the court having certain powers in determining certain cases.  By this I mean access to the maximum amount of information such as medical examinations, psychologists' reports and so on, and that the power would be given to the justice to commission such information.  Child welfare services could and should be linked to these courts.  For example, I note that in Australia in 1975 there was passed a family law Act establishing such different courts there.</P>
    <P>The nature of the District Courts is that you have a wide variety of different types of criminal cases and long waiting lists and the whole environment is very intimidating and unsuited to the hearing of these types of delicate cases.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister for Health or his Minister of State to clarify or resolve or state a commitment to rectify a number of points between now and Committee Stage in order to deal with this Bill expeditiously and satisfactorily.  Perhaps some of them are already dealt with in the 64 sections of this Bill and, if so, Fine Gael will only be too happy to support them.  These points include: first, a level of immunity should be given to general practitioners, public health nurses and other relevant health service personnel and bona fide members of the community who report to the child care authorities cases of feared abuse of children.  I am talking about a third party here referring to the health board or the child care authority their possible concern about abuse or neglect in a family situation.  As I understand it, in the present law there is a scope for civil suits of defamation against well meaning third parties in bringing concerns to the relevant authorities. Obviously, this immunity would have to be balanced to ensure that the reports were of bona fide concern and not of a malicious intent.  This, I think, is one of the weaknesses of the Bill.  Such limited immunity should be conferred on such <Col N="447" /> people so that we have a community response to child care problems.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it should be mandatory that all cases of suspected neglect or abuse of children be reported and recorded by the child care authorities.  I understand there is no such provision in the present legislation. This legislation gives the health boards the powers of operating our child care services.  I am not opposed to this in terms of the present health structures under the 1970 Act as they are the obvious channel of authority.  However, in certain instances where there may be gaps in the boards' personnel or resources to meet child care needs, this legislation should allow, subject to ministerial approval, a voluntary agency to provide child care services on a contract basis. This would not only fill gaps where they arise but would give perhaps better value for money.  In this regard I am concerned with the narrow focus of sections 3, 4 and 14 of the Bill.  Such a contract of service to a voluntary organisation concept could be a valuable blueprint for child care services nationally.  It could also be part of an overall uniform national code of practice for each health board to follow in providing services.</P>
    <P>The powers in the Bill conferred on gardaí in taking children to places of safety should be extended so that those powers would also be available in a substitutional way to health board personnel. I do not think it appropriate in relation to orders for places of safety and so on that gardaí exclusively should be dealing with this matter.  I envisage in terms of substitution that social workers and other staff where appropriate would substitute for gardaí.  I also believe the present role and structure of school attendance officers should be altered to include them in local community care teams dealing with children.  They should be renamed school welfare officers and brought under the direct responsibility of the health services.</P>
    <P>This legislation seems to respond to children at risk by way of powers to remove children, where necessary, from the family environment.  In a number of <Col N="448" /> cases it may be more appropriate to legislate in such a way as to remove the offending adult from the family environment rather than the child.  This could be done by extending barring orders as one method.  I would favour a clear provision in this Bill and powers in this legislation to facilitate such a response by the authorities where they consider it appropriate. It is not clear from this legislation what the precise protocol of the intervention process will be.  This needs to be clarified either in the relevant section of the Bill or by subsequent ministerial regulation. In this regard the rights of parents also need to be clarified so that they have access to any reports prepared against them.  They have a right to know what they are accused of and this is not stated in the Bill.  Similarly, the question of parental consent or lack of it is not clarified satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>In relation to supervision orders it is not defined how often a social worker should visit a family &mdash; once a week, once a day or once a month.  A 12 month period for a supervision order seems to me to be somewhat too short.  Moreover, in relation to the extension of supervision orders, we need to lay down clear criteria to avoid some of the problems that have arisen in relation to the extension of barring orders.  There is no doubt that different district justices take different interpretations in relation to the renewal of such orders.  One can have a situation whereby if an adult is absent from the family environment one judge could decide that because the problem was not happening over the last year, sexual abuse to a child or whatever it might be, there was no need to renew the order by virtue of the fact that the reason for creating it no longer existed.  In those terms the justice would be quite right in interpreting it thus and not renewing the order.  However, another justice might take the view that there was the potential for the abuse to recur if the order was not renewed.  The circumstances whereby an extension of either a care order or a supervisory order would be carried out are not clear.  Moreover, it has to be stated that it is not clear what would <Col N="449" /> happen in the interim after a care order or a supervision order had expired and while further proceedings were pending. It is not clear whether one would have a temporary limbo and that needs to be clarified.  I strongly believe that until the justice decides otherwise that order should continue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the legal ages as defined in this Bill I favour the definition of a child to mean a person up to the age of 18 years.  In the last Government's care and protection Bill in regard to children the age limit was 15 years.  That was, in my view defective especially in families where there are five or six children and, because of the age definition, some would be in care and some out of it.  This lack of restriction is a positive step.</P>
    <P>However, I will be seeking, on Committee Stage, to change the age of criminal responsibility from the present age of seven years to 14 years.  It is disgraceful in the eighties that we would consider that children under 14 were over the age of criminal responsibility.  It is not fair; it is not conducive to their future development. I do not feel that tying them into the criminal process and the whole processs of punishment and retribution is right, and I will be seeking to have that doubled to 14 years of age.  I believe the views that set that up in the first place are now outdated.</P>
    <P>The question of financial resources for child care services will determine the enforcement and success of this legislation. To date, child welfare services have been tacked on to the end of an overburdened health board structure in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  The nature of child care needs does not conform to a 40 hour week but rather a seven day, 168 hour week.  Resources mean staff numbers, including social workers and specialists such as psychologists, and an inspectorate to deal with standards.  It means care facilities, including short and long-term residential homes, and sufficient numbers of foster parents.  Resources also mean community care centres from which child care teams can be based and that can act as a central focal point for the referral of children.  These three requirements of <Col N="450" /> adequate staff, adequate care facilities of a residential nature and referral centres must be put in place by the Government if this legislation is to work.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to table amendments to specify levels of resources to deal with this problem.  I do not believe that this is the correct approach, but I can say that I, and Fine Gael are committed to child welfare and its proper funding and we will be asking the Minister, before this legislation is enacted, to specify exactly what allocation will be made within the community care budget and the primary care budget to provide for the special needs of children.</P>
    <P>Legislation is one thing, enforcing it is another and we have an age old tradition here of aspirational legislation but a total lack of follow-up and enforcement.  In this House I will be ensuring accountability of this Minister, his Department and the health boards to ensure that this reform becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out the provision of child care advisory committees attached to regional health boards.  We support this. However, for them to be successful they have to be representative of the relevant experts and voluntary organisations dealing with children and the consumers of the service.  Section 5, dealing with these committees, is clearly inadequate.  On Committee Stage we will be seeking to ensure that these committees effectively monitor the work of the health boards by being given powers in the following areas: access to information; recourse to a panel of experts; power to make recommendations for the improvement of services; be a consultative body to voluntary organisations; produce accountable annual reports, be empowered to hear submissions from children and carry out visitations of centres; be allowed to promote the development of child care services in the region; draw attention to cases as they see fit, and also to specify any review of the needs of children in their area.  So we see a very clear role for these advisory committees.  We believe that that is not set out in section 5.  If the Minister seeks to set it out by way of ministerial regulation we would want to <Col N="451" /> know, before we approve that section, exactly what those regulations will be.</P>
    <P>The further role of these regional advisory committees should be to co-ordinate with a national children's council which would be independent by way of its research and planning role from the Department of Health.  I am confident that Fine Gael will be able to obtain the support of all Deputies in relation to the establishment of a national children's council.  There was a clear consensus amongst every group working in child care that there is a need for such an independent review of services and structures. I would ask the Minister to take this on board in a constructive fashion. Such a council would ensure full accountability for the child care services across the country.  This was recommended as far back as the Kennedy report on child care services in 1970.  It was again recommended in section 533 of the task force report on child care services in 1981.  Such a council is vital to obtaining and continuing high standards of child care.</P>
    <P>Paramount in the operation of this legislation must be proper consideration for the wishes of the children in question. There are a number of sections in this Bill where we feel this is understated or not alluded to at all.  We will be seeking to insert the words: &ldquo;giving due regard to the wishes of the child&rdquo; into a number of sections.  I am aware that this issue is not clearcut.  For example, would a daughter aged six or eight years of age, express her correct wish as regards remaining in a family home if she was being sexually abused by a male adult.  I appreciate there are sensitive concerns in this regard.  However, the spirit of this legislation and its abiding principle must not be to foist on children the views of adults to the exclusion of their own wishes.</P>
    <P>In terms of alternative care for children, I am extremely supportive of the maximum level of foster care.  I want to place on record my admiration for the work and role of foster parents.  Their rights are not clearly defined in the Bill. Should their rights to adoption increase <Col N="452" /> after a given period of fostering?  If so, how long should that period be?  Should they be given a clear right, including the right to free legal aid where appropriate, to be fully represented at any court hearings affecting the children?  A clear appeal process for both natural and foster parents should be set out in the Bill.  In order to promote more foster resource groups within health boards we need to look again at the rate of remuneration, currently of the order of £35 per week. We need a further inclusion at health board level of respite fostering services for short stay cases.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the major differences between the Bill and the legislation introduced by the previous Government in 1985 is the absence of Part V which dealt with the rights of foster parents.  I agree that there were major problems with that provision in terms of its interaction with other legislation and the difficulty of defining the rights of foster parents but the Bill makes no attempt to deal with those issues. Effectively, the issue has been fudged. We will be seeking some definition of the rights of foster parents.</P>
    <P>I support the call for minimum standards for residential care facilities, pre-school facilities, and other child facilities. For some time the basic standard of buildings has left a lot to be desired and it is right that there should be minimum standards with proper supervision by an adequate inspectorate.  In relation to pre-school facilities, I should like to state that we shall be tabling an amendment to reduce the age from six years to four years in relation to the definition of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>Another legal area that I would like to have clarified relates to the definition of a parent.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;parents&rdquo; includes a surviving parent and, in the case of a child in respect of whom there is in force an adoption order made under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, means the adopter or adopters or the surviving adopter under that adoption order.</P>
    <P>What is the legal position of the natural <Col N="453" /> father of a child born outside marriage? By that I mean a child of an unmarried mother or the child of a second marriage based on a church annulment or a foreign divorce.  In the latter case the father of a second household is as real a parent as any other definition of parent we might like to attribute.  The Minister should consider redefining &ldquo;parent&rdquo; from its present definition to include a biological link, where applicable.  I would appreciate the Attorney General's view on this matter.  Moreover, where children are in care, should we not consider adding in the power of a maintenance order that such fathers should, where possible, contribute to the cost of the welfare of those children.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that legislation dealing with children has been so shabbily treated to date.  It seems incredible that we should be operating on a 1908 Act that was passed, not here, but in Westminster. That Act was changed in the twenties. We should have one comprehensive piece of legislation incorporating not only the contents of the Bill but past and future topics such as the status of children, adoption laws and juvenile justice legislation. This piecemeal approach by different Departments has led to a great deal of legal confusion.  To avoid a repetition of this we need to co-ordinate the efforts and work of different Departments, of Education, Health and Justice.  That can either be done through the proposed national council or through some interdepartmental structure.  The Minister should give a commitment that the wrongs of the past will not be repeated due to a lack of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the early scrutiny of the provisions on Committee Stage.  Fine Gael will not be opposing the passage of Second Stage of the Bill and I hope the Minister will adopt an open and constructive position in response to our constructive proposals.  Ultimately, it is imperative that we take this opportunity, the first one in 80 years and the last time for many years, to update this vital area of our legislation.  I should like to assure the Minister of State that we will be approaching the Bill in a constructive <Col N="454" /> way.  We intend tabling more than 20 amendments for Committee Stage but we will be flexible in our approach to them. There are gaps in the Bill and it is important that we deal with Committee Stage at an early date.  Adequate time should be allowed to Members to scrutinise the provisions effectively.  This is one of the most important welfare areas of State services which has been added to the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>It pleases me greatly to be afforded an opportunity to get involved in this debate.  Before I entered the House I heard politicians, and others, expressing <i>ad nauseam</i> the need to introduce social legislation and, in particular legislation that would deal with the care of children but there was no positive action.  I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the Minister for introducing the Bill at this early stage of his term of office, particularly bearing in mind his massive workload.  The Minister's initiative typifies the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Government. There has been a great deal of lip-service paid to the need for social legislation up to now but it is apparent from the Minister's action that there is a political will to focus on it and act positively.  Apart from the introduction of the Bill the Minister must be lauded for steps he has taken to effect improvements in the area of child care.  The new child abuse guidelines, which contain comprehensive information with regard to the recognition and reporting of incidents of child abuse, issued by his Department were welcomed by all.  Directors of community care are now obliged to have all reported cases of child abuse investigated even where the report is made anonymously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the Minister provided £500,000 in an effort to achieve improvements in the child care area.  It seems incredible, bearing in mind the many changes in Irish society and the new attitudes and values obtaining in 1988, that we are still dependent on archaic legislation, laws which date back to the Victorian era.  Lest there be any doubt as to the dire need for this legislation, I should <Col N="455" /> like to quote startling and significant statistics. The number of Irish children in care at 1 November 1987 was 2,706.  Of that figure 1,824 children were in foster care and 882 in residential care.  The majority of children in care had been placed there by their parents on a voluntary basis because of the inability of the parents, for a variety of reasons, to properly look after the children. However, another type of case that warrants a child being taken into care is one of greater concern.  I am referring to cases where a child has to be removed from the home because of abuse, physical, psychological or sexual.  The number of cases of child abuse, that is abuses of all kinds, reported in 1984 was 495.  Of that figure, 182 cases were confirmed and included in it were 64 cases of child sexual abuse of which 33 were confirmed.  In 1985 the number of cases reported rose to 767, an increase of 55 per cent.  Of that number 304 cases were confirmed, an increase of 67 per cent on the 1984 figures.  The reported figure for child sexual abuse in 1985 rose to 234, an increase of 260 per cent.  Of this number reported, 133 cases were confirmed, giving a massive increase of 303 per cent over the 1984 figures.  In 1986 the overall number of reported cases of abuse rose again, this time to 1,015, an increase of 32 per cent over 1985.  Of these, 494 cases were confirmed, an increase of 63 per cent over the previous year.  The reported figure for child sexual abuse in 1986 rose to 475, an increase of 103 per cent.  Of this number reported, 274 cases were confirmed, giving an increase of 100 per cent over the 1985 figures.  In summary, in the three year period to which I refer, 1984-86, inclusive, there was an increase of 105 per cent in reported cases of overall child abuse, and an increase in the confirmation of these cases of 171 per cent. In the same three year period the number of specifically child sexual abuse cases reported increased by 642 per cent and there was in increase of 730 per cent in the confirmation of these cases.</P>
    <P>While I am not yet <i>au fait</i> with the figures for 1987, I am reliably informed <Col N="456" /> that the trend continues to show an increase.  The huge and dramatic rise in the number of cases of child sexual abuse is one of the main features of these figures. This entire area is only beginning to open up and it is imperative that it be extensively and carefully analysed by all relevant agencies and professionals.  This malaise would appear to manifest itself throughout the social classes and across the rural-urban divide.</P>
    <P>I note with satisfaction that in introducing this legislation, the Minister has taken cognisance of the views and suggestions of interested groups and voluntary organisations with special interest, experience and expertise in this field. These people have been doing trojan work, but unfortunately much of it has gone unnoticed and unheralded.  An example of the commendable and worthwhile efforts of these people is the new &ldquo;childline&rdquo; which was introduced in February last by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. According to the ISPCC, since this line was set up 9,696 calls were received from children who were experiencing some form of distress.  The most serious aspect of this information is that of this approximate 10,000 phone-ins, 1,677 calls came from children who were suffering abuse either of a physical, emotional or sexual nature.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear some of the negative comments which were made during the earlier stages of this debate with regard to the comprehensive nature of the Bill.  I not only have studied carefully the legislation but have taken the trouble to talk to interested and qualified people, such as social workers and other professionals for the purpose of seeking their comments and general reaction.  I have been gratified by their response. This legislation is generally well received and is seen as achieving its objective of rationalising the law in relation to the care of children for the first time in 80 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to elaborate on some aspects of the Bill which I consider to be particularly welcome improvements. This Bill gives specific roles to the health <Col N="457" /> boards and the Garda.  It places a statutory duty on health boards with regard to the proper care and well-being of children. It increases the powers of health boards in the area of child care and family support services.  In cases where children are deemed to be in serious danger, there is provision whereby immediate positive action can be taken by the Garda and health authorities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of supervision orders and care orders is innovative and welcome, as is the introduction of procedures for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services and the revised provisions in the Bill to facilitate the control of residental centres for children who have to be taken into care.  The new definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; in the Bill as a person under 18 years is a progressive move.  Social workers will consider it most helpful to have this new facility which will enable children to be received into care up to the age of 18 years.  The supervision orders, which are totally new and are introduced in this Bill, represent a major improvement. I believe the supervision order will be viewed by social workers as an extremely welcome innovation.  Properly used it can prove to be an important and vital mechanism in the achievement of improvements in the child care area. However, there may be a temptation to over-use this instrument.  The supervision order must not be used to avoid making difficult decisions, for example, rather than taking a decision to receive a particularly affected child into care, there could be a temptation to deal with the situation to deal with the situation <i>via</i> a succession of supervision orders.  The section indicates that the supervision order would be of 12 months duration and would be renewable.  The fact that it is renewable is most useful and meritorious.  But as I have said it ought not to be inappropriately used or used in cases where the care order rather than the supervision order would be more in keeping with the requirements of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 17 which covers access to children in care is also welcome.  It enables the court to make orders as to the access of parents and others to the children in <Col N="458" /> care.  While it is most desirable that parents in certain circumstances be allowed to maintain regular contact with a child when kept in care, it would be most important that the court would have due regard to the views and opinions of the professionals in the health boards when making these orders.  There would be little point in allowing access facilities which are unsuitable or unmanageable so far as the child, the foster parents or the residential care staff are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am particularly enamoured by the concept of fostering.  This method of caring for the child who has for certain reasons to be taken from his natural parents, can offer much more to the child in certain circumstances than the institutionalised situation.  The fostering system allows for the inclusion of the child in a new and improved family environment which is more natural than that which the institution can offer.  Fostering is also a much more cost effective method of child care, costing only one-third of residential care.  This does not take into account the cost incurred in the recruitment of foster parents.</P>
    <P>In order that this long awaited legislation be comprehensive, it must address all areas and situations with which children are involved and to which they can be vulnerable.  With the introduction in the legislation of measures to facilitate the inspection and supervision of pre-school services, the Minister has provided for control of a potentially hazardous area.  I am sure that this measure will be welcomed by the many genuine and caring people who currently run such services as crèches, play schools, play groups, etc.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the control of solvents in section 58.  This area has long been the subject of major public concern. Solvent inhalation, or glue smiffing as it is more commonly called, has long been a plague on our society.  Serious illness and sometimes fatal consequences has been the outcome for many a child who partakes in this dangerous craze.  It is good to see that the Minister to some extent has addressed this highly complex problem, he has provided for fines of up <Col N="459" /> to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment for the offence of selling such products to children where there is knowledge or suspicion that they will be abused.  Quite apart from the matter of legislation for the control of this phenomenon, I believe it behoves every responsible adult in this country, be he or she parent or otherwise, to be vigilant in this area and to endeavour to exhort, advise and inform children of the hazards involved in even the most trivial experimentation with these dangerous solvents.</P>
    <P>I have come across cases of child abuse in my own area.  I have become aware of the results of a specific localised study in this field which was startling in the extreme.  That is why I wanted to take part in this debate and I am grateful to the Minister for introducing this long overdue legislation.  The Minister's action is all the more commendable when one considers that he is legislating for the well-being of children in a country which pecentage-wise has the largest child population of any country in Europe.  It is my hope now that, having waited the best part of a century for this legislation, its provisions can proceed to be implemented expeditiously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineKennedy" hpid="Miss Kennedy Miss Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Miss Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as an attempt, but a rather poor one, to establish a system of child care in Ireland. I say that it is a poor attempt because the public, in recent years, has come to openly acknowledge the prevalence of child abuse and Deputy Jacob has given us some interesting figures on this.  The public would go a long way towards giving legislators extra powers to defend the area of children's rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read the earlier contributions made to this debate and because of the continued references to how this Bill may be construed in the light of the Constitution I would like to say that as legislators we should not be timid or afraid to introduce legislation that may have to be resolved eventually in the courts.  What is often forgotten in this House is that the construction of the Constitution <i>via</i> the <Col N="460" /> courts allows for a presumption of constitutionality in regard to all Acts of the Oireachtas.  In recognising this, we should go further and state that it has been the courts and not this House that has provided the principal impetus for social change and development in Ireland for the last two and a half decades.  I am confident that the courts will continue to lead the Oireachtas in protecting and vindicating the rights of all citizens including children in the years to come. I am also confident that they would not be slow to endorse any attempt by the Oireachtas to introduce worthwhile child care protection.  In fact, they would probably go further and provide for all those matters which we have overlooked here over the years by way of judge-made law.  Before dealing with the principle of this Bill, I should like, <i>en passant,</i> to put on record that the Progressive Democrats acknowledge fully the rights of children so much so that we have given them a special status in our proposed new draft Constitution.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in broad terms, the purpose of this Bill.  I regret to say, however, that it is a far cry from the comprehensive children's code which has been promised in this country for so long to up-date the Children Act of 1908.  After 80 years, there are a number of questions that can legitimately be raised about this Bill: the fact that it gives jurisdiction to the District Court in relation to child care and, secondly, the increased powers and workload placed on the health boards.  The increased powers given to the District Court and the health boards governing the way in which these new child care services are to be delivered are a cause for some concern and reservation in the Progressive Democrats.  We will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage of this Bill.  There is a general agreement across this House that there is a crying need for a comprehensive system of child care and, in principle, the provisions of the Bill are welcome. However, it is worth noting a few reservations at this stage.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem for us is presented by the fact that jurisdiction is given to the <Col N="461" /> District Court in relation to child care under this Bill.  We do not feel the District Court is the appropriate court to deal with the matters covered by the Bill &mdash; in particular, ill-treatment, neglect and sexual abuse.  From our experience of the courts in dealing with family law matters which are similar to these types of problems, allegations of sexual abuse are extremely complex and difficult to deal with and require tremendous care and attention because they may also involve a criminal element or a criminal complaint in relation to an allegation of abuse.</P>
    <P>The everyday business of the District Court would not allow for the time and the care that would be necessary to consider these matters.  District justices are obliged to deal with things quickly and, in general, do not hold extensive inquiries into the problems that come before them. This is not their fault, but rather the fault of the system that they have had to operate and the limited resources that are allowed to them.  Even if district justices have the time and the resources to deal with these serious questions, we still do not believe that it is the appropriate court to deal with the problems covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is required instead, we believe, is a family court to deal with the matters that arise under the Bill and all other family matters that are presently being dealt with in the District Court &mdash; such as barring orders &mdash; and those matters dealt with in the Circuit Court and the High Court.  We would like to see the establishment of a family court, by legislation, in conjunction with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty with the Bill and a much more serious one if we are unable to persuade the Government to the wisdom of having a family court dealing exclusively with these matters, is that under section 11, once the district justice has made a care order, that is the end of the role played by the court itself.  From that moment on, the care of children falls to civil servants and is not capable of sufficient and adequate review by the court that made the original order.  We believe that there is far too much <Col N="462" /> unsupervised State control and interference in the management of children from that point onwards.</P>
    <P>Under section 15, subsection (8), there is an attempt to provide a comeback provision so that the court may vary its original order.  We do not feel that this is a sufficient safeguard in the circumstances because it limits the right to come back to the court to parents of the child or to officials of the health board.  We believe that there would be circumstances where an aunt, an uncle, a grandparent or, even an elder brother or sister or some friend of the family that had an established relationship with the children, as is often the case in relation to unmarried mothers and their children, should be enabled to do so as well.  Therefore, as a minimum, we feel that the control of the court should be expanded and involve greater supervision of the civil servants and officials of the health boards and that the list of persons who can apply to the court should be expanded to take account of the realities of family life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are not completely satisfied with this last proposal though it would improve the Bill.  We have noted, for example, that the Bill and the powers it seeks to give health boards effectively encroach on the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court in relation to wards of court.  If this Bill passed as it stands, it would exist in parallel to the High Court wards system which we feel is a far better system for the control and management of the care of children because it tends to take greater care in making its decisions. I question whether the two systems now envisaged by the Minister would be incompatible.</P>
    <P>The preferred solution is for the establishment of a family court which would take over the jurisdiction that the High Court presently has in relation to wards of court and the responsibilities that this Bill seeks to confer on the District Court and the health boards.  We recommend that this proposal be pursued actively because, aside from its legal practicality, it has the benefit of being a measure which would secure the confidence of the public at large especially in the face of a <Col N="463" /> threat to the family from over-involvement by the State.</P>
    <P>A further item relating to the care given to the making of decisions regarding a child is that some provision should be made for the appointment of qualified persons, legal or otherwise, who are independent of the family and who are also independent of the Civil Service and health boards, who would be assigned by the court to argue specifically for the child's welfare and who would be capable of contradicting a health board proposal with regard to a care order.  At present, there exists in the High Court a provision for such an appointment, known as a &ldquo;guardian <i>ad litem</i>&rdquo;, who is appointed to legally represent a child or a mental defective.</P>
    <P>The one provision we would welcome wholeheartedly, especially following the publication of our new draft Constitution, is the provision contained in section 57 which abolishes the death penalty in respect of children who have been found guilty of a capital offence which carries the death penalty.  That is the single most positive proposal in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main axis on which this Child Care Bill is based, that is the placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection; the strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services; improved procedures to facilitate immediate intervention by health boards and the Garda where children are in serious danger; revised provisions to enable the court to place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk, in the care or under the supervision of health boards; the introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services; and revised provisions in relation to the inspection and approval of residential care centres for children.</P>
    <P>While the last two provisions are very <Col N="464" /> welcome, the introduction of arrangements, for the first time, for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services &mdash; of which the Minister estimated there are some 1,400 to 1,500 different services catering for approximately 20,000 pre-school children, and the inspection and approval of residential centres for children, I have grave reservations about the extra powers being given to the health boards in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In this respect, I found Deputies Flaherty's and Yates' contributions quite interesting.  While Deputy Flaherty raised many legitimate questions about the extra powers being given to the health boards she failed to recognise the current thinking in the leadership of her party, Fine Gael, that all eight health boards should be abolished.  There would seem to be an inconsistency, to say the very least, in her party's approach.  It is because I share the views of the leadership of her party about the health boards that I have grave reservations about the new powers being given them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Given the manner in which the health boards have operated the health service over the last 18 months, the Progressive Democrats would have grave reservations about amplifying and enlarging their powers to deal with the question of child neglect and abuse.  There is little mention in the Bill of how these extra powers will be executed.  Furthermore, there is practically no provision for extra resources and manpower to be made available to the health boards to carry out the new duties being given them in the whole child care area.</P>
    <P>For example I note that the Minister for Health, in his contribution last June, mentioned that he had allocated special funds of £450,000 from his Department's share of the national lottery to the health boards outside of Dublin to enable them improve their capacity for the assessment and investigation of alleged cases of child abuse, including sexual abuse.  Is this to be a once-off contribution from one year's allocation of the national lottery?</P>
    <P>Can the seven health boards, outside of Dublin, also expect to receive almost <Col N="465" /> half a million pounds as a constant contribution to their budget to carry out the important powers given them in this Bill? A secondary point is that 41 per cent of our population is covered by one health board, that is Dublin.  Where is there provision in the Bill for the other seven health boards, outside of Dublin, for any extra funding required &mdash; from the lottery or otherwise &mdash; to enable them exercise their functions?  All in all, this <i>ad hoc</i> dependence on the lottery is no substitute for long-term fiscal planning.  I should like the Minister to address that point in his concluding remarks.</P>
    <P>Besides the important questions of the powers and resources of the health boards, I note that the Irish branch of the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education and the senior social workers' group here have entered a number of reservations about the proposed powers being given to those health boards.  These groups, which have a professional and independent interest in the welfare of children, welcome the proposed establishment of child care advisory committees, the reference to the development of family support services and the implicit preventive thrust of the Bill.  However, they are justly concerned about the lack of detail in regard to the development of preventive services, the lack of reference to the difficult issue of quality in care, to resources other than expenses and to the growing area of after-school care.</P>
    <P>We will be tabling a number of amendments to deal with the lack of detail in a number of these areas on Committee Stage,</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) refers, for example, to a &ldquo;person acting in <i>loco parentis</i>&rdquo;.  To whom does this refer?  I would suggest that this phrase needs definition by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) (d) proposes to recognise the wishes of a child.  Can a child's wishes and best interests be truly represented unless the court can order independent representation of that child when it sees fit to do so, irrespective of representation of parents and other parties concerned?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> On a more general comment, notwithstanding the fact that voluntary care means that a child cannot be maintained under this section against parental wishes, sudden and unplanned removals from care could be detrimental to a child. Could a clause be included which would recommend planned termination of care?</P>
    <P>The proposal, in section 5, to set up child care advisory committees is deserving of further attention.  Since by definition they will be advisory, what real power and influence can these committees have?  Who will form their membership? I believe it is a great pity that there is no provision in the Bill for some kind of national child care authority which could develop policy in this area generally and act as a co-ordinating body for local committees.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other questions raised by the provisions of the Bill which are deserving of detailed attention on Committee Stage.  For example, would a place of safety, covered in section 13, include a foster home?</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2), provides for an application for an emergency care order and its time limit.  Who is to apply for such emergency order?  If the Garda can, as appears in the Bill, are they equipped to make such decisions about children?  If a health board is to apply, subsequent to Garda removal of a child, a stated time limit cannot be adhered to over weekends. Therefore, should these exceptions be included?  If a health board decide not to proceed with applications does a garda have to advise the court of his action in removing a child in any event?</P>
    <P>Given our present economic problems, I should like the Minister to spell out the investment, moral and otherwise, in this Bill in preventive services which will prove cost-effective in the long term.  The Minister should consider obligating himself to bring in regulations to cover adequate supervision of all those pre-school services offering full day care. These regulations should include child minding and day-care centres grant-aided by health boards.  These latter services are managed by voluntary bodies who, in the main, wish for and would welcome <Col N="467" /> such inclusion.  The Minister should consider registration rather than notification of day-care services.</P>
    <P>While recognising the value of integrated pre-school services for all, there is need to ensure the quality of day-care services for families and children at risk. In this regard, I suggest that the regulations pertaining to State supported pre-school services should include specific reference to adult-child ratios, as would apply in a normal school.</P>
    <P>These, and many other points of detail, are very loosely defined in the Bill.  As I said earlier, we will be tabling a number of amendments to improve its general thrust on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Since this will have been the only time this century this House, an Irish Parliament, will have examined the question of child care, I hope the Minister will be open-minded in his attitude to such amendments as are tabled on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been maintained that there is very little original thought on any topic.  Therefore I appreciate that it is unavoidable that many comments made on a Bill such as this will be repetitive.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few general points about the question of child care and its inherent dangers.  I believe that this is a practical, sensible Bill constituting a reasonable approach to the problems obtaining in this area.  Nonetheless it must be acknowledged that it is a very complicated and highly emotive subject with which we are dealing.  I do not believe that this Minister is in the business of political point-scoring and that, if there are rational, reasoned amendments put forward, he will not be willing to take them on board.  We should bear in mind that the previous attempt at introducing a Bill such as this led to circumstances in which at least 150 amendments were required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member of this House subscribes to the view that new child care legislation is long overdue.  Again, I <Col N="468" /> cannot say why it takes so long to get legislation implemented but at least in this case, after eight years, we are moving.  It is important to realise that the Minister has issued guidelines on the way in which to deal with child abuse cases and this Bill will make further changes, which are plainly needed, and which will strengthen the directives the Minister has given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time remaining at my disposal in this debate tonight, I want to make it clear that it is essential that in the disbursement of substantial sums of public money objective criteria have to be established and adhered to.  In the instance of the national lottery funds which are now annually ten times greater than was estimated at the time of the passage of the National Lottery Act, 1986, there are no objective criteria established.  Therefore, it cannot be claimed that objective criteria are being adhered to.</P>
      <P>Part of the money is disbursed in individual constituencies largely on the basis of the personal preferences of Ministers or Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  This has given rise to practices of gombeenism which are reminiscent of a different era and a different century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no real accountability for these sums in the normal acceptable sense.  Several members of the Government have come into this House during the course of this debate and read out global totals under different headings of £X million for this and £Y million for that, but they made no attempt to be accountable for <Col N="469" /> individual decisions by Ministers and Deputies, particularly decisions to give money where no formal application had been made.  The Minister for Finance was at pains to say that thousands of applications that might well have been perfectly valid and worthy had to be turned down because of the numbers concerned. This is perfectly understandable if they had not been turned down in favour of people who had not even applied.</P>
    <P>This practice is widely seen throughout the country as an abuse of public accountability and an abuse of public administration. Seventy per cent of the people in the country want a change.  This Bill tonight seeks to change it.  Less than 10 per cent of the people want the present system retained.  What is even more ominous and sinister about this whole matter is not just the undoubted and widely acknowledged abuse that is going on, but the attitude of the Government and some of their supporters in relation to it.  They have contributed to this debate on the basis that they are perfectly entitled to do what they are doing and that they have to apologise to nobody for this abuse.  Since this is their attitude, while they are a minority Government retained in office by the grace and favour of a majority of the Members of this House, I shudder to think what their attitude would be like if they had majority support in this House.</P>
    <P>The Government seem quite oblivious to the division of powers under our Constitution. Some members of the Government seem to think that once they become a Government, even by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle, which makes them the most narrowly elected Government in history, they are nonetheless entitled to walk roughshod over everybody and that they are entitled to the same support from this House for their corrupt abuse of the national lottery funds and for their crude attempt to gerrymander constituencies as they are for their efforts to reduce spiralling expenditure and to control the level of public debt.  They are of course totally mistaken in this assumption even though the <Col N="470" /> Minister for Finance came in here on Wednesday last to complain in an arrogant, threatening and petulant way that they had a right to support on everything and if they did not get it Opposition parties would be held responsible for &ldquo;undermining the stability that exists in this economy&rdquo;.  This is a brazen and arrogant assumption which presumes that the Members of this House have no rights, no duties and no opinions.  A majority in this House do not support abuse by the Government of their position as a Government.  That majority therefore have not just a right but a duty to express their opposition and, as far as the Progressive Democrats are concerned, we will push our opposition to such measures as far as we can.  In particular, we will endeavour to change the law that appears to allow the present abuse to be perpetrated because it is insufficiently specific, because it does not establish objective criteria and because it does not ensure proper accountability.</P>
    <P>To the present Government, the primacy of this House and of the Legislature generally appears to be only an obscure matter of constitutional theory.  It is time that they took on board the existing parliamentary arithmetic and acted accordingly. It is particularly incumbent on them to do so when it is remembered that this Government have received unprecedented co-operation from much of the Opposition in the course of this present Dáil.  I can think of no parallels in our parliamentary history since independence 67 years ago.  Perhaps the fault lies in part of the Opposition lulling the Government into a false sense of security by giving them the impression that at times virtually anything goes.  If that were the case it is as well in this debate and on this Bill the Government should be finally disabused of that notion.  It underlines the dangers of a &ldquo;blank-cheque&rdquo; approach, and emphasises the importance of examining each issue on its merits.</P>
    <P>This Government have had extraordinary and unprecedented goodwill both within this House and outside it. They have a corresponding duty not to <Col N="471" /> abuse that goodwill and the parliamentary and other assistance which they have got.  If the Government are defeated on this Bill, it is a defeat entirely of their own making.  If they did not engage in these disreputable practices, the Bill would not have had to be introduced. I hope that they are beginning to learn a lesson.  There was some indication that they might be in the course of the debate last Wednesday on the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust Bill, when a proposal to allow public charitable funds of £2.75 million to be expended at the sole personal discretion of the Taoiseach, was amended to put some limited constraints at least on the objects on which it could be spent.</P>
    <P>It is likely that at some time in the not too distant future somebody will challenge the constitutionality of a Bill such as that or the National Lottery Act, 1986, because of the fact that it is very doubtful if disbursement by individual Ministers and others, in this fashion that has recently arisen, accords with either the letter or the spirit of Article 11 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That provision is in the Constitution precisely to prevent the sort of undesirable practices we are now seeing, where public money is distributed for local political purposes in a way that has shattered all confidence in the system and in a way that in some cases at least is seen to be based neither on need nor on merit, when much more needy and meritorious projects are turned down.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that on 1 July 1986 Fianna Fáil voted against Second Stage of the National Lottery Bill because they thought it was insufficiently tightly drafted and open to various abuses.  In the course of that debate, the present Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden said and I quote from the Official Report, Vol. 368, column 1781: &ldquo;Our main criticism is that we have been kept in ignorance of how the proceeds will be allocated&rdquo;.  How very right he was.</P>
    <P>At column 1782, he called for the <Col N="472" /> establishment of a representative body to administer the proceeds:</P>
    <P>....so that it will become clear that it will not be organised on a party political basis or that grants will not be awarded in a purely political way.... that would politicise the national lottery and would be detrimental to its success if it was clearly seen by the public that the funds which accrued would be used by the Government for party political reasons in the constituencies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I presume he would have withdrawn his criticism of the potential abuses if he had realised that it was his own colleagues who would be carrying out the abuse. Perhaps in fairness to Deputy Leyden he was innocent enough to believe that they would not.  Further on at column 1783 the same Deputy said:</P>
    <P>....it would be very tempting for the Minister for Finance to use the proceeds from the national lottery to bolster politicians .... I know many Labour and Fine Gael Deputies who would be very tempted to apply for major allocations to their constitutencies to the detriment of Opposition Deputies. That is being realistic and down to earth.</P>
    <P>Also at column 1783, Deputy Leyden said:</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to make this a totally non-political lottery.  The proceeds should be allocated on a fair and equitable basis having regard to the demands and needs throughout the country.</P>
    <P>At column 1786, the same Deputy said:</P>
    <P>....the fund should be administered on a non-political basis by a non-political group including representatives of sporting and national organisations. Any local community could apply in an open manner for support and the application would not be dealt with in a partisan manner.  This would be very acceptable to all sides of the House <Col N="473" /> because sports should be above party politics.</P>
    <P>He then went on to say, at the same column: &ldquo;These are the major flaws I see in the Bill&rdquo;.  How extraordinarily accurate he was in his prognostication.  How totally justified Deputy Leyden's speech was.  How totally justified Fianna Fáil's opposition to the original Bill was.  Yet they are so immature in their political approach that they come along a year or two later and put into practice all the abuses that they so accurately foresaw and so properly complained of.  Can we as a Legislature not raise ourselves above this mentality?  Must the pettiness of the parish pump always be paramount?</P>
    <P>Let us now do what Deputy Leyden so eloquently wanted and put an end to the abuses that he so accurately foretold.  If the Government spent less of their time engaging in the sort of childish trivia we read about in the distribution of national lottery funds and more time on tackling the enormous problems that beset this country today, they would be serving the nation a great deal better.  It is our duty to try to make them do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to confine my remarks to the amenity grant scheme operated by my Department.  The amenity grant scheme, as we know it today, began in 1986 when £5 million was made available in the Environment Vote for special amenity projects.  The original intention was that £4 million would be allocated to the Dublin area and the balance to the rest of the country.  The scheme was to be aimed at the areas of greatest social need and the managers of the local authorities in Dublin and the other urban authorities with populations <Col N="474" /> over 10,000 were invited to submit proposals for consideration.  In the event, only £4.5 million was spent during the year.  The Dublin area got just short of £3.1 million and the scheme was extended to 15 counties which between them received £0.8 million.  Some examples of these allocations were: Kerry £159,000 and Kilkenny £70,000. To my knowledge there was no outcry in the media or political parties about the fact that it was the Minister who selected the schemes which were to benefit.  The attitude would seem to have been that there was a need to improve the environment and provide more recreational facilities.  The public were ready to let the Minister of the day get on with the job of doing this with the resources available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 a further amount was provided in the Environment Vote for the amenity grant scheme.  The outgoing Minister allocated this before the present Minister took over but on this occasion there was indeed cause for concern.  He refused allocations to no less than 13 counties and allocated the bulk of the money to the Dublin area.  Dublin County alone got £2.3 million while Dublin Corporation got £1.7 million and Dún Laoghaire £0.2 million.  Whatever about the merits of the particular projects &mdash; and in fairness one could not question the motives of the people behind the projects who wanted to do something for their environment &mdash; this was grossly unfair.  As I have said already, the purpose of the scheme was to help meet the need for recreational facilities but I want to point out that in that allocation 13 counties got no money at all.  The then Minister for the Environment burnt the midnight oil on 9 March in order to make allocations available but he excluded 13 counties completely. There was an Adjournment Debate in this House &mdash; a very mild one because it only affected that Member's area &mdash; but other than that no concern was expressed.  This year we increased amenity grants by 50 per cent to £6 million. The criteria laid down by my Department were very exact and many of those involved in the project said they were <Col N="475" /> over-exact.  I want to place it on the record that, in relation to the moneys which were allocated by my Department, both the corporations and the councils had to first ensure that the work was completed and the money spent and then send the notification to my Department. Deputies on the other side of the House seem to have said that these moneys were not being properly accounted for.  It is not fair of them to come in here and accuse voluntary organisations and others of not disbursing the funds in a proper way because the officials of the local authorities, the corporations and the engineers involved had to certify how the funds were spent.</P>
    <P>I want to throw down the gauntlet to the Progressive Democrats: are they saying &mdash; and some of them were hiding behind the newspapers &mdash; that the projects in the midlands which got money were not entitled to it?  If that is the case they should say so.  Are they saying to the Tullamore Harriers and to other community centres throughout the midlands that they should not have got the money? If that is what they are saying they should say so because these organisations have accountability and what is being said is casting a serious reflection on them.  It is not fair of the Progressive Democrats to do this under the shield of this House.</P>
    <P>All the moneys disbursed by my Department can be accounted for.  We received over 2,000 applications and if grant allocations had been made to all of those projects it would have cost £60 million and we had only £6 million. Admittedly, many people involved in projects were going to be disappointed, not alone in my own constituency of Laois-Offaly, but all over the country.  I resent the fact that the Progressive Democrats have come in here and said that the money was not properly disbursed. If the money was not properly disbursed I throw down the challenge to them to name the bodies who got moneys and who were not entitled to them.  If it is the case the Progressive Democrats <Col N="476" /> should come out and say that Portarlington community centre, or Tullamore, Kilcormac, Killinard and other places were not entitled to the moneys they got.  The Progressive Democrats have not done this because every one of the projects in my constituency and in other constituencies submitted an application form for these moneys and these projects are now being properly accounted for.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another layer of bureaucracy which the Progressive Democrats want to bring in.  Could they not easily have turned around and said to the Minister of the day in the Department of the Environment that he should appoint a High Court judge to preside over the allocation of the road funds, the housing funds and the sanitary funds?</P>

That is the responsibility of the Government of the day.  We have a very intelligent electorate who will decide all those issues.  We will not need a straw poll. The rules and regulations issued by the Department of the Environment to every council and corporation are very strictly laid down.  Nobody should try to give the impression to the public that we are dispensing funds irregularly.  That is not correct.  There is some talk about people having cheques.  I could not personally bring such cheques around and to say otherwise is grossly unfair.  I have never handled any cheques in relation to amenity grants from the Department and I will not do so.  It is the responsibility of the local authority to make the money available to the project for which the money has been allocated.</P>

I went out of my way to give Deputy Flanagan the flexibility he was seeking.  I looked after the Tidy Towns competition in Mountmellick as well.  I regret very much that the grant was not availed of, but other organisations in County Laois were crying out for assistance and are delighted to have received it.</P>
      <P>All the money which has been allocated by my Department to various projects can be properly accounted for.  If we are talking about bringing in judges, we should appoint them in all the Departments, but that would end up as a farce. I could not agree with that suggestion.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with everything the Minister of State had to say.  The Government have adhered strictly to the legislation of 1986.  The criteria are similar to those applied to any Exchequer funding, with the same strict accountability.  I am satisfied there has been no abuse by the Government in relation to the allocation of lottery funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department received £10 million from the lottery, £2 million of which went to the capital programme and a further £2 million to the health promotion unit, to provide for the functions formerly carried out by the Health Education Bureau. I am sure Members will agree that the money spent by the health promotion unit and by the advisory council on health promotion was well spent.  The real value will only be seen in the years to come. Health promotion is a very important area of Government involvement.  The <Col N="479" /> main amount of my allocation, £6 million, was made available for distribution for the benefit of community health.  We had detailed and extensive consultations about the priority areas for allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had consultations with the health boards and decided on a number of priority areas, that is, services for the mentally handicapped, services for the physically handicapped, services for the elderly, child services, psychiatric services, community information and the AIDS programme.  These areas should have priority in the context of the lottery funds.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that while we were very pleased to receive £6 million it was not sufficient to meet the demand from various organisations and bodies working with those in need.  The money has been used for development services and was allocated mainly for community-based projects, on the basis of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer now to some of the projects which were grant-aided.  The sum of £1.8 million was used to provide community-based services for the physically and mentally handicapped.  Basically we set out to encourage the development of resocialisation programmes with a view to transferring patients from institutional care to community care or providing care in the community for patients who might otherwise have to seek institutional care. An example of a provision for the mentally handicapped is the grant of £300,000 to the Sisters of Charity on the Navan Road for the purchase of eight houses to enable a group of handicapped persons between the ages of 13 and 40 to live in the community, which is their right when they are able to do so.  Nobody in this House would disagree with that allocation for this worthy project from which 40 handicapped people benefited.  St. Michael's House, another very worthy voluntary organisation working for the mentally handicapped, received £50,000 for short-term relief, something which <Col N="480" /> has not been developed to the extent it should have been.  I am sure nobody would disagree with that allocation to St. Michael's House for the short-term relief of parents of the mentally handicapped. The sum of £60,000 was allocated for the mentally handicapped at St. Peter's in Castlepollard.  The Brothers of Charity in Galway received a grant of £100,000 and the Kerry Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped received a grant of £100,000 for the provision of a day centre and a vocational training unit for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>A large number of groups working with the physically handicapped have also received grants.  The Irish Wheelchair Association grant of £150,000 was spent on the provision of a home care service. They spent £100,000 in the Dublin area and £50,000 outside that area.  I do not believe any Member could say that this money was misappropriated or ill spent. I believe every Member would have to accept that the Irish Wheelchair Association are an organisation well worthy of support and that a grant of £150,000 to them was money well spent.  The Multiple Sclerosis Care Foundation received a grant of £65,000 and Clonturk House for the adult blind in Drumcondra received a grant of £50,000.</P>
    <P>As I said, a total of £1.8 million was provided for the handicapped.  I do not intend to go into detail about how we spent that £1.8 million, but I can assure Deputies that the remainder of that sum was allocated to organisations who provide the very highest level of service, or who wished to extend the service or to develop a new service for the benefit of the handicapped and that these allocations would stand up to any scrutiny under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.2 million was allocated for the provision of community-based services for the elderly.  The House will appreciate that there are an increasing number of elderly in our community and that the availability of over £1 million from the lottery fund was very valuable in providing community-based services, improving existing services or developing new services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> As Members are aware, my Department recently published the report of a working party on the future care of the elderly.  Everyone will agree that the ideal for the elderly is that they should be able to live in their own homes or, failing that, that their families should be able to take care of them.  If for one reason or another the families are unable to look after them, they should be able to remain in their own community.  It is only when they cannot remain in their own community because of infirmity that they should have to go into residential care.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that the money spent helped to develop community-based services and to improve the position for the elderly &mdash; for example, £5,000 was given to a parish priest who was left a house to convert it into two flats for the elderly &mdash; I do not think anyone in this House could say that was money misspent or misappropriated &mdash; £25,000 was given to provide an alarm system for the elderly in inner Dublin.  I do not think anybody could say that money was misspent, and £20,000 was given to convert the former dispensary in Blacklion to a magnificent community centre, something that is very valuable in an area, where, I am told, there are approximately 300 elderly people living alone.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, at the end of last year a number of health boards closed small district hospitals, particularly in Munster.  I was glad to be in a position to meet deputations from local social service committees who put proposals to me as to how they could make use of these centres.  Through an agreement with the health boards, particularly the MidWestern and the South-Eastern Health Boards, a number of voluntary organisations took over the district hospitals on lease and, because of the availability of lottery funds, provided excellent facilities for the elderly in their own community.</P>
    <P>For example, Kilrush got £45,000 from the lottery and provided a beautiful facility for the elderly in their area; Carrick-on-Suir got an allocation of £40,000 and provided a day centre and bus for <Col N="482" /> the elderly; Gorey got £40,000 and provided a day centre and a bus and through the social services for the elderly Castlerea got £60,000.  Again I do not think any Deputy could say the money spent providing these facilities was misspent or misappropriated.</P>
    <P>A sum of £600,000 has been spent for psychiatric services.  Here again I concentrated on the provision of community-based facilities with the particular objective of transferring long stay patients out of psychiatric hospitals into the community. A number of psychiatric hospitals, mental health centres, sector headquarters, and day centres have received grants under these headings ranging from £60,000 in the case of Listowel, County Kerry, to £5,000 in the case of Mohill and £100,000 for the provision of community-based psychiatric facilities in County Meath.  I do not think the House would say that money spent on the development of community psychiatric services is misspent.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million was spent on community information and development services.  This included £600,000 for the National Social Service Board.  The balance has been allocated to voluntary groups and to organisations providing a range of services, for example, marriage counselling, health information promotion, counselling for the terminally ill and community resource centres.</P>
    <P>Over £500,000 has been spent on the AIDS prevention programme with special emphasis on measures to minimise the spread of infection among intravenous drug abusers and between those abusers and the community at large.  As everybody here knows, while we had a major public information programme, that type of programme is not effective in getting to the intravenous drug abusers and it is necessary to have some sort of a one-to-one relationship to encourage the drug abusers to give up their habit.</P>
    <P>We allocated grants of £150,000 to the Eastern Health Board for an outreach programme, £40,000 for the Anna Livia Drugs Counselling Service, £15,000 for a study on paediatric AIDS and drug abuse in the Coombe Hospital, and £15,000 <Col N="483" /> counselling for AIDS patients in St. James's hospital, just to mention a few. I believe Members of this House would accept that the AIDS programme was an appropriate area in which to spend some of the money from the lottery and that the money was allocated to the right area.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are accusing the Government of misspending the lottery money, but they have been accusing the Government of misspending money all the time, and not just in the area of the lottery.  As the Minister of State said, we would need a judge in every Department of State to satisfy various Opposition parties. Today we had an example of an Opposition accusation of misappropriation regarding the funding for the equipment of hospitals.  Deputy Spring alleged that because Cavan was in my constituency some special arrangement &mdash;&ldquo;a precedent&rdquo; to use his own words &mdash; was made in relation to equipping that hospital.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is mischievous of Deputy Spring to make this allegation. The precedent for such a loan was established by the previous Government to equip Beaumont and the Mater hospitals. The equipping of Cavan hospital is part of a package which includes Mullingar hospital, Castlebar hospital and St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>If I might make a political point: Fianna Fáil policy differs from that of Labour because we do not spend hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money building hospitals and then leaving them idle.  I suggest that Deputy Spring go public and tell the people of Mullingar, Castlebar and those who use St. James's hospital that he considers it a scandal &mdash; again to use his own words &mdash; to provide money to equip these hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of Government to collect and to allocate money.  A sum of £70 million has been allocated from the national lottery and controversy surrounds only a tiny percentage of it.  It is very unfortunate especially for the beneficiaries of the funds, that the Opposition should attack the manner in which <Col N="484" /> the money was allocated and misrepresent the facts.  Indeed, Deputy Harney said twice on television that because Kilkenny did not have a Minister represented in the Dáil, they came out worst.  As far as the health allocation is concerned, outside some of the major cities Kilkenny and Kerry received by far the largest allocation, going on a county by county basis.  They were ahead of any other county, apart from large urban areas.  If the Progressive Democrats were in Government they would allocate the lottery funds in exactly the same way, but perhaps not as fairly, having regard to the way they talk about it at present.</P>

      <P>The national lottery, in commercial terms, has been a far greater success than anyone could have envisaged. It is bringing in much more than anyone anticipated when the original Bill was going through the Dáil.  In its first year it raised £100 million against the generally anticipated income of £45 million to £60 million.  It is expected to bring it up to £175 million this year.  At the time when the lottery was first proposed there was a concerted campaign to try to ensure that it would be given over to a private firm to run it.  This was resisted and it was given to An Post who established a subsidiary to organise the lottery. Its success has been a tribute to all those who worked on it and it shows that a State body can be imaginative, innovative and attractive in its operation and indeed that it can be as good &mdash; if not better &mdash; than anything in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given its tremendous commercial success, it is all the more unfortunate that the lottery should have been devalued by the way in which the funds contributed by the people have been applied in a blatantly political and partisan way.  The whole controversy has reinforced the widely held view that what you get from <Col N="485" /> the State is, in many cases, not on clearly specified entitlements but on who you know in the Government.  The whole controversy has further undermined public confidence in politicians and in the democratic process.  It is no defence for Fianna Fáil to say that Coalition administrations also bent the rules in relation to the allocation of funds under various headings.  We all know that went on; the difference is that the sums of money are now so vast that public concern has increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>There cannot be any doubt that the evidence is there to back up public concern. Every Opposition TD can point to cases where lottery money has been applied on a politically partisan basis with the aim of boosting the electoral prospects of a Government TD, especially a Government Minister.  An analysis of the figures backs up what most Members of the Dáil know and what many members of the public suspect, that the constituencies of Government Ministers have got preferential treatment and been given a disproportionate share of lottery funds.  Just take the example of the £6 million allocated by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, for recreation and amenity purposes across the country.  Almost 6 per cent of the total, some £400.000 was allocated to County Mayo, which just happens to be the Minister's own county.  Kildare, which has a similar population to that of Mayo got only £92,000.  On a <i>per capita</i> basis, Mayo got £3.51 compared to 79p per head in Kildare.  I have no doubt that Mayo is in need of assistance to provide recreational and amenity facilities, but can anyone argue that they are entitled to ten times as much as Kildare, which is an area with a rapidly expanding population and all the problems associated with that?</P>
    <P>Another example is the whole scandal of money apparently being allocated without proper applications being submitted or the required procedures complied with.  Dublin County Council sought funding from the Department of the Environment for a total of 87 different projects.  The list was submitted to the Minister for the Environment who <Col N="486" /> approved funding in only 17 of the cases presented by the council.  Yet overall, funding was provided for 49 projects, 32 of which were not on the list submitted by the council.  Of the 32 projects not listed by the council, 25 of them just happened to be in the constituency of North Dublin, the home territory of the Minister, Deputy Burke.  No doubt he will tell us that this was just a coincidence and that he was as surprised as anyone else.</P>
    <P>What has also caused public concern and annoyance is the manner in which Government Ministers have tried to portray the allocation of lottery money almost as if it was coming out of their own pockets.  Almost every provincial newspaper has, over the past year, featured stories about how rival Government Ministers and TDs competed with each other to be first with the news of the allocation of lottery moneys, Ministers sweeping up in their State cars to announce the good news personally to recipients &mdash; in many cases at times when they should have been at their departmental desks doing the work for which they are paid very substantial sums by the taxpayer.  One of the outstanding examples of this sort of carry on was when the Minister for Agriculture and Food arrived last Easter in his constituency, headed by a pipe band, like some sort of third rate feudal prince, to announce the allocation of £10,000 to build a new handball court.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a serious attempt to address the problem and to remove the worst excesses of political patronage from the allocation of money; as such it deserves to get through Second Stage and to allow a more detailed consideration of it on Committee Stage, where I am sure many people will have suggestions as to how it can be improved or tightened up.  The principle of an independent board to supervise the allocation of money is probably the best option in the light of our experience to date.  It is a sad reflection on the political system that the Government cannot be trusted to allocate lottery money in a fair and impartial way, but that is how it is seen by most people <Col N="487" /> throughout the country.  The establishment of an independent board would help to ensure that the money was allocated on the basis of need and not on the basis of political advantage to the Government, whether it is this Fianna Fáil Government, or any future Government of a different political hue.</P>
    <P>The general purposes for which money is allocated under the original Bill and would continue to be allocated under this Bill are correct.  There are sometimes calls for the use of lottery money to build hospitals or schools or to pay wages of staff in particular parts of the public sector which might be under threat.  The fact that the lottery is in existence and operating successfully does not absolve the Government from the responsibility of ensuring that adequate money is raised through taxation for public services such as health, education and social welfare. To start allocating lottery money for these purposes would be a very dangerous precedent.  The lottery is doing well at the moment and there is quite an amount of money available, but there is no guarantee that the lottery revenue will not go down.  If money is allocated from the lottery now for health or education, and the lottery revenue goes down in future years, you could have a situation where the Government would try to use this as a justification for further cutbacks.</P>
    <P>Lottery money should not be used to finance areas which the Government have a statutory obligation to provide.  It should continue to be used for what might be called optional or discretionary expenditure in the voluntary sector and in, as has previously been mentioned, the community care area.  There are anomalies in this regard.  There are hoteliers who qualify for money to build golf courses and yet local authorities, who have responsibility for swimming pools which were built 20 years ago and are now in need of refurbishment, do not qualify. These swimming pools have to be maintained at a great cost to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We consider the general principles behind this Bill to be reasonable.  We will <Col N="488" /> support it at the conclusion of Second Stage but we reserve the right to seek to amend it in subsequent Stages.  The success of the lottery has created its own problems, one of which is the amount of money being spent on lottery tickets by low income families.  The struggle to survive for people on social welfare or on hopelessly inadequate wages is so bleak that the possibility of a lottery win is even more attractive and they may be tempted to spend more than is wise.  If people are simply spending money on lottery tickets that would otherwise have been spent on drink, cigarettes or some other optional items there is no problem but if they are spending money which should be spent on more essential items there is clearly cause for concern.  I would suggest that some moneys should be allocated from the lottery next year to fund a comprehensive, impartial study of money being spent on lottery tickets.  If there is a problem there we should know about it and should consider ways of tackling it. Each and every area makes its contribution to the lottery funds.  Consequently, it is right and proper that the distribution be made in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points of clarification.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Education is here because it is within his ambit to comment on some of my concerns about the national lottery and the distribution of the funds.  Everybody, even those people who were in doubt, the sceptics and the critics of the national lottery when it was first introduced, accepts that it is an enormous success.  I am very concerned with the bad publicity that has been given to it in recent months.  This publicity will not do the future of the national lottery any good.  I have certain reservations about the Progressive Democrats' Bill.  I have no hesitation in saying that it is by far the lesser of two evils.  I support it because the present situation cannot be allowed to continue. If this Bill gets through its Second Reading, on Committee Stage we could prepare some kind of watertight distribution <Col N="489" /> system of the lottery funds so that people will not be complaining.</P>
      <P>As some people are aware, I have had a certain interest in the lottery since its initiation.  I would like to take the House back to the early stages of the lottery. There are people who were very much opposed to it and are now pushing and promoting it with all the zeal of the convert. Credit should be given where it is due.  As you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will know, in 1979 the whole idea of a national sports lottery was presented to the Government by the much maligned Cospóir, the national sports council.  The idea was put forward because of the underfunding of sporting organisations, to make extra money available for the governing bodies of sport and to promote sport generally.  The proposition by Cospóir was left dormant for a number of years but in the mid-eighties it was promoted.  After some deliberation, many meetings and many weeks of discussion the Government of the day accepted the principle of a lottery.  The question arose as to whether it should be a sports lottery or what kind of lottery should be introduced that would catch the imagination of the public and that would be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister present will be well aware of the many consultations which took place with people in charge of lotteries throughout the world, particularly throughout Europe.  There was no doubt that once this lottery was aligned to sport it could not but be a success. We are a sporting nation and we have achieved a considerable amount as far as sports and athletics are concerned, not alone in this country but internationally also.  Credit is due to Cospóir who thought of the idea of the lottery.  Many of the sporting organisations were constantly complaining, and rightly so, that they never knew what they would receive the following year.  They were at the end of the scale, the poor relation of the Exchequer, and if things were bad the sporting organisations suffered.  When the lottery was suggested the Government accepted it and an interdepartmental committee was set up.  At <Col N="490" /> that stage there were a number of competing demands from the local authorities, the Department of Health and the Department of the Environment, looking for a lottery to boost their own funds.</P>
    <P>It transpired, after one month of discussions and about ten meetings, that what would be introduced was a national lottery with the major portion going to sport.  Both Cospóir and the officials in the sports section of the Department of Education were most optimistic about the lottery and it even surpassed their target.  The lottery is a success and will continue to be so but if it is seen as another form of taxation, that will militate against it and will affect it in future. The distribution of the lottery funds should not only be fair but should be seen to be fair so that the people will support it.  Nobody doubted that there was a place for a lottery but what kind of a lottery was the important question that arose.</P>
    <P>Before the lottery was introduced there were a number of other lotteries in existence such as the Mater Hospital Pools, the Cork Polio and General AfterCare Association and a number of other small lotteries.  Everybody knew that if a national lottery was introduced it would militate against those lotteries, particularly the Rehabilitation CRC.  Organisations which were starved of money were raising funds from the general public and they were looking after people and doing work which they felt should be the responsibility of the Government. Those organisations should be encouraged. I had at least one meeting with charitable organisations.  I wanted to make sure that if a national lottery was introduced, under no circumstances would it militate against their fund-raising campaign but rather it should be used to provide for any fall-off in their income.</P>
    <P>There are two lotteries at present, the national lottery and the Rehabilition lottery. That is a scandal and I say that without hesitation.  It is wrong that the State lottery is in competition with the Rehabilitation lottery.  Because of the bad publicity given to the national lottery &mdash; I will give some statistics to prove what I am saying &mdash; the Rehabilitation lottery <Col N="491" /> is gaining at the expense of the national lottery.  One important aspect of the introduction of a lottery was that there would be one lottery that would provide for all areas and all the organisations would be brought under the umbrella of that one national lottery.  I was convinced that what I was advised then was right and I am even more convinced now.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister for Finance to ask the cost of the administration of the national lottery. An indication of concern expressed is that 14 Deputies in this House from the Opposition parties tabled questions to the Minister for Finance about the distribution of lottery funds.  Every Member, I am sure Government Members as well, was meeting this criticism in his constituency.  I was amazed at the answer the Minister gave me.  The question was to ask, among other things, about the expense, and the Minister's reply was that prize expenses to date amounted to £36 million approximately. Total operating costs &mdash; this is the important part &mdash; incurred including agent's commission and all staff costs amount to approximately £16 million.  Because you have two sets of administrative costs you have two sets of advertising and a competitive advertising campaign between the two.  It is wrong, it is a scandal, and I tell the Minister of State here that an effort should be made to have some reconciliation or approach towards the elimination of a great deal of those costs, although it is a little late because the die is cast.  If the national lottery is costing £16 million to administer, it is £16 million waste when you consider that on the other side to promote the rehabilitation lottery you have the same costs.</P>
    <P>One of the many considerations that gave rise to the lottery was the fact that so much cost was involved in running small lotteries.  The causes that were to be served got a very small proportion of the overall, gross intake from all those lotteries.  It is sad.  It is wrong.  The CRC and the Rehabilitation Institute are doing very important work.  Their cause is <Col N="492" /> deserving, and if people see any form of taxation or abuse in the distribution of funds they will transfer to the Rehabilitation Institute's lottery.  I was involved at the start and it was clear at that stage what the lottery should mean if it was to be a success.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many of our young people are unemployed and have nothing to do and nowhere to go all day and every day, with a resultant increase in crime and vandalism.  There is public awareness with people out there prepared to help. The people out there were asked again and again to put their hands into their pockets and contribute too much towards the community and the welfare of the community.  In many of our built-up areas and new estates young people had not even a place to go to in the evening.  If the people I have just mentioned could be brought in to involve those young people in sport and if the lottery could be used to make contributions to the provision of facilities for them, the crime rate would be reduced as would be the cost of keeping those people in our institutions. All that was a noble, good, great idea.  I agree with the Minister for Health. The projects he mentioned are very commendable. It is very commendable to make conrtributions whether to the national lottery or any other source of funding, but it is a little bit much for any Minister to get up here, name and select certain projects and ask members of the Opposition if they object to this, why they object to it and whether they will come out publicly and state so.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Joe Sherlock was quoting from a leading article written in a southern paper in the past week about the lottery and the distribution of funds. I will not go into that now, but here is an impartial, independent observer who said you had an order of priority which indicated that where you had Ministers in a constituency that constituency benefited. We are talking about community halls and sporting and leisure facilities for young people.  I do not want to be overcritical bacause this is a very serious debate, but the person who wrote that leading article had no axe to grind and I <Col N="493" /> would say no political affiliation, but out of concern he assessed for himself that there was abuse, and considering the amount of money allocated I have no doubt in my mind that the abuse is there.</P>
    <P>I am still interested in the national lottery because it is money out of the blue which if properly used can do so much good.  If it is abused it will not be there to do good or harm.  It is as simple as that.  I made inquiries about the contributions on 5 January last from An Post. I wanted to find out exactly where the lottery was supported, in what counties, areas and places.  I will quote a few examples.  On 5 January, <i>per capita,</i> Longford headed the list at £1.13 per person per week.  I inquired today, this very day, from An Post about Longford's contribution.  It is 79p.  On 5 January 1988 the contribution in Dublin, including city and county, was 72p; today it is 49p. Now I want to come to the country and constituency in which I have an interest. On 5 January 1988 it was 72p per person in Cork; now it is 51p per head per week. Is it not quite obvious that there are people who are not satisfied and who have lost interest in the national lottery? It is important that whatever problems are there be ironed out immediately.</P>
    <P>I can see some merit in what the Government are talking about, setting up another layer of bureaucracy to distribute proceeds of the national lottery.  I am not too enamoured by that aspect of the Progressive Democrats Bill.  There must be some easier or more simplified way of distributing those proceeds.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to what was said by the two Ministers who spoke here, because the Bill provides that surplus funds from the national lottery can be distributed in accordance with the wishes of the Government of the day.  In other words, if they felt there was a need and if there were surplus funds over and above what was allocated for the three main headings particularly, at that stage the Government have a right to spend the balance.  However, the lottery was never seen or understood by anybody as a gift to the constituencies represented by <Col N="494" /> Ministers, TDs, councillors or Government representatives.  For that reason it is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>I expect the Minister will be replying to this debate tomorrow night.  I am a little saddened that the lottery is as it is at present.  What happened?  Was there any meeting or consultation?  Was there any discussion in relation to the coming together of all the charitable organisations so that there would be a proper lottery with nobody getting hurt and no good causes suffering as a result of the introduction of the national lottery? Deputy Batt O'Keeffe is here.  He is one of the Deputies from Cork who went around and made statements, distributed funds and informed organisations that as a result of his influence they were able to get funds from the national lottery.</P>

      <P>Since the lottery funds were first allocated last March many allegations, including those we have just heard now and which we find Deputy Creed read about in the newspapers, have been made on one aspect of the lottery allocation, namely, the £6 million allocated by way of recreation and amenity grants by the Department of the Environment and the £5.9 million allocated for youth and sport club facilities at local level by the Department of Education.  The allegations centred on the publicity surrounding announcements of grants by Fianna Fáil <Col N="496" /> Ministers and TDs in their own constituencies and the alleged unfair distribution of funds geographically throughout the country.  Strong language has been used to add emotion to those allegations.  Accusations of scandal and political gombeenism have been made by Deputies Harney and O'Malley.  Phrases such as that the lottery is being used as a political slush fund by Fianna Fáil have also been used.  The Progressive Democrats have chosen specific projects in specific areas amd made outrageous accusations without any reference to the facts surrounding those projects.  On every individual project which any Deputy may wish to raise I can give the facts and these will show that the allocation is totally justified whether it is for a golf club, a hotel tennis complex or Portmarnock Community School I challenge Deputy Harney in particular to raise in public, or in private with me, any allocation that we have made in our Department and I will show her that that allocation was totally justified.</P>
      <P>Let me take up some of the ones she has raised already.  Last week she mentioned the scandal of Portmarnock Community School receiving a grant for a PE hall because there was already a sports centre in that place.  So there is.  The problem in Portmarnock is that that centre, properly and commercially managed, is so busy from morning to night that the school cannot get into it.  A school of 950 pupils which did not have a sports hall was a fact that we had to comprehend and, because of continual promises over the years, we decided to give that school that sports hall.  What makes the hypocrisy of Deputy Harney so great is that according to the official minute record of a Dublin County Council meeting on May 1988 which I have here in front of me, Deputy Harney voted twice in favour of granting £30,000 for the benefit of giving a PE hall to that school.</P>

      <P>She has mentioned the question of a luxury hotel in Kerry.  Let <Col N="497" /> me deal with that question.  A proposal came from Cork-Kerry tourism that under our commercial development of sport programme we should make a grant of £10,000 available to this hotel for a tennis court facility subject to a covenant being signed with the local community that the facility would be used by the local community.  We allocated the grant on that basis on the recommendation of Cork-Kerry tourism and we insisted that a proper facility, two tennis courts on synthetic surface with lights would be provided and that the local community would have full access to it.  We also insisted that that facility would be properly managed by a leisure and recreation manager which the hotel was prepared to-employ.</P>
      <P>That is exactly the type of leisure and recreational facility that is needed here because I see too many tennis courts with glass strewn all over them that are never used.  We have a new dimension now in measuring recreational management, that is, that we build the proper facilities, manage them properly and use them to the full from morning till night.  I stand proudly by the decision that we took in giving that provisional allocation.  As it turns out agreement has not been reached with the local community.  When the local community came back to us to say they were not happy we said that if they provided the site and the £35,000 required to add to our £10,000 we would give them the grant.  They have not returned since. I am proud of that decision.  It represents a new dimension in sport facility development here.  It is one that I will stand over anywhere I go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the golf clubs, the elite sport?  I am glad to say that I was in Deputy Harney's constituency today in one of the two golf clubs I gave grants to under this scheme.  There was a grant of £15,000 to Slade Valley and of £5,000 to Kilrush, £20,000 out of a total of £4 million.  In Slade Valley today we initiated a new programme for golf for unemployed people, retired people and housewives, a programme that is now being adopted by golf clubs all over the country, with the exception of a number <Col N="498" /> of championship courses particularly here in Dublin which obviously cannot accommodate such people.</P>
    <P>I am proud that golf as a live sport which is now growing among the masses is getting a small amount of support from the lottery.  The additional support Deputy Harney mentioned went to clubs from the Department of the Environment and I am glad to say that all of those clubs are now participating in like schemes.  The other golf clubs who got grants got them under the commercial development of sport programme to encourage the development of tourism in five designated tourist areas.  Already the Germans are packing in as a result of the initiatives we have taken.  I make no apology for that kind of development.  I make no apology to anybody for the fact that sport is now, for the first time, making a major commercial contribution to the life of this country, resulting in quite a number of new jobs.  If Deputy Harney wishes to come up with any other slip-shod accusations, I will deal with those too.  The Progressive Democrats cheap shot on this issue has been: let the facts not spoil a good story.  Their misleading allegations on a few specific projects have brought the total national lottery allocations into disrepute and this is the greatest disservice that that party have done the country for some time. With those wild accusations they have brought the national lottery into disrepute and people are asking me what, in the name of goodness, we are doing with the lottery.</P>
    <P>Tonight I wish to detail the total allocation of lottery funds made by my Department on youth and sport for the first time.  I wish to show that the allegations made are untrue, that they stem from a background of bitterness and political jealousy on the part of a party whose interest in and commitment to youth, sport and recreation is absolutely pathetic.  In setting out the total and detailed analysis of the lottery proceeds amounting to £27.14 million allocated by my Department &mdash; and I ask that the charts be given out &mdash; I ask the House, <Col N="499" /> and those in the press gallery in particular, to be judge and jury of whether I, as Minister of State, my Minister, the Minister for Education, or our Department officials acted in any improper or unfair way in the task placed on us.  The fact sheets now being distributed give a detailed breakdown of the specific allocations of lottery proceeds made by my Department.  It is essential to point out that these allocations replace the total Exchequer expenditure on youth and sport and are made in exactly the same way, adhering to the same strict criteria as in previous years.  The same departmental regulations, the same official accountability by civil servants, apply this year as previously.  When we adopted new programmes I strongly insisted on even greater control and accountability to ensure efficiency of expenditure.  For example, the Government allocated for the first time this year £4 million to my Department for expenditure on the most deprived and underprivileged young people.  I appointed an interdepartmental committee of civil servants to ensure total co-ordination and avoid duplication.  I consulted with people like Sister Stanislaus and Fr. Peter McVerry and then I accepted in full, and implemented, the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that arising out of those allocations, subsequently made, many young people such as the homeless, substance abusers and children in conflict with the law now enjoy an enhanced lifestyle. A total of £16.64 million from current expenditure has been spent by my Department on youth and sport.  I defy anybody to show any misappropriation in expenditure.  Similarly, I challenge any person to prove how the money could be more fairly or effectively spent.  I am proud of the effectiveness of the allocations and of the fact that in a number of schemes priority in expenditure has been in the less-well-off areas and on people who suffer from a disadvantage of some kind.</P>
    <P>I was astounded last week at the proposal of the Progressive Democrats, <Col N="500" /> which I take as their current policy, that less money should be spent on sport and instead be used to replace Exchequer expenditure in other areas.  What they are saying is that the lottery proceeds should now become a tax to replace Exchequer expenditure.  As Deputy Creed said &mdash; I complimented him on being the person who brought the lottery into being &mdash; the central concept of the lottery as proposed by Cospóir was to provide a regular source of substantial funding for sport.  Other areas which, like sport, had not been adequately funded over the years were later included.</P>
    <P>I now urge the many youth and sports organisations, in addition to the thousands of people involved in youth affairs and sport, to vehemently reject this Progressive Democrats proposal for dilution of funds away from sport and youth, as proposed by them last week.  This year's allocation from the lottery has enabled the Government to give adequate funding for the first time in support of the massive voluntary effort in youth and sport.  I should like to state categorically that there is no other area of Exchequer expenditure which gives a better return to the State on the investment it makes than that of youth and sport.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the capital programme which I outlined in pages 1 and 2 of the document circulated.  There is a detailed breakdown of the allocations of funds for our national, regional and local facility development programme in that document.  That programme, now taking place, was proposed by the Cospóir National Sports Centre Committee and adopted by the previous Government.  In fact, the only political stroke that was attempted was that by Deputy Cooney who on the morning the report was presented suggested that instead of being in Dublin the national sports centre should be in Athlone.  That was an attempt at a political stroke.</P>

      <P>As the document circulated shows, we are putting in place a nationwide network of sports facilities <Col N="501" /> which includes a national sports centre, an outdoor sports stadium, basketball and badminton centres together with six regional centres.  It would not have been possible to contemplate such a range of sports facilities 18 months ago.  The national sports centre, which is being built at a cost of £35 million, will open its doors within three years.  It will be constructed by the same method as that being used on the Custom House Docks development and will provide a 15,000-seat arena with multi-purpose indoor sports facilities and a 50-metre pool.</P>
      <P>I should like to indicate the damage that is being done by the irresponsibility of the Progressive Democrats, backed by other parties.  We heard from Deputy Noonan, a senior member of Fine Gael, that we should be thinking of providing a national sports centre.  When one sees that a senior member of the Fine Gael Party does not know that we are about to lay the foundation stone of the national sports centre, which will be the finest in Europe, one can understand the disservice his party are doing in regard to the allocation of the lottery funds.  The fact that it is being developed by private sector investment enables us to proceed with the construction of the regional sports facilities.  The local authorities are now at an advanced stage of planning on each of those facilities with a view to their commencement in the near future and their completion within two years.  I ask Members to refer to the first page of the document which has been circulated and they will see that a range of facilities costing in the region of £50 million will be completed and opened to the public within the next three years.  That could not have been contemplated without the national lottery and it is the kind of service the national lottery has provided.</P>

      <P>With regard to the local facilities for which the Government have allocated £5.9 million to the Department of Education, I should like to point out that we have taken great care to ensure that the best possible return is achieved on that expenditure.  Since 1980 the Department have operated a scheme under strict Department of Finance regulations for the provision of youth, sport and community facilities under the capital programme.  In deciding on the successful organisations to whom funds are to be allocated I have used criteria such as to help those who are prepared to help themselves, as far as possible, to try to be fair and reasonable with a geographic spread, to take account of the views of informed and reliable sources in each of those counties, to have regard to the number of applications on hand at the time of the allocation and the amounts allocated to similar projects in previous years.  I am insisting on proper planning, physical and financial, to ensure full utilisation and commercial viability of the completed facility.  I am satisfied that a fair allocation is being made by me as Minister for Sport backed up by a knowledgeable Civil Service.  In any scheme where there are 1,000 applications and resources that will fund only 250 it is understandable that many applicants will be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document I have circulated gives an account of the moneys allocated to each county and Members will agree that each county received a fair allocation.  It is not possible to give each county an equal amount because we do not make <Col N="503" /> decision based on mathematical considerations.</P>

There has been nothing except absolute integrity on my part and on the part of my officials.  I treat with the contempt it deserves the attempt by Deputy Harney, by implication, to question our integrity.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the Deputy Leader of the Progressive Democrats to give an indication of what has gone on. The House will be aware that Deputy Keating was Minister of State at the Department of Education between June 1981 and February 1982.  He withdrew approximately £4 million in recreational grants which had previously been allocated by the present occupant of the Chair, Deputy Tunney.  After some controversy he reinstated most of the grants but reallocated £414,000 as follows: Tolka Rovers AFC, £40,000 in Dublin Central; Transport Boxing Club, £35,000 in Dublin Central; Ierne Social Club, £50,000 in Dublin Central; Dunshaughlin Community Council, £50,000 in County Meath; Charleville LTC, £13,000 in Dublin Central; St. Saviours YC, Dominick Street, £8,000, in Dublin Central; St. Joseph's Senior Citizens, East Wall, £20,000, in Dublin Central; Marino/Fairview Community Council, £18,000 in Dublin Central; CY Fairview, £80,000 in Dublin Central and Sheriff Street sports hall, £100,000 in Dublin Central.  In case Members are wondering how Dunshaughlin happened to be the odd one out, I should like to point out that by coincidence that happens to be where Deputy Keating lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Deputy Harney what constituency the Deputy Leader of her party, Deputy Michael Keating, represents. There is an eerie silence hanging <Col N="504" /> over the Progressive Democrats.  He represents the constituency of Dublin Central. I have searched in vain for a record of Deputy Keating having consulted a High Court judge or an independent commission.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, may I ask Deputy Harney whether she feels it is necessary to appoint a High Court judge to be the deputy leader of her party?  There is an eerie silence hanging over the Progressive Democrats.  May I ask Deputy Harney how she feels the rest of the country fared in the allocation of the £414,000, seeing that she is so concerned about fairness and equity in recent weeks?</P>
    <P>This legislation is the greatest act of political gombeenism that we have seen brought before this House in many a long year.  We know, and in fact they stated themselves less than 24 hours after they introduced it that the legislation was unworkable.  We know there is no way we can accept the system being proposed in this House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Child Care Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the new Child Care Bill, I would immediately like to draw attention to the enlightened thinking behind the 1908 Act.  We live in a dramatically changing society.  Because of the dramatic changes in values and attitudes it will be necessary in future to review existing legislation on a much more regular basis.  Some Members suggested that we could go into the next century before reviewing the Bill, but <Col N="505" /> that cannot be tolerated at any time in the future.</P>
      <P>Much more follow-up legislation will be required in the areas of child care, family support services and community care services.  Discussions in this area should be ongoing.  Legislation should not be brought forward as a reactionary response to bad cases.  Rather it should be brought forward as a result of a careful and logical approach to the issues involved.</P>
      <P>Young people in general are at greater risk than ever before.  It is simplistic to suggest that only the children of financially deprived families are at risk. Anyone involved in youth affairs will know that children from all sections of society are now in danger.  Although it is correct to say that children of financially deprived families will have less opportunities in the educational and social areas, it is arrant nonsense to suggest that children from the more affluent sections of society are not in danger of being neglected, assaulted or sexually abused. What is likely to happen, and what has happened in the past, is that such abuse will not become known because that section of society may not come to the attention of the social worker or others working in the field.  There is a grave danger that many commentators are becoming much too smug about the source of potential danger.  The Minister's directive last year that all reported cases of child abuse, including those reported anonymously, would have to be investigated by a director of community care was most appropriate in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can ask the question often enough why there has been an upsurge of child neglect, violence and assault.  We do not ask such questions with a completely open mind.  We are much too ready to fall back on the simple and convenient answer of financial deprivation. Of course, that answer neatly avoids the need for each one of us to examine our own conscience.  It avoids the need to question heavy drinking by the more affluent sections, the incidence of watching damaging video films and other sources of amusement for the adult <Col N="506" /> section of society which is not financially deprived.  However, we cannot avoid the fact that children in such an environment may be in danger.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the child care legislation which is a considerable worry and must be examined &mdash; this has cropped up during the debate and people seem to be taking sides &mdash; is the possible conflict between the points of view expressed by what I might loosely describe as the pro-family group and the pro-State supplied safety group.  Both groups have very clear and strongly held beliefs about what is best for the child.  It must be said, however, that both groups are totally sincere and honest in their approach but believe in a different solution in providing for children at risk.  The first group would seem to have the backing of Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution, whereby the family is described as (a) &ldquo;the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society&rdquo; and (b) &ldquo;the primary and natural educator of the child&rdquo;.  The second group however would have the clear evidence from social workers and others of the terrible happenings within some homes and families and would be aware of the need to prevent these happenings. The Minister has to bring forward legislation which while recognising the Articles of the Constitution also recognises the need to get any child out of a dangerous situation as speedily as possible. Whatever the differences, all legislation must begin from the basic principle of giving precedence to the safety of the child.  Many people have taken sides on this issue, and both arguments must be recognised, but the safety of the child must take precedence.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 16 of the Act enabling the court to make a supervision order allowing for the health board to supervise a child in its own home seems to be a fair compromise between the previous stark choices of taking a child into care or gambling on leaving it in a very dangerous and unsupervised situation. The Minister has had to modernise the legislation and to cater for the new dangers in society.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to a previous attempt <Col N="507" /> at legislation which resulted in the tabling of 150 amendments.  It is to be expected that amendments will be tabled also to this legislation and I think the Minister will take them on board.  We need to realise that legislation alone will go nowhere near solving the problem.  Public opinion must change.  Health care finances must be diverted into the Cinderella areas of family support and community care in general.  Related legislation must be introduced and supported.  We have had arguments about legislation which not only affects children but also affects adults' comforts.  Very often arguments are put forward by pseudo liberals.  The availability of pornographic material, of drink and other mood changing substances, the sheer lack of parental control, which is very often the results of too much socialising are just some facts aside from unemployment and poverty which directly affect children.  I question the reaction we get when we attempt to improve this situation.  Recently the Minister for Justice brought in legislation to prevent young people buying drink directly from supermarket shelves.  This source had been previously identified as one of the major areas for such supplies to young drinkers.  Some of the adult population have complained that they could not select their Christmas wines directly from shelves &mdash; so much for their being willing to make sacrifices for those at risk.  We cannot tolerate that sort of double think.  We will have to bring in legislation where necessary and where there is a conflict of interests between adults and children we will have to support the interests of children.</P>
    <P>There is a massive and articulate campaign waged by many sources for the funds available in the health care area.  I know that the personnel involved in child care and family support services may not be as well organised or as vociferous as many of the other disciplines.  I also know from representing a large urban area and being a former chairman of the Southern Health Board, that their request for finance will have to get the same degree of recognition as the other sources.  In fact <Col N="508" /> they will need more resources to compensate for their poor starting position.  I believe that if extra money is not immediately put into family support services that the situation will deteriorate beyond control and it will be useless bringing in any legislation.  However, from experience, I believe this is a decision for the local boards rather than for the Minister.  No matter whose responsibility it is we must divert cash into this area or we will be in very deep trouble.</P>
    <P>In asking the question why there is such an increase in child-related social problems we could look at it under a number of headings.  Is it because the family unit is being undermined?  There are many attacks on the family unit, some of which are obvious and very blatant but some are much more subtle.  I have been contacted by many people who expressed grave anxiety about the schools training programmes which are loosely described as skills for life or life skills.  The people who contacted me were genuine family-loving people, neither ultra-conservative nor ultra-liberal, just ordinary down-to-earth people.  They come and tell of happenings which should worry anyone in public office.  They complain of activities which apparently lead to mood changes in their children, and in some instances they feel that these children could end up in the situation covered by the Bill which we are now discussing.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that this point might be more relevant to the Department of Education but if this kind of activity leads children into these areas of conflict we must ask questions, There are questions to be asked by a number of Departments in this area.  One of the prime worries about these particular sessions is the apparent secrecy in which they are conducted. The parents who are the so-called primary and natural educators of children according to the Constitution are being deliberately kept ignorant of what is going on.</P>
    <P>In relation to the contents of the Bill, generally speaking the public are not aware of how limited is the existing legislation. It is only when a particularly notorious case hits the headlines that <Col N="509" /> interest is taken in the power that exists for dealing with it or, as up to now, which did not exist.  One of the primary sections is section 2 the main effect of which is to raise from 16 to 18 years the age up to which health boards are responsible for children.  That will immediately make an important change which was clearly required.  I would like to ask the Minister if this definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; will apply to all legislation which is child-related as in the areas of justice, labour and so on because if not there will be a lot of confusion. I have seen confusion in the past with regard to factories Acts, safety regulations and so on.  It is important that basic definitions as the age of responsibility should be standard right across the board.  I ask the Minister to look at that and to see that it extends into the other areas.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 9 contain a number of provisions aimed at promoting the welfare of children and preventing family breakdown.  I referred earlier to finance but this will be money well spent because up to now it depended totally on the type of director of community care or the programme manager of each health board.  The family support services must get a good share of health budgets in the future; otherwise it will reflect in the dependency rate on health boards and social welfare.  There is a need to go from just minding it to actively promoting the welfare of children and I hope we will do that as a result of what the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <P>In section 5 it is proposed to establish one or more child care advisory commitees in each health board area.  This is something that many of us have asked for in the past.  We want these committees to advise the board and come forward with their knowledge &mdash; because voluntary bodies and professionals would be involved &mdash; on the performance of its functions under the Bill.  This opens up a new area of child care which was an essential move.  I commend the Minister for getting the voluntary groups involved. Section 7 enables the health boards to make arrangements with the voluntary bodies and section 8 empowers health <Col N="510" /> boards to grant-aid voluntary bodies.  I would ask the Minister to tighten up those two sections to ensure that the health boards are required to support child care and family services.  At present it depends very much on having an enlightened director of community care or programme manager available.  I would ask that this would become mandatory.  In the Cork area we are lucky as we have got tremendous people many of whom are religious groups who help in the area of child care but I think they need financial support.</P>
    <P>Section 10 relates to a controversial area which was challenged in the courts and that is the right of a garda in an emergency to remove to a hospital or other children's home a child who has been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  Initially, that removal could only be for a maximum of 24 hours. The time now proposed is reasonable because it could be a very traumatic experience if something goes wrong.  We are all aware of the recent case in Britain where the professionals were proved wrong.  It was so traumatic for the families involved that they will never recover from the experience.  It is essential that we have a brief period to look at the position.  That immediately leads to the question as to whether there will be training for the Garda to recognise the reality of a given situation.  They are not experts in this area and there is need to provide some type of training for them which will probably come under the Department of Justice but we need liaison between the Departments.  There is need for training of the Garda because they would not have the expertise.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the court to make a supervision order.  This is enlightened legislation because up to now we had stark choices: a child was put into care or a child was left in the confines of the dangerous area because there was no alternative where people could take extra care and still leave the child in the home or in another safe place.  This provision is good as it will give the professionals the option of working with families and of pointing out to them the danger of the <Col N="511" /> child being taken away and so on.  It is an excellent compromise between the two previous levels.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill is very important as it deals with the introduction of a system for the inspection of services for pre-school children.  Deputies trotted out a whole range of issues on that subject during the debate.  The primary areas are day nurseries, crèches, playgroups and pre-schools.  Pre-schools, in particular, have mushroomed.  That is a reflection of the change in society where so many women quite rightly, feel that their place in society may be at the workplace even though they may also be mothers.  They put the children either in the day nursery, a crèche or a pre-school.  Pre-schools are totally supported in the Cork area through the Cork Community Services Council.  Those who would now be considered almost professional in the area know that there is a need for the introduction of standards and inspection and all of this will mean that extra funding will be required.  There is no use in saying to a programme manager of community care that there are another 40 places to examine when there is nobody to examine them.  We will have to look at the whole question of funding.</P>
    <P>The most humane section which was widely greeted by everyone is section 57, providing for the abolition of the death sentence in respect of crimes committed by persons under 18 years of age.  As a newcomer here I find it incredible that such legislation even existed on the Statute Book.  In relation to that legislation we were really in the dark ages and I am delighted the Minister had the courage at last to get rid of it.  It is incredible that it took so long to arrive at this stage.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to mention is one that is very topical and about where there was great public disquiet: it relates to the question of the abuse of solvents. It is an area fraught with danger.  Going through the motion of writing down the various household products which may be abused can, in itself, be a temptation to young people.  Many of us who have worked in the area of drug and alcohol <Col N="512" /> abuse have been aware of the many alternatives to glue sniffing over a number of years.  There are hundreds of substances that can be bought off the shelf in shops or found in offices and so on that can be used for that purpose.  It is practically impossible to police the whole area.  The Minister is attempting to do so in rendering it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children where it is suspected they will be abused.  I do not know how that could be proved in a court of law. The deterrents, of a fine of £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment obtain, but it is an area very difficult to police.  It constituted a weak area in respect of which there was no legislative provision.</P>
    <P>We will have to be prepared to move more speedily.  I do not see why a Bill pertaining to any issue must consist of 50 or 60 pages.  Whether by way of ministerial order or otherwise we shall have to move more speedily in order to head off obvious difficulties such as glue sniffing when the Garda tell one: sorry, we cannot do anything about it; there is no legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are seeking mandatory reporting of cases of abuse.  Such provision would be good and would mean that nobody involved in a case would be allowed slip away.  There have also been efforts made to effect a change from the circumstances in which the offended person, that is the child, rather than the offender is removed from the home. Because of the pattern emerging, showing that in many cases more than one child in a family is sexually abused, further examination of this area is warranted. When there is evidence to the effect that a number of children in the one family have been abused over a number of years by the same person the notion of removing the offender will have to be examined.  I agree with that notion particularly where the evidence suggests that such action would be more beneficial to the family concerned.</P>
    <P>The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children referred to the child care area as being the Cinderella of our <Col N="513" /> social services.  Community care in general has been put on the back boiler for years.  It was the last programme to be formally recognised, the general hospitals and psychiatric programmes having existed longer.  The whole of the social services area &mdash; community care, care of the aged, child care, family support, will have to receive a greater proportion of the overall health budget.  If it is an issue for the health boards then let us face up to it and put our money where our mouths have been to date.</P>

      <P>While I agree with much of what Deputy Dennehy had to say about the provisions of this Bill I contend there is a myth around that somehow children and families were happier, better protected, almost by nature itself, automatically guaranteed full growth and happiness hitherto.  When we look into recent history we find the opposite to be the case.  That occurred because of our not having legislation for the protection of children, affording them their rights. The last sentence of the explanatory memorandum accompanying this Bill is particularly apt.  It reads:</P>
      <P>The opportunity is being taken to repeal a large number of outdated provisions in relation to children.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that we live in a crisis-ridden, difficult world.  It would appear that we are confronted by problems that did not exist in happier times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Dennehy speculated about the breakdown in family life and child care I jotted down a few of the difficulties and deprivations the majority of children encountered until very recently.  For example, there were orphaned children who had absolutely no rights at all, sometimes living in hellish-like orphanages. The former head of the children's section of the Department of Health &mdash; for which section I have tremendous admiration &mdash; outlined the suffering and lack of rights of such children in his wonderful book entitled &ldquo;The Lost Children&rdquo; which demonstrated that until recently we did not perceive children as human beings much less grant them their rights.  For example, <Col N="514" /> there was child labour when children were sent up chimneys and down into mines.  Until recently colonising countries deported children, sending them to their colonies at an incredibly young age and submitting to dreadful punishment for very small crimes.  The recent trauma of children being evacuated in wars has left them with many a scar.  There was also the more recent almost moral right of adults to subject children to corporal punishment in the home, schools and other educational establishments. Thankfully that practice has been outlawed, so that we can now look back on a more barbarous age.</P>
    <P>All of that meant that children had no rights, which is what the provisions of this Bill are about and the reason they are so welcomed by us all.  Indeed one of the greatest abuses of children was that of child prostitution and subjection to pornography.  Now that such practices are out in the open I would hope that our society would deal with them.  A reading of history uncovers evidence to show that in Victorian times in Britain &mdash; and I am sure elsewhere &mdash; there was a high level of child prostitution and pornography hidden under the cloak of respectability. Therefore, I welcome a less so-called respectable society, a more tolerant and more open one, that allows us to examine the sins committed against our children and the rights denied them.  While affording protection to children and their parents &mdash; without invading the rights of either &mdash; constitutes a dilemma, it is a welcome fact that for the first time we are recognising child abuse and introducing legislation to protect them and guarantee their rights to survival and development. Bearing in mind the world in which our children must grow up and the honesty with which we endeavour to prepare them for such I believe the skills for life programme in our schools is essential.  In the course of our deliberations in the Committee on Women's Rights during the term of office of the last Government we examined carefully the development of children in education.  One of the strongest recommendations of that all-party committee was that there be a well <Col N="515" /> defined integrated skills for life preparation of all children.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that children can be abused in two ways, by the abuse of power by an adult and by denying them information, allowing them be used and abused through ignorance.  None of us has the right to allow our children grow up in ignorance pretending that in some way we are maintaining their innocence. It should be remembered constantly that the victims of crime, usually of physical and sexual abuse, are children least capable of defending themselves.  This turns out to be far more traumatic for those who have not been prepared to face this problem or to avoid it.  That is the kind of education we have to offer our young people so that this legislation will not need to be used to the extent that I think it will need to be used when it becomes law.  If we give those skills to our children we will end up with a less authoritarian and a far more healthy society, with many of these abuses being eliminated.  That is the hope of all those involved in child care.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister and his officials have taken note of the points which have been made again and again. Consequently, I will not dwell for too long on any one of them but I would like to highlight a number of areas which I, in my arrogance, believe have not been referred to as yet.  Each one of us welcomes the section of the Bill which provides for the revised arrangements in respect of the inspection and approval of residential centres for children but it is very important that the correct income levels for suitably qualified staff are applied and the proper value put on child care because one of the difficulties experienced up to now is that we have allowed child care to be considered as an extension of family care, mostly carried out by women, and not valued.  Suitably qualified staff are not paid at the rate they should be.  This is one of the most demanding professions a person can get involved in.  The decisions which require to be taken, particularly in regard to the removal of children or offenders from the <Col N="516" /> home, need to be taken by those with the highest qualifications and skills.  Rather than being seen as a Cinderella profession and, unfortunately, social work is seen in that context at present &mdash; one has only to look at the income levels which apply and the status of social workers compared with some of our more glorious professionals &mdash; to see that this is the case.  I would like, when residential care centres are being established, to see a defined level of remuneration and superannuation entitlements being applied.</P>
    <P>Like everybody else I welcome the provision that the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; will now be defined as any person up to 18 years of age other than a married person.  I would remind the House, having regard to the kind of residential care that would be needed for children within that age group, that the implications will be enormous in that many of our residential care units have not had to cope with children in that age group up to now.  Children who have been institutionalised during their childhood need to progress through units which would act as halfway houses where they would be prepared for employment and marriage.  There is a huge amount of work to be done and I hope, on Committee Stage, to be able to go into that aspect in much more detail.</P>
    <P>This may sound like a clichè but, like most clichès it is true.  All the emphasis should be placed on preventive action and family support services so that families would not need to be broken up. I have read the report produced by the Wexford family group who provide support for families with children at risk. The evidence of that report shows that if we provide assistance at the time when the family most need support, in the long term this would prove more beneficial than in removing either a parent or the children from the home.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill provides for care proceedings to be heard in private and to be as informal as possible.  This highlights the need for a children's court.  The section provides for the proceedings to be as informal as possible.  I am sure that other Members of the House will share <Col N="517" /> my concern on this.  A practice had developed in the children's court and even in the ordinary courts of the land when children were involved in legal cases where a real attempt was made by each person involved in the case, be it the judge, solicitors or members of the Garda Síochána, not to wear their garb or uniforms but I have heard to my great disappointment that not alone has this development not evolved further but a directive has been issued that members of the Garda Síochána should wear their uniforms.  I think that is a retrograde step. I cannot see any reason for it and I would like to think that this practice will not continue.</P>
    <P>Section 32 enables a health board or the Garda Síochána to recover children who have been unlawfully removed from care or who have absconded.  While this is not the responsibility of the Minister for Health but rather the Minister for Justice I would like to place on the record that we are still awaiting legislation which I believe is being drafted, which would prevent children being kidnapped from the parent who had been awarded custody of them and being taken out of the country.  In some cases these children are lost to the parents forever.  We have not been able to ratify the European Convention as the appropriate legislation has not been introduced.  By the time parents may have the resources which would enable them to take action to get their children back the children have been with the other parent for so long that they question whether they should disrupt that relationship.  Some parents have decided to make a great sacrifice and give up their children.  No greater sacrifice is asked of a parent than to give up their children. Even if it only affects a very small number of people this should not be allowed to happen.  I would like to place on the record that we are expecting that legislation which would enable us to ratify the European Convention.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) lists the powers which a health board shall have under this Bill. Section 3 (2) (a) says that the health board shall &ldquo;take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who <Col N="518" /> are not receiving adequate care and protection&rdquo;. In fairness to everybody who will be involved in making that serious decision, we must give the resources for the training and qualification of staff so that when they make that decision they can make it with the sense of knowledge, information and education which they need but which will not place them at risk of having action taken against them because of what they did in good faith. The question of the education and qualification of staff who will be dealing with children needs to be looked at and defined much more than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Section 5 in Part II of the Bill spells out what the health boards shall do.  One of their obligations will be to establish child care advisory committees to advise the health boards.  This is one part of the legislation I wish to stress.  Those who have been involved in recommending and pressing for legislation and who have experience of working in the child care area have pointed out again and again that in order to have uniformity and to standardise the level of confidence we would all like and appreciate we must have a national child care council or authority. The Kennedy report, the task forces, the ISPCC and others have said that the standards and regulations must be done on a national level.  Because this is a small country that would not be such a large or difficult task.  If this is not done on a national level health boards might be left at a disadvantage in not knowing what standards to use.  Anomalies may arise between one health board and another and I believe that that would be an invidious position in which to place them or the people for whom they are administering.  I believe we need a national council or authority to administer and define at that level.</P>
    <P>I believe all of us welcome the acknowledgement given and the request made in section 7 in Part II of the Bill that the health boards should recognise and make arrangements with voluntary organisations or other persons for the provision by those organisations or other persons on behalf of the health board of child care and family support services <Col N="519" /> which the board is empowered to provide under this Bill.  What that section is saying is that we should acknowledge, value and continue to use as positively as possible the great contribution made by voluntary bodies in this area.  However, section 8 states &ldquo;...say a periodic contribution to funds of the body or person&rdquo;.  Here is where we get to the nub of the problem. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister and all of us know that sometimes the voluntary contribution and the huge demands which are made on either voluntary persons or bodies to carry out vital services on behalf of all of us are done so under tremendous stress and with a tremendous need for resources.  With the critical situation many voluntary organisations &mdash; and certainly women's organisations &mdash; find themselves in because of budgetary cutbacks, if we mean what we say in section 8 of this Bill then, in ordinary every day parlance, we have got to put our money where our mouths are.  We cannot continue to demand qualified and skilled contributions in sensitive areas from voluntary bodies without giving them the necessary resources to carry these out.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the provision in section 9 whereby a health board may conduct or assist other persons in conducting research into any matter connected with the functions assigned to the board under this Bill.  It is only recently that we in this country have faced up to the fact that, while we seem to have a tremendous number of centres and resources to give us economic research and projections and programmes of reality and, at times, unreality, we do not have a complementary research programme in the social area.  Social research works at the most fundamental level can anticipate problems and make cost-effective the running of our society by showing us where investment is needed before it is too late.  No more than the voluntary bodies getting the necessary resources.  I would once again like to think that this is not just lip service and that money will be invested in research.  I particularly welcome the provision that <Col N="520" /> not alone may the health boards conduct research but that they may assist other persons in conducting research.  From my experience on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I know that with a small amount of funding we could have access to very important and useful social research which we would not have the time or money to invest ourselves.  Allowing the health boards to assist in research gives them a flexibility which is very welcome and which the Oireachtas committees do not have at present.  However, that is another area of work.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the protection of children in emergencies.  Naturally we welcome the powers being given to the Garda Síochána that, where they have reasonable grounds for believing that a child is being assaulted, ill treated, neglected or sexually abused or there is an immediate or serious risk to the health or wellbeing of the child, the child may, without a warrant, be taken to a place of safety.  This is one of the most strengthening sections in the Bill and gardaí, social workers, health boards and child care residential centres have suffered because of the lack of such a provision before this.  However, I want to raise a point &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will be confronted again with this &mdash; to which I think we should give serious attention.  With regard to treating child abuse, particularly the sexual abuse of children which is very recent in this country, people looking after the health of children who have been abused make the point that, for two reasons, the emphasis should, perhaps, be on removing the offender and not the child from the family home.  Deputy Dennehy referred to one of the reasons, that is, other children may be at risk of being abused if the child is removed.  Secondly, it can add considerably to the guilt of a child who is suffering tremendous guilt already.  If a child is removed from the loving relationship of the other parent in the home it may create such trauma for the child that it only exacerbates the situation and will take much longer to deal with the guilt of the child.</P>
    <P>I have said that this is a sensitive and <Col N="521" /> complex issue, and I know the people who have drafted this Bill are more than aware of that, but because this Bill is fundamentally about children's rights and the protection of children, I believe our first emphasis must be on the child and leaving them in an environment of safety and protection.  Naturally there will be emergency situations where that power will be needed to remove a child immediately until other arrangements can be made but if we are looking at a case of child abuse within a family I believe that in the long term it is the offender who must be removed and treated.  We cannot begin to cope with the difficulties and the cycle of child abuse without a support system, not just for the child and the offender but also for the rest of the family.  It is probably the most complicated relationship that has to be dealt with.  It is astonishing and horrifying that most abusers were themselves abused. We have evidence and statistics to show that.  It shows the level of abuse which has occurred down through the centuries, but it is also a hopeful piece of evidence if we can use that knowledge to break the cycle of abuse by treating the family, the offender and the abused.  This treatment can take years and we must have units with qualified staff to enable the treatment to continue until people are fully recovered.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the supervision of pre-school services.  Looking through my files and at my bookshelf I realise that this is one area in which a great deal of research has been done. There have been many reports on the whole area of child care and pre-school services.  We have models and documentation from other countries, but unfortunately that is all.  There is a tremendous need to strengthen this part of the Bill, based on the evidence which is already available.  Anybody who has had experience in this area believes that the legislation must be strengthened in this respect.  There must be standards and qualifications in the area of child care. The necessity for statutory registration and the statutory control of standards in day care facilities have been stressed by <Col N="522" /> various bodies, including the Child Minders Union, the Pre-School Playschools Association and the ISPCC.  The point was also made in the report of the Working Party on Child Care Facilities for Working Parents.  That report contains a summary of main recommendations and proposals but begins by recommending the adoption of a statutory scheme for controlling and regulating day care facilities. They refer to a code of practice which would complement the legal framework.  This code of practice should be drawn up to include other desirable standards which day care facilities would be encouraged to aspire to or to adopt.</P>
    <P>Many meetings, seminars and workshops have been held in relation to child care facilities.  Those concerned have recommended statutory controls.  All the groups and associations I have named make their recommendations in the first instance for the protection of children and in the interests of having qualified people looking after them.  These people are also motivated by pride in the work they do, being aware of its importance. A person should not be allowed to carry on a pre-school practice or a childminding service without being registered under the law.  The Bill provides that a person shall give notice to the relevant health board of intention to carry on a pre-school service.  A health board shall cause to be visited from time to time each pre-school service in its area in order to ensure that the person carrying on the service is fulfilling the duty imposed on him or her.  People working in this area believe that one should not be allowed to practise without being registered and that registration should not be possible without a qualifying inspection.  If this is not done, people could set up hidden or half-hidden child care units, without fulfilling the necessary conditions and meeting the required standards.</P>
    <P>The National Childminding Association issued recommendations for good practice in Britain in July 1985.  Their recommendations are along the lines I am suggesting.  The regulations for good practice were drawn up after discussions all over the country at seminars in every <Col N="523" /> area of Britain.  They incorporate suggestions made by people involved in childminding and child care there.  The report states:</P>
    <P>There was general agreement with the proposed aims of any legislation or guidance concerning childminding.  It should ensure the following:</P>
    <P>(1)  That registration should be recognised as a mark of ability to provide a good standard of overall child care;</P>
    <P>(2)  That childminding should be supported;</P>
    <P>(3)  That all childminding should be registered.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation is as follows:</P>
    <P>It was felt that it should be a statutory responsibility of local authorities to inform the public that registration is a legal requirement.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to suggest that a network of training facilities for childminders should be established.  Many of the existing pre-schools associations here have a high level of qualification but the area of childminding is somewhat more vague.  There is a childminding union here with a directory where childminders are registered.  They also attempt to ensure that the necessary skills are given to people to allow them to reach the standards that would be required for registration.</P>
    <P>I have spent much time on this area of the Bill but we have been waiting a long time to have the issue of standards and regulations addressed in the pre-school area.  It is very important that we encourage high standards and the training of qualified people.  Everybody I have spoken to who works in this area would lobby for this to be done.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the importance of including in Part IX of this Bill that it will be an offence for persons to sell, offer or make available substances other than a controlled drug to a person under 18 years of age.  Considering that lives can be destroyed when dealers feed drugs to young people, the penalty being <Col N="524" /> imposed for this heinous offence is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have a positive and constructive approach to our law and I agree.  When discussing this Bill one of the points we will be making is that this legislation is not about removing people's rights but about giving people their rights, the right to protection under the law.  This is a positive, not a negative, Bill and I welcome it.  I agree with other speakers who suggest that if it is suspected that this Bill will run into constitutional difficulties, we should have the President take steps to ensure that it is constitutional and that will not be challenged. I have no problem with that, and I would like to think the majority of our people would not either.</P>
    <P>Because children are so vulnerable and cannot defend themselves there is a greater need for us to place an importance on children's rights rather than on adults' and parental rights because we can fight our own corner.  Children's rights should be fundamental to the Bill. The people who drew up our Constitution wanted that, too.  There should be independent legal representation for children. Where it is needed children must have access to independent legal representation and the interests of the children should be paramount.</P>
    <P>To make this Bill as positive as possible I would ask the Minister to ensure that we protect the rights of children, even to the extent of taking them temporarily from parents or the people over them. This legislation should be as flexible as possible.  As I said, the children should be our prime interest, but to ensure that these children are properly protected, it should not be necessary to prove that parents have failed.  There should be an understanding that at times parents or those in authority may not be the best people to look after a child but as far as possible we should give every support and help to the parents and ensure that when upholding children's rights we do not in any way downgrade the rights of the parents or the adults in authority. Early intervention provide a safeguard <Col N="525" /> for the family and the family might never break up.</P>
    <P>We pride ourselves on being a child centred society.  A very high proportion of our population are children, and we welcome that, but it is not enough to protect them against the most obvious abuses of violence as well as sexual abuse. When we talk about the maintenance, the rights and the development of our children we must ensure that no child will go hungry, that no child will be less than well clothed, and that every child will have the same opportunities.  This Bill will empower the health boards to intervene where necessary to protect children, but society must not only safeguard children against violence and sexual abuse, but ensure that no child will suffer from lack of food or lack of opportunity and that every child will have the same opportunities.</P>
    <P>If the necessary support services were available and if every family had a decent income, we would not have to cope with the numerous problems we face now.  I would like to think that the most powerful section of this Bill would be used only in the minority of cases.  I would like to see a society which concentrated on the rights of children and provided that every child had the same right to survival and success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMooney" hpid="Miss Mooney Miss Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In producing this Bill the Government have taken a great step forward in providing for the welfare and protection of children who are at risk.  I welcome the Bill because in the past I fear the State was very slow to come to the rescue of the children we are now aiming to protect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of Irish homes are happy and the children born into them can be sure that they will be protected and provided for, loved and reared to adulthood, by steady good decent parents.  They may not all have very high incomes but what they have they use to the best of their ability.  However, there is a small number of children born into families where they are not exactly welcome or where abnormal situations arise.  It is the plight of these children that this Child Care Bill is <Col N="526" /> addressing.  For such children their arrival into the world is the beginning of a nightmare and one that can last their whole lives.  These are children who have arrived into the homes of monsters.  That is the only way I could describe parents who horribly neglect, starve, torture, burn and batter their children in this fashion, or parents who sexually interfere with and abuse their children before they are out of nappies and beyond, or children who, for want of a better description, live in a war zone.  These children are often daily witnesses to acts of violence perpetrated by one parent on the other.  Many of these unnatural and terrifying situations are caused by circumstances outside the family, such as alcohol abuse, poverty, unemployment, selfishness, infidelity or lack of love. These problems can undermine the stability of ordinary family life which in a small minority of cases, can lead to the base and mindless acts of abuse and degradation I am talking about.</P>
    <P>Children living in these frightening circumstances are sometimes so traumatised and emotionally shocked that they cannot speak about their experiences at home to anyone.  They do not call the police, the health centre, the solicitor or any other person about these happenings.  They are usually too terrified of the abusers to do so.  The people most likely to discover the situation &mdash; or to have their suspicions &mdash; are a school teacher, a close neighbour or a family friend.  Generally, these people do not alert the authorities because there is always the feeling that the Garda or the health boards cannot do anything to relieve the problem as they do not have the necessary clout.  In any case, people do not want to become involved.  This leaves the children in a desperate plight; every often they are emotionally stunted and never reach fulfilment and happiness in their lives.  The responsibility for their well-being and future is very definitely in the hands of the State.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the care of these children, the main thrust of the Bill is to place a statutory duty on the health boards to ensure that the welfare of these children <Col N="527" /> is being properly provided for and that they are given full protection.  The Bill also strengthens the powers of the health board to provide child care and family support services and to improve procedures to help immediate intervention by health boards and the Garda where children are in serious danger which, in itself, is a godsend.  It also revises provisions to enable the court to place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused in the care of or under the supervision of health boards.  It will introduce arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services and revise provisions in relation to the inspection and approval of residential centres for children.</P>
    <P>All these provisions are well intentioned and needed but I cannot see any of them working properly unless there is financial backing to support them.  The most important provisions in the Bill are that the health boards now have a duty and responsibility to protect and accommodate these children and that the Garda can intervene immediately in a family where the child is under threat and remove that child to the care of the health boards.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the necessary finance is made available to the health boards for the provision of accommodation and the cost of care for the children.  If the Bill is passed in its present form there will be nowhere &mdash; at least in Dublin &mdash; for the Garda to leave these children as there will not be enough beds available in any of the homes run by the health boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that day care means the right of the family to remain a family. It is obvious that it is not the Minister's intention to destroy or try to break up the family unit but to give the health board responsibility to give support and assistance to families in difficulties and, in all but the most serious and difficult cases, to leave the child at home but under the watchful eye of the health board.  Another plus for the Bill is that in each area where the health boards <Col N="528" /> operate, a committee made up of representatives of voluntary bodies, presumably child care organisations such as the ISPCC, St. Vincent de Paul, district nurses, community workers and teachers, people with a working knowledge of the area, will be set up with the intention of advising the health board of their duty under the Bill to carry out periodic reviews of the adequacy of the child care and family support services in the area. They should have a working relationship, with the help of grant aid, for the bodies who provide child care and family support services in these areas.  This will give the community a part to play in ensuring that the well-being and welfare of these children is being maintained.</P>
    <P>A large part of the Bill deals with the responsibility of the courts under the heading &ldquo;care proceedings&rdquo;.  In extreme cases, where the health board are seeking the custody of a child, they apply to the court for a care order in respect of the child.  A care order would suspend the parents' right to custody of the child and place him or her in the custody of the health board.  To receive a care order, the health board must satisfy the court that the child has been subjected to assault, ill-treatment, serious neglect, has been sexually abused, that the child's health or well-being has been, or is being avoidably impaired or seriously neglected or that there are reasonable grounds for believing the same.  They must also satisfy the court that the child requires care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is under the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>In granting the care order, the court must take into consideration the rights and duties of the parents under the Constitution. More important, it must take into consideration the natural rights of the child.  This care order would remain in force until the child reaches the age of 18 years or if it was successfully challenged by the parents or discharged by the court because of changed circumstances. I very much welcome this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The health board can also apply for a supervision order which would enable the <Col N="529" /> board to have the child visited at his or her home to ensure that he or she is being properly cared for.  The court could also have the power to direct the parents to bring the child to a day care centre or child guidance clinic or hospital or other such service or help which the child might need.  A supervision order would apply for 12 months and could be renewed but I should like to know how the Minister will carry out this provision.  The court will also be responsible for a number of other matters, including the right of parents or other persons to have access to the children in the care of health boards.</P>
    <P>The following provisions are also covered in the Bill: what happens to children in the care of the health boards, the supervision of pre-school services, the standards and administration of children's residential centres which all come under the scrutiny of the Minister for Health and, in some cases, the Minister for Education, which is satisfactory and adequate.</P>
    <P>Last but not least, there is a provision for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months' imprisonment for anyone selling solvent-based products to children for glue sniffing.  Everybody here knows that a number of children and teenagers died over the past few years from sniffing these products.  This provision will be welcomed by parents and guardians.  The Bill is up to date and will go a long way to ensure that the rights of children are maintained and provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to one point made by Deputy Mooney, namely, the monsters who beat and abuse their children.  I preface my remarks by saying that my sympathy and concern are entirely with the children who are beaten and abused but it must also be said that parents are not born monsters, they are created by society.  It would be useful to examine the question of what creates the kind of people who beat and abuse their children.  Who are those most likely to be disposed in that way?  Can we pinpoint them and try to use preventative measures which will ensure that fewer and fewer children are beaten <Col N="530" /> or abused by their parents?  Of course, in many cases, children are not abused by their parents but by older brothers, sisters or other near relatives, perhaps uncles. It is necessary for society to look at that aspect of the problem which the Bill attempts to address.</P>
      <P>There has long been a need for a radical updating of legislation in relation to children, which has been widely acknowledged for many years by all concerned with their care and welfare.  However, the pace of legislative reform in this area has been extremely and painfully slow. Some progress has been made, the Status of Children Act which is now in operation being a notable case.  In other areas little or no progress has been made.  The Children (Care and Protection) Bill, 1985, introduced by the Coalition Government, although flawed in some respects, was a serious attempt to deal with some of the problems.  Regrettably there seemed to have been an absence of the necessary determination to get that Bill through the Oireachtas at the time.  It was put through a special committee.  I attended one or two of those committee meetings as an observer &mdash; I was not given the right to attend as a member &mdash; and it was clear from those meetings that the Bill was going to die a death.  In the event, it disappeared because of the general election which followed fairly soon afterwards.</P>
      <P>This Bill is quite different in many respects from the Coalition's Bill.  The 1985 Bill had more than 45 pages whereas this one has only 27 pages.  While I would be the first to admit that bulk is not always necessarily a sign of quality, the fact is that some significant sections of the previous Bill have been dropped.  There are some improvements in the Bill such as the raising of the age, under which a child is defined, to 18 years compared with 15 years in the 1985 Bill.  That eliminates the limbo in which 16 to 18 year olds found themselves.  The authorities who had to deal with the care of children also found themselves in a similar limbo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether this change has any implications for the payment of children's allowance.  After all, children's allowance <Col N="531" /> is generally paid up to the age of 16 years. In certain circumstances, where the child is in full time education, it is extended to 18 years and it is extended still further to 21 years where the child's mother is a deserted wife or a widow.  Perhaps this applies to some other categories also which I cannot recall at present.  It is worth nothing that we are raising the age under which a child is defined.  I am quite certain that children's allowances will have to be paid likewise for children up to the age of 18 years.  I hope the Minister who has responsibility for social welfare will take note of that fact when he is drafting his social welfare Bill after the budget.</P>
    <P>On the other hand some of the areas which the 1985 Bill sought to tackle, such as the question of private foster care, have been totally ducked in this Bill. Other areas, such as the question of pre-school care have been greatly reduced in scope.  Before dealing with specific aspects of this Bill it is important to put into some kind of economic context the sort of problems this Bill purports to address.  According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of the Bill is to up-date the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who have been assaulted, ill treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused or those who are at risk.  It has to be said that the many good ideas and progressive proposals in the Bill will have little effect if Government policies in other areas lead directly or indirectly to children being neglected, ill treated or otherwise put at risk.  Child neglect and ill treatment are problems that are experienced in all social groups.  There is no doubt that the incidences of these problems are most frequently found in those families who are under pressure as a result of low income, inadequate housing and general social deprivation.  As long as there is poverty and deprivation we will have to face problems of ill treatment and child neglect.  That is an unfortunate fact.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years unemployment has grown to a level that most people thought they would never see again.  Over <Col N="532" /> 60 per cent of the unemployed are now on unemployment assistance, the lower level of payment for the unemployed. Hundreds of thousands of children are living in families which are existing on a totally inadequate level of unemployment assistance.  They receive little more than £80 per week to feed, house and clothe a family of two adults and two children.  It is virtually impossible to ensure that children receive an adequate level of nourishment and care on such a derisory income.  These children are the victims of child neglect but those guilty of neglect are not the parents who, in most cases, do a tremendous but virtually impossible job in trying to make ends meet.  Those guilty of neglect are successive governments who have failed to provide families with a sufficient level of income to enable them to provide an adequate level of care.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking indictment of Irish society that the infant mortality rate among the offspring of unskilled manual workers is three times higher than among those of middle class professional parents.  According to a report prepared by the Minister's Department the rate of peri-natal death, late foetal death and death of infants under one week was 5.42 per thousand live births where the father was in the higher professional classes. However, the death rate was as high as 18.55 among babies of unskilled manual workers.</P>
    <P>The recent ESRI Combat Poverty Agency report disclosed that children make up a greater proportion of the poor than was the case 15 years ago.  According to the report, households with children are increasing as a proportion of the poor. Two types of household were identified as being particularly at risk &mdash; two-adult households with three or more children and one-adult households with children. There are children in more than six out of every ten households below the poverty line.  The report said that the risk of poverty increased as the number of children in a household increased.  The risk of poverty is between two and three times as great for households with children as for those without children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Given the scale of the problem it is worth quoting what the Combat Poverty Agency had to say in relation to the action which needs to be taken to address the problem of poverty among children.  It is worth reading into the record of the House what the agency had to say because it is highly improbable that we will get an opportunity to debate that report here, although the Minister has indicated that it can be put on the Floor of the House with the agreement of the Whips.  I would be happy if that report were to be debated but nevertheless on the basis that I believe it will not be debated, it is important to have on the record of the House the recommendations of the Combat Poverty Agency in this regard.  Part I of the report deals in the first place with the question of unemployment and poverty and Part II deals with the inadequacy of welfare payments.  On page viii of Part I, paragraph 3.5, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The third key issue that needs to be addressed is the widespread extent of poverty among families with children. Even with the qualifications that the ESRI researchers make about how the exact levels vary depending on the equivalence scale used, their findings raise concern about the number of children growing up in poverty and highlight issues such as the fall in the real value of child benefit over time.  There is clearly a need to look at all policies that affect children, especially social welfare, health and education, and to develop a comprehensive integrated policy to tackle family poverty.  Also, in view of the sensitivity of the findings to the equivalence scale used, there is a need to investigate in some detail the actual costs associated with children. The Agency has already prioritised the issue of child poverty and is undertaking a comprehensive review of the extent of the problem and the range of measures necessary to counter it. These findings give this task an added urgency.</P>
    <P>The agency go on to recommend:</P>
    <P>(i)  there should be a recognition of the costs associated with bringing up children and a significant increase in <Col N="534" /> the state's financial support for families with children;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to this end, immediate consideration should be given to increasing the value of Child Benefit as a way of recognising the additional costs associated with bringing up children while avoiding the creation of poverty traps.</P>
    <P>(iii)  to complement action in relation to income support, urgent attention should be given to developing high quality early childhood education for disadvantaged children, increasing resources to primary schools in poor neighbourhoods and providing comprehensive day-care services for poor families.</P>
    <P>I will be referring later to the last recommendation. Let me say that this Bill fudges the issue of pre-school education and child care facilities, and attempts to deal with it under the broad heading of pre-school services.</P>
    <P>Despite this evidence from the agency, the present Fianna Fáil Government and, indeed, the previous Coalition Administration, have introduced a series of cutbacks which have directly affected the welfare of children and made it even more difficult for parents on low incomes to cope.  There was, of course, the withdrawal of food subsidies and the almost total withdrawal of clothing grants.  This Government have followed suit by reducing the value of shoe grants for children, deliberately increasing the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools and blocking the appointment of new remedial teachers. Under both Governments there has been a general tightening up of supplementary welfare payments.  The introduction of the hospital charges has contributed to the pressure on families with children, and the almost total absence of decent dental and particularly orthodontic treatment for children has been a disgrace. All these factors lead to greater pressure on parents.  Some parents simply cannot cope, and the result sometimes is that children are simply neglected or ill-treated. It is not enough to express concern about this or take action against parents who offend, until we have a society where poverty and deprivation <Col N="535" /> have been eliminated.  Those who determine the economic conditions under which people live must share the guilt for the neglect and ill-treatment of children.</P>
    <P>Even if this Bill is passed and the proposals in it put into effect, they will have little impact on the overall problem unless the staff and resources are devoted to implementing them effectively.  Over the past few years most health boards have had to implement sweeping cutbacks because of the savage reductions in their financial allocations from central Government.  Indeed, we have heard dramatic accounts from consultants in Temple Street Hospital, the children's hospital on the north side of the city of Dublin, of the impact of the cutbacks on the standard of health care in their hospital.  The health board personnel who are already dealing with the child care area are already stretched to their limit and simply will not be able to cope with the additional workload arising from this Bill unless there is a substantial increase in finance and staffing levels.</P>
    <P>In some respects the priorities in the Bill seem to be wrong.  There are pages and pages dealing with procedures for taking children into care and dealing with the custody of children outside the so-called natural family, but little or nothing on the support needed by the natural family to ensure that it will not be necessary to take the child away in the first place.  Again, in relation to cases where children may be sexually abused by another member of the family, the emphasis in the Bill is on the removal of the child from the family home.  Those organisations dealing with the victims of child sexual abuse have made the point on a number of occasions that the best approach in many cases is to move the offending person out of the home and leave the child with the rest of the family. That may not be possible in all cases.  It depends on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill gives important power to the Garda in relation to taking children to a place of safety.  This raises the whole question of the training of the Garda to deal with these situations, something I understand is almost nonexistent at the moment.  It will certainly <Col N="536" /> be necessary for the Garda authorities to be involved in these matters on some occasions, but it is important that it should be only those members of the force who have received the training necessary to enable them to carry out their functions without causing further distress to what is already probably a very distressed and upset child.  It is a responsibility on the Garda authorities and on Government generally to ensure that the Garda authorities have the resources to train sufficient gardaí in every district so that they are capable of dealing with these extremely sensitive issues.</P>
    <P>One area not dealt with at all in the Bill is the question of school attendance. I understand that only in Dublin city and Cork city there are school attendance officers, and that the officers do not operate generally as school attendance officers, or truant officers as they used to, but act more as welfare workers, which is all to the good.  Indeed, their name, if nothing else, should be changed.  In other areas of the country, technically the question of school attendance is a function for the Garda.  The Garda cannot deal adequately with that question and, even if they could in terms of resources and personnel, it is doubtful in this modern age that simply having a garda call to the house about a young girl or boy who is not attending school and threatening jail or court proceedings against the parents or taking the child into care is an inadequate approach to the problem.  The way the service has developed in the Dublin and Cork areas should be extended throughout the country but it cannot be done simply by putting those responsibilities on to the Garda.  The whole question of that area of responsibility has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The part of the Bill, dealing with the question of children who may be the subject of care proceedings also raised the question of the right of legal representation for parents who may want to contest these proceedings.  The present system of legal aid in civil cases where it can sometimes take several weeks even to get an interview with a solicitor is quite unsatisfactory.  There is a need to <Col N="537" /> establish the right of parents to proper legal representation in these cases.</P>
    <P>This Bill also appears to adopt a much more limited approach to the question of child care services.  The 1985 Bill obliged the Minister to make regulations for the registration by each health board of &ldquo;premises in its area other than premises wholly or mainly used as private dwellings, where children are received regularly to be looked after for reward for such period of the day as may be prescribed&rdquo;. This Bill, which refers only to pre-school services, would seem much more restrictive and it seems to me the Government have ducked an area which needs regulation urgently.  I propose to introduce some amendments on Committee Stage in relation to this whereby there will be a clear definition of what is pre-school education, at what age it starts and what should be the regulation in regard to child care services.</P>
    <P>A scheme of registration of day care nurseries, creches and childminders was one of the recommendations made by the working party on child care facilities for working parents.  However, it is regrettable that this Bill, and the 1985 Bill, totally ignored one of the key recommendations of The Workers' Party under the provision of day care facilities for children in chapter 3.  Recommendation 11 says that day care needs of working parents should be regarded as an aspect of the totality of local community needs and, as such, any measures designed to meet these needs should be regarded as part of the total network of community-based services which are intended to cater for community needs on a co-ordinated, integrated basis.  Recommendation 12 says that all child care services should be provided through or under the aegis of the community care programme administered by the regional health boards.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, unlike the 1985 one, the question of private foster care is totally ignored.  Private foster care is not an ideal arrangement and probably should be abolished completely, but as long as it is allowed to continue there is a need for control.  Many of those who have to use private foster care at the moment are <Col N="538" /> people for whom day care is not a practical proposition for instance, single parents, who work night shifts or who have to travel in the course of their work. A nurse, for instance, who is a single mother will still probably have to work night shifts and will not be able to use normal daycare services.  This is a category of people who face particular problems and their needs require particular attention.</P>
    <P>On the question of solvent abuse, this Bill again restricts the attempt to deal with this problem.  The provisions of the Bill dealing with solvent abuse are disappointing and inadequate.  The provisions of the Bill represent a watering down of the provisions in the previous 1985 Bill.  There is a point I want to make in relation to this matter.  Given that the problem has been spreading and that in the last year seven young children have died as a result of solvent abuse, I would hope that this Bill, <i>in toto,</i> would be passed by this House by Christmas.  If that is not the Minister's intention, I would urge him to take the section on solvent abuse out of his present Bill, strengthen it, and bring it forward as a single short Bill which could be dealt with urgently by this House.  The fact that seven young boys and girls have died in the last year is sufficient evidence for the Minister to take such emergency action. It is an urgent problem and it requires urgent attention.  There is no indication that the problem is reducing.  In fact the evidence is that the incidence of death from solvent abuse is increasing.  That is why I urge, if it is not the intention of the Minister to get this Bill completed by the end of the year, that he should bring forward a short Bill covering the question of solvent abuse.  I have no doubt that if he does so, this House will agree to process it quickly.  I have no doubt that it could be passed through this House in a matter of a day or two with agreement on all sides, because all Members of the House have experienced this problem in their constituencies, and it is not a problem confined to urban areas nor indeed to disadvantaged areas, urban or rural.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that the measures seeking to control the sale and distribution of solvents is only part of the <Col N="539" /> solution.  There has also got to be a major education campaign to alert young people to the dangers of solvent abuse. Many of them are simply not aware of the danger, and it is surprising that except for a few recent cases the death of young children from solvent abuse has not got the kind of press coverage which other incidents of death among young people have received.  I know that the deaths of young people as a result of heroin abuse get headline coverage, but the fact that a child dies as a result of solvent abuse does not seem to merit the same attention from our media.  Indeed, without the law at all, health boards should be encouraged to get in touch with schools.  It has to be said, unfortunately, that it is the primary schools that need to be contacted, certainly the older children in primary schools; children as young as six and seven years of age have been found to be abusing solvents and those right up to the age of 15 and 16 years seem to be the main area of problem.  I would urge the Minister to tackle the problem on two fronts by urging the passing of legislation to deal with the sale of solvents and restoring to the Bill the right of the Garda to seize solvents from youngsters who are believed to be abusing them.  That power has been deleted from the present Bill.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it has to be said that we welcome the Bill which is long overdue. Its main value is that it gives health boards not alone the power but the obligation to intervene in certain circumstances. It has also made it obligatory for health boards to set up child care advisory committees.  What is absent from it is a matter which virtually all child care agencies have called for, that is a national children's council.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting reference in section 31 to after care which is important and perhaps the Minister would explain exactly what is intended there.  As far as I know, at present there is no facility or procedure at health board level for after care of young people.  Once they pass the statutory age of being defined as a child, they are no longer the responsibility of the health board.  I would therefore ask the Minister what way he proposes the <Col N="540" /> health boards would have a responsibility for after care.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's reference to the need for informal court procedures &mdash; the reference to the need for that underlines once again the urgent need for family tribunal-type procedures in special family courts &mdash; the need for justices and judges to have special training in the area of dealing with family affairs of this kind, the need for expert advice to be available to courts to assist judges in deciding on the matters before them.  I also welcome the reference to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  This is important even though it is qualified.  It shifts the balance away from the concept of family rights to that of the right of the individual child, although it has to be said that some have argued that it also places children's rights a poor third to parental and constitutional rights.  However, on balance, in terms of a compromise, it would seem to be welcome.  We also welcome the fact that the passage of the Bill will enable us to accede to the United Nations' covenant on civil and political rights.</P>
    <P>It must be repeated that the question of funding is crucial to the effectiveness of the legislation.  Health boards are unable to meet their existing duties and will not be able to do what this Bill requires of them without considerable increases in resources, including staff. We have the largest child population in Europe but the least resources for child care.  It would be disgraceful if we passed the Bill and the Government do not provide in their budget in January adequate resources for health boards to implement the provisions of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianSwift" hpid="Mr. Swift Mr. Swift">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Swift</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the Bill.  My first comment about its provisions is that they are not a threat to family life or to the institution of the family.  In fact, there are provisions in it which will act as a necessary prop to families which may be under stress or under threat.  It must be said that in recent years there has been an increase in the number of cases of child abuse and child sexual abuse in particular.  In 1987 there was 763 cases of child abuse and that figure represented an increase of 54 <Col N="541" /> per cent on the 1986 figure of 495 cases. In 1987 there were 456 cases of child sexual abuse, an increase of 60 per cent on the 1986 figure of 274.  Although the rate of increase in 1987 was less than the rate of increase in 1986 it is still clear that we have a real and escalating problem.</P>
      <P>In July 1987 the newly elected Government set about dealing with this problem when they published the child abuse guidelines which, in the words of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Leyden, set out procedures which would have a systematic and a sensitive approach to the problems. They were also designed to protect parents and other interested people, particularly professionals, from unfounded allegations.  This year, as another practical expression of their concern, the Government, apart from the funds they set aside specifically for the Dublin area, set aside a sum of £450,000 out of the national lottery for the seven regional health boards.  Indeed, my own constituency of Waterford benefited from that allocation of resources.  That finance was very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Government also this year introduced an Adoption Bill and Members will agree that there was a crying need for that legislation.  There remained a need to address the issue of child care and it is pleasing to note that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has done so in the Bill before us.  The measure will up-date, strengthen and improve the law, particularly in relation to children who are being assaulted, abused, sexually ill-treated, neglected or at risk.</P>
      <P>There are about 40 children's homes in the country, about half of them are industrial schools of the old order and the remainder have been approved for the reception of children under the Health Act, 1953.  The Bill proposed to turn them into children's residential centres. The desirable and interesting development there is that they will be subject to inspection by officials of the Department of Health and will have to comply with ministerial regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of inspection, particularly if they are pursued with vigour by Department officials, as I presume they will be, will be a great addition to the present <Col N="542" /> system.  The regulations the Minister is empowered to make will cover such matters as the ratio of staff to the number of children, the condition of buildings, and the necessity for facilities.  There is also power to insist on records being kept. That is a useful provision in that it will prove a good monitoring procedure.  It will prove useful in the future if there is a necessity, as there always is, to introduce amending legislation.  I welcome also the decision to introduce a superannuation scheme for the staff of children's residential homes.  The staff, and their representative organisations, have been calling for such a scheme for some time.</P>
    <P>Section 57 proposes to abolish the death penalty for people under 18 years of age.  I am sure all Members consider that a desirable and welcome development. The inclusion of the provision is an indication of how the law in this area has been allowed to become totally out of date.  The fact that it has been found necessary in the later half of 1988 to introduce a section in a Bill abolising the death penalty for people who are not adults clearly demonstrates how out of date our law is.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the existing law is antiquated and does not reflect the enormous complexity of the problems affecting children, their families and the professionals who deal with them.  It rarely relates to modern developments in psychology, particularly child psychology. The law in this area should be a vehicle for the solution of problems affecting children.  It should facilitate the expression of concern, both of the people directly affected and the official bodies who bear responsibility in this field and their professional advisers.  The law does not perform that function.  Until the Bill is passed it is arguable that the law is a positive hindrance in dealing with children's problems.  It most definitely is a hindrance in finding solutions to their problems and trying to help them.  That is not a criticism of the courts, the Judiciary, lawyers, gardaí or social workers.  They would be the first to admit the truth of what I have said.  Indeed, many of them have been to the forefront in campaigns for change and in highlighting the need to acknowledge the <Col N="543" /> deficiencies in the law, and the necessity for reform so that, subject to the overriding necessity to protect the family, children in danger or at risk can be protected by our Legislature.</P>
    <P>Against that background the Bill deserves the general welcome it has received in the House.  At any one time 2,500 children in the State are in the care of health boards.  There may be others who need such care.  In complimenting the Minister on bringing the legislation forward I should like to state that I am glad that the responsibility for this matter rests with his Department.  It would have been a pity if, in view of the fact that the courts some times have an involvement in this area, the Department of Justice would have been given a paramount role. In giving the Department of Health the central role in this debate the Government are giving concrete expression to the modern viewpoint that child care is an area for concern, for care, for protection, for preventive measures and for remedial action rather than for sanctions and punishment.</P>
    <P>I welcome this kind of forward thinking. I would like to underline the positive nature of the provisions of the Bill, particularly the statutory duties now being imposed on health boards to promote the welfare of children in their areas who are not receiving adequate care and attention.  This very broad provision in the initial part of the Bill has tremendous possibilities of wide interpretation in the future development of child care services.</P>

      <P>I confirm that I wish to share my time with Deputy Shatter. I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for <Col N="544" /> allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight.  It is a matter of widespread concern, particularly for those people living in the smoke-controlled zone area in Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that I have raised this issue in the Dáil on many occasions over the past 18 months &mdash; in fact this is the 27th occasion.  This is an acute problem in the city, but especially in Ballyfermot. I want to emphasise at the outset of the debate that smog is a serious danger to health.  It not only exacerbates illness like asthma, bronchitis, cardiovascular and coronary problems but it may also be a contributing factor to cancer.  We know that it is costly from a health point of view and every time there is a serious problem with smog, visits to doctors in the affected areas greatly multiply, as do the number of prescriptions dispensed and the admissions to hospitals.  That cost factor must be borne in mind.  There is a saving when we do something about smog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government introduced the Air Pollution Bill in the Seanad.  Unfortunately, the general election intervened and the Bill lapsed.  The present Government reintroduced the Bill as it stood as one of their first measures, which I welcomed, and it was passed unanimously in this House last year.  Subsequent to that in February of this year, my Fine Gael colleague from my area, councillor Charles McManus, tabled a motion in Dublin City Council asking that all of Ballyfermot, acknowledged to be the most severely affected area in the city and country, should be declared a smoke-controlled area.  On the recommendation of the city manager, the city council approved that one eighth of Ballyfermot &mdash; the 800 houses in Ballyfermot between Garryowen Road and Kylemore Road and between Ballyfermot Road and Landen Road, be declared a smoke-free zone.  Councillor McManus and I jointly challenged the absurdity of this small area being declared a smoke-free zone, but it has to be said that it was the city manager's proposal that it would be such a small area.  I do not know whether he had had any discussions with the Minister for the Environment, who might clarify that <Col N="545" /> point.  The first smoke-controlled zone area was declared in this absurdly small area by the city council in April.  Because there were objections a public inquiry was ordered, as provided for in the legislation and that was completed in June. The report was submitted to the Minister and some days ago he confirmed the order with some variations.  That is the background to the events.</P>
    <P>Public consultation is very desirable and has taken place in this case, but we cannot afford to allow the process to be so long in the future.  Admittedly, this is the first case, and it may take longer than usual, but we have to speed up the process.  The Minister in his statement last week said he will consider no further smoke-controlled zone areas from local authorities until this pilot scheme has been tried and tested.  I regret that very much and I request the Minister to change his mind on that point and indicate tonight that he is prepared to consider requests from local authorities for smoke controlled zone areas where there are particular problems.  The Minister acknowledge in his statement that under the Act he has to give six months' notice, so the order does not take effect until May next year.  In reality this means that the order does not take effect until the winter of 1989-90.  Therefore, the earliest date at which results will be available from the pilot scheme &mdash; I contend the area is so small that any results can be contested &mdash; is in summer 1990.  If the Minister is to persist that he will consider no further smoke-controlled zone areas, we will have another three to five winters of smog, like we had last night in the city, which is very debilitating even for those like myself who do not have chest problems. I ask the Minister to change his mind on that and to consider reasonably any smoke-controlled zone orders made by local authorities from now on.</P>
    <P>Some people have criticised the Minister for allowing the use of coal and briquettes in the order.  I am not among those who have criticised the Minister, because it is right that the claims made for the coal and peat briquette burning fires be tested in the pilot scheme.  If peat briquettes have such low smoke content, as Bord na Móna claim, they would meet <Col N="546" /> all EC air pollution criteria and it would be wrong to ban them.  Briquettes have the added attraction of being Irish made, thus helping to create jobs.  It would be silly to ban them if in fact they were not a contributory factor to the problem. However if the results of the pilot scheme show differently, the Minister would have to change his mind, and I am sure he would.  The argument that it is Irish does not hold good for coal, but the Minister could have been open to challenge in the courts if he did not allow the coal burning fire.  The coal industry have made an effort to meet the problem.  If the coal burning fire performs as the coal industry claim, this will also contribute to the elimination of air pollution and meeting the criteria set by the European Commission. Coal does not have the advantage of being manufactured in Ireland, although there are jobs in the coal industry, so it does not have the same attraction for me.</P>
    <P>Gas is produced in Ireland and is the cleanest of all fuels.  It is good there are Irish fuels that meet the EC criteria.  I hope when people make their choices in relation to the fuels they use they will consider giving preference to Irish made products, because unemployment is one of the major problems of the country and Ballyfermot has more than its share of unemployment.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge the special problems of Ballyfermot.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister's package is reasonably balanced as between tenants, tenant purchasers and purchasers, but one category has been omitted.  The Minister has gone a long way towards creating a reasonable balance between those three categories.  However, there is a category who have been very hard done by, namely, the category who since the city council made its order back in March-April &mdash; between the time when they thought the order was in and the Minister confirmed the order a week ago &mdash; in anticipation of the Minister's confirmation went ahead and entered into contracts particularly to have gas installed.  Having taken that initiative to help solve the problem in that area this winter they are now to be penalised by having no grant.  This is most unfair.  It is penalising initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> I know the Minister made a statement in June warning people not to opt but not everybody reads every ministerial statement. I communicated the fact that people should not opt until a decision was made.  I appeal to the Minister to understand the problem.  People who thought they were doing the right thing are now penalised.  I would ask him to go back to the Government to get agreement that the grants would cover those people who opted for appliances which, otherwise, would qualify but who opted before his statement was made and since the City Council made its order.  That is my second request to him.</P>
    <P>My third request relates to another aspect of pollution in our city &mdash; I regret to say it as a former Minister for Transport &mdash; and that is the pollution caused by buses in the city.  A lot of pollution is caused by buses and trucks.  There are many buses going around the city billowing black fumes.  When they get to the termini especially at this time of the year when it is cold the drivers &mdash; for understandable reasons, perhaps, to keep themselves warm &mdash; leave the engines running.  I would ask the Minister to approach the board of CIE with a view to having this stopped even if it means providing in the buses independent heating in the cab while they are waiting to move off &mdash; sometimes it can be for five or ten minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My fourth request to the Minister concerns the scheme and the variety of grants he announced which of necessity are complicated.  Every house is different.  I would ask the Minister to make officials available in the area to answer queries so that people, whether tenants or tenant purchasers, can say what appliances they had and what appliances they want and can be told specifically what grant they are entitled to.  There is a lot of confusion in this area. I would be grateful if the Minister could do that quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a problem that will continue.  I hope we can do more than the Minister has been able to do in his statement.  It is <Col N="548" /> a first step.  We should be much more committed to taking speedy steps to eliminate this problem than is indicated in the Minister's statement.  I urge him to review the situation in that light.  I now give way to my colleague, Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Mitchell, has outlined the problems as they apply in Ballyfermot and has done so very ably.  I do not intend to address the problems of Ballyfermot but I intend to address, in my contribution, the problems of the entire city and county of Dublin.  The reality is that we cannot erect a large wall around some portion of the city and say the smog problems are confined to that portion of the city.  They stretch now throughout the length and breadth of the city and county of Dublin, as everyone in Dublin is aware.  Whereas I welcome the fact that the Minister has made the special control area order for the Ballyfermot area it is my view that what is being done is too little and is too late.</P>
      <P>What is now required is a radical departure from the pedestrian approach that we have seen from this Minister to date on this issue.  We need a Dublin smog action plan.  We need recognition from Government of the extent of the problem not merely in the context of the cost to the medical service but of the human impact of this problem on people living throughout Dublin.  There is a need for a series of steps to be taken to tackle this issue.  When the Minister announced that the order for Ballyfermot was being made I regret that he very specifically said that he would not be making further orders until various tests which he wants carried out by Eolas have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the brief time available to me I am going to ask the Minister to take a series of actions.  The first action that should be taken is that on a daily basis RTE should broadcast smog alert warnings when smog is going to reach dangerous levels within the city and county of Dublin.  If RTE can make announcements regarding the pollen count in the summer, they should make similar announcements to warn people when evening is coming and when it appears that we are going to have <Col N="549" /> a major smog problem in the city.  The elderly, those who have chest problems, those who suffer from the type of illnesses which Deputy Mitchell described, deserve to have some warning signal both on television and radio.  The Minister has the capacity to arrange for that to take place.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister should launch a major public service information campaign. The problem requires not merely ministerial initiatives but the help and co-operation of everyone living in the city and county of Dublin.  We are currently wasting money on a campaign entitled &ldquo;Let us get the lead out&rdquo; to exhort people to purchase lead-free petrol from 36 out of the 3,400 garages in the State when what we need is a &ldquo;Let us get the smoke out&rdquo; campaign.  If the Department of the Environment can spend money on advertising on the air waves to encourage people to use unleaded petrol &mdash; which they should be encouraged to do if only the garages were selling it &mdash; at this time in the context of the problems in Dublin we should have a &ldquo;Let us get the smoke out&rdquo; campaign.  The Minister should encourage the people outside the Ballyfermot area to take initiatives themselves to reduce the level of smoke that is polluting the city and county.  There is a need for a greater degree of urgency.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Minister should no longer wait for local authorities, either in Dublin city or in Dublin county, to isolate portions of the city and county to have named special control areas.  Under section 39 (4) of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the Minister can direct a local authority to designate special control areas, special smoke free areas.  I call on the Minister to direct Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation to take the steps necessary to designate the entire city and county of Dublin as special control areas so that the procedures are immediately initiated. If public inquiries need to be held, they can be held this year in the month of December and the necessary orders can be made well before next winter so that we do not find ourselves in a position where the problem is repeated next winter and where the only smoke control zone in Dublin is Ballyfermot.  This should apply to the entire city and county. <Col N="550" /> The Corporation are too slow to act in these matters and the Department of the Environment have not shown the required urgency.</P>
    <P>I would also urge the Minister, and I think he would have support from all parties in this House, to introduce an amendment to the Air Pollution Act.  It is unsatisfactory that the order in respect of Ballyfermot will take six months to take effect.  It will not take effect until 31 May 1989, when the problem will be solved by the onset of the summer months.  There is no particular reason why the Act could not provide for this type of order to become operative within three months of it being made and I urge the Minister to do that.  I also ask him to take a further initiative and that is to discuss with his Cabinet colleagues extending the type of grants now being provided to Ballyfermot, to the city and the county of Dublin to tackle this problem. The cost factors Deputy Mitchell mentioned in the area of health will be a great deal greater than the necessary financial input to provide a scheme of grants to assist people to convert from the current fuels that create the smoke problems obtaining in this city.</P>
    <P>The next initiative I would ask the Minister to take &mdash; with the assistance of his departmental and local authority officials &mdash; is to identify what industries within the city and county of Dublin and contributing to the smog problem we have, to ensure that they are brought within the provisions of the Air Pollution Act and, if necessary, ensure that action is taken in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for contributing. Rather than read my prepared <Col N="551" /> script perhaps the quickest way to get the information across would be to answer their questions.  I share the concern expressed by the two Deputies about this problem which is becoming worse and which must be dealt with now.</P>
      <P>As everybody understands, under the legislation, the important thing is that the question of the creation of these smokeless zones is a matter for Dublin Corporation but I do have the power to direct them, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The whole question about delays has been gone into in some detail by Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I accept what he says to be true except, of course, that there were circumstances in which there were 12 objections to the order being made.  That happened on this occasion.  Personally I do not think it will happen on any other. There were special circumstances applicable this time.  But in other areas, when control orders are being made, we will be able to overcome that obstacle and be able to attend to the business in hand somewhat quicker.  Other areas will be considered now.  I am satisfied that that is the way it should be done, so I can see the point.  I am now inviting Dublin Corporation to proceed.  They have completed surveys in respect of some other areas contiguous to that area and other places as well in the city and county.  I am happy to press them to do it now.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputy Mitchell recognised the problem about the burning of briquettes and the full burning fire. I shall not go into this matter.  I axed it in a quasi-official way.  I considered all the evidence available to me and there was overwhelming evidence to support what I did.  The grant was as balanced and as generous as I could possibly make it in all the circumstances.  I recognise the position of those people about whom the Deputy spoke who may have taken the option earlier than was intended.  I will examine the matter but I would invite the Deputy to consider the provisions of section 45 of the Air Pollution Act which I am fairly sure preclude me from doing anything to help out the people he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that that <Col N="552" /> acts as a disincentive to everybody else in the city and county from doing anything about their problem until the Minister makes further orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Without an order they cannot get the grant assistance but, if we can get the grant assistance in place now, it will be a similar type of grant assistance that will be applicable.  But the provisions of section 45 are specific.  We agreed them unanimously.  However, I would rather get on with the job now than talk about amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Deputy is saying.  However, he will acknowledge that they were forewarned of the dual situation.  The reason they were forewarned was on account of the provisions of section 45.  I understand that the Deputy himself, by way of circular, told the people in that area to be careful of what they were doing. Anyway, Deputy Mitchell has made the point.  I shall examine it.  But I would have to say that, from by casual perusal of the provisions of that section this evening, it would appear that I am precluded from doing anything.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point the Deputy made about buses, I should say that I shall contact CIE on behalf of us all in this matter.  I think there might be a need for some calibration of the systems which would take care of much of that problem. Certainly emissions from buses contribute to the level of emissions of smoke in the city, not to a great percentage degree, but it should be remembered that every little adds to the total.</P>
      <P>I should say that officials will be available in the Ballyfermot area to advise on these matters on Thursday of next week. They will be officials of Dublin Corporation, not mine, who will be there in the Ballyfermot school.  I can confirm that to the Deputy later.</P>

      <P>With regard to the action plan to which Deputy Shatter referred, I should say that there is an action plan which was not reported as widely as I would have liked. It outlined precisely some of the actions I had already taken in the matter. However, I shall list them again now.  I was questioned about smoke/smog alert warnings at the press conference.  I said then I thought it was a good idea.  I shall endeavour to see if that can be arranged so that people would be alerted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Deputy is saying, that it should be done in a formal way.  I conceded the point, that I thought it was a good idea and should be pursued.</P>
      <P>The information campaign was covered in my press release also.  I will give the Deputies details of that now. That is also being pursued so that there will be a proper understanding of how people can voluntarily do an awful lot to right the problem tonight if only they would avail of the choices available to them.</P>
      <P>It has been contended that the Minister should direct other control areas.  As I understand it, that will not be necessary. I would do so if I thought it was.  I believe that Dublin Corporation, in the county, have area orders sufficiently advanced by way of the surveys they have undertaken to make the orders shortly, which will be coming to me, so that we can get on with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the testing of some of the appliances mentioned is concerned I <Col N="554" /> should say that EOLAS are undertaking some of that testing whose results will certainly be available before the next order is ready.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter mentioned industries. I should say to him that I had already taken the initiative in so far as those industries concerned.  I made regulations a couple of weeks ago which will apply to new industries are from 1 February next with regard to the whole question of smoke emissions from new industries and, progressively from that date forward, will apply to existing and older industries.  That initiative has already been taken under the provisions of the Air Pollution Act and is being applied now.</P>
    <P>We all know that the smog joined the fog last evening to create an even greater problem.  Even in the west of the country last night there was a pea-souper fog, not smog, which continued to prevail right up through the midlands today.  We had the fog and the smog here last night which led to a very difficult position; I understand that.  An instant solution is not possible. Nonetheless it is overdue.  We are now tackling the problem under many of the headings I have mentioned.  I should say that the smog affects areas other than Ballyfermot.  I have to say that there is a certain amount of responsibility on those who can afford it &mdash; and this will form part of my information campaign &mdash; to make the personal choice to buy smokeless fuels.  Of course they are a little more expensive now.  However their greater use would reduce the overall level of smog emissions in this city if only people would make that choice.  I appeal to them again to do so in their own interests; it constitutes an investment in their health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What fuels does the Minister recommend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Coalite is one and there are several other recognised smokeless fuels now.  In fact only today I received representations about other fuels that people want me to say are suitable.  Of course, until such time as they are tested, I shall not give them that <i>carte blanche.</i> However, I should say that some residents <Col N="555" /> associations on the south side of the city have been in touch with me within the last week or two informing me that they have met and have agreed voluntarily to have a smokeless area in their districts.  I applaud that initiative.  It is taking the action themselves.  If we could get that message across the city this very evening there could be an enormous reduction in the amount of smog and a huge increase in the usage of smokeless fuels.  The surest way to get their price down is to have greater usage.</P>
      <P>I had in mind a few other measures that might be taken as well.  I announced them and they constitute something practical I can do within my Department.  For example, in future new house grants will be confined to houses fitted with smokeless appliances in heavily built-up areas, and possibly other large areas, with a corresponding provision applicable to new public housing.  This means there will be no more public housing in this area unless they comply with the installation of certain types of appliances.  There will be a general policy directive issued by me under the Planning Acts relating to the use of smokeless heating systems in any new or reconstructed premises; that will include domestic, residential, commercial or anything else in the area about which we are speaking.  Dublin Corporation houses are to be converted to smokeless either by the existing remedial works scheme or a special scheme where major refurbishment work is carried out. As the Deputies will know, there is on hand at present a huge scheme of remedial works in various parts of the city.  Within the provisions of those schemes I am endeavouring to have both jobs done simultaneously.  That is a good way to tackle it in so far as Dublin Corporation's housing stock is concerned.  I am also actively pursuing the question of Government buildings so that, if they can be converted to smokeless fuels, that should be done.  They constitute enormous complexes, with huge smoke emissions, about which we could do something really big and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say I am getting good support from the few distributors concerned with <Col N="556" /> mounting my information campaign and in paying for it.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that the lead-free petrol campaign ought to be funded in a similar manner.  We are indeed getting great value for money there.  I should like the same to apply to my information campaign, so that we could have not just smokeless fuels but lead-free petrol and all of the other initiatives that could achieve our objective in this area.  It constitutes a very positive start.  By and large I can concede the Deputies' requests. Hopefully, before this time next year, we shall have made a huge dent in the problem in so far as the large local authority housing areas are concerned.  In the meantime people in the middle and upper class areas of Dublin can just stop burning bituminous coal and opt for smokeless, when the problem would be resolved within a very short time.</P>

      <P>In relation to local authority houses in Dublin city that have no fireplaces at present &mdash; I think there are approximately 150 houses in Dublin Corporation city areas &mdash; or which have conserva heaters which are virtually extinct, will the Minister's grants be applicable to those or will he allow the provisions of the refurbishment schemes be utilised to have smokeless appliances fitted in them?</P>

But there will be no grants paid except in respect of the areas covered by the control area orders.  I expect they will be quite numerous within the next 12 months; so be it; we shall just have to find the money for them.</P>

      <P>It has been decided that the new place of detention at Wheatfield is to be brought into operation during 1989 on a phased basis.  It is the intention that approximately 160 offenders should be accommodated there from mid-1989.  A final decision has not yet been taken regarding the categories of offenders who will be accommodated at the new institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institution will have the services of a medical officer and the normal medical <Col N="263" /> care that can be provided within a detention centre will be available there and, as I have indicated on an earlier occasion, the possibility of using part of the institution to accommodate offenders who are found to be HIV positive, is being considered.  I expect proposals for staffing of the institution to be finalised shortly.</P>

      <P>Normally ground rent has been fixed for the full period of a lease.  The Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1967 to 1987 provide a code under which ground rent tenants in general are given the right either to obtain renewals of ground rent leases or to purchase the fee simple, that is, to buy out the ground rent.</P>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980, which I initiated, sets out the terms on which ground rent leases are renewable.  Where a ground rent lease has expired, the terms of renewal are likely to differ very substantially from the terms of the expired lease, which may have been settled 100 years ago or more. This is why successive governments have encouraged people to buy out their ground rents well before their leases expire.</P>
      <P>The special ground rents purchase scheme of 1978 which I also initiated &mdash; and extended for an indefinite period in 1987 &mdash; applies to all dwellinghouse owners.  It is also applicable to a renewed lease.</P>
      <P>The legislation I have mentioned represents the policy of the Government on ground rents.</P>

      <P>The present prohibition on advertising by solicitors is imposed by the Law Society, in regulations which the Society made under the Solicitors Act, 1954.  The membership of the Law Society voted recently to permit members of the profession to advertise their services.  I expect that the Council of the Law Society will make the necessary regulations shortly.  My concurrence is not required for such regulations, and no statutory amendment is required to enable the Law Society to remove the prohibition on advertising.</P>
      <P>I hope to submit comprehensive proposals for amendments to the Solicitors Acts, to Government shortly for approval.  I have informed the House previously, that my proposals will take account of the recommendations in the Restrictive Practices Commission's report in 1982 on the restrictions on conveyancing and advertising by solicitors. The commission recommended the removal of the prohibition on advertising by solicitors, subject to a safeguard against advertising which is injurious to the repute of the profession.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Land Registry is required by law to be self-supporting.  The relevant legislative provision is section 14 (2) of the Registration of Title Act, 1964.  Perhaps I ought to add that the figures for &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo; shown in the table above do not include any provision for the costs incurred on the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice in the administration of the Land Registry.  Neither do they include any element for accommodation in the Four Courts complex.  These would, of course, have to be estimates. Were they to be included the result would be that deficits rather than surpluses would have been incurred in some of the years listed.</P>
    <P>I have no plans for converting the Land Registry into an antonomous public corporation.</P>

      <P>I must stress that this figure is not really an estimate.  Since there is no control on entry to the State from Great Britain and Northern Ireland and since an illegal alien includes, by definition, a person who has failed to bring himself to notice as required by the Aliens law, it follows that it is not practicable to obtain reliable information relating to the number of such persons in the State at any time.</P>
      <P>Where the presence of an illegal alien comes to notice and he is refused permission to remain in the State, he is in the first instance instructed to leave.  Failure to comply can lead to a prosecution under the Aliens Act, 1936 or to deportation.</P>

      <P>The policy of Ireland and of its partners in the European Community rests on two fundamental principles: the right of all states in the area, including Israel, to exist within secure, recognised and guaranteed borders and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination with all that this implies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting held in Brussels on 23 February 1987, in the European Political Co-operation framework, Ireland together with its partners in the Twelve declared support for an international peace conference to be held under the auspices of the United Nations with the participation of the parties concerned and of any party able to make a direct and positive contribution to the restoration and maintenance of peace and to the region's economic and social development. Since then, the Twelve have <Col N="283" /> repeatedly made clear their readiness to play their part with respect to such a conference and to make an active contribution both through the Presidency and individually to bring the positions of the parties concerned closer to one another with a view to such a conference being convened.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as one of the Twelve, was associated with the statement made on behalf of the Twelve by the Presidency, Greece, at the UN General Assembly on 27 September last.  In that statement the Twelve again set out their policy on the Arab-Israeli conflict; they reaffirmed their support for an international peace conference; and they stated that such a conference would be a suitable framework for the negotiations between the parties directly concerned which they see as indispensable.</P>

      <P>I have read the publication referred to and I would agree generally with its conclusions concerning the economic implications for Ireland of aid expenditures.  I concur with the statement that the primary case for official development assistance remains the altruistic or humanitarian one but I would disagree with the assertion that our credibility in regard to ODA was greatly diminished last year.  Our partners in development understand and appreciate that we are going through a necessary process of reductions in Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>As was stated in the Dáil as recently as 9 November 1988, Government policy remains one of commitment to the maintenance and expansion of ODA as soon as economic circumstances permit.  In the interim, allocations for ODA will reflect the maximum possible amount consistent with budgetary circumstances.</P>

      <P>(1) The Deputy will be aware that Ireland's national control over foreign vessels ends at the 12 mile limit of our territorial waters.  Submarines are entitled to exercise rights of innocent passage within our territorial waters. While doing so they are obliged to travel on the surface and to show identification. No submarines have exercised their rights of innocent passage in our territorial waters in this manner over the last six years.  All nations have free access under international law to the international waters beyond territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Submarines play a central role in the strategic plans of military alliances, a role in which their capacity to circulate unobserved is essential.  Accordingly, the powers concerned do not release information about movement of their vessels in international waters, or their numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The safety of Irish vessels at sea has been a matter of particular concern to <Col N="288" /> the Government.  The Government have brought the issue to the attention of all parties concerned through the channels of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).  Four incidents involving boats damaged or lost have been raised by the Government at the IMO.  The list includes well publicised casualties to fishing vessels which were caused or were likely to have been caused by submerged submarines.</P>

      <P>The EC Commission's proposals for harmonisation of indirect taxes envisage a dual VAT structure: a standard rate in the range 14 to 20 per cent which would apply to the generality of goods and services, and a reduced rate in the range 4 to 9 per cent which would apply exclusively to food, medicines, publications, fuel for lighting and heating, passenger transport and the supply of water.  If the Commission proposals were implemented in their present form, therefore, the provision of meals and hotel accommodation would attract the new standard rate in the range 14 to 20 per cent.  The specific rate would have to be decided in due course.</P>

      <P>Up to 1 January, 1984, United States <Col N="294" /> social security pensions were exempted from a charge to tax in the United States under the domestic law of that country.</P>
      <P>The position changed as from that date following the enactment of the Federal Social Security Tax Act, 1982.  The United States authorities have since that time deducted tax at 15 per cent from social security pensions paid to Irish residents who are not also United States residents.</P>
      <P>The existing double taxation arrangements between Ireland and the United States are at present the subject of negotiations. The treatment of United States Social Security pensions in the hands of Irish residents is under review in that context.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this was an application for a copy map which was received in the Land Registry on 20 September 1988.  The copy map was issued to the applicant's solicitor on 2 November 1988.  This represents a slightly longer time than average and was due to the fact that the map had to be hand-drawn prior to a copy being made. There was no undue delay in the issue of the copy in this case.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Civil Service Commissioners, who are conducting the current Garda recruitment competition, that the interviewing of candidates who secure the highest placings in the recent written tests will commence in January next.  It is not possible, at this stage, to indicate precisely the total number of candidates who will be interviewed as this will depend on the success rate of candidates at the interview and medical examination.  However, it is intended that a sufficient number will be interviewed to provide for 1,000 appointments over the three year period 1989-1991.</P>
      <P>The intention is that the first intake of trainees should be in April 1989, and that there should be a further intake every three months thereafter.</P>

      <P>The herdowner maintains a suckler herd and has no facilities for wintering his stock and apparently shares such facilities on his father's farm.  His father, who has land close by, has had 26 brucellosis reactor animals disclosed in five monthly herd tests concluded since April 1988. This herd has also disclosed no reactors in tests carried out since September 1988.</P>
      <P>ERAD is endeavouring to depopulate both of these herds which are regarded as infected with brucellosis and which, for veterinary reasons, will remain restricted and continue to be subjected to monthly testing.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a fuel allowance is that a person must be living either entirely alone or only with a person or persons who come within certain excepted categories.</P>
      <P>A fuel allowance was refused in the case of the person concerned because a son, who resides with her, is employed and does not, therefore, come within the excepted categories for the purpose of the living-alone condition of the scheme. Her application was refused on 28 October 1988 and she was notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>The standardisation of the <Col N="314" /> national fuel scheme, which was initiated last year, is now completed.  As a result, the urban fuel schemes have ceased and the uniform eligibility criteria of the national fuel scheme will apply throughout the country for the first time.  This standardisation was subject to the proviso that existing entitlements be preserved. In addition, all beneficiaries will from now on have their entitlement to fuel allowances paid in the same way as their qualifying payments.  Thus, the Department's headquarters will arrange for the issue of payment books to qualified pensioners, the Department's local offices will deal with the long-term unemployed and the health boards will deal with beneficiaries under schemes which they administer, namely, supplementary welfare allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance and infectious diseases maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was not included on the list from the health board of persons whose entitlement to the fuel allowance was preserved, because she was not a recipient under the 1987-88 national fuel scheme.  She was in fact assisted with her heating needs last year under the exceptional needs provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  My Department has now forwarded a copy of the relevant application form for a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme, together with the relevant information leaflet, to her.  Her entitlement to a fuel allowance will be assessed on receipt of the completed application form.  In the event of her application not being successful, it will be open to her to re-apply to her health board for an exceptional needs payment.</P>
      <P>The number of people who received the fuel allowance in the 1987-88 season was approximately 202,000.  While it is too early yet to be fully definitive on the question, the indications at present are that there will not be any major change in 1988-89.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, increases in social welfare payments are generally payable in respect of child dependants up to the age of 18 years.  However, special arrangements apply in the case of widows, deserted wives, prisoners' wives and unmarried mothers, who are receiving a social welfare pension or allowance. In such cases increases are awarded in respect of children up to the age of 21 years provided that they are in full-time education at either second or third level. <Col N="317" /> This extension of the age limit was introduced in recognition of the special needs of widows and other one-parent families.</P>
      <P>The question of extending generally the age limit for child dependant allowances would have cost implications and is a matter that would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

A child over 18 years of age, whether or not at school, is not a child dependant for this purpose. No fuel allowance is payable where any person other than a qualified dependant is residing with the claimant.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance. However, as his eldest child residing in the household, is over 18 years of age, he does not fulfil the conditions of entitlement to a fuel allowance under the national fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>The educational opportunities scheme which has been operating on a pilot basis in Tallaght, County Dublin, and in Limerick City gives unemployed persons over 23 years of age who have been in receipt of unemployment payments for 12 months or more the opportunity to attend a certificate course (including leaving certificate) at their local VEC.  While attending the course, participants receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will consider removing the anomaly whereby a widow does not qualify for treatment benefit once the currency of her husband's contributions expires, in view of the fact that this is entirely different treatment to that given to an old age pensioner who will retain entitlement to treatment benefit for the rest of his or her life and in view of the fact that a widow is not entitled to make current contributions to retain eligibility for treatment benefit even if she is working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Coverage for treatment benefits was extended to dependent spouses of insured persons with effect from October 1987.  Under this provision a dependent spouse qualifies for the full range of benefits under the scheme for as long as the contribution conditions are satisfied on the insurance record of the working spouse.</P>
      <P>Where a dependent spouse is widowed she retains entitlement to treatment benefit for as long as the contribution conditions continue to be fulfilled on the deceased spouse's insurance record. Where a qualified insured person with a dependent spouse dies after pension age his widow would continue to be entitled for the rest of her life.</P>
      <P>The extension of a lifetime entitlement to treatment benefit to widows in all cases would have considerable cost implications for the scheme.</P>
      <P>A working widow in respect of whom PRSI contributions at the full rate are payable by her employer is covered for treatment benefit on her own insurance record.</P>

      <P>The Department's information policy in relation to existing schemes relies primarily on the extensive use of information leaflets, booklets and posters <Col N="323" /> which are widely available in all social welfare offices throughout the country and from a number of other sources such as community information centres.  A detailed leaflet on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SW54) forms part of the Department's range of leaflets and it is available from the sources mentioned.</P>
      <P>In line with my policy of upgrading and simplifying information booklets and leaflets I recently (30 September 1988) launched a new leaflet which summarises in a convenient pocket guide, when, where and how to claim social welfare payments including supplementary welfare allowance.  This new leaflet was widely advertised by my Department in the media.  I have forwarded copies of both leaflets to the Deputy for his information.</P>
      <P>Our research indicates that most people prefer one-to-one personal contact when they want to help in social welfare matters.  It is for this reason that information officers are now being located in many of our social welfare offices.</P>
      <P>The use of press, radio and television in the information process is mainly to advertise major changes in schemes or the addition of new schemes such as the recent extension of PRSI to the self-employed. The information needs and requirements of the public are subject to continual review and reassessment and the methods of disseminating information are revised as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the growing importance of the services sector to the economy, of its increasing international profile and of the advantages which a system for the registration of service marks would entail for service activity here.  As I have previously indicated, legislative proposals, comprehensively updating existing trade mark law and giving effect, <i>inter alia</i>, to a system for the registration of service marks here, are currently being prepared for early consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to know that by far the greater proportion of the many additional jobs recently announced by me are, in fact, in the manufacturing sector rather than the services sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140, 141, 143, 144, 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>The question of harmonising company law at EC level is a matter for the Commission of the European Communities, which has promoted a number of Directives in this field.</P>
      <P>Of the specific matters raised by the Deputy, the only one which is the subject of co-ordinated action at EC level relates to insider dealing, where a proposed Directive is currently at an early stage of Council Working party discussion.  The Irish authorities are, of course, participating fully in the negotiations concerned. I can confirm that this proposal covers the situation raised by the Deputy in Question No. 143, namely the use of inside information by &ldquo;tippees&rdquo;.  The remainder of the proposal generally accords with the approach in Part V of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, currently before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>None of the other matters raised by the Deputy are the subject either of adopted Directives, or of current proposals for Directives in the company law area, and I am not in a position to give the Deputy the kind of detailed information on the exact legislative position in all member states of the Community on the various matters referred to in the questions concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>So far, the proposals for harmonisation of Irish and EC company law have not dealt with the issue of take-over panels.  However, the Commission is preparing a proposal in this respect.  It has not yet been proposed to Council.</P>
      <P>The Irish Stock Exchange is part of the International Stock Exchange of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Limited and requires companies resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and this country to abide by the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the procedures which exist for the mutual exchange of information between EC member states in regard to individual provisions of company law, in the interests of harmonisation; the use that he has made of such procedures for the exchange of information; if he favours maintaining Irish law in as near as possible an approximation to the law of other EC states in order to avoid cross-border transfer of companies in order to evade legislative provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of EC Directive/Regulations in the company law area which provide for the exchange of information between member states in the context of those particular Instruments.</P>
      <P>The Fourth Company Law Directive on company accounts provided, in Article 52, for the setting up of a contact committee, the functions of which are&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to facilitate ... the harmonised application of this Directive through regular meetings dealing in particular with practical problems arising in connection with its application;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  to advise the Commission, if <Col N="332" /> necessary, on additions or amendments to this Directive</P>
    <P>Article 47 of the Seventh Directive on Consolidated Accounts extended the function of this committee to cover that Directive also, and the Eighth Directive on the Qualifications of Auditors also extended the responsibility of the original contact committee to dealing with matters arising out of that directive.  The meetings of this committee are attended by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Stock Exchange) Regulations, 1984, implemented three separate EC Directives relating to the admission, listing and reporting requirements for transferable securities.  These make provision for co-operation and exchange of information between EC countries including, in particular, the setting up of a contact committee to assist and co-ordinate in implementing the Directives involved. This committee is also serviced by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Regulation on the European Economic Interest Grouping, which is due to come into effect here next year, provides for a similar contact committee to oversee its implementation.  Again, meetings of this committee are attended by officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the merits of approximating Irish Company Law with that of other EC member states, and I am confident that the EC Commission's extensive programme for the harmonisation of company law throughout the community will ensure that no one member state will be at an advantage in this regard <i>viz-à-viz</i> other member states.  However, where there was a clear need to legislate independently to take account of Irish conditions, I would not hesitate to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the assessment he has made of the likely impact upon employment and unemployment in Ireland on completion of the Single European <Col N="333" /> Market, 1992; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>My assessment is that the completion of the Single European Market will be of benefit to employment in manufacturing in Ireland because of the achievement of improved access to Community markets which has up to now been restricted by various national trade barriers.</P>
      <P>The achievement of growth in employment in the context of the single market is of course dependent on a range of factors including particularly the maintenance of a competitive cost environment for industry and a satisfactory state of preparedness on the part of business; I have been actively attending to these aspects.  The Government and the various State agencies are implementing the policy measures set out in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to create new employment, including measures to improve the environment for investment and to strengthen the marketing and technological resources of Irish industry. These measures are proving to be successful and the job targets in the programme are being attained.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to build, in the national plan now being prepared, on the progress already made and so to achieve the maximum economic and employment benefits for Ireland in the European market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of Government policies on the creation of jobs for young people in Tallaght and elsewhere has been the creation of an environment conducive to economic growth.  Progress to date has been encouraging, the latest figures showing that 14,500 new industrial jobs were created in the nine months to 30 September 1988.</P>
      <P>The present trend in unemployment levels nationally continues to fall and in the case of Tallaght, the numbers signing on at the local employment exchange has fallen over the last four months.</P>
      <P>The promotion of industrial development in specific areas is a day to day matter for the Industrial Development Authority.  However, I have been assured that they are doing their utmost to promote employment opportunities for young people in Tallaght, and I am confident that a continuation in the current positive economic trends will be of assistance to them in this regard.</P>

      <P>I have instructed my Department to expedite the preparations of a comprehensive development plan for inland fisheries.  My Department, the Central and seven Regional Fisheries Boards are now proceeding with full speed in drawing up these plans for the individual regions so as to tie in with the programmes which are being drawn up for the economy and regions generally for the purpose of the EC Structural Funds. These plans will be aimed at, <i>inter alia,</i> developing tourist angling with a view to creating the 1,500 new jobs as targeted in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Deputy will appreciate that the full <Col N="346" /> support of the angling community financially and otherwise will be necessary to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in 1987 from the Moneypoint electricity generation plant are estimated at 24,000 tonnes.  Monitoring indicates that the emissions are within acceptable levels and that there are no direct adverse effects at national level.  At the international level, the Protocol concerning the control of emissions of nitrogen oxides which was agreed recently in Sofia requires Parties to stabilise total annual emissions of NOx from all sources at 1987 levels by 31 December 1994.  In our case, this will require action to control emissions from the transport, industrial and power generation sectors.  Retrofitting of NOx control technology at Moneypoint will be involved and the ESB is committed to doing this.</P>

      <P>There has been no undue delay in processing Galway Corporation's proposed local authority housing scheme at Ballybane. However, the capital provided for the local authority housing construction programme in 1988 has been fully allocated to meet expenditure on schemes completed, in progress or already approved but not yet started.</P>
      <P>In relation to 1989, claims for capital for housing construction will, in accordance with normal procedures, be sought from housing authorities at the end of 1988.

      <P>In 1987, a total of 5,550 or 12.7 per cent of heavy goods vehicles, trailers, buses and ambulances failed the compulsory annual roadworthiness test for such vehicles over one year old.  A proportion of the failed vehicles would have been subsequently repaired, retested, passed and are included in the total of 38,063 vehicles passed as road-worthy in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant number of vehicles failed as unroadworthy would have been taken off the road and scrapped because the cost of the necessary repairs would be disproportionately high.  I would expect the majority of the owners of failed vehicles to act responsibly and not <Col N="366" /> endanger drivers or other road users by using unroadworthy vehicles, contrary to the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  It is an offence to use any vehicles in the categories mentioned above in a public place without a current certificate of roadworthiness.  Such vehicles cannot be retaxed unless and until a  certificate of road worthiness is produced to the local licensing authority.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that at present some 40 per cent of asthma patients are covered by medical cards and, therefore, receive all their prescribed drugs and general practitioners services, entirely free of charge. Significant ongoing medical expenses are reckoned in determining eligibility for medical card cover.</P>
      <P>Persons whose income precludes such eligibility can avail themselves of the benefits of the drugs refund scheme.  This scheme ensures that the net expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines, for an individual or a family, does not exceed £28 per month.  Persons insured with the VHI can avail themselves of the benefits applicable to their particular policy. Income tax relief is also available in regard to medical expenses.</P>
      <P>It is not possible in the present difficult financial situation to contemplate any extension of the long term illness scheme, as such an extension could only be achieved through the diversion of resources from existing essential services.  I believe it is possible to improve the various arrangements described and I am currently looking at ways to improve them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give details of the circumstances in which the body of a male psychiatric patient was found in the vicinity of Saint Ita's Hospital, Portrane, County Dublin on Sunday, 6 November; the patient status of this person; if he was an in-patient; if he will define liberty patient status; the supervision arrangements of same; if he has satisfied himself with the adequacy of arrangements in this and other similar hospitals to ensure such an incident does not recur; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware a post mortem examination was carried out in this case.  The results are not yet to hand. I would prefer to have the findings of the post mortem before commenting on this case, other than expressing my sympathy with the relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, however, say that I am well aware that the psychiatric services of the Eastern Health Board have moved forward significantly in the past few years and continue to develop in a highly professional and progressive manner.  It seems to me that St. Ita's has been singled out at regular intervals for very negative attacks, usually by people who are unaware of the humane and caring efforts of the staff.  In this hospital the archaic, <Col N="379" /> destructive custodial model of care has been replaced by one in which patients are afforded the greatest possible degree of independence.  If the arrangements the Deputy refers to mean the return to locked wards and high walls, then I can assure him we will not revert to this.</P>

Applications for funding from individuals or teams attending international competition must be made through the national governing body of sport.</P>
      <P>In the case of karate, the position regarding the recognition of a national governing body to represent karate is that a body entitled the National Amateur Association of Ireland was established recently by a number of karate organisations.</P>
      <P>That body has been informed that, as an entirely exceptional matter, the National Amateur Karate Association of Ireland will be recognised as a national governing body for karate in Ireland, subject to:</P>

      <P>The main criteria governing the provision of new buildings for existing or newly established post primary schools are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the need for such accommodation having regard to existing and anticipated accommodation requirements in the centre, and in other accessible schools.  The level of need is established by an examination of many factors including primary and post primary school enrolments, demographic trends, housing and industrial developments actual or proposed.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the duration of the need for such accommodation.  In general, no permanent accommodation, replacing or adding to, the existing stock of accommodation is provided at any school, or in any post primary centre other than that necessary to cater for stable long term enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" />&mdash;my Department's rationalisation policy.  If my Department is satisfied that new accommodation is justified but that rationalisation of facilities, so as to ensure the maximum utilisation of existing resources (e.g. amalgamation) is a valid alternative to the provision of such accommodation, then in the absence of local agreement to such rationalisation, only temporary accommodation will be offered pending resolution of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, from the foregoing that an increase in pupil enrolments is not the sole criterion in determining accommodation needs.  The specific information in regard to such enrolments is not readily available from my Department's records and as its compilation would involve the deployment of staff from more urgent duties, the authorisation of such deployment would not be warranted in present circumstances.</P>
