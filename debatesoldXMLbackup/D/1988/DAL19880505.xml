      <P>In view of the importance of improved competitiveness in the lead up to 1992, have the Government undertaken any comprehensive review of their legislative programme to identify those measures which should be given priority in view of the challenges that will be posed to the service sector in particular by 1992?

      <P>That an Interim report from the Committee of Public Accounts be laid before the Dáil and that the report, minutes of evidence and appendix be printed.</P>
      <P>This interim report arises because of the failure of the ESB to meet their obligations under section 7 of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1982.  While the committee see no objection to the sum involved being provided by excess Vote, they regard it as unsatisfactory that this course of action should now be necessary simply because the authority of the Government was effectively called into question by a State body.  The Committee have asked accounting officers in the Department of the Environment to communicate their dissatisfaction to the ESB.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 8 to 20 will probably be discussed in a global way and the contributions will probably cover all sections.  I should like to give an introductory view of sections 8 to 20.  Sections 8 to 20 give effect to the undertaking in the budget to phase in a system of self-assessment for those taxpayers who do not pay their taxes under the PAYE system.  The provisions contained in the sections make extensive changes in the tax system which will apply to those taxpayers in the tax year 1988-89.  They also lay the groundwork for further development of the system in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies do not need reminding that the existing tax system for the self-employed is unsatisfactory.  It is in need of major overhaul.  The Government are committed to carrying out that overhaul <Col N="500" /> and have the full support of the Revenue Commissioners in that regard.</P>
    <P>The existing tax system makes things too easy for the tax evader.  The system, in effect, contains incentives which encourage taxpayers to delay the payment of tax or to fail to pay tax altogether. The tax evader could sit back and wait for the inspector of taxes to catch up with him in the knowledge that he did not have to make a tax return until requested by a formal notice and did not have to pay tax until he was directly assessed by the inspector.  In general, penalties, interest and the surcharge only came into play from the time the evader was actually caught by the inspector.  The tax evader who just sat tight in the hope that he might not be caught was taking no risk.  The new procedures will radically alter this situation.</P>
    <P>Standing obligations will be imposed on all tax liable persons who do not pay their taxes under the PAYE system to make returns and pay tax by set dates. Failure to do this will put the tax evader in an immediate interest and penalty position so that there will be no advantage in not coming forward and making a full disclosure.  The longer he delays in putting his tax affairs in order, the greater will be the amount of the interest and penalty when he is eventually caught. The capacity which the new procedures will give the Revenue Commissioners to devote more resources to pursuing evaders should ensure that their chances of being caught are much greater.</P>
    <P>The levels of estimated tax and nonexistent arrears generated by the present system are a justifiable cause for concern. While efforts were made to bring the problem under control, the complicated procedures which inspectors had to go through in order to make an estimate, made it difficult to solve the problem. A new initiative was required and self-assessment is seen as the appropriate initiative.</P>
    <P>The new procedures contained in the Bill make major changes to the way in which tax assessments will be made in future.  Initial estimates by inspectors will be directed at estimating tax only and in <Col N="501" /> the legislation this tax is referred to as &ldquo;preliminary tax&rdquo;.  In practice these estimates will be made by reference to the latest available amount of agreed tax for a previous year.  The ultimate objective will be to avoid, as far as possible, making these estimates and to require taxpayers to pay tax on the basis of their own estimates.</P>
    <P>A formal tax assessment will usually be made only by reference to the taxpayer's own tax return.  The basic tax charge will, therefore, be based initially on the taxpayer's own figures with no element of estimation by the inspector.  A right to correct the assessment where the subsequent inquiries of the inspector indicate that it is incorrect is provided.  Retrospective interest charges and penalties will be incurred if a taxpayer fraudulently or negligently gives an incorrect return on which to base his tax assessment.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that these procedures will greatly reduce the level of tax estimates. The tax appeal procedures have become notorious in recent years, both for the capacity which they provided to delay the payment of tax and the extent of the Revenue resources which had to be devoted to largely non-productive work, resources which would have been far better employed in pursuing tax defaulters.  The taxpayer with a genuine requirement for an appeal hearing found it almost impossible to get a speedy hearing of his appeal.</P>
    <P>The surcharge for late submission of returns introduced by the Finance Act, 1986, went a good part of the way to addressing the problem but the position is still far from satisfactory.  New procedures are now being provided which it is expected will greatly reduce the number of appeals and will ensure that only genuine appeals on real matters of dispute will go before the Appeal Commissioners. All taxpayers should get an early hearing of their appeals.</P>
    <P>Appeals will not be permitted against initial estimates of preliminary tax but taxpayers will be given the opportunity to displace the estimates by making and paying their own estimates.  Appeals will not be permitted against assessments <Col N="502" /> made on the basis of the taxpayer's own figures.  The normal appeal provisions will apply to any changes or amendments made by the Inspector of Taxes.  Before they can make an appeal taxpayers will be required to have made a return of income for tax purposes and to have paid at least the tax due on the basis of their own figures.</P>
    <P>These new procedures in relation to returns, assessments and appeals, if approached in a constructive manner by all concerned, will greatly improve the efficiency of the tax system, will make life easier for the complying taxpayer and will free Revenue resources to devote more effort to pursuing the tax defaulter. Nevertheless, they are only the first step in a continuing process and further improvements must be made in the coming years, leading ultimately to full self-assessment.  It cannot be claimed that the procedures are perfect at this stage. Experience will indicate the extent to which the provisions are effective and the extent to which they may need to be changed.  However, they are a bold first step which deserve the support of all persons concerned to improve the tax system and to make it more effective.</P>
    <P>I have given an overview of the provisions in sections 8 to 20, but I will be only too delighted to deal with any further questions that might be raised during the debate on those sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am glad of the procedure suggested by the Minister. It will be very helpful to take the entire chapter and get a general overview of it.  There are only two amendments tabled, one in the name of the Minister and the other in my name.  My amendment is not of major consequence or controversy but it will give us an opportunity to focus on one aspect.  The Fine Gael Party agree with the move to self-assessment. When Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Finance he initiated the process.  He invited in the IMF, in their capacity as international consultants, to advise on the matter.  A report was prepared and circulated to all Deputies on the question of self-assessment and most <Col N="503" /> of these sections were drafted on the advice of that report.</P>
      <P>I am greatful to the Minister and his officials for circulating immediately after the budget the document entitled &ldquo;New Arrangements on Tax Returns and Assessment, January 1988&rdquo;.  That document will prove very helpful; it is very clear, well laid out and anybody who reads it will not have to come back to the House and raise a whole series of questions about how it will work.  It removes an entire procedural area from the debate in an effective way.  It also is quite comprehensible to any ordinary taxpayer.  I must congratulate the officials involved for taking the jargon out of this and writing it in simple prose that anybody with a tax liability can understand. That is very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Apart from welcoming this and agreeing with the general move, the first question we must ask is: will this work?  It will work if it proves to be an effective method of tax collection.  It will work if it relieves the bureaucratic burden which is on officers of the Revenue Commissioners and allows them more time for the process of collection rather than being involved in a multiplicity of form-filling exercises and lengthy correspondence with individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined in brief the way the system will work.  The first step from the taxpayer's point of view is that he will receive a form some time in May which will oblige him to make a return. The Revenue Commissioners will still assess all self-employed people sometime in mid-summer, if I understand the procedure correctly, and those assessments will be based on the tax liability of the previous year.  That is the first area of difficulty that arises.  If the Revenue Commissioners must continue to issue assessments to all self-employed and farming taxpayers there does not appear <Col N="504" /> to be any reduction in the burden of paper work imposed on the Revenue.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that for some period two parallel systems will be running &mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) the old system where the onus is on the Revenue to assess and collect and (2) a system where an individual taxpayer may opt out of the old process by self-assessment. When a taxpayer gets his assessment in August he has two choices. He can agree to the assessment and pay the amount involved under the old scheme on the dates required or, alternatively, by using the facility of this chapter he can be self-assessed by completing the appropriate form.  In that event he has to pay 90 per cent of the amount that he considers he owes to the Revenue Commissioners during the month of October.  As I understand it, the obligation arises from 1 October and the taxpayer has a month to settle.  Unless it transpires that he has paid 90 per cent of his untimate liability, then penalties will arise on any residual amount which is greater than 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>By running two parallel systems I wonder if the Minister's proposal will work or will we have assessments put on taxpayers by the Revenue Commissioners in mid-summer being more inaccurate than the assessments that were traditionally issued?  The onus will be put on the taxpayer to opt out and the mechanism is there, without any appeal system, to opt out of the assessment the Revenue Commissioners put on him by assessing himself, and because of that I have a doubt about the accuracy of the assessments which will be issued.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty which might arise is that there is an obligation on the taxpayer to make returns of income and, if somebody opts out of the Revenue assessment, assesses themselves and pays 90 per cent of what they think is due, there is still the obligation to make full returns of income.  That will have to be done by December next.  Obviously, the Revenue will have to examine those returns and there is a suggestion that a small sample will be subject to a detailed audit.  What happens to the rest of the returns of income?  Will the 95 per cent <Col N="505" /> be accepted on face value and 5 per cent subject to a detailed audit or will the Revenue Commissioners have to look in detail at each return of income to see if it is in line with the trend of the previous year or if it is vastly out of line?  Will they identify the returns that on face value look suspect and subject them to a detailed audit or will the detailed audit be at random?</P>
    <P>If the procedure will be in line with my first suggestion there will be no saving on paperwork in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  If it is in line with the second suggestion can the Minister assure the House that it is the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to select a sufficiently large sample for detail audit?  I presume that there are ways of deciding what a sufficiently large sample is to ensure that those not in compliance are not freely evading for years.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise there.  What is the percentage sample for the detailed audit? What are the obligations on the taxpayers?  I presume everything the Revenue Commissioners request will have to be supplied.  If there is no compliance on the part of the taxpayer and he proceeds to inhibit the audit by not co-operating with the legitimate requests of the Revenue Commissioners, what are the sanctions? In situations where the detailed audit takes place and people are found not to have fully assessed themselves and to have evaded their obligations, what are the penalties?  Are they simply the penalties incorporated in law already or are some new penalties envisaged?  It would be helpful if the Minister would enumerate the package of penalties envisaged? It would be helpful if the Minister would enumerate the package of penalties which would operate and comment on whether new penalties would be required to ensure compliance.</P>
    <P>There is a serious risk of loss of revenue in any major movement in the manner in which tax is collected.  The proposal seems to be that the sample, subject to a detailed audit, will be the check to ensure that everybody complies.  If this is not done with efficiency, thoroughness and <Col N="506" /> rigour and is not followed by the most draconian of penalties, I do not think it will work.  There must not be any perception among taxpayers that this is some kind of soft option where anything written down on the self-assessment form will be accepted, that the chances of ever coming up in the sample will be fairly small and that even if this should happen it will be possible to gum up the works by having an accountant delay the process for years.  If the Revenue Commissioners put a person in a position where he has to comply and the only penalty is the interest on the amount of tax unpaid, this will have little effect.  Fines would be of no great consequence when balanced against years of successful evasion.  If this is the way the self-assessment system operates it will not work.  While I welcome the principle and I have no objection to the way the Chapter is drafted, I see a danger that a bad situation could be made worse if the new scheme is not implemented with absolute rigour.</P>
    <P>The Minister might comment on some of the points I have made to ease fears that despite the best efforts of his officials and those in the Revenue Commission the system will not be taken seriously and will not work.  It also seems to be envisaged that parallel systems will run, with no diminution in paper work.  When does the Minister envisage that one system will be dropped in favour of the new system?  What is the time-scale for the parallel systems?</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the self-assessment of individual taxpayers.  The procedures for corporate taxation seem to be similar.  Anything I have said in the first instance applies also in the area of company taxation.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I am suggesting that the obligation on returning the self-assessment 90 per cent of the amount to the Revenue Commissioners should be reduced to 85 per cent.  I am putting this forward as a basis for discussion because this is the kind of Chapter which could in certain circumstances go through without adequate debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential to have this information on the record not just for our own benefit but for the benefit of taxpayers generally and those such as accountants who will be operating the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention for the future is that as far as possible inspectors will not give estimated notices of preliminary tax. Instead taxpayers will be required to make and pay their own estimates. However, it will be appreciated that if a taxpayer failed to make and pay his own estimate the Collector General would have no tax to demand until the inspector became aware of the failure and made an estimate.  If either wilfully or through ignorance of the new procedures any appreciable number of taxpayers were to fail to estimate and pay their own tax there would be a considerable cash flow loss to the Exchequer.  To prevent this happening and to encourage taxpayers to make their own estimates, inspectors of taxes will make estimates of preliminary tax due for this year in all cases.  These estimates will be related to tax only and will be considerably lower than previous estimates.  A computer programme will search through each case for the best available agreed tax figure or range of agreed tax figures and will make a tax estimate by reference to those figures. The estimate will issue in September.  A special facility will be provided to enable taxpayers to make and pay their own estimates or to indicate that they consider <Col N="508" /> they will have no tax liability.  If they do not avail of this facility the estimate made by the programme will go for collection. This will safeguard the flow of tax to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers who demonstrate an understanding of the new procedures and their willingness to comply with them may not receive inspectors estimates in future years.</P>
    <P>For the year 1988-89 the intention is to base estimates on agreed tax liability. The estimate will usually be the amount of the agreed tax for 1987-88.  If this was an unusually low amount of tax amounting to less than the average tax for the three years 1985-86, 1986-87 and 1987-88, the estimate would be the average tax for those three years.  Exceptionally, if there is no agreed tax liability the tax actually assessed for 1987-88 will be used. If it is a case with no previous tax on record a specific estimate will be made by the inspector.</P>
    <P>The question of cases for detailed examination was raised.  At this stage it would be neither possible nor advisable to say how many cases will be selected for examination and the basis for that selection.  The number of cases to be examined is a function of the Revenue resources to be applied to examining cases and the intensity of the examination. It will take some time for the Revenue Commissioners to free their resources from the present system and apply them to the new system.  Only experience can indicate how detailed and thorough examinations must be in order to flush out tax evasion and fraud.  Of necessity, a certain amount of secrecy must surround the factors which determine how a case is selected for examination and those factors must be subject to constant review and change.  It is necessary to keep one step ahead of the tax evader.  If the tax evader knows what the inspector is looking for, it makes it that much easier for him to mask his activities.  The odds must be kept at a level where for all taxpayers there is a risk in trying to cheat the system.</P>
    <P>Broadly, cases may be selected on the basis of a mixture of the following <Col N="509" /> methods: (a) on a sample random basis so that all taxpayers face the possibility of their return being examined; (b) on a statistical basis by reference to certain telltale features in the return; or, (c) perhaps in the majority of cases because there is evidence that the taxpayer has defaulted in meeting other tax requirements. In general, it may be accepted that default in any area of the Revenue code is likely to draw the inspector's attention to the return of the defaulter.</P>
    <P>The question of penalties was also raised.  It may be contended that a movement towards the self-assessment system will have to be underpinned by an effective range of penalties to deter abuses of the new arrangements.  The array of existing penalties which will be brought to bear on earned taxpayers is, in fact, very extensive.  For example, failure to submit a return, or the submission of an incorrect return will render the taxpayer liable to the penalties provided for in sections 500, 501 and 503 of the Income Tax Act of 1967.  In section 500 we provide for a penalty of £500 for failure to deliver a return.  The penalty rises to £800 where the failure continues after the end of the following year of assessment. Section 501 provides penalties where a person fraudulently or negligently makes an incorrect return etc.  The penalty is £100 plus the amount of the unpaid tax. In the case of fraud, the penalty is twice the amount of the unpaid tax.  In section 503 we provide for higher penalties in the case of companies for the same offences.</P>
    <P>Failure to deliver returns in time will render the taxpayer liable to the surcharge provided for in section 48 of the Finance Act of 1986 so that preliminary tax as well as tax charged in an assessment will be increased by 10 per cent.  In addition to the foregoing, section 94 of the Finance Act of 1983 provides that on summary conviction for a revenue offence a defaulter may be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000 and/or 12 months' imprisonment.  On conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £10,000 and/or up to five years' imprisonment can be imposed. Delays in payment of tax under the new arrangement will result in interest being <Col N="510" /> charged at the rate of 1¼ per cent per month for each month or part of a month for which the tax is outstanding.  The period of grace within which tax must be paid if an interest charge is to be avoided is being cut from the existing two months to one month of the due date.  New methods of collection are being introduced and existing methods will become more efficient.</P>
    <P>Overall, therefore, I am satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards to meet and overcome any attempts by non-compliant taxpayers to frustrate the new arrangements now being set in place, to ensure that the matter is kept under review and that, if it proves necessary, further measures will be introduced to ensure that the Government's intention to tackle once and for all the question of tax arrears is not frustrated.  That covers in general the points that were raised by Deputy Noonan and I am glad of the opportunity of putting all that on the record because it is important, bearing in mind the lack of information that flows out from the House in the normal media way, that we do have it on the record of the House for the information of the taxpayers, the accountants, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach in trying to clarify the matter.  I fully agree in principle with what is in Chapter II.  I have long advocated that we move towards a system such as this.  My only regret or reservation is that it is extraordinarily complicated, unfortunately.  I wish that it were not.  If there was any particular branch of revenue law or income tax law that should not try to be more complicated than normal, it should be this one.  This is the one under which individuals will have to try to deal with their taxation affairs on their own initiative, rather than what has been the tradition here for as long as income tax has existed when the onus was, as it were, on the inspector.  People felt that because that was so there was not a great need for them to become acquainted with the intricacies of income tax law.  This chapter puts the onus on <Col N="511" /> them.  I have no brief for those who deliberately try to evade, but there inevitably will be a great many people, particularly in the first couple of years, who through no fault of their own will make errors in their self-assessment returns and I am afraid, will not be able to follow the procedures that are set out in this chapter.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that while this chapter only occupies a relatively small part of the entire Finance Bill, it occupies a huge part of the explanatory memorandum, no less than eleven and a half pages of which relate to it.  It is not easy to follow.  I was interested in what the Minister had to day in regard to penalties.  I cannot see in the chapter any specific penalties relating to this new system of self-assessment. It appears that the existing penalties, in general, apply under sections 500 to 503, inclusive, of the Income Tax Act of 1967. Those penalties are adequate.  It is rare that there are criminal convictions as opposed to monetary penalties being imposed by way of surcharges, interest and so on.  Presumably they are likely to become more common.</P>
      <P>It is worth looking at other countries where the self-assessment system has been in operation for a very long time. In particular, the one that we would most readily look at is the United States.  The penalties there, as the Minister knows, are very severe indeed.  They have succeeded, certainly at federal level, in introducing a tax system based on self-assessment which is very efficient and is generally regarded as fair, except that the penalties are very onerous.  Apparently, they feel that they cannot operate the system without onerous penalties. Attempts to impose such penalties here should be withheld until the system is better understood and is streamlined. While I would have no objection, in cases of deliberate fraud, to seeing people going to jail, to seek to impose prison sentences on people who are just unable to cope with the very new system would perhaps be unfair in the early years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will be able to circulate as widely as possible <Col N="512" /> relatively simple explanations of this system.  Of its nature, it is not simple and it is not that easy satisfactorily to explain it in simple terms, but the underlying principles should be expressed in simple terms, and in particular, the sort of pitfalls that the compliant taxpayer should look out for and should be warned about should be brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>We have waited a number of years for this system, and it is welcome that it has started.  However, laudable and all as it is, it will suffer from a difficulty which our general tax assessment system in its different forms has up to now suffered from: that it seems to harass unduly many taxpayers who are within the net who have problems but completely ignores a large number of people who have not been got within the net at all. This chapter should try to bring into the net people who have not been in it all along.  The feeling is abroad here that if one gets caught in at all one gets oneself into tremendous difficulties and can be accused of all sorts of improper practices, even though one is trying to comply; but if one stays away from the thing altogether one can get away with total non-compliance, although one cannot get away with partial non-compliance.</P>
    <P>The country is so small that it should be possible to identify every liable taxpayer and to do it reasonably quickly.  The resources of the Revenue have been entirely weighted towards dealing with those who are in the system.  Perhaps this is due to the complexity of the system, which is not straightforward like the American system and which necessitates an enormous amount of manpower and work just to deal with the difficulties that arise in relation to the affairs of those who are within the system and who are seeking to comply but who frequently have perfectly legitimate and often complicated disputes about the amount of their liability.  It is no wonder that disputes are complicated when we think of all the Finance Acts every year for the last 20 or 30 years.  They are tremendously complicated; they are not separate from one another but are all cross-amending one another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> It is a major job for anybody, even with the best of professional advice, to ascertain exactly his liability or legal position in a whole variety of situations in which he may find himself.  If we had a simpler system the people in the Revenue would be freer to devote themselves to a greater extent to something which in equity is now called for from them: dealing with people who have never been part of the taxation system here.  The number of people in that position is extraordinary. Dealing with that situation would give a feeling of at least lessened injustice to those who feel persecuted within the system.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear what the Minister had to say in that he made no claim that what is set out here in Chapter 2 is perfect or anything like it.  The Minister realistically accepts that this is a first time effort, that experience will highlight difficulties and that amendments will have to be made to this from time to time.  That is the right approach, but I hope the amendments will not just be made in terms of trying to tighten loopholes.  It is particularly important that the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and successive Minister for Finance would look at this in terms of amending it with a view to simplifying it.  That is every bit as important as amending it with a view to trying to close the loopholes. When people get used to this and when the anomalies that inevitably must be in it are smoothed out, I am confident that within one to three years it will work smoothly for a very high proportion of people who either comply or who wish to comply.  Their rights and problems have every bit as much right to be taken into account as the problems created by those who do not comply.  The law in these matters should not all the time be approached from the point of view of making it more complicated in order to close loopholes and to get those who deliberately do not comply if it creates huge problems for those who do not wish to evade anything but who wish to have their affairs in order as rapidly as possible in the tax year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> Unfortunately, it has not been the tradition in tax legislation here to look at problems from the point of view of assisting those who want to comply.  This has caused many genuine people to get into great difficulties because they simply cannot cope with the complexity of the law as it is.  If that aspect could be dealt with &mdash; and I accept that it is very hard to do it in the first year &mdash; we could have a satisfactory and smooth running system.  The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance should bear in mind that it is in their interests and in the national interest to ensure that as high a cash flow as possible in terms of tax is generated voluntarily.  If that can be achieved the national interest will be served, and it will be achieved better by a simpler and more understandable system than by an enormously complicated system that from day one sets out assuming that every taxpayer or potential taxpayer wants to evade his liabilities.</P>
    <P>While this chapter is unfortunately rather longer and more complicated than one would wish, it is an important piece of legislation inasmuch as it is the first time that there is the beginnings of a system of self-assessment.  It is one that will greatly benefit everybody in the long term, both the Exchequer and the taxpayers, although there will be problems in the first year or two.  The difficulties of taxpayers should be borne in mind.  After a number of years the system should, provided the Revenue Commissioners are sensible in their method of application, be worthwhile and begin a much-needed and long-waited new chapter in the vexed story of tax assessment and tax collection here.  If we had a simpler and obviously fairer way of doing things than at present, if we did away with the underlying mentality that people do not pay tax unless it is squeezed out of them, the picture would be changed.  It is different in other countries.  There are all sorts of historical and sociological reasons why it is the way it is here; but would be in everyone's interest if it could be changed and I hope that this chapter will be a <Col N="515" /> preliminary to a change of attitude in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief points.  First of all, the introduction of a system of self-assessment was advocted by the unions and my party for several years and is now being introduced. We welcome this measure.  It is however useless to adopt this measure and leave it at that.  Special safeguards need to be introduced to ensure that the money is collected and in this respect The Workers' Party advocate that the Revenue Commissioners should have the power to examine bank accounts and that the assets of defaulters must be given to collectors.</P>
      <P>It is an established practice in countries which already use self-assessment including the United States, that all taxpayers must supply their tax numbers to banks, building societies and so on and that the Revenue can request details of the relevant accounts when auditing the taxpayer. Automatic penalties must be applied where tax returns, especially PAYE, PRSI and VAT, are not made and the Revenue Commissioners' powers to waive interest must be examined.  A separate division in the courts should be established to deal with Revenue cases so as to reduce delays through abuse of the appeals procedure.  Personal guarantees and/or security must be required of directors who have gone into liquidation previously leaving tax debts unpaid and who wish to establish new business.  An official receiver should be appointed to deal with liquidations which at present are not pursued due to the absence of funds in the company concerned and there must be public access to information regarding tax debts, particularly VAT, PAYE, and PRSI, of traders and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are well aware that when some companies went into liquidation in the past they left their employees without <Col N="516" /> any benefits as a result of not having paid PAYE and PRSI.  Therefore, we welcome this measure.  It was also recommended by the Commission on Taxation, who said that showing taxpayers the automatic penalties they would face for failure to submit a return and for understatement of income in returns would maintain a high level of compliance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to some of the points which have been made.  In respect of Deputy Noonan's amendment to section 17, I would like to say that what we are talking about here is reducing the percentage from 90 per cent to 85 per cent, which would involve a cash flow loss in 1988 of £6 million.  This cannot be contemplated.  In the first instance it was introduced in the 1976 Act at 80 per cent.  It was increased to 85 per cent and in the 1986 Act it had been increased to 90 per cent.  We are maintaining that percentage.  We cannot contemplate a reduction as it would bring about a cash flow loss of £6 million.</P>
      <P>I do not know how you are going to proceed, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but in case I forget to move amendment No. 31 to section 15, which is a technical amendment, I would like to say that it arises from a minor change in the wording of section 15 and is being made in order to put beyond doubt the date by which returns of income must be delivered if a surcharge under section 48 of the Finance Act, 1986, is to be avoided.  The date in question is 31 December in the year of assessment.  It had been suggested that the existing wording might result in the return date being put back to 30 June following the end of the year of assessment, which would be inappopriate in the context of the arrangements now being set in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal with a number of other points which have been raised by Deputy O'Malley and thank all those who have made contributions. I suppose we can say everything is simple to the person who understands it, but self-assessment works in jurisdictions with far more complicated tax systems than ours.  In general the <Col N="517" /> taxpayer whose income is large and complicated will have an accountant or some other professional tax consultant to advise him, and self-assessment will be no problem to that taxpayer.  If anything, he is too well advised, as the growth in tax planning and tax avoidance shows. The area of difficulty which has been mentioned lies with the taxpayer who does not have and cannot afford a tax adviser.  His affairs are usually simple and the vast bulk of the tax code has little relevance for him.  What he needs perhaps is not a simpler tax code but assistance in understanding the limited part of the existing code which applies to him. Providing that assistance in the form of advice and simpler tax forms is one of the challenges in moving to self-assessment and it is one which I and the Revenue Commissioners recognise.</P>
    <P>Over the coming years a programme of redesigning tax forms must be carried out.  This process has already been started with the redesigning of this year's self-employed tax return.  The farm profile form and a special simple farm account form have given a lead in simpler accounts for small traders which must be developed into other areas.  Advice, assistance and publicity must be given to taxpayers in relation to the new procedures. This is not a process which can be carried out overnight, but I want to assure the House that I am aware of the problems involved and steps will be taken to overcome them.</P>
    <P>Some of the steps we are taking are the following.  Firstly, the returns of income for 1988-89 will be issued shortly.  The returns have been extensively redesigned to make them easier to complete and they will be accompanied by explanatory notes giving guidance on the completion of the returns.  Details of the tax allowances and rate bands will be given in the returns or in the explanatory notes.  Following the passing of the Act advertisements will be placed in the media outlining the new returns filing requirements and giving details on where to get the returns.</P>
    <P>In July every taxpayer affected by the new provisions will receive an explanatory booklet outlining the new system and <Col N="518" /> advising him of what to do.  In September notices of preliminary tax will be issued and every notice will be accompanied by an explanatory leaflet giving instructions on the new preliminary tax procedures. In addition, advertisements will be placed in the media outlining the new tax payment requirements.  From September to December a continuous advertisement campaign will be conducted regarding the need to lodge returns to avoid the surcharge. In addition, very close liaison will be maintained with professional organisations so as to ensure that their members are familiar with the new requirements.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Revenue Commissioners, it has to be said that every conceivable thing that they can think of has been done or is in the process of being done and we all want to see it work.  In the event of any problems arising as the procedures come into operation, as I have already said and as the House has asked, this House, with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, will set about correcting them.</P>

The Minister, in his commitment to publicise this measure fully, to place advertisements, provide brochures and so on, should spell out the penalties very clearly and should not just refer to sections of Acts because that means nothing to the ordinary person.  The actual penalties should be spelled out very clearly.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The <Col N="520" /> Minister might also consider, for self-assessment purposes, the imposition of interest.  He said that tax unpaid by certain dates would be subject to the present penalty of paying 1¼ per cent interest per month.  That is a low enough interest rate &mdash; I presume it is compounded &mdash; when you consider that you pay over 2 per cent a month on your credit card, amounting to 26.4 per cent per annum.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are certain advantages in sending to your credit company the money that you owe to the Revenue Commissioners if there is going to be a difference of 11 per cent or 12 per cent annually.  It is worth looking at this matter.  As people look at the portfolio of their expenses within a domestic or a business situation, if on your Access, Visa or American Express cards credit costs you 26 per cent and the same type of credit from the Revenue costs 16 per cent, there is a gain there and therefore it is worth looking at again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's point about the requirement to return 90 per cent of the amount owed.  I would have thought that in introducing the scheme it would be worth considering 80 per cent or 85 per cent which pertained some years ago. It might encourage people to come into the self-assessment regime if a higher tolerance were provided in the initial years. I can appreciate the Minister's point about a cash flow loss of £6 million but the cash flow loss would of course be made up subsequently.  It would not be a Revenue loss; it would be a cash flow loss because the obligation to pay the 15 per cent when final returns had been agreed would be as obligatory as the obligation to pay the 10 per cent residual now.  It is worth looking at this matter between now and Report Stage.  Perhaps the Minister would consider an amendment for, say, the 1988-89 tax year while the measure is being phased in and give a figure of 80 per cent or 85 per cent as the compliance level.  He could also write into the section that in subsequent tax years the figure <Col N="521" /> would be 90 per cent.  That suggestion is worth examining.  It is in everybody's interest that the transition is made smoothly.  We should make it relatively easy for people to move into self-assessment and, of course, once in that system they stay in it, as the Minister has said.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to raise concerns the wider area of the powers of Revenue and is related to the powers and the penalties which they might have in certain circumstances.  There are many wealthy people around the world.  I think the rule about getting wealthy is to be able to transfer income into assets.  If people pay very high marginal rates of tax they will have very little residual income to transfer into assets.  The flowing lawns, the long avenues, the large houses, the horses in the paddock and the yacht on the sea all come about as a result of people succeeding in transferring income into assets.  If somebody succeeds in evading taxation under self-assessment, will the Revenue have power, for example, to examine their assets?  Will they have power, as a result of the sample audit or in pursuance of the sample audit, to enter a house and see the antiques and the pictures on the walls or will, as is the case in America, the sample audit be so rigorous that not only will all returns of income have to be examined and vouched for but an explanation must be given for income which has been transferred to assets and there will be an audit of the assets as well as of the income of the individual.  A sample audit of income will not reveal very much if the tax evaded has been transferred from income to assets.  That is the way wealth is created and that is how the wealthy become wealthier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in normal circumstances. I have said yes or no to most of the questions as the Deputy was raising them.  In concluding this section of the Bill, I can say that the compliant taxpayers have nothing to fear.  They will get all the help they need, as we have outlined during the course of the debate. The evader will come more and more under the microscope as we free the resources in Revenue from assessment <Col N="523" /> and so on.  That is what everybody in this House wants to see.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also mentioned the 1¼ per cent interest rate not being severe enough.  I think it is rather severe because it is not tax deductible and, at the end of the year, it works out at a much higher rate.  I know from the other provision announced in the budget and the incentive in this Bill, which we will come to later, many people found that because they had defaulted in paying their taxes, the interest had piled up.  As they could not see the possibility of ever settling their account, they had made up their minds that they would continue to evade paying taxes.  From some of the cases I have seen, I notice that half the amount owing was made up of interest.  The amount owing very quickly doubles when the interest is taken into account.</P>

When discussing his amendment the Deputy asked if I would consider the possibility of substituting a rate of 80 per cent or 85 per cent for 90 per cent between now and Report Stage.  I have to say at this stage that I honestly cannot, because it means dropping £6 million in revenue this year, and everybody in the House knows we cannot do that.  In fact, on the Order of Business this morning, the Deputy asked about possible slippages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the position of a person who is on PAYE and who is also a Schedule D taxpayer in relation to self-assessment? The new régime proposed will bring a strict level of accountability on taxpayers, particularly as it will be the subject of a random audit.  If the audit is of the dimensions Deputy Noonan indicated, and which was confirmed by the Minister, quite clearly the accountability will be very strict indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The penalties available to the Minister under the income tax code are extremely <Col N="524" /> heavy.  The Minister is taking a power of enforcement which is novel and draconian, that is, the power of attachment. What we are providing in this new assessment regime is the liability to pay taxes on it, subject to penalties for nonpayment. I presume it will also attract the power of attachment which is provided for later in the Bill.  I urge the Minister to, in turn, urge the Revenue Commissioners when applying this novel regime to apply it with the utmost discretion.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister representing the same sort of constitutency I represent will be well aware of the serious cash flow problems being encountered by the vast majority of businesses.  Should there be any interference with the cash coming into those businesses by the application of a notice of attachment, and taking the cash which those businesses need for their very survival, an unreasonable or harsh use of the power of attachment would, in my opinion, have extremely serious commercial consequences for the businesses concerned.  I am sure the Minister will agree that many Irish businesses are walking a very narrow gap between solvency and insolvency mainly due to poor cash flow.  We should not be distracted by the good national statistics because they are misleading and do not represent the true nature of commercial life.  Again, I ask the Minister to urge the Revenue Commissioners to apply this attachment with the utmost discretion.</P>
    <P>There is a technical point on the power of attachment I would like to raise at this stage.  There is an indemnity given in the power of attachment in that the relevant person cannot be sued in court by reason of his failure to make a disbursement on the basis that the money has been attached.  I would like to consider the position of a person in my profession who has given an undertaking to a bank or other financial institution.  Breaching that undertaking will not render him liable to be sued in court but, even worse, could render him liable to be struck off the roll for professional misconduct.  There is no indemnity given to a person in that position in the attachment section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask about access to bank accounts.  When the debate on self-assessment started some years ago, one of the points made was that if we wanted this system to be applied here it would be difficult to avoid bringing in powers for Revenue to have access without any court order to bank, building society and other accounts of individuals.  I do not see any reference to that in this chapter and I assume that power is not being taken.  If the system can work without it, it is obviously to the overall benefit, but I would like the Minister to confirm that fact because there are misapprehensions about it arising from various references made not in this House but outside when the question of self-assessment first arose.</P>
      <P>Lest my silence be taken as compliance, I utterly disagree with what Deputy Noonan said about the interest rates.  They are absolutely penal.  In view of the huge drop in interest rates generally in the last year or so, the opportunity should be taken in this Bill to reduce the extraordinarily penal level which the Revenue have the right to look for now.  This rate was introduced at a time when interest rates generally were as much as double what they are today. It seems quite incongruous that the Government are able to borrow at 8 per cent and 8½ per cent but they are charging an effective annual rate of about 18 per cent to people who are in default.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of interest is so excessively penal, and is seen by everybody to be so, that it is probably counterproductive from Revenue's point of view, because if somebody is in difficulties with arrears of tax, as the Minister says, frequently 50 per cent of that sum is made up of interest.  I think there is some restriction which prevents the interest charge exceeding 100 per cent of the debt.  Certainly that used to be the case in relation to the old death duties.  I am not sure whether that still applies.  If that restriction is not applicable, very <Col N="526" /> rapidly there will be cases in which the element of interest will be three or four times greater than the original tax due. The result will be that the tax will never be paid because the people concerned will despair.  If they own a company they will go into liquidation, go to England or do one of the various things people do when they simply cannot cope at all, and close down their business.  A huge number of businesses are closing down in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>Therefore it seems to me to be disappointing that, in conjunction with the introduction of self-assessment and contemporaneous with a very substantial drop in interest rates, there is not a corresponding drop in the interest rate on the arrears of tax due.  If it were justified &mdash; and I place much emphasis on the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; when interest rates generally were twice as high as they are today, then half of that rate only is justified today, which would mean it should be down from 1.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent, or less, per month, compound.  I should like the Minister to examine that aspect also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one broad point in relation to the chapters here, particularly that relating to self-assessment. I am not as sanguine about the prospects of success as are the Minister for Finance and other spokespersons. There is a long established, ingrained, endemic tradition here that you pay nothing until you have to, you wait and keep waiting, until the taxman arrives. When he comes you give him something to keep him off your back.  Then you pay the balance when you begin to be faced by penal interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there will be any immediate transformation of that tradition. It is so ingrained, my belief is that people will not come forward that easily, filling in self-assessment forms on an advance basis.  There is the requirement that taxpayers must furnish returns even if they do not receive demands to do so. Anybody who is familiar with the attitude of taxpayers on the self-employed side &mdash; and I have known them since 1957, right through the transitional arrangements <Col N="527" /> leading to the introduction of PAYE &mdash; must know that, unless you receive some indication of a demand from the Revenue Commissioners, you will not furnish a return.</P>
    <P>That takes me to what I perceive as the fundamental flaw in the totality of that tax arrangement, that is the absence of full disclosure mechanisms.  I foresee great public controversy and opprobrium applying to any Minister for Finance who would dare bring in full disclosure.  But, without full disclosure, self-assessment is like a very expensive £60,000 car with one component missing, the battery.  Its value remains at that level until somebody buys the battery.  The real battery of the taxation system is full disclosure. Anybody, knowing that they are faced with full disclosure, that there is no escape, no matter where they may be, unless they keep the money as was the custom in the past, under the bed or in their part of the room&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The box I knew as a child containing the sovereigns from America was carefully placed on their side of the bed.  I contend that, unless there is the prospect of full disclosure, the concept of self-assessment will have grave difficulty in succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know only too well from our experiences that, without total access by the Revenue Commissioners, I would even venture to say on a print-out basis, by an officer lifting the telephone and saying: &ldquo;I want A to B on my desk, tomorrow morning from this or that bank manager, I want a print-out of the accounts it will not work or succeed; just as when any of us try to negotiate yet more money to remain in political life, our bank manager enters our account number, up it comes, term loan, overdraft and everything else, on to the screen.  On the basis of automatic transfer of banking data, building society data, there is no reason in the wide world that data should not come up straight on to the screen of the tax inspector.  I know <Col N="528" /> there will be allegations thrown at me of advocating big brother and the State interfering in people's lives.  But I contend that people will not pay full taxation on any kind of a general altruistic basis particularly with society becoming so selfish, so individualistic, with a whole profession now geared to tax avoidance, with all sorts of tax havens being screwed out of the politicians, be they the Custom House, business enterprise for marinas, that kind of practice, in which there is the Minister, on the one side, trying self-assessment and, on the other, a whole profession deciding to emasculate it, ensuring that very little is paid.  Until there is full disclosure, I do not see any real prospect of success with regard to self-assessment.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental reforms which can be effected.  I recall the execration when we introduced the DIRT tax, now yielding £300 million, a solid lump of revenue.  I remember, on the Fianna Fáil side, they spoke of the children's confirmation money, the few shillings they received from uncles and aunts which had been deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank, that this awful Coalition, this awful Minister for Finance had caused the little child of 12 and 13 years of age great trauma.  But we fought it through and we introduced the DIRT tax, worth £300 million.  The Minister for Finance today would be on his political uppers if he did not have that revenue yield, and he will receive more next year.  There were huge arguments advanced then about it constituting yet another step toward total disclosure, total return.  We fought that off.  We reformed the tax system &mdash; because that constituted a fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the decisions taken relating to power of attachment.  This is a very necessary, valuable power.  It is not being done with any degree of collectivisation phobia or pre-occupation.  It is simply that to have a decent taxation system there must be full disclosure.  There can be no messing about with it.  Whether it is the accounts of a small farmer, a large farmer, a small publican, a big publican, a small solicitor, <Col N="529" /> a big solicitor or anybody else, total disclosure of what goes on should be available on a one to one basis to the inspector of taxes.  That is a harsh measure and it may be very difficult to implement, but it is the only way.  Until such time as we get that I would be very dubious about the prospect of self-assessment.</P>

The only way the Revenue Commissioners can really run the show in a democratic way is if they have the power of total disclosure.

America under the leadership of Ronald Reagan is not exactly known for Gulag obsession; the reverse is the case.  We have to bring in total disclosure on that basis and I would hope to see it introduced during our life time on an all-party basis.

Therefore, I can cheerfully advocate it and so can all Members who are covered by the top level review group, if I may make an oblique comment to the Minister and his underpaid colleagues in the bull pen.  I ask that there be total disclosure so that there can be real self-assessment. I do not mind disclosing what I have not got.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister for some clarification on section 8. During the past 12 months I have met many small business people and small farmers who have the notion that they can only have their tax assessment done by an accountant.  I know people who could not afford to pay accountants and consequently their assessments were not made and returned to the Revenue Commissioners. Problems built up between these people who want to keep their affairs in order.  I have to say that then I approached the Revenue Commissioners and inspectors in respect of this matter they were very helpful.  May I ask the Minister to clarify whether people have the right to make an appointment with their tax inspector and that he will accept from them the accounts which they have properly kept over a period of time so that the process whereby they have to <Col N="531" /> deal with accountants whom they cannot afford to pay will be eliminated?  In some instances people have paid accountants as much as £500 to prove that they have no liability for tax.  That is a disgrace and I believe a system should be introduced whereby it would be easier for such people to put their tax affairs in order.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if it is his intention to have mobile units occasionally visit large towns to enable people to have easy access to the Revenue Commissioners? That would be a very worthwhile exercise.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Because of the way our time is organised we may never have a full discussion on section 69.  Deputy Cooney raised a number of points about the power of attachment and I would have no objection to the Minister taking the liberty of putting some of his views on the power of attachment on the record of the House for the benefit of the House and the people outside who will read the record, because I doubt if we will get the opportunity subsequently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Deputy Cooney, the power of attachment does not arise under this section.  We have made progress today but many people have joined us and some points are being raised which were already dealt with earlier this morning. The very efficient Revenue Commissioners who are here with me have given me an immediate answer to Deputy Sherlock's question.  I could read it out to the Deputy but it consists of a page of instructions to all people who are working in tax offices and it is headed &ldquo;Assistance to Taxpayers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxpayers are entitled to receive from officers of the Department reasonable assistance and any information which can be given to them in regard to their rights as well as their obligations under the Tax Acts.  There is no question about that. People are not under any obligation from the Revenue Commissioners or under any law enacted by this House to have an accountant or a tax consultant look after <Col N="532" /> their affairs.  They can look after their own affairs and there is nothing to stop them doing that.  All callers should receive prompt attention.  Interviews should be held with due regard to privacy and confidentiality.  Discussions conducted at a counter are normally to be restricted to ascertaining the nature of a caller's inquiry.  Deputy Sherlock can advise the people who have raised this query with him that they are entitled to have access to officials who will be able to deal with their problems in a confidential way.</P>
    <P>Other points have been made in relation to full disclosure.  This was referred to in one sense by Deputy O'Malley and the opposite argument was put by Deputy Desmond.  The point raised by Deputy O'Malley is quite clear. I said that under section 18 of the Finance Act, 1983, they have access to financial institutions and, under section 20 of the same Act, to details or assets.  These are operated only in very specific cases of default.  The position remains the same. I do not accept what Deputy Desmond said about one needing full disclosure for the self-assessment system to work.  If he was here during the course of the debate he would have heard that we are providing all the information that is necessary to make it work as effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of interest rates, again two sides of the argument were put.  As I said earlier interest rates are high enough; I do not think they should be any higher and I definitely do not think they should be reduced.  What we are dealing with is default and evasion. Consistently, in every political party in this House and outside the House, every day we concern ourselves about the huge amount of tax paid by the PAYE sector, and rightly so.  I said in reply to a query raised in Tuesday's debate that the figure is 81.2 per cent.  In the main we are dealing here with people who pay the other 18.8 per cent tax.  We also hear consistently in this House about the huge amount of arrears, and action should be taken on that.  This is one of the deterrents which is there, as people know, and <Col N="533" /> must be kept there.  Even with interest rates dropping, as Deputy O'Malley said, it is a huge deterrent and should be so, because we must try to have some sort of equilibrium in the whole taxation code which we have not got at the moment. We are trying to get that under self-assessment and to reduce the amount of tax the PAYE sector are contributing. We hope that can be brought about.</P>
    <P>The question of power of attachment was raised by Deputy Cooney and Deputy Desmond.  It does not arise until a later section so we will deal with it when we come to it.  However, Deputy Cooney raised a very important point and I will give the information I have on it.  The Government in relation to PAYE and non-PAYE income tax payers have decided that the PAYE taxpayer should not be subject to the new procedures. However, PAYE taxpayers are not always a clearly identifiable group.  Some persons whose income is largely PAYE income have small amounts of investment or other income.  Other persons whose incomes are derived largely from self-employment have small amounts of PAYE income.  In such circumstances some practical method must be used to determine when persons with PAYE income are subject to the new procedures. The method which has been adopted is to exclude from the new procedures persons whose non-PAYE income is small enough to be included in their tax free allowance certificates. Those persons do not receive formal tax assessments and accordingly it is appropriate that they be excluded from the new provisions.  Persons whose non-PAYE incomes are not so included will get formal tax assessments and will be properly included in the new procedures.  This is the only practical solution to a practical problem.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that persons will have difficulty in identifying their status under the new method.  However, each year before the commencement of the tax year persons are issued with tax free allowance certificates.  It will be obvious from the certificates whether their non-PAYE incomes have been included in the <Col N="534" /> certificate.  In addition, every person who is required to pay an amount in preliminary tax will receive either a notice of preliminary tax or a reminder that he is so required.  No person will be in doubt as to his status under the new provisions.</P>
    <P>I hope that has covered the last number of points raised and that we can bring this to a conclusion and get on to the other points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These efforts to cast doubts on my colleagues are not fair.  My <Col N="537" /> amendment seeks to qualify the situation in regard to grants which are paid to people starting up a business under the enterprise allowance scheme by the Department of Labour and to provide that these allowances are not regarded as part of the receipts of a business for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax.  At the moment a person on the dole can apply to the Department of Labour for a grant of £30 per week under the enterprise allowance scheme to tide him over while he becomes self-employed. Of late some inspectors of taxes, but I understand not all, are treating the amount received as a receipt of the business.</P>
      <P>On the basis on which new businesses are taxed this has a rather grotesque result.  In a recent case an unemployed individual who set up a business of his own received a sum of £1,680 under the enterprise allowance scheme at the rate of £30 per week.  His business, I am happy to say, was at least moderately successful, but on the basis of assessment of new businesses for tax he has become liable now to pay the sum of £1,590 in income tax on the £1,680 which he received as a grant to get him started.  Because the grant is treated as a receipt of his business rather than a personal grant separate from the business, effectively almost all of it is clawed back in income tax, which can hardly have been the intention of the Legislature or the Department of Labour in helping to get him established in a new business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that he need only pay tax on it once and the proposed mechanism is to treat it as personal income and not as a business receipt.  Because of the special rules for taxation on commencement of a business, receipts under the enterprise allowance scheme are included in three years' accounts successively.  Therefore, somebody receiving a grant of this kind pays 35 per cent of the amount in each of three years and in the factual case in point, relating to a formerly unemployed person who set up a business, he is charged 35 per cent on £1,200, the amount he received during the first year, which amounts to <Col N="538" /> £420 in tax.  In the second year he is charged 35 per cent on £1,680 which amounts to £585 and in the third year he is again charged 35 per cent on £1,680, amounting to £585, which gives a total tax liability for the three years on the one grant of £1,590, which is almost the entirety of the grant.  Considering that he is an unemployed person being helped to set up a small, new business and to get off the dole &mdash; happily, in the case I have in mind, it worked &mdash; it seems totally anomalous that the State give out that money with one hand and takes virtually all of it back with the other.</P>
    <P>The reason the difficulty arises is that the basis of assessment for a new business is, in the first year, the actual profits from commencement to the following 5 April. In the second year the profits are based on the first 12 months with a right to claim a reduction to actual profits for the year up to 5 April and in the third year on the preceding year's profit, with a right to claim a reduction by the amount of any by which the total of the second and third years' assessment exceeded the profit of those two years.</P>
    <P>This amendment would simply ensure &mdash; what one would imagine was always the intention &mdash; that a sum of money would not be subjected to tax three times over.  It is only fair and reasonable that that should be so because it is anomalous, inequitable and unfair that out of a sum of £1,680 all, apart from £90, is reclaimed in income tax.  It must have been the intention that you could not be charged tax on the same receipt in three successive years and this amendment would ensure that a person was only charged once on it.  It would also ensure that it is regarded as a grant rather than an income of the business.  It is a simple point and it could hardly have ever been intended that this would happen.  My amendment puts it beyond doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this question.  The tax treatment of payments under the enterprise allowance scheme &mdash; or the enterprise scheme as it is now known &mdash; has been under consideration following a ruling by <Col N="539" /> the appeal commissioners.  In the absence of a specific provision exempting such payments from tax, the weight of tax case law and the treatment given to similar type payments in the past suggested that the payments in question are taxable.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this, the Revenue Commissioners had been treating payments under the scheme as trading receipts.  This treatment had consequences for the tax treatment of scheme payments because of the special commencement provisions in tax law for starting up a business.  This aspect of the matter had caused particular concern and I had received a certain amount of correspondence in connection with it.</P>
      <P>In considering the position following the appeal commissioners' ruling, I have had regard to the purpose for which the scheme was initiated, namely job creation. While I consider that there are arguments in favour of proceeding with an appeal to the High Court in the matter, I have come to the conclusion that payments under the scheme should be exempt from tax altogether.  I propose, therefore, to circulate a Report Stage amendment to this effect to put the matter beyond doubt.  The amendment will be retrospective, that is, it will apply to payments made under the scheme from the beginning.</P>

      <P>The amendment cannot be accepted in its present form because, first, the provision indicates that the allowance will not be regarded for income tax or corporation tax purposes as part of the receipts of a business or trade.  However, a residual charge to tax as a miscellaneous receipt might still arise under section 4 of Schedule D.  Secondly, the provision may not be strong enough to provide for retrospection and, third, it may be technically inaccurate in its description of the payments.  Originally the payments were made by the Minister for Labour through the National Manpower Service.  Since January 1988 the payments have been made by FÁS which have a separate statutory existence from the Minister in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Services Act, 1987. These will require consultation with the parliamentary draftsman and this is taking place at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 29, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1982 is hereby amended by the substitution, in subsection (2), of `110 per cent. (and, in the case of additional beef cattle, 125 per cent.)' for `eleven-tenths'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 (4) of the Finance Act, 1976 and other enactments relating to relief in respect of increase in stock values, any such relief which has not been availed of in respect of an accounting period (as defined by the <Col N="541" /> said enactments) may be availed of in any subsequent three accounting periods.</P>
    <P>(5)  Section 12 (5) of the Finance Act, 1976, as substituted by section 33 (3) of the Finance Act, 1984, is hereby amended by the insertion, in the proviso thereto, after `10 years' of `(or, in the case of beef cattle, 7 years)'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment incorporates three different provisions.  Clearly, there is a crisis in the beef industry because of the shortage of cattle.  The figures speak for themselves.  There has been a drop of 100,000 in the national cow herd over the last couple of years with projects of a drop of a further 200,000 heads over the next four years.  Last week the Dáil unanimously accepted my motion urging the introduction and implementation of a comprehensive plan to cope with the crisis.  I have produced, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, a 20 point action plan designed to increase beef cow numbers by 300,000 over four years.  The implementation of this programme will result in 1,000 additional jobs in the meat industry, extra beef exports of about £200 million per year, viability for 20,000 to 30,000 farm families and, as a consequence, substantial gains for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that the proposed amendment to the Bill is but part of the entire package I have put forward, but acceptance of my amendment on stock relief will be of considerable importance on its own merits and will be seen as a first step towards the overall resolution of the crisis affecting the beef industry. My approach is that the stock relief provisions of the income tax code should be reviewed so as to provide a greater incentive for farmers to increase beef cow numbers.  This will be of special relevance to dairy farmers, many of whom have income tax liabilities.  My amendment incorporates a number of changes.  Stock relief for additional beef cows should be increased from the present 110 per cent to 125 per cent.  Stock relief cannot be used to create a loss and this means that some stock relief, or a portion of it, may <Col N="542" /> not be of any benefit to taxpaying farmers since unused relief cannot be carried forward to following years.  That problem could arise quite often on beef farms where the level of income is generally low relative to value of stock carried on the farm.  It can be especially significant for a farmer building up a suckler herd since the purchase of the breeding stock could precede the resulting income flow by two to three years.</P>
    <P>On the latter point my proposal is that unused stock relief be carried forward for up to three years.  At present the clawback period for stock relief is ten years.  That means that if within ten years a farmer has to reduce his stock level the relief granted during the build-up period will be clawed back.  In a business as risky as beef production ten years is a very long time.  With my colleague, Deputy Noonan, I propose that a more appropriate period of seven years be introduced.</P>
    <P>The major national agricultural priority is to reverse the trend of dropping cow numbers.  Policy instruments must give clear signals to indicate that this is the major national agricultural priority and a major overall national priority.  The scale of the benefit to the national economy from the expansion of the beef cow herd and the losses which will be suffered if there is no or limited expansion &mdash; indeed, if there is a further reduction &mdash; make it imperative that decisions are taken urgently.  For that reason I am pressing the Minister to accept my amendment to incorporate the tax incentive aspect of the overall plan of Fine Gael for securing a future for the beef industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment, not on the grounds of cost because it is not easy to determine the exact cost.  The extending of stock relief will amount to about £300,000 in a full year.  As I say, the amendment is not being opposed on grounds of cost but rather that it will add a further layer of legislation and resultant administrative procedures to an already complex situation and with no guarantee that the exercise will prove worthwhile.  While it is <Col N="543" /> desirable that the decline in the national herd should be halted and reversed, it is considered that further tax reliefs are not the way to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>Claims for improvements to the present very generous stock relief provisions must be viewed against (1) the likely reaction of non-farming sectors who have no entitlement whatsoever to stock relief; and (2) whether, having regard to the original purpose of stock relief, even the existing terms are justifiable or appropriate at a time of low inflation, compared to about 20 per cent inflation when stock relief was introduced in 1975.</P>
      <P>Increased stock relief confers disproportionate benefit on the larger farmer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the small farmer.  The latter would have little or no taxable profits and thus stock relief will offer him no incentive to keep herd numbers up.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposal that unused stock relief should be permitted to be carried forward &mdash; presumably because there would be insufficient profits against which it could be set off &mdash; it must be stated that this would be totally inappropriate and only serves to highlight the fact that tax reliefs are only of value to people who actually pay tax.  Stock relief was introduced in an attempt to remove from the ambit of the tax charge profits attributable to inflationary factors and which were in some respects no more than national profits.  If profits are insufficient to absorb the available stock relief in a particular accounting period the underlying justification for stock relief is not present.  The proposal that unused stock relief should be carried forward, which was never conceded since the introduction of stock relief in 1975, cannot now be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for special rates of relief and clawback measures for beef cattle would immensely complicate the stock relief regime which, many will argue, is already very complicated.  A special rate for stocks of beef cattle would result in two classes of stock for stock relief purposes instead of the present single category &mdash; trading stocks.  Three rates of <Col N="544" /> relief would then replace the existing two rates &mdash; 100 per cent pre 1982-83 and 110 per cent thereafter &mdash; depending on the make-up of the individual farmer's stock.</P>
    <P>Proposed changes in clawback would lead to even further difficulties if, and when, farmers found themselves in a clawback situation.  Apart from the two rates of clawback and the ten-year time limit that already apply to other stock, the position as regards beef cattle would have to be separately determined by reference to three different rates 100 per cent, 110 per cent and 125 per cent and two separate time periods, up to seven years, full clawback and after seven years, no clawback.  It gets more complicated as we go on.</P>
    <P>The administrative considerations both for farmers and Revenue in attempting to implement and police such a complex relief must not be underestimated. Detailed herd break-downs to distinguish as between beef cattle and other stock would be called for both to compute the relief due and to operate the clawback measures proposed.  The whole thrust of taxation in general is to move, if possible, in the direction of simplification and to avoid unnecessary further complication of an already complex tax code.  The proposals now being made run counter to such a policy and would result in legislative measures of a kind that, for many farmers, involvement with the accountancy profession would be the inevitable outcome.</P>
    <P>Calls for a shortening of the clawback period are not favoured as a short term cut-off point could lead to abuse; stocks could be dropped very quickly once the cut-off is reached and the process of building up stocks could start all over again with fresh entitlement to stock relief.  A shortening of the clawback period could perhaps only be considered in the context of the abolition of stock relief.  Furthermore, any dilution of clawback would have cost implications arising from the relief already given, and which would not then be clawed back, and from increased claims for stock relief by farmers on the basis of a new cycle of relief.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I cannot accept <Col N="545" /> the Deputy's amendment.  However, I agree with the statements by the Deputy, by the Minister for Agriculture and by people outside the House about the necessity to increase beef cow numbers. I am sure we will find ways to do so, but I do not think this is the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response, especially since he represents a rural constituency and once held the Agriculture portfolio.  Obviously, he must be well aware of the major crisis in the beef industry.  He mentions that the cost is not a factor and that makes his reaction even worse.  If my proposals were fully implemented farmers and the meat industry would gain, our exports would increase substantially and there would be a substantial benefit to the Exchequer as a consequence.</P>
      <P>If tax reliefs are not the answer to the problem, what is?  In my view we need a comprehensive plan covering a whole range of measures, including reorientation of grant incentives and a series of other measures to improve farm efficiency and profit margins.  As part of the overall plan it is also necessary to change the system of tax incentives to put a much greater focus on those who take the risk of being involved in the production of additional beef cows.</P>
      <P>My disappointment is compounded by the reaction of the Minister, not just in rejecting my amendment but in failing to produce any alternative.  His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, had a scheme in this area which has totally collapsed. That Minister is like the emperor without any clothes &mdash; he has no plan at all.  I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider my amendment on Report Stage.  It is a major priority of Fine Gael to ensure that the crisis in the beef industry be tackled immediately.  In so far as reorientation of tax incentives can help in tackling that crisis, action must be taken now.  On that basis I am pressing my amendment as being part of a solution to that crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the fact <Col N="546" /> that we were not opposing the proposal on grounds of cost.  The main reason the cost is so low is that the proposal will be ineffective.  It is not my job to propose an alternative to the amendment.  The Minister for Agriculture had been pursuing this question with the interests involved and the Deputy will be fully aware of the EC implications of having any kind of identifiable national aid.  That is not tolerated.  The Minister had almost concluded when certain parties involved in the trade decided not to opt into the scheme proposed.  I know the Minister is working diligently, prompted very efficiently and effectively by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that about 50 per cent of farmers on tax records have availed of stock relief in the past or have been affected by claw back following decreases in stock levels.  That suggests approximately 30,000 farmers.  About 10 per cent of those are thought to be currently affected by the claw back.  The farmers who would probably be anxious to increase beef cow numbers are more inclined to be small farmers not inside the tax net.  I know there are some who, because of the restrictions now imposed by the superlevy, would keep on cows for beef purposes and they might get the advantage.  As I explained, we would have all sorts of complications in deciding which should qualify and which should not.  The amendment is an effort to deal with the problem, but I do not think this is the mechanism to achieve what the Deputy and the Government want, namely, an increase in beef cow numbers. We will have to look at other ways.</P>

      <P>I thought we were getting close to a meeting of minds on one point.  I see a major potential on the part of dairy farmers who are now restricted because of quotas.  These are some of the people who can make a substantial contribution to increasing beef cow numbers.  I strongly believe my proposals would encourage the exploitation of that potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> According to the Explanatory Memorandum, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Section 22 raises from £4,000 to £6,000, the capital value used in determining&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the capital allowances, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the deduction for running expenses,</P>
      <P>to be granted for tax purposes in respect of motor cars used in the course of a trade, profession or employment. In the case of capital allowances, the increase applies to cars provided after 27 January, 1988 (other than cars that were contracted for before that date but provided within 12 months of that date), while in the case of running expenses, the increase applies to expenses incurred after that date.</P>
      <P>I welcome this section which is a move in the right direction.  Even though the move, on the face of it, looks quite small, it costs quite an amount of money.  The Minister can confirm that it will cost approximately £7 million to achieve this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I circulated an amendment which arose from the treatment of company cars for benefit in kind purposes.  I proposed in assessing benefit in kind that instead of taking the individual cost of the car into account, a table should be drawn up by <Col N="550" /> the Revenue Commissioners, which would be based on the engine capacity of the vehicles.  If this was used it could be organised in a manner by the Minister for Finance and his advisers so that there would be no loss of revenue to the State as a result.  If this change were made some taxpayers who had the benefit of a car from their company for their private use would pay more tax and others would pay less.  It could be organised so as to not have any adverse effect on the flow of revenue.</P>
    <P>Because there would be a charge on some taxpayers it was not possible within the very restricted rules of the House for the amendment to be debated in the House.  The amendment was proposed arising from this section, not in ease of the individual taxpayer but in ease of the motor trade.  There is no particular benefit to all company car holders in the proposal because some would gain and some would lose but the motor trade would gain because the emphasis would switch to new cars rather than secondhand cars and that might stimulate an industry which has been in the doldrums now for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I know there are a variety of tax avoidance schemes by companies to facilitate their employees who have the use of company cars.  I know also that it is the practice now for people on high incomes to acquire quite old cars at low market value and then soup them up and there are significant people on very high incomes in this city who have 1975, 1976 and 1977 cars with high engine capacities but because the original cost of the car was so low, they benefit from the provisions as they stand at the moment.  That is a direct disincentive to the purchase of new cars.  If we can get the Minister for Finance to agree to base the scale of allowances on the engine capacity of cars, that could be done without loss of revenue to the State and in a manner which would benefit the motor trade.  It is essential that more new cars be sold if the motor trade is to survive in this country.</P>
    <P>The question of the number of secondhand cars on the Irish market at the moment that is safe is a cause for concern. <Col N="551" /> There is quite a significant level of importation of secondhand cars from the UK.  The regulations in the UK regarding the safety of vehicles are more stringent and are more stringently applied than the regulations that apply here.  I fear that UK secondhand cars which have failed to pass the safety tests in the UK are being brought in here and being put on the secondhand market.  There is a second reason for this change and that is to ensure that vehicles which are put on the roads are safe.  Obviously if a change in the direction I am proposing would stimulate the motor industry and if companies would exchange the cars they have now for new models, then over a period, a reasonably adequate supply of secondhand cars would be available through the trade to the majority of motorists who cannot afford a new car who of necessity purchase secondhand cars.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister's comments on this.  On this side of the House our hands are tied.  On the last Finance Bill Deputies McDowell and O'Malley proposed an amendment on similar lines and it was ruled out of order for the same reasons &mdash; because we are inhibited from moving an amendment even if there is no overall loss of revenue, if it proposes an increase of tax on any taxpayer, even if that would be compensated for by tax reductions for other taxpayers, leaving an overall revenue effect which would be neutral.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the tolerance of the Chair and the House which enabled me to speak at length about a matter which is not properly before the House.  I strongly urge the Minister, as we discuss this section, to give an indication that he will have this examined between now and Report Stage with a view to moving the amendment in his name on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea which Deputy Noonan has just made.  What we think we save and what we actually do save by having these restrictions are two different things.  As anyone in business in this city knows, there are ways and means of getting <Col N="552" /> around this particular imposition and this brings our laws into disrepute.  We have not made any significant moves in this area for a number of years and the proposal which Deputy Noonan has outlined is a very reasonable one.  Of course, we recognise that there are problems and that we do not have considerable sums of money to give away at this stage, but this proposal will not result in extra expenditure or any loss in revenue on the part of the Exchequer.  It is a sensible way of dealing with this problem.</P>
      <P>A number of parties in this House are trying to achieve an atmosphere in this country where people will feel that they are expected to pay a reasonable amount of money in taxation.  Whether we in this House like it or not there is a general feeling that everybody is being screwed by our tax system.  We are being screwed by the high rates of PAYE and by the small limits between one band and the next.  If one is supplied with a company car for business purposes they are caught for benefit in kind.  There is a general feeling that the State is out to take everything from us.  Therefore, we should show some movement either in the personal taxation area or in an area such as this so that at least a person can feel that they can go out and buy a new car and do not have to drive around in an old banger simply and solely because they have a feeling that the State is going to step in and rip them off, and in many cases they are quite right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal provides us with an opportunity to move forward.  We have a car industry which is dying on its feet.  In the past it employed large numbers of people, but all of us know of garages which are closing down, letting people go or taking on no apprentices.  Not alone is the price of a new car too high because of the various duties and taxes, but because of this imposition there is no encouragement to go out and buy a new car.  On top of this the amount of disposable income available to someone to change their car is extremely limited because of our high tax rates.  I join with my colleague, Deputy Noonan, in appealing to the Minister to look at this <Col N="553" /> problem and, on Report Stage, to bring in some amendment along the lines suggested by Deputy Noonan in order that some movement can take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the principle behind what is being suggested here, but I am not certain whether the way in which it is drafted is the right way to go about it.  I can see the difficulties, because I recall Deputy McDowell and I tabling an amendment to try to cope with this problem last year which was ruled out of order because theoretically it might increase the amount of tax payable by some individual taxpayer, even though clearly its intent was to reduce the burden of taxation on a very large number of taxpayers.</P>
      <P>I am not being critical of this amendment, as I can see why it has to be expressed in a somewhat unusual way, but a weakness that I see in it is that it does not refer to amounts of money.  The amount that is deductible as an expense of a business or a company cannot be worked out.  At present it is worked out in the proportion which the allowed amount bears to the total cost and this would not be achieved under the amendment as drafted by Deputy Noonan.  At the same time I fully support the principle behind it and it is an amendment which will have to be made by the Minister.  It is only reasonable that he increase the proposed figure of £6,000 to something that approximates with the average cost of a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this restriction was originally introduced in 1973 the figure was £2,500, which was at that time the average cost of a reasonably good car, but it has lost all meaning since.  Even with the proposed slight increase this year, to £6,000 it still bears no relation to the average cost of a car.  It impinges enormously on both individuals and companies.  Because of the way allowances for vehicles are so extraordinarily restricted there have been instances where a company, which to my knowledge showed no profits on its audited accounts for a particular year, was charged substantial corporation tax <Col N="554" /> by the Revenue because most of the travelling expenses which were properly incurred by the company were disallowed. It is ridiculous that a company which shows quite genuinely that it made no profit and was just able to tick over in a particular year should be assessed with a figure of £150,000 just because it has a fleet of between 30 and 40 cars on the road and therefore has to pay corporation tax at a rate of 50 per cent which would amount to £75,000.  While this is slightly removed from the matter which we are discussing here, capital allowances, it is very much tied in with it because the two are related.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the motor trade is well known.  They have made their case very clearly during the past few years in particular.  I do not think anyone seriously disagrees with their statements on the appalling position in which they find themselves, and the ultimate proof of this is to look at the number of new car sales in the Republic as compared with the number of new car sales in each of the last two years in Northern Ireland. The population of Northern Ireland is now significantly less than half the population of the Republic.  The population of Northern Ireland is 1.5 million as compared to a population in this country of 3.5 million, but the sale of new cars in Northern Ireland is well above the sale of new cars here.</P>
    <P>There is a grave abnormality in that. It is not because the Northern Ireland economy is booming that everyone is buying a second car.  The Northern Ireland economy is in dire trouble, but so far as motor cars are concerned the level of purchase is normal whereas down here the level of purchase of motor cars is abnormally and artificially low, despite our economy, while in severe difficulty, being no worse than the Northern Ireland economy.  It is only because of this factor that the number of old cars on the roads here is relatively high.  We have a fairly scattered population as compared to Northern Ireland, we have less public transport and more people in the normal way would use cars in this country; but the sales are totally inverted to what the <Col N="555" /> norm would be.  They are inverted for one reason only and that is taxation.  If there is one thing the Department of Finance are completely hung up about it is this.  They cannot understand why people should be allowed to drive cars which they do not own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we have high motor claims.  It is part of what we were talking about yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an artificial distinction to draw to penalise in this grossly excessive way the provision of cars by a company to its own employees and not to penalise in any way the payment of a mileage allowance to employees.  The result is, as Deputy Barrett has said, that all sorts of artificial ways of trying to get round this are created and it brings the law into contempt.  One is entitled to ask why there is no taxation of any kind on high rates of mileage allowance, such as 75p, 85p and 90p, which must confer a substantial benefit in kind on those who are fortunate enough to be able to avail of them.  At the same time there is a most excessive and penal level of taxation on those who are provided with cars by their companies.  One is entitled to ponder the theoretical question that, if the Department of Finance and other Departments provided cars for their officials for use in the course of their duties and did not pay them mileage allowance for using their own cars, would the law be different?  We are entitled to ponder that question and ask it because my strong feeling is that it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way this system has been defended for years is irrational.  It makes no sense and I do not see it repeated anywhere else.  The figures of new car sales speak for themselves.  If there is a reduction in the amount of tax that will be raised by increasing the capital allowance, that clearly will be offset by increased sales of cars.  We have the highest rate of excise and VAT on vehicles in the European Community and possibly in the world.  It is extraordinarily high.  Therefore, any worthwhile increase in the sales of new <Col N="556" /> cars will bring a very substantial benefit to the Revenue.  It is not in any way irresponsible or profligate to suggest that these capital allowances should be increased and that people and companies should be treated more fairly in relation to them because with the high rates of excise and VAT, there will be a huge flood of revenue coming into the Exchequer as a result.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is picking out one sector of the economy and saying that it does not matter, that for some kind of arbitrary bureaucratic reason we have to maintain this system and that it will be maintained through thick and thin.  That makes no sense.  It sums up one of the great dichotomies in the administration of this country; that there is a huge gulf or gap between what I call the real economy out there and those who administer it from inside the walls of Government Buildings, the Department of Finance or wherever else.  There is a lack of understanding of how the system works and a belief that the commercial activity of this country can be run on bureaucratic or administrative standards when quite clearly that cannot be done.  It has to operate in a different way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is a very minor concession in this section in regard to the capital allowance but it really is not significant.  Some day some Minister for Finance will have to grasp this nettle. It will not be a very difficult one to grasp because he will not lose any revenue by doing so.  If we were selling the same number of cars <i>pro rata</i> as Northern Ireland the inflow to the Revenue would be so huge that whatever losses would be incurred by allowing a reasonable capital allowance would be far exceeded.  The Revenue would be not just as well off but probably substantially better off.  The indirect effects throughout the economy as a whole would be enormously beneficial.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section and of the amendment is to encourage the purchase of more new cars.  Everyone who has spoken has said what a marvellous thing that would be. <Col N="557" /> The statistics in relation to the purchase of new cars show us up in a very bad light compared with Northern Ireland. They bear no relation to the number of cars purchased because there are no figures for the purchase of secondhand cars or third, fourth or fifthhand cars.  The car that I traded in five years ago, a Vauxhall Chevette &mdash; it was six years old at the time &mdash; is still on the road in Cavan.</P>
      <P>When Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Finance he had a totally different theory from that of Deputy Noonan.  His theory was that, as far as jobs were concerned, we would be better off if more people bought secondhand cars, that there were more jobs in the servicing of secondhand cars.  He said there was no reason why we should encourage the purchase of new cars.  That is a theory well worth discussing.  The purchase of new cars is of great benefit to a small number of traders who have concessions for particular brands of cars and they make a fine living from selling them.  There is no proof that there are any jobs created by the sale of new cars.  If we were to purchase new cars, keep them for one or two years, trade them in for other new cars and then sell all the secondhand cars to, say, a Third World Country, where would the jobs be created?  Nobody here has given us any indication of the great benefit of new cars to the country as compared with secondhand cars.  I do not know whether or not Deputy Bruton has changed his mind in that regard.  He is not spokesman on Finance any more and I do not know whether or not Fine Gael have any policy on that matter.  There is no proof whatsoever that the purchase of new cars is a good thing for the economy.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the danger of having so many second-hand cars on the road.  That is a matter for the Government and the Minister for the Environment.  They should ensure that cars and trucks on the road are safe.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Finance. It does not matter whether your car is 20 years old or 40 years old if it is safe; but, if it is not, it is up to the Minister for the Environment to impose the necessary penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> Let us look at the cost of new cars.  If the price was cheaper more people would buy them.  That is obvious when cars were assembled here &mdash; some people may not even recall that time but car assembly here only ended in 1982 &mdash; and when over 4,000 people were engaged in their assembly and many more thousands were engaged in supplying the materials for the car assembly industry, we were being continually told that this was the reason cars cost so much.  We were told we were subsidising the car assembly industry and that this was wrong.  There were many tears shed about that.  Deputy O'Malley is now talking about the jobs that are being lost and he said that the car industry is in a disastrous state.  I did not hear him crying any tears, crocodile or otherwise, when the car assembly industry was simply shut down and everybody in that industry was put out of business.  Workers are still on the dole from the car assembly industry being shut down and they are now being told that they are not looking for work.</P>
    <P>These people fought against the terms of the EC in order to hold their jobs. They got longer than a ten year stay of execution because of their fight, but they are out of work now and on the dole.  The same applies to many workers around the country who were supplying raw materials to these people.  We were told the price of cars was high because they were being assembled here and when our car assembly plants closed down, we all expected cheap cars at last.  However, car prices did not go down by £1.  They continued to escalate.  Our prices are still the highest in Europe, and possibly in the world.  What is the explanation for that?</P>
    <P>We are told the answer is taxes and duties.  I believe it is just a rip off.  Merchants import cars and sell them for whatever price they care to put on them.  If taxes are the cause of the high price of cars, is it not ridiculous to take taxes from everyone by way of duty on the purchase of the car, duty on car parts, VAT and then taxing the car, and handing back some of that money in reliefs to a chosen few?  That is the purpose of this type of tax relief for company cars.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> Why not reduce the taxation so that cars would be cheaper and more people would purchase them?  Instead of giving the tax incentive to companies which purchase cars for company business, why not give the tax relief to people who need cars to get to work?  Why not give them tax relief for the capital purchase of their cars and for their travelling expenses? Why not assist them in that way?  If they get the tax relief, they will have the incentive to purchase cars and far more cars will be purchased, that is if the Minister wants more cars on the road.</P>
    <P>This is a question the Minister for Finance should think about.  This is the question Deputy Bruton had in mind when he was Minister for Finance: can we afford more cars on the road?  We do not have a road system to take more cars.  Have we the money to provide that road system?  Our roads are deterioration at such a rate that cars are not being made for them.  That has been proved by Swedish cars which were not made for our roads.  Our roads are deteriorating much faster than the roads in any other country in Europe.  Cars are not built for our brutal road system.  Do we want more cars on the road?  More cars mean more, not less expenditure on roads, and it means greater and bigger roads as well as a more packed city.  At the moment we cannot maintain the small number of cars we are told are in this city.  Do we want more cars?  These are the type of decisions a Government have to think about.</P>
    <P>Here is a Government talking about cuts in public expenditure, but if they put more cars on the roads will we not need more public expenditure, to provide the necessary infrastructure?  Would it not be better to put the money they are losing on the taxation system into a public transport system which this Government wrote off totally when they wrote off the DART system which would be by far the most efficient public transport system for this city?</P>
    <P>When the Minister is talking about reliefs of this kind, is he just thinking about the people who need company <Col N="560" /> cars, that if they get these reliefs, they will buy more cars?  How many people is the Minister thinking about?  When talking about the import and sale of cars is the Minister thinking about money and jobs, because there is nothing else involved but importing the cars, putting them into showrooms and then selling them, whereas the secondhand car business provides jobs.</P>
    <P>People by secondhand cars because they are cheap.  Deputies should realise that although the Minister is giving a relief of £6,000, there are excellent cars on the roads costing £5,000.  Sales of these cars are increasing very rapidly, particularly among the farming community who recognise the strength of these cars. I am speaking of the Lada, particularly the Lada Riva.  They are available for £5,000 and the Minister is giving an allowance of £6,000.  The cheapest decent European car is about £8,000 new.  Very few people are able to pay that sort of money for new cars.  The cost of cars, and the taxation of cars, should be taken into consideration before giving tax relief to a handful of people.  The question of whether we want more new cars on the roads should also be considered.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the amendments.  The section is updating the figure of £2,500 to £6,000.  I have no real objection to that, but what I want to know is if the Minister, through his Government, has a policy on car ownership for increasing or reducing the number of cars on the roads.  At least Deputy Bruton had a policy in mind when he was Minister for Finance.  He took into account a number of considerations in regard to the infrastructure and jobs. Has this Minister any policy and what benefit does he see arising from this section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Mac Giolla said in relation to benefit in kind, how it should be calculated and so on.  There is no doubt we are dealing with people who are getting a company car.  In this section we are going as far as we can this year &mdash; I will come back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the amendment has been <Col N="561" /> ruled out of order we are discussing it. Nevertheless, as some points were raised, I will answer them.  At the moment the benefit in kind is worth £31 million in a full year to the Exchequer.  That is a sizeable amount of money and cannot just be ignored or diluted to any great extent.  With regard to the proposal in the amendment which was disallowed, for a benefit in kind charge based on engine capacity, recent consideration of the matter indicated that under a four rate structure based on engine capacity the following benefit in kind assessments would be necessary to maintain the yield: up to 1012cc, £1,500; up to 1512cc, £1,850; up to 2012cc, £2,200 and above 2012cc, £2,675.  The scheme was calculated by reference to the prices of basic models.  While there is some scope for variation within categories, the rates quoted are the minimum necessary to maintain the current yield and would need to be increased to compensate for the element of high price cars being provided for employees.</P>
    <P>Obviously like any other scheme which we are changing, we will have to look at it from an Exchequer point of view in relation to its equity, cost implications to the Exchequer and administrative difficulties. In so far as equity is concerned the fairer and more objective criterion is market value rather than engine size in establishing benefit to the employee.  The existing charge attempts to tax income in kind on the same basis as cash income. As is the case with cash income, the more valuable the payment in kind, the higher is the tax charge under current arrangements. This would not be the case with a scheme based on engine capacity, which is not an accurate yardstick for measuring a benefit of this kind.  For example, a Ford Sierra 2,000, with an engine capacity of 1,993 c.c. costs considerably less than a Saab 900 which has an almost identical engine, with a capacity of 1,985 c.c. Therefore, it is difficult to reconcile that kind of position in one's mind when one is talking about tax relief.  Under a scheme based on engine capacity the real value of the tax charge would tend to fall from year to year whereas under the present <Col N="562" /> system, based on market value, the real value of the charge is automatically maintained as new car prices rise.  The problem of falling yields could be overcome only by increasing the rates of charge annually by way of legislation which would be bound to give rise to controversy.  The proposal in the amendment would greatly increase the administrative complexity of handling these benefit in kind cases.</P>
    <P>There is a lot that has to be said about this benefit in kind scheme.  I was Minister for Finance at the time it was introduced in 1982.  One of the bigger problems we must examine &mdash; and Deputy Mac Giolla put his finger on this when he spoke of the totality of car owners rather than those who just happen to have a company car or a car supplied &mdash; is that of the duty content.  The huge excise duty of 21.7 per cent plus VAT of 20 per cent on cars up to 2,012 c.c., which amounts to a total of 41.7 per cent, and on those over an engine capacity of 2,012 c.c. in respect of which the excise duty and VAT is as high as 44.7 per cent constitutes an enormous cost.  That accounts for the main difference between what Deputy O'Malley spoke of &mdash; those people in the North of Ireland having so many more cars <i>per capita</i> than we do because the cost of the actual commodity is so much less.  There is no doubt that that has a major influence on the market.  Let us hope that we can begin to move toward that position.  How we will make up for the Exchequer loss remains to be seen but this is the kind of process we must examine carefully between now and 1992, with the creation of the internal market.</P>
    <P>When we talk about giving incentives for the purchase of cars, dear and all as they are, it is as well to remember that this impinges on the balance of payments; as Deputy Mac Giolla rightly said, we do not have any car assembly plants here now.  Deputy Mac Giolla asked me about my policy in that regard.  I should say that there has been quite an effort on the part of the Industrial Development Authority, accompanied by quite an amount of success in attracting huge numbers of manufacturers of car components here, and our policy will continue to promote <Col N="563" /> that kind of activity.  We will make every endeavour to get back into the assembly business if we can at all.</P>
    <P>Just to give the House an example, I should say that the value of imports in 1987 of cars and vans &mdash; if you like, cars and commercial cars &mdash; was £230 million. That figure does not include import taxes, VAT, excise duty, dealers' profits or whatever.  The number of those cars and vans was 63,354.  In a poor economy in grave difficulty, an expenditure of £230 million &mdash; plus 42 per cent, when one takes into account excise duties and VAT, amounting to another £100 million, making a total of £330 million spent on new cars &mdash; is a lot of money, particularly in difficult times.  We went as far as we could in our budgetary proposals. So that people will realise the impact of the budgetary provisions, I should say that in the first quarter of 1987 new car registrations amounted to 17,376 whereas, in the first quarter of this year, the corresponding figure was 19,808, an increase of 14 per cent.  Small and all as have been the concessions and the criticism levelled at them &mdash; although I must say that, in fairness, some people did welcome them &mdash; they must be having a significant impact when there has been a 14 per cent increase in new car registrations in the first quarter of this year. Let us hope that trend will continue so that we can replace what is a very old stock of cars at present &mdash; I think everybody travelling our roads would accept that fact &mdash; and, second, boost Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>A question was raised in regard to the measure proposed in section 22.  I should say that its cost is estimated at £600,000 in 1988, rising sharply to £6.6 million in 1989 and to £14 million in 1990; the two latter figures representing the full year costs.  Of course, the final cost will depend on the rate at which new cars qualifying for the increased allowance are purchased.  I do not expect there would have been many such cars purchased in 1988 between budget day and 5 April to affect tax payments in that year.  Consequently, the cost shown is minimal and <Col N="564" /> relates basically to running expenses in respect of existing cars rather than to the capital allowance element of new cars. The cost is expected to increase considerably in 1989 and reach its peak in 1990.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It becomes almost an annual ritual, and a matter of considerable regret to me, to say that the Minister for Finance does not seem to be any more enlightened about this matter than were his predecessors.  He makes play of the fact that we spent £230 million on cars last year.  It should be remembered that, out of total imports of approximately £12 million or £13 million, the remarkable thing about that figure is that it is so low; it is extraordinarily low; there is nothing large about it.  The only thing abnormal about it is that it is so low, the lowest in Europe.  The Minister spoke about the fact that, in the first three months of this year, there had been an increase of 14 per cent in new car registrations. It should be remembered that that is a 14 per cent increase on an incredibly low base, one that bears no relation to what it would be if things were allowed to operate normally in our economy.  For example, even if there were to be a 100 per cent increase this year, we would still not be back to normal.  Frankly, a 14 per cent increase does not make any difference.</P>
      <P>There is no effort to face up to reality in the provisions of this section.  I am not talking about the amendment because I understand it is not being moved but, in the section generally, there has been no attempt to face up to reality.</P>
      <P>We have heard the usual old stuff from Deputy Mac Giolla and people like him, about the capital allowance being increased to £6,000, and constituting a big tax concession or incentive, as it were, to people to buy cars.  Of course, he does not understand what it is about.  This is not a tax concession at all.  This is a tax penalty, by confining the capital allowance to that amount rather than as it is in most places, to the value of the car.</P>

      <P>It is done apparently for the purpose of trying to suggest that there is a huge benefit in kind which constitutes will over half the value or use of the car.  That is entirely questionable. If it is necessary to tax benefit in kind so heavily where motor cars are concerned, why is there no taxation of the 80p or 90p per mile that is allowed to users of cars who are operating under the other system?  I do not think they can have it both ways.  It cannot be a benefit in kind one way and not the other way.  I want to repeat my view that if the State provided cars for its own employees or officials the law might be different from the way it is at present and from the way it is proposed to continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that we should be discussing this section with such a degree of futility just after we have heard the tragic news of the passing of Senator Daly who strove for many years in his career in the Seanad to change this situation.  It is sad that on the very day of his death, which we all regret so much, that this iniquitous system should be perpetuated for some further time.  It will eventually change but it is unnecessary and pointless.  It gains nothing to the Exchequer because the amount of taxation in excise and VAT which would be got, by getting us back to a normal level of car sales, would be so great that the Exchequer would not lose.  It knows it will not lose and this is only a begrudging attitude to perpetuate this system.  That is wrong and I do not <Col N="566" /> think law and, in particular, revenue law, should be based on a begrudging attitude where there is no fiscal justification for what is being done.  If we were to get back to normal &mdash; and it would only be normal &mdash; we would have to double our car sales this year.  If we were to encourage them it would more than double them.</P>

      <P>I would like to respond to Deputy O'Malley's latter remarks about the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the number of cars.  I wonder where Deputy O'Malley has been for a number of years.  There were exceptional numbers of cars registered in 1980 and 1981; 90,000 and 104,000 for both of those years.  From 1982 up to the present time the norm has been more like 55,000 to 65,000.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and talk about getting back to the norm but the fact of the matter is that if we get the same sort of trends this year as we had last year, taking roughly three times the figures for the first quarter, there will be up to 60,000 new car registrations.  This will be as high as the number in any of the past five years and will be an enormous difference.  I do not accept that we have to have a certain norm of number of cars and that it has to be 80,000, 90,000 or 100,000.  If the new car registrations for this year work out at the order of 60,000, which they can do, this will be an extremely good result.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister if he has available the cost of the change in 1989 and 1990?  The change is very minimal this year in terms of cost, £600,000, but I imagine the Minister will have to provide £6 million, £7 million or <Col N="568" /> £8 million next year and £14 million in 1990.  The concession will be costly and will have to be provided for next year.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that the level of new car purchases will be up this year.  The motor vehicle duty returns up to 30 April this year is £49 million and it was £50.27 million for the same period last year.  The extent of the drop off in the purchase of new cars is noticeable. Only last week I spoke to the late Senator Daly and he told me that he had sold an annual average of 300 to 400 new cars &mdash; and he was a dealer for a particular make of car &mdash; but he expected that his sales for 1988 would be about 120 new cars, so severe has been the drop in new car purchases in his part of the country.  The increase from 4,000 to 6,000 is very substantial and I would be interested to know the cost of the concession given by the Minister on this occasion.</P>

The allowance consists of relief at the rate of 5 per cent per annum for ten years given to the first owner occupier in respect of the cost of a newly constructed or refurbished dwellinghouse which is his sole or main residence.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I believe the mix of benefits in the designated areas is now weighted towards development of commercial property to the detriment of domestic property, and that is a pity. When originally conceived it was envisaged that there would be a mixture of dwellinghouses of various value which would allow a mix of people to live in these areas and that there would be both small industrial property and commercial property development.  The balance now has gone away from the dwellinghouse side.  The Minister should consider restoring the £5,000 grant which applied to the country as a whole but which was removed by him and his Government last year.  I am not advocating that it be <Col N="571" /> restored nationally, but when the scheme was abolished the Minister for the Environment, who has responsibility in the area, exempted by administrative Act the Gaeltacht areas.  I understand that in a Gaeltacht area anywhere in the country if a tenant hands back a local authority house to the local authority the tenant is entitled to the £5,000 grant for the purchase of a new dwelling.  I advocate strongly that the Minister also by order apply the £5,000 grant scheme to the inner city designated areas.</P>
      <P>In many cases in my city, Limerick, developers had taken land.  They were working on the basis that those who had been dislocated from centre city areas by urban decay and had gone as local authority tenants to the margins of the city would be anxious to come back and live in the area in which they were born and reared.  Certainly they would have come and many planned to do so if the £5,000 grant had not been abolished.  I understand the economic reasons and some of the social reasons for the abolition of the scheme, but the inner city urban areas, the designated areas, should be exempt.  There is little point or purpose in developing our inner city areas if they are to be concrete graveyards at night.  I do not think that type of development where activity ceases at 5.30 p.m., when offices shut and everybody departs for the suburbs, is what the inner city should be.  If we are to develop the inner city we must develop a living inner city where families, as in the past, live and bring up their children.</P>
      <P>Much of the infrastructure is in place. The churches in the inner city now, through lack of population among other reasons, are half empty for Mass and services.  The schools in the inner cities have now vacant classrooms through lack of population.  At the same time continuing demands are being made on all Departments of State to duplicate these facilities in urban areas because the movement is to the fringe of our cities. We have a kind of doughnut development where a large hole rapidly increases in the centre and the ring outside gets wider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> It makes neither economic nor social sense and the Minister, in a manner by which he could easily quantify the cost, could decide by order of the Minister for the Environment to reintroduce the £5,000 grant for inner city areas.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Finance Bill the old section 23 for apartments, flats and maisonettes will be reintroduced and, of course, the benefit of that accrues to the purchaser of the apartment or small dwelling but only if he has tenants who can pay significant rents.  The type of development which is now feasible for tax avoidance purposes in the inner city area in regard to domestic property will be geared towards the highly paid and the young professionals &mdash; if any of them want to live there &mdash; while the indigenous population of the inner city have been dislocated to the far flung suburbs and will not be in a position to go back there to live.  That is bad social and economic policy and I should like the Minister to look at the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the general thrust of the Deputy's remarks about the weight in favour of commercial interests as against domestic.  Perhaps he has a limited point in regard to the reintroduction of the £5,000 local authority grant in some other form.  However, while it was taken up fairly substantially by local authority tenants, there is no doubt that there are problems in its wake. I could bring the Deputy to several estates in the country from which excellent people moved out and now community relations are difficult because those who moved out were the leaders. There is not much pressure to have this matter reconsidered.  I was in favour of the measure until we saw its consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section extends the time limit applying to qualifying expenditure in the designated areas in the original five county boroughs, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  I would have thought that everybody would be jumping for joy as a result.  We will have more time to cover some of these points in sections 24 to 26 where there is an <Col N="573" /> extensive reintroduction of refurbishment and reconstruction grants for domestic dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by the Minister in relation to the £5,000 grant, especially in relation to the Custom House Docks area, where it could have the reverse effect to that intended by Deputy Noonan.  Perhaps it would be successful if it was confined to the Custom House Docks area, but the whole point of a living city is to ensure that people who already live in the area are kept there and given new housing.  I do not know whether this section is the appropriate one to discuss this, but as it refers to housing it is reasonable to assume it is.</P>
      <P>The Custom House Docks area comes under this section and it seems to extend about half way across the river.  I do not know what the purpose of that is, or if one could bring houses half way across the river, but it certainly takes up the whole roadway as well as part of the river. I have never been able to understand what this means or what power it gives to the people in the area in regard to encroachment or construction on the river.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. D. O'Malley Mr. D. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the level of construction in designated urban areas is not as rapid as I would have hoped for and which I thought, a year or so ago, was likely to happen.  I know Limerick best and I concur with what Deputy Noonan said about the complete absence of dwelling accommodation. Although there were considerable plans, none has been provided in the designated urban area.  The extensive plans for several hundred units have all been dropped, which is particularly disappointing, because if there is commercial development the centre of Limerick city, and of others, will remain empty at night.  That is, socially and otherwise, unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate at which commercial developments have gone ahead is, unfortunately, very slow.  There have been a whole series of postponements in Limerick and we are <Col N="574" /> now told that it is hoped to start some of the long postponed projects within the next few weeks.  I certainly hope that happens because the number of postponements has been extremely disappointing. They are mainly due to tax changes of one kind or another which have complicated the situation.  One of the most important things that could and should be done in all the inner urban areas outside Dublin is, of course, the Government decentralisation programme. I am glad that announcements have been made in relation to a number of smaller places; but nothing has gone ahead in relation to Limerick or Cork and, I think I am right in saying, in relation to Waterford.</P>
    <P>There was an excellent site in Limerick some years ago which, unfortunately, has been partly built on and is not available. In recent months I urged the Minister to try to ensure that a site would be available for the proposals in regard to Limerick and I should like the Minister to give the present position in regard to the decentralisation of a large section of the Revenue Commissioners, about 900 officials. That would do more for the regeneration of Limerick and its derelict central areas than almost any of the various incentives. It would make a huge difference, it would be invaluable and very important. Indeed, it should have happened in 1981 or 1982 but it was cancelled at that time. I would particularly like to hear the Minister comment on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about the scope of the Custom House Docks area going out as far as the river.  The reason for that is to have the full incentives available out as far as the river for landscaping and so on, perhaps even for marinas, who knows?  Before I comment on decentralisation, I want to give figures which I did not have on section 22.  Deputy Desmond said that revenue was down in relation to excise duty on cars.  In January to March 1987 the duty amounted to £34.78 million and for the same period in 1988 it amounted to £42.57 million.  In January to April 1987, it amounted to £48.6 million and <Col N="575" /> for the same period in 1988 it amounted to £60.6 million, which confirms the figures I gave about the 14 per cent increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made that point but he did not say from what he was quoting.  I am giving the correct figures supplied by the Revenue Commissioners. In relation to decentralisation, there has been no hold up in pursuing, as actively as possible, the detailed provision of offices for that purpose. At present seven of the 12 are under way or awaiting tenders.  It is expected that within the next month or six weeks we will have at least another three of the five that are left.  I hope that will include the city named by the Deputy, Limerick.  There is no difficulty that I am aware of and I agree fully with the Deputy in regard to the contribution decentralisation will make to the designated towns and cities.  I also agree with what he said in regard to any delays or holdups that there have been in starting work in the designated areas.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I submitted, as is my right, three priority questions.  One of those priority questions asked the Minister for Labour whether he had been asked to intervene in the dispute within the Prison Service. That does not appear on the Order Paper today.  When I inquired from the Questions Office they informed me that the reason for that was that the Minister had transferred it to the Department of Justice. I make no point about the fact that I did not get any formal notice from the Chair's office, because I entirely accept that it went wrong in the postal service or whatever; I am not making any issue about that.  However, the question specifically asked the Minister for Labour whether he had received a request and there is no question as to who has overall responsibility for the administration of the Prison Service.  This issue has already arisen on at least two occasions in regard to questions on special notice.</P>

      <P>My priority task in the manpower area is to help the unemployed and my Department have had frequent contacts with the Department of Social Welfare.  The successful introduction of Jobsearch is an example of the results of this co-operation.</P>
      <P>In the policy guidelines which I issued to FÁS after consultation with other Departments, including Social Welfare, I have asked them to have regard to the need to ensure a regular exchange of information and I understand that the proposals FÁS have for computerisation of the placement service will facilitate this.  I have also asked FÁS to consult with the Department of Social Welfare with a view to maintaining a presence in employment exchanges where the needs of the unemployed justify such a service.</P>

It is in the interests of the public that there should be closer liaison.  Already the placement service is being computerised on a pilot basis.  This development will allow flexibility to use the same information.

FÁS are also working towards implementation of a <Col N="579" /> plan to achieve my policy of regionalisation and decentralisation of their services.</P>

Is he aware that in some sections of the organisation people with an AnCO background are finding it very difficult to adjust to the work practices which were common in the Manpower service and the Youth Employment Agency?  Is there any truth in that and, if so, what is being done to address it?  I should like to ask the Minister what steps have been taken by him since the establishment of FÁS to place his Department in the driving role as the policy formulator in the manpower area?  What steps have his Department <Col N="580" /> taken to ensure that they take the reins from the beginning?</P>

      <P>With regard to the second point raised by the Deputy, I should like to tell him that the policy unit referred to in the Manpower policy document of 1986 is now firmly in place in the Department of Labour.  The Department have recruited the necessary expert staff to build up that policy unit.  In future policy on all matters relating to FÁS will be formulated in the Department in conjunction with FÁS.  I am not anxious for the Department to devise policies and schemes without working with those involved in the front line.  The scheme is working and a number of initiatives have already been announced.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that over a number of years there has been a marked lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Department of Defence and the Army general staff in implementing the legislation?

      <P>In fairness it should be said that when the legislation was drawn up the Defence Forces were excluded because of the security nature of the employment.  At that stage it was considered that females would not be in combatant positions but that has changed following the 1979 Act.  The Army have made some strides in making changes, particularly at cadet level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he will enter into discussions with those organisations active on behalf of young Irish emigrants in Britain about the likely impact of the changes in social security put into effect recently in Britain; and the plans he has to ameliorate the most severe effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have been in consultation with DÍON, the London-based committee which advises me on matters of emigrant welfare, about the impact of the revised social security system in Britain on unemployed young Irish people there.  In addition, the Irish Embassy in London, on behalf of DÍON, has arranged that staff of the Department of Health and Social Services meet representatives of the various organisations involved with the welfare of Irish persons <Col N="583" /> there and brief them fully on the revised system.</P>
      <P>My approach in relation to emigration is to try to ensure that young persons considering emigration, particularly to London, are made fully aware of the serious difficulties they may encounter unless they have employment and accommodation arranged in advance.  For this reason, one of the aims of the information and advice service which I introduced last year is to dissuade from emigrating, if possible, those persons who do not have the financial resources, education and skills to ensure a reasonable chance of success.  In particular, those aged under 18 and those going to London without firm arrangements about accommodation and work are dissuaded.  This information and advice service is now provided through FÁS &mdash; the training and employment service.</P>
      <P>While every effort will be made to dissuade young persons from emigrating in an unprepared and thoughtless manner, the final decision on whether or not to emigrate rests with the individual.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the percentage of Irish emigrants who fail to find employment and must depend on the British social security system is probably as low as 10 per cent of emigrants to Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in view of the extra demands on the resources of organisations looking after the welfare of our young emigrants in the UK, particularly in London, extra resources should be made available to help in the provision of services?  I understand demands on these services have increased fivefold during the past year, while the grant has only been increased by between 50 per cent and 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that demands have gone up substantially. The grant to the DÍON committee has worked particularly well.  Two years ago that grant was only £68,000 but it is now £250,000.  Through the apprenticeship scheme FÁS have carried out work in <Col N="584" /> different centres.  The Camden Town centre will open in a week's time and they have committed themselves to further work in Camden.  The DÍON committee are trying to use their resources as best they can.  While there were cutbacks in most areas of the Department this year, we strove to make sure that the DÍON grant remained at the same level, which was substantially higher than the level in 1986.  We will continue to look at this grant in the light of the demands.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the grant to DÍON for providing such valuable advice and help to our emigrants is the same as provided to Dublin Zoo, namely, £250,000.  Is the Minister satisfied that FÁS have been given adequate resources to provide pre-emigration counselling?  Have any extra resources been made available to FÁS and have they the necessary expertise to advise these people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the past two years much effort has been put into providing a good welfare service.  The booklet has proved a great success and is now used throughout the education system generally.  The number of organisations and agencies who receive money from DÍON is substantial.  In recent months I met the spokesmen of the Irish Federation of Clubs and those representing Irish emigrant services abroad and they indicated there is not a crisis.  A fairly small percentage go to the advice centres and only a small percentage of those actually need help.  Most are simply seeking advice and contacts.  While no money is ever enough, the amount available is being used very well.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that 10 per cent of emigrants do not get employment.  Where is that figure derived from?  How long does it normally take for an emigrant to find work?  For some it may be a matter of days but for others it could take several months.  We should be concerned about the length of time it takes many of them to find employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I simply gave that figure so that the problem would not appear to be out of proportion. We must help those who do not get work, whatever percentage they represent. From continual surveys it has been found that 10 per cent is about the figure for people who do not get jobs.  We are continually advising people, through the FÁS offices, to endeavour, at least, to have some contacts before they emigrate. From my visits to the centres on two occasions, it has been amazing how young people are picking up jobs at great speed. What they are having tremendous difficulty with is accommodation.  Every centre I visited and every group I met hardly raised the position on unemployment, but did mention accommodation difficulties.</P>

      <P>That is where they are encountering great difficulties and that is where we must try to assist them.  Much of the work being done by the DÍON committee concerns the renovation of hostels.  I know that a number of the county associations are involved and this has nothing to do with the State at all. They are buying up old and large houses and trying to provide accommodation for young people.  The Kerrymen's Association, in particular, has done a great deal of good work in that area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly accept the Minister's analysis that the major problem is on the accommodation side rather than on the employment side.  As I understand it, a number of the changes in relation to social welfare impinge particularly on people who are seeking accommodation, perhaps soon after arrival.  In those circumstances, could the Minister arrange for an officer of the Irish Embassy in London to be assigned specifically to the task of offering support <Col N="586" /> and assistance to individuals who find themselves with problems?  I know that there is an officer whose function it is to relate to the organised Irish community and that there is an officer attached to the Minister's Department who relates also to the organised community and to the Department of Employment and so on.  However, there should be an officer there to assist and show people the way through the system so that they do not find themselves lost in encountering bureaucracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not rule out that suggestion.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy have arranged to have discussions between DÍON, the Federation of Irish Clubs and the Department of Social Security.  They are probably trying to see how best they can handle the position.  It might as well be said that under the new regulations which will come into force in September I can see great difficulties for the under 18 year olds.  I do not see a solution there, whatever about trying to find some way around the new laws to minimise the effects on people over 18 years of age. The people under 18 years of age, first, will be given support for only a very short period of time, having waited a number of weeks.  I shall look at the Deputy's suggestion.  I should like to liaise with DÍON as to what advice they come back with in trying to find a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 5, 52 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The normal weekly wage payable to participants on the social employment scheme is £60.  The additional allowance of £25 per week is only payable to persons who immediately before joining the scheme were in receipt of an adult dependant's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and have a certificate to this effect from their local employment exchange.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the situations raised by the Deputies where a person's status changes in relation to an adult dependant during the course of participation in the scheme.  I am examining the position at present, but I have to be conscious of the possible cost implications for both this scheme and the enterprise scheme.  I will communicate with the Deputies as soon as possible in the matter.</P>
      <P>Questions relating to specific individuals are a matter for day-to-day activities of FÁS and I would suggest the Deputies contact FÁS direct in the matter.</P>

      <P>I have said that I am conscious of the difficulties.  The Deputy might also accept that if a couple's circumstances change and, for example, the wife obtains a job during the period of the social employment scheme, the Department or FÁS would not take away the benefit.  It is a case of the swings and roundabouts.  It was arranged in this way from the start for a good reason.  In many of these schemes voluntary and community groups had to cost a scheme for materials and labour and then try to work that scheme as best they could.  Rather than changing the rates of an individual during the scheme it was decided, with much justification, that where there were pluses and minuses the situation would be left as it was.  People would be left on the scale at which they begun.  With 10,000, or normally 12,000, people on the social employment scheme at any one time, to make individual changes would be administratively quite difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, would the Minister accept that a plus for one married couple is no help in countering a minus for another couple?  If the problem is administrative, surely it can be resolved by flexibility in that a marriage certificate would be accepted as being evidence to permit a change in the rates?  I was impressed by the Minister's response with regard to a similar anomaly in connection with part-time firemen.  I would appeal to him to do the decent thing in this case and provide, as it were, a wedding present for young couples who are affected by this outrageous and unjust anomaly.</P>

I will probably be happier to try to force the Department of Social Welfare to make the change if I could be equally happy that when I provided the wedding presents those from whom I could take away those amounts would own up as well.  It does create some administrative difficulties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the percentage of disabled persons who have found employment in the public service in the year ending 31 January 1987; the action he proposes to take to facilitate the attainment of the 3 per cent quota; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>During 1986, 114 disabled persons were recruited to the public service.  As a result at 31 December 1986 the percentage of disabled persons employed in the public sector stood at 1.30 per cent.  These are the latest figures available.</P>
      <P>My Department have responsibility for overseeing the 3 per cent quota scheme for the employment of disabled persons in the public service.  I regret that little progress can be made at present because of the general embargo on recruitment to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has said that it is a matter of regret to him. I think he will accept that traditionally disabled persons who are qualified and willing to work fared better in getting jobs in the public service and that traditionally that service made a better effort to meet the target of 3 per cent than had been done, for example, in the private sector.  Since the introduction of the embargo on public service recruitment disabled persons have fallen back very badly.  People of that nature do not have the option of emigrating, as a number of able-bodied people have if they are qualified and willing to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of those matters does the Minister not think that the time has come when he and his Department should initiate some kind of drive to help people in that position?  Apart from all the other implications, the situation has arisen where rehabilitation centres, for example, that have trainees ready for open employment cannot get jobs for these trainees, who have to fall back on the centres, which are overcrowded.  This <Col N="590" /> leads to new people in need of training not being able to attend the centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made the points.  As the Deputy will know, a decision was made some years ago about subordinate employment grades in the Departments and special competitions for other grades which gave very satisfactory openings for disabled people. With the embargo position, however, over the years vacancies in those grades were frozen, even before other grades in the public service.  The Department of Labour through the last ten years have been using their powers of persuasion and co-operation with the Departments to try to get both the Ministers and the Departments to take on disabled people, with much success for perhaps four or five years.  Then came the difficulties.  I would be glad if I could think of some suitable scheme and would be open to suggestions, but with the embargo there is great difficulty.  In the context of the handicapped and the disabled whether it be through Teamwork or the Social Employment Scheme, we have been very sympathetic.  I know that that is not what the Deputy is talking about in relation to employment opportunities, but on the extension of some of those schemes we have allowed disabled people to be retained where others have not been retained. The only good news I can give the Deputy today is that the Department of Labour <Col N="591" /> quota is 3.3 per cent.  I wish every other Department was the same.  When the position improves we can start moving again to try to help the disabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will extend the remit of DÍON to allocate resources to bodies/organisations working outside Britain, for example, the United States, Germany or Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>DÍON, the advisory committee on emigrant welfare, was established in 1984.  One of their functions is to make recommendations on the application of State assistance towards the employment of professional staff by voluntary organisations dealing with the welfare problems of Irish emigrants.  All but one of the members of DÍON, which include two representatives of the Federation of Irish Societies, are based in Britain.</P>
      <P>When DÍON were established it was represented that most of the welfare problems associated with emigrants were concentrated in the United Kingdom, particularly in the London area.  Since then, the bulk of grants have been paid to voluntary organisations in Britain, on the recommendation of DÍON.</P>
      <P>Because of its proximity, ease of access, low passenger fares and absence of administrative controls, Britain continues to be the main destination for Irish people seeking work abroad.  Unfortunately, a proportion of those going there fail to make adequate advance preparations and some of them get into difficulties.  Most of the voluntary bodies which provide reception and emergency services for emigrants have reported a significant increase in the number of inquiries, requests for help and demands for the services in the past few years and, on that basis, have sought larger grants.</P>
      <P>Despite cuts in most other areas of State expenditure, the Government have maintained the 1988 allocation for emigrant advisory services at its 1987 level of £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given limited budgets, grants to voluntary bodies outside the United <Col N="595" /> Kingdom could be made only at the expense of the amount available to British-based groups and at the risk of obliging such groups to curtail or abandon some of the badly needed services which they help to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a question on 16 February it was stated that over 400 queries are received on a weekly basis in our consulates in New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco on matters such as welfare, health care and social security.  Surely this shows a need for an extension of the service to the US? Besides, the Taoiseach on his recent visit to America promised that he would aid such a service by the IIRM.  Will the Minister of State comment on that promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach outlined a number of extensions in the services in the US when he met a number of groups. The DÍON Committee for which I have responsibility are only concerned with hardship and homelessness problems in Britain.  The problems the Deputy refers to do not fall within my remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that similar problems prevail in the UK and the US and in some cases they are more serious in the US?  Because of the seriousness of the problem in the US can consideration be given to extending the role of DÍON in 1989?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems in the US are different in that far more of them relate to the legal status of emigrants to the US.  From the reports I have read problems in the UK are different.  The Deputy's question is really a question for the Department of Foreign Affairs. DÍON are primarily working in Britain and they have no function outside of Britain to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn <Col N="596" /> to the fact that 9,500 women and 3,100 men, over 25 years of age, are signing on for unemployment assistance but receiving no money, because they are living at home; that, because they are receiving no money they are excluded from participating in social employment schemes; the steps, if any, he intends to take to end this discrimination; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme is specifically designed to assist the long term unemployed in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit and the scheme is funded to a significant extent through savings on social welfare payments.  To admit person not in receipt of unemployment compensation would increase the net Exchequer cost of the scheme.  This would mean that with a given budget fewer participants could be assisted.  In these circumstances, I regret that some people who are unemployed but not receiving unemployment compensation are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous question the Minister answered was quite distinct but the reply to my question was not so distinct.  Is the Minister saying that people who are registered as unemployed and who are not being paid are being excluded and will continue to be excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise if I read the reply too fast but I have answered this question so many times that I have the reply almost off by heart.  It was decided to use the social welfare criteria when setting up the social employment scheme and that is still the policy.  The criteria are registration on the live register and classification of recipient on unemployment assistance so as to identify those in need of income support and employment opportunity.  It is accepted as a requirement of eligibility that persons be in receipt of unemployment assistance as this represents the most appropriate test of need in both senses and it was also decided to confine the scheme to persons in receipt of social <Col N="597" /> welfare payments to achieve compensatory savings <i>vis-á-vis</i> social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>These people in the first instance are being deprived of receiving benefit of assistance and, secondly, they are not being allowed to participate in the social employment scheme because of the benefit and privilege part of the social welfare code.  Would the Minister agree that this code is now archaic and would he give an assurance to the House that he will seek discussions with the Minister for Social Welfare to rid the scheme of this anomaly?  Would the Minister also agree that applicants for unemployment assistance have no income and cannot be maintained at home by their parents and that this in turn is forcing some people to emigrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question on a number of occasions.  The position is that part of the cost of the social employment scheme is funded from savings in the social welfare budget and because of this people who are on the live register but not in receipt of any benefit are excluded.  That will continue to be the case at least for this year.  The reason why they are being excluded is that, as a result of a means test, they are not in receipt of any benefits.  Therefore, I do not think they come within the category the Deputy spoke about, but I am aware that there are some border line cases.  At present there are about 10,000 places in the social employment scheme and, as long as there are far more people who are in receipt of assistance and benefit than places, the position is unlikely to change.  At present there are far more people seeking to go on the social employment scheme than the number of places available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnneMarieColley" hpid="Miss Colley Miss Colley">
      <NameTxt>Miss Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for some social employment schemes there are no suitable qualified people available &mdash; that is, being on the live register and in receipt of payments &mdash; and would he consider those who are registered as long-term unemployed but <Col N="598" /> not in receipt of payments for social employment schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At present they are ruled out, but I am sympathetic to the point the Deputy has made.  There would still be the question of the additional cost to the State which would be outside the present regulations and it is not for me to make an adjustment.  I made some exceptions in the case of islanders so that they could be retained on schemes.  My difficulty lies with the extra costs that would be imposed on the Exchequer.  It is the savings in social welfare that make it possible to have so many people in this scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that he has answered this question so often that he knows the reply off by heart, but I am afraid he is going to have to continue answering it until this discrimination is eliminated.  It has been pointed out that those who are most discriminated against are women.  There are 9,500 women &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us at what point does he consider it would be socially beneficial for a person who is unemployed to take part in a social employment scheme?  What we are doing here is effectively applying a means test before allowing a person to go on a social employment scheme.  There are young people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally unfair that a person has to undergo a means test before being allowed to go on a social employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which should not be missed is that this scheme is most attractive for the long term unemployed of which we have far too many.  A single person who is long term unemployed <Col N="599" /> receives £42 per week, but on the social employment scheme such a person would receive £60 a week.  I wish that there were not so many long term unemployed on the live register but I think they are entitled to first call on the social unemployment scheme and that is how the scheme is operating at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has shown some flexibility in response to a question from Deputy Colley that a particular approach should be taken where it is shown that there are no qualified people on the live register.  Would the Minister consider adopting the same approach where it is established there are no ordinary applicants on the live register where a sponsoring organisation want to retain on a scheme a person who has already completed their year or want to restore them on the scheme after a lapse of time?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Colley, there still would be the financial implications of such a change. During the past few months I have held discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the social employment scheme and they are very reluctant to agree to a position where people would be allowed to continue into a second year, although some flexibility has been shown in particular cases, particularly in respect of the handicapped.  Agreeing to allow people continue into a second year would create great difficulties for many reasons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Minimum wage fixing machinery in the form of joint labour committees is already an established part of our industrial relations legislation.  The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, contains detailed provisions in relation to these committees.</P>
      <P>There are at present 17 joint labour committees in existence covering about 30,000 workers.  The sectors of employment covered by these committees are generally characterised as being non-unionised and/or with low rates of pay. From time to time difficulties arise for the committees in attempting to reconcile the expectations of the workers covered in relation to increases in pay and the need to maintain a competitive advantage in terms of products.</P>
      <P>In the light of experience of the operation of JLCs I am proposing amendments to JLC procedures as part of my review of industrial relations legislation.</P>
      <P>In general, in my view the minimum wage-fixing machinery has worked well in protecting workers in areas where trade union organisation is weak.  Considerable arrears of wages continue to be collected in respect of law clerks, catering and hotel workers.</P>

      <P>Under the 1946 Act the joint labour committees were based around the country.  There were a number of groups such as farm labourers and law clerks which were difficult to incorporate in any union so that people could negotiate with them.  There are 17 committees and they cover tailoring, shirt making, women's clothing and so on. They cover a great variety of areas and I do not think there is any need to extend them as the groups I mentioned are the only ones that are dispersed.</P>

      <P>I could have read the question in a different way and said that of the four chairpeople that I have appointed 50 per cent of them are women.  That would have sounded better. I should also say in my own defence that unfortunately in the Department of Labour the Minister has to accept the names of nominating bodies.  It is with great difficulty that we can get many of the nominating bodies to put forward a woman's name and therefore it is difficult for the Minister to appoint women and that is regrettable.  Perhaps if those bodies put forward more women my statistics in this regard would be better. Needless to say, the chairperson that I appointed to the Employment Equality Agency is a woman.</P>

I wonder whether he has approached them and suggested that they have responsibilities in balancing their appointments as between men and women and also <Col N="603" /> in having a significant number of young people among their appointments.  The Minister can do something about inviting suitable submissions.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the estimates which have been made by his Department regarding the extent of the extra resources which will be required if the recommendations of the Barrington Commission on Health and Safety at Work are to be implemented; and if he will give an assurance that the necessary resources will be made available for same.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work contained a great variety of recommendations.  My main priority at present is to bring forward the legislation to give effect to those recommendations which require a legislative base, including the establishment of a National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.</P>
      <P>It will essentially be for the new authority in the first instance to make an assessment of the overall needs and resources necessary to give effect to the broad recommendations of the Barrington Commission.  Some preliminary consideration has been given to initial resource requirements but this has been purely tentative and I do not propose to publish the results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be for the Government to decide on the level of resources to be made <Col N="604" /> available, taking into account the phased approach recommended by the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. Birmingham Mr. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to confirm to the Dáil that if we move to a situation of blanket coverage where protective legislation will apply to every workplace in the country, that is bound to very substantially increase the demands on his Department and on the new agency which is to be established?  There is very little point in passing legislation through this House if we are not in a position to enforce it. Believe it or not, we have apparently been congratulated by the Council of Europe recently on having the best anti-water pollution legislation in Europe. The fact that we are quite incapable of enforcing it is entirely another matter. Would the Minister accept that there is no point in bringing legislation before this House unless, when he introduces it, he is in a position to establish to the House that he can make it stick?</P>

      <P>What the Deputy has said is sensible but he will also know, as he had a great involvement in this area in the Department of Labour, that it is the intention of the interim board to bring in this legislation.  I would be very glad to introduce it and to implement it on a phased basis.  Then we could worry about the next problem.  I would not be pessimistic and say that in future years &mdash; I am not talking about decades &mdash; we would be in a position to start implementing it. With the considerable number of staff already involved in health and safety we could start implementing it now on a phased basis, not taking into account the extra resources that would perhaps be available to us in time to come.  I would be happy if we could pass the Bill.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it will take some time to organise this board, taking into account the various organisations that are concerned.  We should not delay with this matter.  I am continually pressing to have the legislation agreed between the Department, the parliamentary draftsman, and the Attorney General's office. <Col N="605" /> I agree that there would be substantial costs involved if we were to implement all the recommendations in the report, although I do not have a total financial assessment on that.  We should continue in our efforts to bring about this measure because it is something that is very desirable. I am sure the Deputy knows the pluses and minuses of having this measure from the point of view of the national economy.  It does not just involve a straight cost to the Exchequer.  There are many other matters involved such as people's lives, their health and insurance costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put down a marker to the Minister in advance of the debate in the House and to say that I am a little concerned about his approach that the first thing to do is to get the legislation on the Statute Books and then see how much of it we can implement and at what pace we can implement it. Our Statute Books are groaning with legislation which we have never set about implementing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as the Minister for Labour who is responsible for looking after the health and safety of the workforce, I would be failing in my duty if I was not to try to change the position where we have legislation covering only 20 per cent of the workforce.  We now have an excellent commission report which will help us to give health and safety to 100 per cent of the workforce. Regardless of what happens, if we could have the legislation passed we could improve substantially the safety and welfare of the workers, at perhaps no great cost.</P>

      <P>Regulations are being drafted legally to give effect to the provisions of Council Directive 83/477/EEC of 19 September 1983 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.  While some of the issues involved are relatively complex, I will endeavour to have the regulations completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the provisions of the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955, and 1980, and the Factories (Asbestos Processes) Regulations, 1975, which are made under those Acts, apply to workers who may be exposed to asbestos in workplaces and activities covered by the Acts.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister indicate the reason for such a long delay in bringing forward the regulations in relation to asbestos?  It is particularly apt that the question should be dealt with today in view of the effects of asbestos when it is disturbed.  It creates lung cancer, asbestosis and so on.  Can he also indicate whether or not the regulations <Col N="607" /> would involve controls on, or does he propose to introduce any regulations to control, the importation of products which contain asbestos?  Can he give a date as to when the regulations he is talking about now will come into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the delay is that the regulations are complex and there was pressure of work.  The regulations are being drafted at present and I understand it will be summer before I get them.  The Deputy asked about the EC directive for the general reduction of exposure to asbestos fibres in the work place, the setting of exposure limits for asbestos dust concentrations, the establishment of sampling and measuring methods, appropriate health surveillance for workers exposed to asbestos for the first time and the provision of adequate information to workers and their representatives in the work place about the potential risks to health from exposure to asbestos and the precautions to be taken. The directive sets the exposure limit value of one fibre per cubic centimetre as a maximum level of asbestos in the air to which workers may be exposed.  This is European Week against Cancer, this issue is extremely important and I hope to get the draft regulations during the summer.</P>

As far as it concerns my Department, when I have identified the scope for action, including simplification or abolition of requirements, I will make a further announcement.  In the meantime I can assure the Deputy that through such steps as wide discussion &mdash; as exemplified by the recent discussion document &mdash; the production of straightforward non-technical guides to labour legislation and the operation of a free information services, I am attempting to balance the maintenance of a floor of social rights and the reduction of burdens on industry and commerce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the figure. In regard to the simplication of legislation under the Department of Labour, it has been said there are far too many statutes which are unduly complicated.  Recently we published a guide to labour law which provides in a straightforward and nontechnical manner short descriptions of <Col N="609" /> the more significant legislation concerning industrial relations and employment protection legislation.</P>

Would the Minister, as Minister for Labour, take on the responsibility of trying to agree a core of rights with the social partners to which everyone could assent and which would be outside the scope of any such review?

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> spelt out a number of areas, including that mentioned by the Deputy, where there would be a consensus. If there are areas where it can be proved that the regulations were not required and were not taking away anybody's rights, the Department of Labour would have to take into account the fact that removing an obstacle for an employer might mean removing a right for an employee.  The Department of Labour have an information section which produced a number of guides for legislation, annual reports and so on. These documents will make it simpler for the general public to get information.  A discussion document was published on the equality legislation and unfair dismissals legislation last year and we continue to review the submissions of the employer organisations.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to a recent recommendation of the Labour Court in respect of Wicklow County Council.</P>
      <P>The ITGWU took a case to the Labour Court claiming that the privatisation by the council of a refuse collection route was in breach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The court's recommendation is as follows:</P>
      <P>The court cannot find any reference to privatisation of services in section II, paragraph 11 of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>To settle this dispute the court recommends on industrial relations grounds that, as an alternative to contracting out, the disputed route should be manned by staff redeployed from non-essential services.</P>
      <P>The consideration of Labour Court recommendations is a matter for the parties to whom they are addressed, in this case Wicklow County Council and the ITGWU.</P>

      <P>In his reply, the Minister said that, in so far as general issues are concerned, everybody in this House would accept that the Government must have flexibility to ensure that any opportunity existing for reducing the cost of public services, thus reducing the burden on the taxpayer, must be carefully examined. He went on to say that the notion that any service at present executed by the public sector must continue to be provided by the public sector at all costs is not one to which the Government could subscribe.  He said he fully accepted that the industrial relations aspect of making any changes of this nature would have to be taken into account.  He reiterated that the Government commitment &mdash; in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; to achieving any reduction in the number of public service employees on a voluntary <Col N="615" /> basis must be honoured.  That was the reply given by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on Tuesday 3 May 1988.  I should say that it is the view I hold on this matter.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that the Minister now holds that view.  Would he say whether he considers that view is consistent with the correspondence entered into by the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before the last General Election, when he apparently told them there was no need to worry, that there would be no move towards privatisation of any services?</P>

      <P>No, that issue did not form part of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> There is no specific provision in that plan for privatisation.  Here I might quote paragraph 11 of section II of the programme which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In realising their budgetary targets, the Government are committed to the need for the achievement of a reduction in the number of public service employees.  They are committed to achieving this reduction on a voluntary basis.  They are confident that the comprehensive voluntary arrangements they have introduced will achieve the reductions sought.  If in practice, however, the take-up of these voluntary arrangements does not enable <Col N="616" /> the Government's budgetary and structural objectives to be met, the Government will review the position but, in doing so, they undertake to consult fully with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Such prior consultations will take place under the review mechanism provided for in the Programme.</P>

    <P>SECTION 24.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I move amendment No. 37:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> In page 30, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) in the definition of `house' in the said subsection (1) (a) `and in particular includes on-campus hostel accommodation for third level educational establishments' were inserted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 24 re-introduces what used to be known as section 23 in its old and widest form.  Briefly, for the benefit of the House, I should say that section 23 allows the cost of apartments or houses to be written off against the rental income accruing from those apartments or houses with certain limitations as to size. In its widest form it also extends to the rental income of any property held by the owner of a section 23 dwelling.  This means that somebody who would purchase a section 23 dwelling could write off the rent of existing rented property against the acquisition costs of the new dwelling.</P>
    <P>I am seeking, in this amendment, to ensure that the provisions of section 23 would apply to on-campus accommodation for university students.  There is a variety of reasons for having on-campus accommodation available in our universities.  Traditionally, such on-campus accommodation has been available in Trinity College, Dublin.  It is the intention of the authorities of University College, Dublin to construct on-campus accommodation at Belfield.  Certainly they have plenty of room in which to provide such accommodation.  It is a beautifully landscaped campus.  The inclusion of apartment-type accommodation, on-campus, for students would be of great benefit to them and to the university itself.  It improves the atmosphere of a campus when the students who study there also live on-campus. The same applies to the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick. They are at present constructing student accommodation immediately outside the main gate of their premises which, effectively, is the equivalent of on-campus accommodation.  Perhaps the <Col N="647" /> Minister and his officials consider that the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; is wide enough already to include this type of accommodation but I think it is important to put the matter beyond doubt and that is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to add some additional wording to the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; for the purpose of the section 23 relief.  It appears its intention is to include, for the purposes of relief, properties which might not otherwise qualify.  If this is the case the proposed amendment would not add anything to the existing definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; in section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981, and accordingly would not extend the range of the relief.  The word &ldquo;house&rdquo; is defined in section 23 as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;house&rdquo; includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for us as a dwelling and any out-office, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith;</P>
      <P>This definition is broad enough to include any property used as a dwelling. However, to qualify as a section 23 property a house must have an internal floor area of between 30 square metres and 90 square metres, previously 73 square metres, in the case of a self-contained flat or maisonette, and between 35 square metres, and 125 square metres in any other case.  It must also meet certain standards in relation to construction, water, sewerage and other services laid down by the Minister for the Environment and be the subject of a certificate of reasonable cost if it is to be rented out directly by a builder or by the person who commissioned the building.  The property must be let under a qualified lease or leases for a period of ten years to qualify for the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any on-campus accommodation for third level educational establishments which meets the above criteria would qualify for section 23 relief and, therefore, there is no specific need to extend the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; in the manner proposed.  I am advised in this regard by <Col N="648" /> the Revenue Commissioners that they have approved, in principle, under the existing legislation, a housing scheme adjacent to a third level campus which appears to be directed towards student occupation.  For that reason I do not think there is a necessity for the amendment.</P>

      <P>This time last year Deputy McDowell and I put down an amendment to reintroduce section 23.  I pushed it fairly strongly and I was told it could not be contemplated.  Suddenly it has appeared this year and it does not cost the Exchequer anything.  It would not have cost the Exchequer anything last year.  There is a need for it this year but there was at least an equal need for it last year.  I wonder why all the arguments that were put forward against it by the Minister for Finance last year no longer suddenly apply.  I suppose this is one of the mysteries of political life one has to live with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this has been introduced but it is a pity it was done last year, as I tried and suggested at the time.  I hope it will be retained for a reasonable length of time.  It is to operate for a period of three years but if it works as well as it did in the past I do not see any reason why it should not be extended eventually <Col N="649" /> beyond that period because it is a perfectly sensible provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not going to oppose the section but I have doubts about whether it will be of much benefit.  When the tax avoidance scheme being reintroduced in the section was first put in place it was reputed to have had certain benefits but I think these benefits were always questionable.  As I remarked in another context this morning, if one can transfer residual income into assets that will create wealth.  Section 23 was, and will again be, a mechanism whereby the people who were the beneficiaries of rental income did not pay tax on their rental income and the tax foregone was translated into the asset value of the apartment or house.  That is the way it works.  People do not pay the tax and even though this does not increase their income it does increase their assets.</P>
      <P>Obviously well targeted tax avoidance schemes can benefit an economy but I wonder if this one does.  One would think in the first instance that a tax avoidance scheme in the housing area would be directed towards the provision of housing and increasing the housing stock but that does not seem to be the purpose of section 23, reintroduced as section 24, and I do not think that was ever the purpose of it.  I do not think there was ever any suggestion that the original section 23 was in ease of the homeless.  I do not think there was ever any suggestion that it was directed to improve the stock of dwellings.</P>
      <P>The Minister probably has more accurate information than I have but I understand that during its brief existence approximately 500 or 600 dwellings, to a large extent apartments, were built under section 23.  The Minister can confirm the figures.  I may be overlapping between houses and apartments but between 500 and 600&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not discussing section 23 of this Finance Bill which you a Cheann Comhairle rightly pointed out has already been dealt with. I was developing the point that during the previous duration of section 23 between 500 and 600 apartments were built.  I understand that about half of those were built in the Dublin 4 area. That does not seem to be the area where there are the greatest number of homeless people or where there are the least numbers of undeveloped or uncomfortable dwelling houses.  From past experience, I do not think it is arguable that section 23, now section 24, is being introduced to provide a boost to the stock of dwellings.  Obviously it is not being brought in to ease the plight of the homeless or to provide better houses for those who are inadequately housed.  It is being brought in as a measure to boost an ailing building industry.  The building industry is on its uppers.  Many of the main practitioners of the building industry are no longer in the country.  The contractors are in the south-east of England and in various far foreign fields from Dunkirk to Belgrade and beyond the Persian Gulf in Bahrain and Kuwait and various places like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must measure the re-introduction of this section to stimulate the building industry against the record of the Minister's <Col N="651" /> Government since they came into office <i>vis-á-vis</i> the building industry.  First there have been constant press reports that prior to the election a commitment was made to the building industry that a sum of £200 million of capital expenditure would be injected into that industry when the Minister's party returned to office. Second, there have been constant and continuing reports in the media that the 10 per cent VAT rate which applies to the building industry would be reduced to 5 per cent.  These reports have never been denied by the Minister or his party or the Taoiseach as being inaccurate.  Not only was there not an injection of capital funds along the lines promised, not only was there no reduction in the VAT rates applying to the building industry, but the exact opposite was done.  In the Book of Estimates last autumn the capital budget was devastated; it was cut down to the point where, in effect, only ongoing contractual obligations were maintained. Are we now seriously to accept that the re-introduction of section 23, now 24, is going to act as a counter-stimulous to all the negative stimuli that have been the result of Government decisions over the last 12 months?</P>
    <P>Another question also arises, and it is this: when section 23 was introduced originally in 1981 it was one of the few tax avoidance schemes readily available to the ordinary taxpayer on high marginal rates.  But since then there is a multiplicity of them.</P>
    <P>We were talking this morning about designated areas in our cities; they were to be Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  Now, as a result of the lobbying of some of the Minister's party, it is to be extended right across the country, and now the inner area of any larger town is to benefit from a whole package of incentives which would make advocates of section 23 blush.</P>
    <P>As well as that we have the business expansion scheme.  The business expansion scheme was put in the first instance so that people would use a tax avoidance <Col N="652" /> scheme to invest in manufacturing industry and as a result risk a certain amount of income.  Now that has been extended as well.  There is a further extension of it here in the first chapter of this Finance Bill.  It was extended last year to the tourist industry and in extending it to the tourist industry it is very hard, as the Minister knows, to put the ring fence around that.  I have had examples brought to my attention of people acquiring holiday homes for sums of £7,000 and £8,000 net because the business expansion scheme was to take up over 58 per cent of it.</P>
    <P>I am not, for the moment, opposing the extension of the business expansion scheme.  I am not opposing the package of incentives in the cities or in the towns. What I wonder is where is the market now for a further tax avoidance scheme when there are so many available right around the country?  We have financial institutions and financial organisations actively packaging taxpayers up to the level of £25,000 apiece and directing the composite amounts towards investment in manufacturing industry and tourism and in the particular areas to which it is now extended in this Act.</P>
    <P>The question I am raising is, in the re-introduction of section 23 and its associated sections 24, 25 and 26, merely cosmetic? Is it simply providing the Minister and the Government with an alibi when they meet representatives of the building industry so that they will be able to say they could not, due to adverse financial circumstances, fulfil the promises made prior to the election but have brought back section 23 and they can go off and build apartments all over the city and it will be great?</P>
    <P>I am not so sure if it will work this time because there are too many other tax avoidance outlets.  Let us call things by their proper names.  There are too many other tax avoidance outlets directed in other areas where the capital gains are more and the residual risk is probably less.  Even if it works it will not be of benefit to everybody in the building industry because there are people who, in the absence of section 23, constructed <Col N="653" /> blocks of apartments or small houses and the effect of now reintroducing section 23 is to make it impossible for people who have either constructed or who are in the process of constructing apartments to rent them if they cannot benefit from section 23.  There are specific examples of buildings now which are, in effect, being sterilised because the rent will not be tax deductible against the acquisition cost.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of this or whether he has any plans to deal with it, but I can see a limited number of apartment blocks and houses that have been constructed for rental purposes remaining idle into the foreseeable future because there is no provision under these sections.  I am not opposing it, but I believe in calling things by their right names and I believe in evaluating the merits of the sections.  I do not think the reintroduction of section 23 in its widest form, as section 24 here, or the further incentives for the building industry in sections 25 and 26, will work on this occasion.  There are too many other gaps now available to people under the best accountancy advice in the town and I do not think they will go through this particular gap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I agree basically with the points made by Deputy Noonan.  It creates more opportunities for evasion and more complications in the taxation system. Basically we would be opposed to the widening of the system of tax reliefs.  It is our belief that assistance from the State should be by way of grants and subsidies direct, so that it is out in the open and everybody sees how much everybody is getting for what, and we know what we are assisting and why we are assisting it. This system of tax relief or tax foregone by the State works to the detriment of somebody else because there is less money coming into the Exchequer, and of course that money has to be found elsewhere or State expenditure has to be cut back.  It is much clearer if assistance is by way of direct grants and subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case it is a hidden subsidy to landlords and potential landlords &mdash; we <Col N="654" /> do not know how much the total is.  The obvious purpose would appear to be to assist the construction industry; it is another sort of a relief scheme.  We used to have relief schemes in famine days when people built jails and follies in different parts of the country, some of which are still standing; some landlords erected a folly to keep people at work and to give them some assistance.  We used to have relief schemes 30 or 40 years ago.  This is a type of relief scheme which, as Deputy Noonan says, could very well leave a number of follies behind in the form of refurbished dwellings with nobody necessarily availing of them.  It is my belief that, far from getting tax relief, there should be some method of identifying landlords to ensure that they are taxed.  There is nothing in sections 24 to 26 to indicate &mdash; having refurbished dwellings, got the tax relief and the rental income &mdash; that they are identified for tax purposes or that there is any rent control. I am sure the Minister is aware as well as everybody else in this House of young people who are paying outrageous rents for tiny premises.  There is no system of rent control nor is there a system of ensuring minimum size of rooms or the number of people to one bedsit.  There are no regulations of that kind and neither is there compulsory registration of landlords.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a system for registration but only those who offer themselves for registration are registered. There is no mechanism for going out, identifying them and putting them down on the register and having the complete register of landlords even in this city where the numbers in rented accommodation has grown rapidly in recent years.</P>
    <P>The idea of assisting the construction industry by assisting landlords does not seem to make any sense.  It will not necessarily assist those requiring the accommodation.  It will assist one area of the construction industry namely, those in the refurbishing end of the business who, generally, are small, and fly-by-night firms many of whom may not be registered for tax.  The whole business of <Col N="655" /> assisting the construction industry by this method seems to be the most roundabout and least effective way of doing it.</P>
    <P>The construction industry certainly requires assistance, a boost and a start-off and many people are hoping that the famous Custom House Docks site will give them that start-off.  It requires assistance in many ways particularly since the local authorities have decided not to construct any more houses.  It is almost two years since they built houses of any consequence in this city and construction has ceased except to a minimal extent.  In that area the construction industry requires help and assistance.  Local authorities are endeavouring to get refurbishment schemes going for local authority flats etc.  Incidentally, I do not know whether they would be entitled to claim reliefs under this or any other scheme for the job they do.  It is my belief that if assistance is required in that area it can be decided very clearly and definitely by a system of grants and subsidies for specific jobs where we know what they are doing, we know the type of accommodation being created, who is creating the accommodation, how much assistance is required, and we give them that assistance.</P>
    <P>This spreads to an area of development which might lead anywhere and there is thus a wider area for tax evasion which should be narrowed down.  The Commission on Taxation also recommended that the whole area of tax reliefs be gradually eliminated.  The mixture of tax credits &mdash; instead of tax reliefs &mdash; and grants and subsidies in this area are the way in which to do this, where the Exchequer has a clear knowledge of how much assistance is being given in each case and what the purpose of that assistance is, and the public has similar knowledge. Currently the public have no knowledge of the extent of taxes foregone by the State.  Figures have been given here at different times over the last few days.  The total figure for tax foregone was given as being in the region of £2 billion between PAYE workers, the self-employed, farmers, businesses and <Col N="656" /> the whole private sector area.  That is never taken into consideration in discussions of public expenditure by the State.  It is not seen in those terms at all whereas if instead of that there was a system of subsidies, grants, tax credits, it would be clearly seen what the total State expenditure actually was.  That is why I say these are hidden subsidies because they are not open to us for scrutiny and discussion in the same way as the grant and subsidy system.  The main beneficiaries will be landlords, only a small proportion of whom are registered for tax purposes.  I hope that the Minister can say &mdash; I cannot find it in the Bill &mdash; that anyone who avails of this will have to be registered for tax and will have to be up to date in their tax repayments etc. before they will be able to avail of section 23 allowances.</P>

      <P>I would like to answer the last point raised by Deputy Mac Giolla.  Anybody claiming relief would obviously have to be registered for tax purposes.  There is no question or doubt about that.  I do not accept what the Deputy said that it was initiated and introduced mainly for the purpose of giving a subsidy to landlords.  It is, as other Deputies have said, being introduced to give an impetus to the construction industry and nobody is denying that.  So far as the points made by Deputy Noonan are concerned, I would like to say that the number of claims for individuals was 541 and for companies 144 in the previous period of its existence.</P>

I would like to refer to the points made by Deputy Noonan relating to the construction industry and particularly the political comments he made <i>vis-á-vis</i> promises and the £200 million of an injection into the construction industry.  It is about time to put the record straight regarding that accusation that has been around now for the past couple of years, even before the last election.  It was made by our party to give an impetus to the construction industry at the time and, in fact, was taken up by the Coalition Government as was the £5,000 local authority grant.  All of those cost much more than £200 million.  By the time we are finished paying for them it will be some years hence and they will be running into hundreds of millions of pounds.  The reconstruction grants last year had to be discontinued because already we were facing potential bills of £200 million to £300 million in grants under one heading alone.  It was an enormous amount of money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to capital budget cuts as referred to by Deputy Noonan, almost all parties in this House agree we had to get out borrowing down.  I listened to criticisms of cuts in the capital budget, cuts in the area of current expenditure, health, education in staff numbers and so on.  These cuts are all for one purpose, to reduce the borrowing requirement and the national debt that has been run up in the past ten or 12 years.  If Deputies know another way of reducing the national debt I would love to hear about it.  God knows, they would go down in the history if they could find it, but there is no way other than cutting expenditure and increasing activity in the economy so that we can get extra taxes and get more people to <Col N="658" /> work rather than having huge costs in health, social welfare or whatever.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Government's activity, as well as making savings in current or capital expenditure areas we have introduced a number of schemes, including those we are talking about now under sections 24, 25 and 26, in the designated areas, the decentralisation scheme and the Custom House Docks site, all of which are bringing about activity in the economy with no capital expenditure for the Exchequer.  We should all be grateful it is going to do that.  That is the purpose of the exercise.  It is not, as Deputy Mac Giolla suggested, to hand out subsidies to anybody.  If we come to the stage of having this as successful as we want it to be, it will cost money but at the same time I am sure the benefits to the overall economy generally in relation to increased employment will be enormous.</P>
    <P>Costs were mentioned.  The previous scheme would cost around £10 million over the years.  As introduced now, if the take-up is as we expect we see no great cost in 1988 but as it progresses and is taken up and put into operation the costs of 24, 25 and 26 could run to the order of £9 million in tax foregone on an annual basis.  Therefore, it will be well worthwhile and if it reaches that sort of level it will have been successful.  That was the reason for introducing it in the first place.</P>

      <P>In the current economic situation with very scarce resources available to the Minister for relief, I question whether the relief offered is being geared in the right direction.  That is my essential criticism.  There is no doubt that the construction industry on the ground is in a very dire state.  If one wants to maintain an industry and to maintain employment to some degree in the industry where employment has been decimated, if we want to retain what we have, this is not the right way to go about it.  I would have preferred to use a straight £9 million of Exchequer subsidy on, for example, bringing forward some of the road network proposals which are proliferating on the capital projects side of the Department of the Environment.  The economic <Col N="659" /> spinoff would be far greater.  There is an interesting paper in the Department of Finance which I am sure the Minister has seen and which shows that investment in roads has a factor of five in follow-through productivity.</P>

      <P>One question we posed was, &ldquo;If you have relief money to give, where do you give it?&rdquo; The Department of Finance since 1981 have come back to us and said time and time again that we should forget about this preoccupation with housing, that we are the best housed, best housing stocked country in the western democracies.  People do not believe that.  We still have homelessness due to political incompetence.  The stock of Irish housing represents enormous wealth and benefit and now with emigration the demand for new house starts is relatively low.</P>
      <P>Take an industrialist coming into this country and draw a line from, say Manor-hamilton down to Macroom, go west of it and I would not bring him anywhere other than by helicopter because there is no way he would put a plant, particularly heavy plant, west of that line.  He would not know where to turn if he had an executive car or heavy duty lorry; the axle would break from the condition of Irish roads in those areas.</P>

      <P>For example, the Government are anxious to put, say, heavy chemical industry into Cork and we are now handling out £9 million in <Col N="660" /> section 23 to fellows, some of whom I know would not pay income tax, capital gains tax, property tax, residential tax or wealth tax; they pay nothing.  They are fly-by-nights.  Many of them availed of section 23 and some of them are now living it up on section 23 reliefs in London working in the construction industry there where with the explosion of property values they are now making their money, having made it here in the mid-seventies and early eighties from reliefs of this nature.  That £9 million creating an infrastructure in parts of Cork for a chemical industry would be gold dust. However, the Department and Minister for Finance think in strait-jacket terms: the Finance Bill, concessions, taxation, section 23; the Custom House Dock is one of those remote places where they do other things and we have no integration by way of tax relief and tax incentives for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>I do not particularly blame the Minister for Finance.  He is besieged.  His job is to keep the lunatic fringe away from the Department of Finance and from making representations to him for everybody wanting every kind of relief.  He is subjected to enormous pressures, not least around the Cabinet table.  Had he said to those within the Department that there was £8 million or £9 million relief for the construction industry and asked where that money should be spent, he would have been told to put it into fundamental road development that is urgently needed in many parts of the country, not least in his own country.  The lack of such development is a huge impediment to industrial development.  I remember as a trade union official having to drive to Sligo week after week to the textile plants when they were flourising there and having to tell the industrialists concerned &mdash; many of them came over the country &mdash; not to have a heavy meal because after a few pints in Ballyshannon they would be unable to travel any longer, such was the condition of the roads.</P>

      <P>That was Irish industrial development.  We have received representations from the construction industry and the spokespersons for that industry at the moment give me a slightly ill feeling.  Go back through the capital programme.  In 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 we had increments of reasonable growth in the capital programme, we maintained economic development and in 1987 £625 million was provided for productive infrastructure. What did the Minister spend? It was £587 million.   He did not even spend what was provided for productive infrastructure in the capital programme for 1987.  Of course, the Department of Finance got their hands on it and they cut it back and back and that was the name of the game, even though we knocked the bottom out of the construction industry. The provision for this year, 1988, is £587 million but that is well below what was provided in the 1987 budget.  We are knocking the bottom out of the industry and there is not a cheep from the Fianna Fáil construction industry members.  It is bitterly disappointing to the industry which was promised £200 million and a VAT rate of 5 per cent.  When these benefits did not materialise there was no criticism because the party comes first in the construction industry.  I learned that as a member of Dublin County Council from 1974 to 1982 and I learned it again in Government.  There has not been a word of criticism when people have had to emigrate because of serious unemployment arising from the policies of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little money to provide incentives to the productive sectors but we are not spending the money available wisely.  I was horrified to learn that there are a couple of million square feet of empty office blocks in Dublin and that we are spending the best part of £20 million in the Minister's home town building another public office block for civil servants who will be brought to Sligo.  Whoever builds this office will probably get tax relief, all because of transient political gain because a couple of dozen civil servants have to travel by coach from Dublin to Sligo every weekend <Col N="662" /> to see their mothers and fathers, boyfriends and lovers.  It is a waste of public money and if the Minister wants to spend the best part of £20 million in Sligo it should be spent on the roads there.</P>

He has a cheek to talk here in such nonsensical terms about what happened in the last four years.  He does not know what he is talking about and too many of his accusations have gone unchallenged.  We will not let him away with it any more.  The decentralised offices being built will not cost one shilling of capital expenditure this or next year.  Until such time as staff are installed in them, the State will not pay rent.  When it does pay rent the amount per square foot will be 50p less than is being paid at present.

      <P>This section has nothing to do with decentralisation.  It deals with tax relief for refurbishment of dwellings, etc.  Before Deputy Desmond spoke, the Minister bore out my point in regard to giving tax reliefs.  I said that they are never regarded as expenditure <Col N="663" /> by the Government whereas, if you did not give tax relief but gave direct subsidies and grants, they would be shown as capital expenditure.  The Minister said that the Custom House Docks site will give a tremendous boost to the construction industry without one penny of capital expenditure being spent.  What about the tax reliefs?  That is tax foregone by the State, yet the Minister does not regard it as capital expenditure.  That is why we oppose hidden tax reliefs.  We do not know the total amount in this regard, the Minister estimated that this tax relief will cost £9 million in taxes foregone.  It would be very interesting to know the total tax reliefs foregone over the ten year period &mdash; or whatever it is &mdash; of the Custom House Docks site&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When Deputy Desmond, Deputy Noonan and Deputy Mac Giolla talk about a sum of £2,000 million they should remind themselves and the public of the facts.  I am looking at figures now for the year to which I referred and I know they will be much higher for 1988-89.  In 1984-85, the married man's allowance for income tax purposes cost £673 million; the single person's allowance for the same year cost £389 million and the mortgage interest relief &mdash; which I know is costing £160 million this year &mdash; cost £117 million. One would imagine from the remarks these Deputies made that the relief was confined to a little pocket of the community.  However, it benefits the 900,000 PAYE taxpayers.  I will not go through all these figures but they are updated on a regular basis by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

There may be ideological problems about this and succeeding sections but there are no amendments to them.  I presume that they will go through but there are severe problems in relation to section 29 so much so that the Minister for Finance has no less than 19 amendments to it, plus an amendment to Part II of the Second Schedule which also relates to it.  It is causing huge problems and needs to be sorted out.  The time between now and 5 p.m. might be more usefully spent on inviting the Minister to explain what he <Col N="665" /> has in mind in regard to section 29, why he has found it necessary to propose 20 amendments, an enormous number of amendments to one section, and whether the section should be withdrawn in its entirety and looked at again.  Apparently, the effect of many of the amendments is to postpone the matter for one year.  If it is found necessary to postpone it for one year perhaps we should take that amount of time to think about it because of the severe damage it is going to do.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a short statement about this section which was referred to earlier by Deputy O'Malley.  I am delighted that we have some time to debate this complex section.  I have decided to put forward a number of amendments to this section.  Section 29 is concerned with the rules for the distribution by companies of dividends to shareholders.  While the section is extremely complex, its basic purpose is to discontinue the primary fund arrangement and to provide instead for a new arrangement based on proportionality. The primary fund has applied since 1980 to dividend distributions by companies. Under that arrangement a company would have to distribute all its dividends from its 10 per cent profits before it distributed any dividends from its 47 per <Col N="667" /> cent profits.  This in turn, would determine the tax credits applying to the dividends. The tax credit on 10 per cent profits is 5.5 per cent and the credit on 47 per cent profits is 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>The primary fund no longer serves its original purpose now that full advance corporation tax is in operation.  Section 29, therefore, substitutes for the primary fund a new arrangement for distributions which is in line with the thinking of the Commission on Taxation.  Under the arrangement now proposed, dividends are treated as coming proportionately from the mix of profits in the preceding year.  There is a corresponding mix of tax credits.</P>
    <P>Section 29 as it stands in the Bill has recently given rise to a considerable volume of representations from companies and other interests.  Some of those representations have sought full flexilibity for companies to determine their mix of distributions and credits, but this would have an adverse impact on the Exchequer.  Others have sought solutions for particular problems they perceive in the section.</P>
    <P>The essential rule in section 29, of proportionality based on the previous year's mix of profits, is logical and fair.  Nevertheless, in view of the representations made to me, I have provided in the amendments for a number of changes as follows:</P>
    <P>General application of the sections will be postponed until 6 April 1989. This will allow more time for companies to plan for the operation of the new arrangements.  I will also consider in the meantime whether the detailed arrangements can be further simplified or improved.</P>
    <P>If, however, a company wishes to start applying the new rules now, it will have the option to do so.</P>
    <P>To take care of specific difficulties, interim dividends or distributions relating to interest payments on section 84 loans may continue to be paid out of <Col N="668" /> profits of the current year rather than the previous year.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of tidying-up amendments of a technical or drafting nature.</P>
    <P>That is all I would like to say at this stage because I want to give the opportunity to other Members to make their points about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed explanation and for introducing the amendments before us.  It is the kind of section in a Finance Bill which by its very complexity puts the ordinary politician who is a general practitioner rather than a specialist off discussing it.  One works on the basis that highly complex sections like this have been agreed between the Revenue officials, officials of the Minister's Department and the interests involved.  When I first saw this I thought the intention was in ease of companies who had a mix of business which attracted a mix of corporation tax.  It seems, following subsequent examination of it, by the type of conglomerates company which would be involved in the mix of business and would in one area attract the 10 per cent rate and in another the 47 per cent rate, that what was purported to be in ease of the conglomerates would work adversely.  I am sure the Minister has had the type of representation we have all received.  Consequently these amendments have been put down.  I do not fully understand the section and I doubt if many political people in the House understand its full ramifications.  If one moves to proportionality and to discontinue the primary fund arrangement, a consequence is to force a conglomorate type of business to draw dividends from an area of activity which on the face of it would favour the company but which, because of the implementation of full advance corporation tax, would result in the reduction of the tax credit available. The difficulty arises when one translates the rates into the tax credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendments are quite complex.  The first group of amendments <Col N="669" /> have the effect of postponing the general operation of the section until 6 April 1989.  That is very welcome.  Another amendment gives an option to another company who so wish to apply the new arrangements with effect from 6 April 1988.  Then there is the amendment which I do not understand relating to interest on section 84 loans.  For the record of the House and the benefit of the professionals who will have to operate it, I should like an explanation.  The final group of amendments are technical in nature.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Malley's view that we should give this matter some time because it is so complex.  It did not arise on Second Stage and we were well into Committee Stage before difficulties arose.  Is it prudent to seek to remediate the section in such a short time?  Perhaps our very haste in moving towards solving the problem is creating further difficulty. There is great merit in suspending it completely until next year.  Probably a better suggestion and one which would be welcomed by the interests involved would be to give the company an option.  If an amendment allowing a company to opt for the primary fund arrangement or to move to the proportionality arrangement could make this a permanent rather than a one-year option it would solve the problems of companies affected by the change.  I advocate that the Minister should do this.  I understand this provision was introduced to ease difficulties being experienced by companies.  That being the case, let those companies in whose ease it operates benefit but let those companies against whose interests it operates be allowed to operate the primary fund arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very co-operative and open in his explanations.  Perhaps he would take up these points.  I will not oppose his amendments or the section but there is time for reflection between now and next Thursday and we should seriously consider either dropping it completely or leaving the double option for everybody, especially if this is intended to be in ease of companies rather than to penalise them.</P>

      <P>The concern felt is well founded since the Minister found it necessary last night to put down 20 amendments.  I have been here all day but have had no chance to study them. That might not have been very fruitful anyway since I should need somebody to advise me as to their effect.</P>
      <P>It is clear from a cursory look at the amendments and from what the Minister has said that companies are given the option of postponement for a year.  Some fundamental questions have to be asked. What was wrong with the primary fund system of 1980, particularly since the introduction of advance corporation tax? The Exchequer cannot have been at any loss.  This is a question of the method of distribution of fully taxed profits.  Surely it is a matter for a company and its shareholders alone to decide how these fully taxed profits are distributed.  It should be of no concern to the Revenue or to the Department of Finance who do not stand to gain or lose anything by it.  The profits out of which the distribution is made have already borne tax in full.  An argument might have been made a few years ago before the introduction of advance corporation tax that some distributions carried tax credits which the Revenue would have had to honour in the hands of the recipients.  That is no longer the case. The tax is paid in full in advance.  Therefore, the Revenue cannot either gain or lose.  Why not let the companies go on as they wish in relation to the distribution of their fully taxed profits?  Is this not an unnecessary bureaucratic interference?</P>

    <P>It is a matter of concern that in recent years the number of private shareholders in public companies has dropped enormously. The proportion has about halved.  The size and power of the institutional shareholdings has become very much bigger.  One of the reasons is the unattractiveness of the tax credits in many cases.  When companies were able to evolve more than one fund out of which to pay their dividends in a manner which suited the often conflicting interests of their different classes of shareholders and when they could get the approval of all the necessary authorities <Col N="671" /> to do that, it did not cost the Exchequer anything and did not damage the public interest.  It suited the different types of shareholders and encouraged people to invest in Irish industry.  Therefore it cannot but have been beneficial from all points of view.  Why not allow them to continue?  Since the Exchequer will not raise more tax by changing the primary fund arrangement of 1980, why are they going on with section 29, even in its very heavily amended form?  If they cannot benefit except in a theoretical way in that way that they have more control over the form of distribution, why go on with it? Why do they need that power to control the method of distribution when it is immaterial to them since it is being made out of taxed profits?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the number of amendments. Some seven or eight of them simply involve changing the year from 1988 to 1989.  They are not of great substance.  I have stated quite clearly what the amendments are designed to do and I think Deputy Noonan has accepted it.  I repeat that the general application of the section will be postponed until 6 April 1989.  This will allow more time for companies to plan for the operation of the new arrangements. I will also consider in the meantime whether any detailed arrangements can be further simplified or improved.  If a company wish to start applying the new rules now they will have the option to do so.  There is nothing sinister about what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised a question about section 84 loan interest.  Section 29 as it stands provides that all of a company's dividends and distributions must be attributed to the accounting period preceding that in which the dividends are paid or the distributions are made.  Thus the ratio of relieved manufacturing profits of that period to the total profits of the period will determine the proportion of a dividend to be treated as a manufacturing dividend.  While this rule is perfectly reasonable as it affects final <Col N="672" /> dividends, it is somewhat artificial with respect to interim dividends which are paid out of profits of the accounting period during which they are paid and to section 84 loan interest, which is an expense of the accounting period for which it is paid.  The preceding accounting period rule has the value of certainty the ratio of manufacturing income to total income after the end of the period, whereas when an interim dividend or section 84 loan interest is paid during an accounting period, the company may have to estimate the ratio for that period. However, the weight of the problems created by the preceding accounting period rule seem to outweigh the problem of estimation in so far as interim dividends and section 84 loan interest are concerned.  Therefore, an amendment is proposed which provides that interim dividends and section 84 loan interest will be treated, for the purpose of section 29, as distributions of the accounting period for which they are paid or made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the administration of the Department of Social Welfare whereby people on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are being required to produce evidence of having sought work, in the form of letters of refusal of jobs from prospective employers. Deputy Quinn is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, for according me the time to raise this matter in the House.  I do so with some reluctance.  I do so because it is my view &mdash; and I use my words with consideration &mdash; that this Government are in the process of terrorising a certain number of people who, through no fault of their own, cannot get work and who, as a consequence of the way in which standard procedures of administration are being interpreted, are being forced off the live register so creating, in a totally artificial sense, an apparent improvement in the figures for unemployment, thereby giving a further boost to the illusion that this economy is perhaps somewhat on the mend in relation to employment figures.</P>
      <P>I am conscious, having made that statement of terrorisation &mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; that it is not being made for the first time.  As far back as 10 March of this year during debate on Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, my colleague Deputy Pattison, in his contribution for which the Minister who is here now was present also, raised this problem.  Deputy Pattison from Carlow-Kilkenny who was a junior Minister in the Department of Social Welfare and, as a Deputy, is extremely well versed in areas of representation, had the following to say, as reported at column 2412 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the whole area of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  In this area there <Col N="674" /> is a crazy practice where recipients of these benefits are sent around like fools to various employers looking for letters to the effect that the employer concerned has no work available for them. The position has got so bad in the last few months that some factories I know of have put notices on their doors that they are not issuing letters to these people.  I know one factory where the management claimed they would have to have a full-time clerk typist typing letters to the local exchange down the road telling them that there is no work available.  I cannot think of a more crazy system.  The Government are providing all kinds of inducements to do away with jobs.  I am thinking of the redundancy packages particularly as they pertain to rural areas where a manual worker's main hope of getting a job rested with his local authority, working on roadworks, drainage, building of local authority dwellings and so on.  That was the main source of manual workers' employment in rural areas.  The Government have effectively done away with all of those jobs.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say, column 2413:</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me understand the logic of this type of practice, of people having to appear before appeals officers producing anything up to 20 letters from all kinds of people, shopkeepers, farmers, whoever; they have to tramp the roads appealing for these letters.  I should be very glad if the Minister would offer some explanation of this practice.  After all, we have a very efficient, widespread Manpower service which monitors closely any job opportunities or any prospect of employment in given areas.  That being the State way of doing things, surely that should be sufficient in this day and age to satisfy that State requirement?</P>
    <P>That is what my colleague said on 10 March of this year in the course of Second Stage debate.  What was the Minister's response?  His response, as reported at column 2523, referred to various items raised in that debate.  The House will recall that the primary issue in question <Col N="675" /> was the extension of PRSI to the self-employed. The Minister will recall this better than I do, because I was not present in the House at the time.  He chose to close business at that time, because the question was put at 5 p.m. Deputy Woods, Minister for Social Welfare, did not at any stage in his reply refer at all to the substance in part of Deputy Pattison's contribution.</P>
    <P>The matter that you have been good enough to allow me to raise this evening cannot and does not come as a matter of surprise to the Minister for Social Welfare. He chose not to reply on 10 March. That may well have been due to pressure of time.  It was quite clear from the amount of time left to the Minister on that occasion that there was not much time available.  I am giving the Minister an opportunity now, exclusively, to refute the charge that there is any form of terrorisation involved in asking people to obtain letters from employers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's annual report for 1985-86, published by himself carries his signature on page 7.  I assume that while he was not necessarily an office-holder in that period, he takes responsibility, in issuing the report, for its contents in some shape or form.  In that report he talks about special initiatives for the unemployed on page 29.  On page 30 he talks about the difficulties that were there and the various schemes that have been introduced and goes on to talk about the question of fraud and abuse.  At the end of page 32, it is pointed out that despite all the protestations one hears in the lounge bars, bars of golf clubs and elsewhere, the number of actual prosecutions that have taken place in relation to social welfare fraud for 1985 was 175.  That was for disability benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, combined. For the same categories for 1986 it was 151.  There are approximately a quarter of a million people who are on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance &mdash; and let us include, for roundness of statistics, disability benefit as well.  Out of a labour force of approximately one million, we are talking in real <Col N="676" /> terms of prosecutions, according to the figures that we have most readily available, of 175.  There is a gap between the actual prosecutions and the requirement that is being sought by the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Why have I raised this matter today in this House?  I was aware, in general terms, of the need for various officers of social welfare administration throughout the country to satisfy themselves that a person was genuinely seeking work.  That is clearly part of the legislation and a part of the system the Minister inherited.  I have no dispute with that nor could anybody. What I dispute is the manner of administration.  The way in which this rule is being interpreted amounts to a form of bureaucratic terrorism designed to make people feel inadequate, guilty and dependent on assistance and benefit. In the case of benefit they have paid for it and in the case of unemployment assistance they are entitled to it by virtue of their citizenship in this State and the provisions of this Legislature.</P>
    <P>The person to whom I refer was forced to retire from work because of a physical disability.  He was forced out of employment by a semi-State company and his record was quite clear to the administration in the Department of Social Welfare and in the relevant local labour exchange.  This person is not young; he has a family consisting of one child and a dependent wife and it was clear from his records that he was obliged to cease employment through no fault of his own because of an injury in the course of employment with An Post.  This man has now been obliged not to produce one letter from an employer saying that he could not get work but to get three letters.</P>
    <P>I have been fortunate in that I have enjoyed good health all of my life and have been able to obtain employment for virtually all of my working life as an adult. It is humiliating enough for a responsible adult with obligations, as is this person, and as are many others, to confront the reality of unemployment, but it is adding insult to injury to force them to go around employers and shopkeepers, not to look <Col N="677" /> for a job because they know there is none available, but to look for a letter saying that there is no job and to be told by the employer that he does not have the time to engage in that sort of bureaucratic nonsense, and that he has already informed Manpower, now known as FÁS, that they do not have work.  That may be an understandable response from a busy employer, but it is of no comfort to the individual who has been humiliated. It is no use trying to convey that message to the official behind the hatch in the employment exchange because he has his requirements to follow as set out by the management within the Department of Social Welfare.  That is my central point.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is not responsible for this system which has been operating for a long time, but the Minister is responsible for the way in which it is currently being administered. Having regard to the points made by Deputy Pattison on 10 March and having regard to the Minister's knowledge of the situation, I put it to the Minister, that there has been an intensification of the way in which the system is administered for reasons upon which I can only speculate. I invite the Minister to give his official version as to the real reasons.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of the various labour force projections that have been made by an array of economic and social commentators.  The labour force here continues to grow despite the levels of emigration and it is likely to continue to grow for some period, certainly until the mid-1990s.  While demographic projections are notoriously unreliable, it is quite clear that, for the next two to three years and certainly for the duration of the period of office of this Administration, having regard to the current level of socio-economic policies that they are pursuing with the support of Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, this country will see no effective reduction in the levels of unemployment and that approximately 16 to 18 per cent of the labour force will remain unemployed.</P>
    <P>Whatever about young graduates coming out of training centres and third <Col N="678" /> level institutions and young people coming on to the labour market with marketable skills able to accept the reduced level of wages which are now being offered, it is clear that the categories of people like the person I have described, men in their forties with no particular skills who have suffered in industrial accidents with a background in manual and semi-skilled labour are not likely to get employment.  All the employment schemes are posited on the analysis that that kind of person will not get employment because of the continuing shake out of agricultural employment and the reduction in local authority road works type employment and other kinds of traditional sources of semi-skilled employment.  According to Paul Tansey and other commentators and indeed the NESC report, the best prospects for employment, having regard to the increasing size of our labour market is that we will be looking at at least a quarter of a million people unemployed for the next two to three years.  Whoever gets a job in the next two to three years it will not be the kind of person to whom I have referred.  Yet that person is being forced to jump to bureaucratic terror in order to find letters of refusal from employers in order to comply with the requirements of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Having regard to employment prospects, if people having been humiliated, fail to get a number of letters of refusal from employers in their area, they will be cut off and will lose their only source of income so that people who are already poor will be made destitute.  Various economic commentators, political apologists for this administration or others, are saying that there is an upturn in the economy and that levels of unemployment are decreasing.  The Minister has a difficult task.  The process of Government is not easy.  We on this side of the House have never suggested that it was, but what is going on at the moment is crazy.  The Minister was told that it was crazy on 10 March but due to the constraints of time I suspect that the <Col N="679" /> Minister was not in a position to respond. I am now asking the Minister to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers was forced to retire from work in An Post because of injury and the first thing which comes to my mind is, why is that person not on injury benefit, invalidity benefit or disability benefit? Perhaps the person is not available for work.  If the Deputy supplies the details I will certainly look into the case.  It is a particular case but the Deputy generalised and made sweeping allegations which are totally unfounded.  No matter how he feels about a particular case I know from experience that they are unfounded.  In an effort to support his argument he referred to the comments of Deputy Pattison during the course of a debate in relation to PRSI on 10 March. In all of the cases we have looked into they came by and large to nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that a new interpretation is being put on the standard procedures but as the Deputy knows it is a statutory condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit that persons must be available for and genuinely seeking employment.  The relevant legislation governing entitlement to unemployment payments is contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, as amended by subsequent legislation.  The officers who are statutorily appointed make those decisions independently and no pressure whatsoever is put on them but under the legislation they must satisfy themselves that the people concerned are available for and genuinely seeking work. The question of whether a claimant may be considered to be available for and <Col N="680" /> genuinely seeking work is a matter which is determined by statutorily appointed deciding officers and appeals officers who are independent in the exercise of their powers, and the Deputy is well aware that they have shown their independence over the years.  Their independence is something which I value greatly and is important in the operation of the system.</P>
    <P>Each case is determined on its own merits and I am confident that the officers involved discharge their functions in an absolutely impartial manner.  In determining cases where the question of availability arises, the criteria used by deciding officers and appeals officers are broadly whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present; whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which might limit the person's freedom to accept or might prevent acceptance of full time employment which would normally be suitable; or whether restrictions are being imposed by the person or the kind, place or hours of employment, any of which would unreasonably diminish the person's prospects of obtaining work.  The decisions are made through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria having regard to the evidence available in the case.</P>
    <P>At the new claims stage detailed information is requested from the claimant on a questionnaire to be completed in respect of the claimant.  For example, the claimant is asked what type of work he or she is seeking and the hours of employment being sought.  The claimant is also asked what specific efforts have been made to obtain employment and to furnish any documentary evidence he or she may have.  Claimants are also asked whether they have registered for employment with FÁS.  Details of the ages of any children in the household are also required to be furnished as well as particulars about who will care for the children in the event of the claimant finding employment.</P>
    <P>Claims are reviewed subsequently on a regular basis to ensure that the claimant continues to satisfy the conditions for <Col N="681" /> entitlement to payment.  The review consists of an updating of the previous examination including details of the recent efforts by the claimant to obtain employment. This may be done orally over a counter in the exchange or through the use of a written request to be handed or posted to the claimant.  In carrying out these reviews claimants may be asked to furnish any documentary evidence they may have about their efforts to obtain work.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of producing evidence of efforts to get work, documentary evidence of refusal of requests for employment is not essential to show that a person is genuinely seeking work. Local offices of my Department do not insist on such evidence being made available but if claimants do happen to have such evidence readily available they are requested to furnish it.  It is accepted that many employers nowadays receive numerous requests for employment from unemployed persons and such employers would not be expected to give written letters in respect of all such requests. However, when deciding entitlement to payment evidence would be required that the claimant was actively seeking work and in this context details of approaches to employers would be sought.  The claimant would be required to give names of the employers who were approached.</P>
    <P>Most claimants are in a position to supply such evidence.  Therefore, it does not necessarily require a letter from an employer but the individual would have to give some indication that they had approached employers.  I know of many cases where people have said they got into difficulties in this respect and when they were questioned it was very often found that they gave a bad impression to a deciding officer.  There is no point going in and saying in a vague way that they did so at some stage; the person has to be able to say where they went and when they went there.  It would help if they had some letters from employers and most people do.  There are some people who have a lot of letters and there are others who seem to have none at all but even people who do not have any letters are <Col N="682" /> approved and there is no doubt about this, as I know from experience.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the fact that a person can produce documentary evidence from employers would not in itself prove that such claimant was genuinely seeking work.  The validity and usefulness of such evidence would have to be examined by a deciding officer in arriving at his or her decision.  If, for example, an unskilled labourer produced documentary evidence that he was seeking an office job, such evidence might not be of great value in determining the person's entitlement. Another example of documentary evidence which might be of little value to the deciding officer would be where the employer who refused to offer work was found to be a close relative of the claimant.</P>
    <P>I think it is important however that people should not get things out of perspective. Although statistics are not maintained of the number of cases disallowed because the claimant was found not to be genuinely seeking work it is known that the total figure is only a tiny fraction of all claims allowed.  Furthermore, I think we should concentrate on the positive elements of what is being done to help the unemployed.  I have always adopted a flexible approach in relation to entitlement to unemployment payments.  In the present economic climate when there is not a significant number of job opportunities available I think it is only right that unemployed persons be allowed make constructive use of the free time available to them.</P>
    <P>Within this flexible approach claimants can participate in various activities without affecting their unemployment entitlements so long as they continue to be in the labour market and continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work. Examples of these activities are participation in part-time education courses and voluntary projects.  Claimants are also allowed to take two weeks holidays in the year without affecting their entitlements. Recently, I decided that unemployed athletes who are chosen to represent Ireland in the forthcoming Olympic Games will continue to be <Col N="683" /> entitled to unemployment payments while they are abroad.  I intend to pursue this line of removing any stumbling blocks in the way of unemployed persons who carry on normal social or recreational activities as long as this does not run counter to the need for control against abuse.</P>
    <P>There are a number of schemes which cater for unemployed persons that I would like to refer to in particular.  These are the Jobsearch programme, the part-time job incentive scheme and the educational opportunities scheme.  The Deputy will also be aware of the scheme I introduced very recently, the pre-retirement allowance scheme for persons over 60.  I can assure the Deputy that I am very anxious to ensure that flexible arrangements are available for those who are on the unemployment register and I will be pursuing this matter at great length in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister a question in order to seek clarification. The Minister stated that the local offices of his Department do not request letters of refusal but I can tell him that in this <Col N="684" /> case the person was asked to obtain three letters of refusal.  He was told letters of refusal would suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that these would not be the sole condition.  They would be but one factor which would be taken into account.  If a person could show by way of a letter of refusal that they had been pursuing employment that would be satisfactory.  The Deputy may have a specific case in mind and if he gives me the details I will look into it.</P>
      <P>There is one final remark I would like to make.  Last year we interviewed over 140,000 people in respect of the Jobsearch programme and only 1.4 per cent of the total were disallowed.  The normal procedures were applied and I would like to keep the matter in that perspective. The number actually disallowed <i>pro rata</i> was very small.  I am very anxious to pursue any cases which the Deputy may have in mind and to ensure that the arrangements in respect of the unemployed are as flexible and as reasonable as possible.</P>

      <P>As regards the reform of the Social Fund, I would refer the Deputy to a very comprehensive reply which I gave in response to Question No. 165 on Tuesday 15 March, 1988.

      <P>The SEDOC system is the European Community Placement Service designed to assist the free movement of workers throughout the Community by giving job seekers access to vacancies in other European Community countries.  Lists of vacancies in the member states are made available through the system and are displayed in all local FÁS offices.  Suitable applications are sent by FÁS to the employment service of the member states notifying the vacancy for processing.</P>
      <P>Statistics on the use of the SEDOC system are not readily available.  I am arranging with FÁS to forward the required information to the Deputy as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his attention has been drawn to the results of a survey carried out by the Action Group for Irish Youth which <Col N="619" /> states that 70 per cent of Irish emigrants have less than £100 in cash when they arrive in London; that the basic weekly cost of living is £93; and the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the survey in question.  I understand, however, that the research was confined to young persons who had got into difficulties and had sought help from advice centres, night shelters, etc. in London.  It was 70 per cent of this group which had emigrated bringing less than £100, not 70 per cent of all emigrants.</P>
      <P>Emigrating without proper preparation and adequate financial resources is unwise and has to be discouraged.  My policy is that FÁS dissuade young persons in that situation from emigrating if they approach FÁS seeking advice.  FÁS &mdash; the training and employment authority established on 1 January this year, now has responsibility for providing an advice and information service for intending emigrants to ensure that, where possible, young people contemplating emigration are dissuaded from doing so unless they have planned properly, and have employment and accommodation fixed up before they go.</P>
      <P>My advice to young persons considering going to Britain, particularly to London, to seek employment is that they should have</P>
      <P>&mdash;firm employment prospects,</P>
      <P>&mdash;accommodation arranged in advance,</P>
      <P>&mdash;adequate money (at least £400),</P>
      <P>&mdash;contacts (friends and relatives).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is quite difficult to meet all these conditions, particularly the two relating to financial resources and prearranged accommodation, they are, nevertheless, vital precautions to ensure that the young person's well-being is not put unnecessarily at risk.  DÍON, the London-based committee which advises me on matters relating to emigrant welfare, <Col N="620" /> agrees that this is the approach we must adopt to protect young Irish persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Employment scheme is currently in operation in approximately 40 local authorities including Urban District Councils.  The reasons for the scheme's non-operation in other local authorities are diverse; for example, in some cases a body may not have applied and in others local issues such as industrial action may have prevented the operation of projects. In addition, because of financial constraints, I understand that FÁS have had to operate a quota system for each region which may lead to deferment of certain applications.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the approval of new Social Employment scheme projects in some local authorities has been deferred in certain cases at the instigation of the trade unions where a guarantee has not been given by the local authority that there will be no lay-offs or redundancies in 1988.  I have had discussions with the trade unions about this problem and I also understand that the Minister for the Environment has had discussions with local authority managers.  I hope that the problem can be speedily resolved to ensure that long-term unemployed people in certain areas are not deprived of their chance to re-enter the active labour market.</P>

      <P>As regards the public sector, the Department of Finance has published the results of research on absenteeism in the Civil Service which shows an absenteeism rate of 3.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>A ministerial task force on absenteeism was set up in July 1983 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.

    </Speaker>
    <P>With the limited resources at my disposal, I am trying to ensure that as many long term unemployed people as possible benefit from the scheme.  I must, therefore, restrict recruitment to this category <Col N="623" /> as much as possible and place a limit on the duration of participation.</P>
    <P>As an extremely exceptional measure on rare occasions participation beyond one year was allowed.  I should add, however, that the more places that fall into an exceptional category, the fewer long term unemployed people can be given a chance to participate in any year. I am also concerned to ensure that a scheme set up to provide temporary employment could gradually become a means of providing public funding for quasi-permanent jobs.</P>
    <P>Finally, to help persons completing their term on a social employment scheme, I have agreed that the normal requirements of 13 weeks' registration with and receipt of unemployment compensation from the Department of Social Welfare be waived for the employment incentive and the enterprise schemes.</P>

      <P>I am pursuing a policy of promoting public awareness of the importance of the environment generally which would include an appreciation of the value of trees.  Local authorities play an important role in the implementation of this policy.  The local environment campaigns which they have been asked to organise often include activities such as tree planting ceremonies, landscaping public open spaces, tree weeks, etc. Towards the end of the year, I will be making awards, totalling £15,000 to the local authorities with the best local campaigns. In addition, I recently announced the allocation of funds from the national lottery for amenity and recreational projects many of which contained landscaping proposals or were devoted entirely to the planting and landscaping of amenity areas.</P>

      <P>The social guarantee year is operated on the basis of an academic year and in the year 1986-87, some 13,000 young people were notified to the National Manpower Service by schools.  Of this number 88 per cent were invited for interview.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1) Work Experience Programme: The programme was suspended in September 1987.  The gross costs of one man-year was £1,794.  (2) Employment Incentive scheme: The gross cost of one man-year is £1,757, based on the average annual premium.  (3) Enterprise scheme: The gross cost of one man-year is £2,221, based on the average annual allowance. (4) Teamwork: The gross cost of one man-year is £4,037 based on the average unit cost per worker, including grants towards supervision and approved running costs.  (5) Social Employment scheme: The gross cost of the man-year is £4,500, based on the best available assumptions relating to average wage and allowance for dependants, costs of materials and supervision costs.</P>
      <P>The figures given for the employment incentive scheme, enterprise scheme, Teamwork and the social employment scheme are average figures.  The costs for individual participants would be influenced by a number of factors, such as age and length of unemployment in the case of the employment incentive scheme and the participant's number of dependants in the case of the enterprise and social employment schemes.</P>
      <P>All the programmes attract European Social Fund assistance.  The net cost to the Exchequer would, therefore, be lower than the figures given.  The net Exchequer cost would also be reduced by other Exchequer savings for example on unemployment compensation.</P>
      <P>FÁS administration costs are not included.</P>

    <P>A further claim for payment in relation to professional fees (detailing the VAT component) was submitted on 22 March 1988 with a further update on 19 April 1988.  This claim is currently being processed within my Department and a letter will issue to the project organisers shortly, in relation to any payments due.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received setting out the financial position of the sport and leisure centre.  However, while I sympathise with Ballyfermot Leisure Co-operative Ltd., in view of the considerable sum already allocated for the construction of the centre and many other demands for assistance, it is not possible for me to sanction a further grant in respect of this project.</P>
    <P>I must also state that the terms of the scheme preclude the payment of grants in relation to the running costs of the centre or in relation to debts incurred on the project.</P>

      <P>As the parents of 1,428 of these pupils were the holders of a current medical card they were exempted from the repeat fees.  This left a total of 5,031 pupils liable for repeat fees.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the needs of Meánscoil Iognáid Rís, Naas, County Kildare.  My Department has approved the provision of an extension to the school at an estimated cost of £740,000. Architectural planning has reached the outline sketch scheme stage.  Schedule of proposed accommodation for the extension is as follows: 2 general classrooms; 1 science laboratory &amp; prep-resource area; 1 Woodwork-Building Construction room; 1 Social Studies room; 1 Mechanical Drawing Room; PE Hall and ancillary; and toilets-cloaks-lockers.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to indicate when the extra facilities may be provided, as the rate at which this project as with other capital projects of this nature can proceed is dependent on the availability of capital resources and on my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>
